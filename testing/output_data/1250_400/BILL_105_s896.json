    "content": "The \"Landmine Elimination Act of 1997\" is the short title of this Act. It includes findings related to landmines. Congress found that in 1995, a moratorium was imposed on US use of anti-personnel landmines, and in 1996, senior military officers urged a ban on production and use of landmines. They stated that a ban would be humane and militarily responsible, with examples of casualties in Vietnam and Bosnia caused by landmines. In Vietnam, 7,318 US military personnel were killed and 56,783 injured by landmines. In Bosnia, 204 soldiers under UN command and 55 soldiers under NATO command were injured or killed by landmines. The Department of State estimates a person is killed or injured by a landmine every 22 minutes. President Clinton declared pursuit of an international agreement to ban landmines. The Organization of American States and African Unity adopted goals for landmine-free zones. Canada announced negotiations for a treaty banning landmines. On December 10, 1996, the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution to pursue a treaty banning anti-personnel landmines. Formal negotiations for the Ottawa treaty are set to begin in Oslo, Norway in September 1997. The United States could use its international influence to secure support for a binding treaty banning anti-personnel landmines, which would enhance US security. Formal negotiations for the Ottawa treaty are scheduled to start in Oslo, Norway in September 1997. The United States has the potential to garner widespread backing for a binding international treaty prohibiting anti-personnel landmines, which would bolster US security and humanitarian interests by discouraging their use against US military personnel and civilians. SEC. 3. RESTRICTION ON NEW DEPLOYMENTS OF ANTI-PERSONNEL LANDMINES. Beginning on January 1, 2000, no funds may be used for new deployments of anti-personnel landmines. The Secretary of Defense must submit a report to Congress within 180 days outlining alternatives for such deployments on the Korean Peninsula. The President can delay the restriction if new deployments are deemed essential for the defense of South Korea during a war or emergency. Congress must certify that new deployments of anti-personnel landmines on the Korean Peninsula during a war or emergency in Korea are necessary for the defense of South Korea. The report must also detail efforts to implement proposed alternatives for such deployments. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"anti-personnel landmine\" refers to munitions designed to detonate by person contact, excluding command-detonated Claymore munitions. \"New deployments of anti-personnel landmines\" are those placed after January 1, 2000."
