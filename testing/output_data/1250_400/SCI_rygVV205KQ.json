    "content": "In this work, imitation learning is used to tackle challenges in high-dimensional sparse reward tasks for reinforcement learning agents. Adversarial imitation can effectively learn a representation of the world from pixels and explore efficiently with minimal parameters. The proposed agent can solve complex tasks like robot manipulation with only video demonstrations and sparse rewards, outperforming other approaches. Our agent successfully learns to solve a challenging robot manipulation task of block stacking from video demonstrations and sparse reward. It outperforms non-imitating agents and competing approaches that rely on dense reward functions. Additionally, a new adversarial goal recognizer allows the agent to learn stacking purely from imitation in some cases. The use of GAIL with the right features enables handling high-dimensional pixel observations efficiently. The agent's efficiency is further improved by using a Deep Distributed Deterministic Policy Gradients (D4PG) agent. The text discusses the use of a single-layer discriminator network to handle high-dimensional pixel observations efficiently. It also mentions the use of a Deep Distributed Deterministic Policy Gradients (D4PG) agent with a replay buffer to improve efficiency. Various types of features are successfully used with a tiny, single-layer adversary, including self-supervised embeddings and value network features from the D4PG agent. The approach is demonstrated to solve a challenging robotic block stacking task using only demonstrations and a sparse binary reward. The proposed approach utilizes experience replay to solve a challenging robotic block stacking task from pixels with sparse rewards. It outperforms previous imitation methods by learning faster and reducing the reliance on hand-crafted rewards. Key contributions include a Jaco robot arm agent achieving 94% success rate, an early termination method for improved learning speed, and an agent learning without task rewards using an auxiliary goal recognizer adversary. The curr_chunk discusses an agent learning without task rewards using an auxiliary goal recognizer adversary, achieving 55% stacking success from video imitation only. Ablation experiments on Jaco stacking and a 2D planar walker benchmark are conducted to understand the reasons for improvement in the agent's performance. The text also explains the components of a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and the goal of training an agent to maximize expected rewards. The curr_chunk discusses the actor-critic method DDPG for training an agent to maximize expected rewards. The actor's policy and critic's action-value function are represented by neural networks, with new transitions added to a replay buffer for better exploration. The action-value function is trained to match 1-step returns, and target networks are updated every K learning steps for stability. The policy network is trained via gradient descent to produce actions that maximize the action-value. The curr_chunk discusses improvements to the DDPG agent, including the D4PG method and GAIL. D4PG utilizes off-policy training with experience replay, while GAIL learns a reward function using a discriminator network. The actor and critic updates remain the same as in D4PG, with the addition of joint training for the reward function. The curr_chunk introduces the use of a D4PG agent for off-policy training with experience replay and joint training of the reward function. The reward function combines imitation reward and sparse task reward, with the discriminator distinguishing expert transitions. Actions are not used in the discriminator, and the reward function is bounded between 0 and 1 for early termination. The curr_chunk discusses the implementation details of the reward function in the D4PG agent, including the use of imitation reward and sparse task reward. It also explains the early termination mechanism based on the discriminator score to prevent the agent from deviating too far from expert trajectories. Multiple CPU actor processes are used in parallel with a single GPU learner process. The actor processes receive updated network parameters every 100 steps. The actor in the D4PG agent uses early termination based on the discriminator score to prevent deviation from expert trajectories. The type of network in the discriminator is crucial for the agent's learning process. Expert demonstrations provide valuable data for feature learning. In this work, the discriminator architectures used to teach the agent how to solve the task are illustrated. Expert demonstrations are a valuable source of data for feature learning, as they cover the necessary regions of the state space. Behavior cloning is not an option for feature learning in this scenario. High-resolution images are used, so learning features by predicting in pixel space is not preferred. Contrastive predictive coding (CPC) is considered a suitable representation learning technique for this task. Contrastive predictive coding (CPC) is a representation learning technique that maps observations into a latent space for long-term predictions. It uses a probabilistic contrastive loss with negative sampling, allowing joint training of encoder and autoregressive model without needing a decoder. Swapping sparse rewards with a neural network goal recognizer trained on expert trajectories can remove task rewards, but the network may be exploited by the agent. This issue can be addressed by replacing the sparse task rewards. To address the issue of agents exploiting a frozen network goal recognizer during training, sparse task rewards can be replaced with a secondary goal discriminator. This discriminator detects if an agent reaches a goal state defined as the latter 1/M proportion of expert demonstrations. The modified reward function includes the secondary goal discriminator network, trained separately from the original network, to improve agent performance in imitation learning. The environment includes a Kinova Jaco arm with 9 degrees of freedom and two blocks on a tabletop. The arm is controlled by policies setting joint velocity commands, with observations as 128x128 RGB images. Hand-crafted reward functions are used, and demonstrations are collected using a SpaceNavigator 3D motion controller. The curr_chunk discusses the collection of demonstrations for two different environments: one involving a Jaco arm with hand-crafted reward functions and another with a 2D walker trained using expert demonstrations. Demonstrations were collected using a SpaceNavigator 3D motion controller and a D4PG agent, respectively. The dataset includes expert trajectories, validation trajectories, and non-expert trajectories for diagnostic purposes. The curr_chunk discusses comparing an imitation method to D4PG and GAIL agents on dense and sparse rewards using expert demonstrations. It shows that the proposed method with a tiny adversary performs well. The Conditional Predictive Coding (CPC) model is used to improve performance on stacking tasks. D4PG with sparse rewards struggles due to exploration complexity, while with dense rewards, learning is slow. The proposed method shows superior performance with sparse rewards compared to D4PG and GAIL agents. Using Conditional Predictive Coding (CPC) embeddings improves performance on stacking tasks. D4PG struggles with sparse rewards due to exploration complexity, while learning is slow with dense rewards. The value network features enable quicker learning compared to CPC features. GAIL with tiny adversaries on random projections achieves limited success. The regularizing effect of norm clipping in the critic optimizer may explain why GAIL value features work better than pixel features. The discriminator network has 128 parameters, while the value network features are 2048-dimensional. Norm clipping in the critic optimizer may explain why GAIL value features work better than pixel features. Using CPC features and temporal predictions did not improve performance in Jaco and Walker2D tasks. Adding layers to the discriminator network did not improve performance in Jaco stacking ablation experiments. Figure 5 visualizes CPC features learned from training trajectories on validation trajectories. In Jaco stacking ablation experiments, adding layers to the discriminator network did not improve performance, and early termination is crucial. Even with fewer demonstrations, the agent can learn stacking well. A small discriminator on meaningful representation is more advantageous than a powerful one. Early termination criterion significantly affects the learning speed. In ablation experiments, adding layers to the discriminator network did not improve performance. Early termination is crucial for faster learning. Even with fewer demonstrations, the agent can learn well. A small discriminator on a meaningful representation is more advantageous. Data efficiency was evaluated with 60, 120, 240, and 500 demonstrations, showing good performance with even 60 demonstrations. In a third ablation experiment, data efficiency was evaluated with 60, 120, 240, and 500 demonstrations, showing good performance with even 60 demonstrations. The proposed method using value network features and random projections learned to run, unlike conventional GAIL on pixels. Videos of the trained agent are included in the supplementary videos. Results for agents trained without any rewards are shown, with two out of five runs able to learn without task rewards. In a study on data efficiency, the proposed method using value network features and random projections learned to run with as few as 60 demonstrations. Results for agents trained without rewards showed that two out of five runs were successful, with the best agent achieving a 55% success rate. The agent demonstrated efficient stacking in under 2 seconds, outperforming a human teloperator who took up to 30 seconds. Additionally, an agent exploited by rolling a block to the background to fake a completed stack. Leveraging expert demonstrations to enhance agent performance has a history in robotics, with recent work showing success in training a Q-learning agent on cart-pole swing up after a single episode. In contrast to recent work on priming a Q-function with expert demonstrations for cart-pole swing up, our task focuses on learning from pixel observations without access to states and actions. Imitation learning, particularly supervised imitation and one-shot imitation, offers a promising approach for training agents in interactive environments. Our approach differs from supervised imitation and one-shot imitation methods by focusing on the agent learning through interaction with the environment rather than through demonstrations. Behavioral cloning has limitations in generalization and requires access to demonstrator actions. Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) and deep Q-Learning from demonstration (DQfD) offer alternatives to behavioral cloning for training agents, allowing them to learn a reward function from demonstrations and optimize it through reinforcement learning. Deterministic policy gradients from demonstration (DPGfD) also show promise in solving tasks without direct access to demonstrator actions. BID26 extended training methods for agents to handle sparse-exploration Atari games. BID36 developed deterministic policy gradients from demonstration (DPGfD) and showed success in solving tasks without direct access to expert actions. GAIL BID16 applies adversarial learning to imitation problems, but challenges remain in high-dimensional input spaces. Our contribution involves using minimal adversaries to solve sparse reward tasks with high-dimensional input spaces. Our contribution involves using minimal adversaries to successfully solve sparse reward tasks with high-dimensional input spaces by learning compact representations for imitation learning. We utilize self-supervised features and dynamic value network features to train block stacking agents from sparse rewards on pixels. The study utilizes static self-supervised features like contrastive predictive coding and dynamic value network features to train block stacking agents successfully from sparse rewards on pixels. The model includes an encoder mapping observations to latent representations and an autoregressive model summarizing past latents into a context vector. The model consists of an encoder mapping observations to latent representations and an autoregressive model summarizing past latents into a context vector. The weights for the bilinear mapping are learned and depend on the number of latent steps the model is predicting in the future. By optimizing the loss function, the mutual information between the context and target is maximized, resulting in compact representations. This is useful for extracting slow features, especially when the context and target are far apart in time. Our proposed approach involves model learning via contrastive predictive coding (CPC) to extract slow features by linearly embedding observations into compact representations. The agent is trained using CPC future predictions without the need to predict in pixel space. Two types of reward functions are defined for evaluation, dense staged reward with five stages and sparse reward with two stages. The actor and critic share a residual network with twenty convolutional layers. The actor and critic in the proposed approach share a residual network with twenty convolutional layers. They use Distributional Q functions and compute bootstrap targets with N-step returns. The categorical representation of Z is adopted, and fixed atoms bounded between V min and V max are used.
