The Congress finds that the greater Southern California metropolitan region, the second largest urban concentration in the US, lacks sufficient park and recreation lands. This deficiency deprives residents of health benefits, reduced crime, lower social tension, and increased educational opportunities associated with proximity to nature. The Rim of the Valley Corridor surrounding the San Fernando and La Crescenta valleys offers scenic, environmental, recreational, educational, scientific, and economic benefits to Southern California. It contains endangered habitats and deserves increased protection for public benefit in the future. The Rim of the Valley Corridor, including various mountain ranges and forests, contains endangered habitats like the Mediterranean chaparral ecosystem. The San Gabriel Mountains within the Angeles National Forest are managed for watershed, recreational, and habitat values. Privately owned lands in the corridor are important for scenic, environmental, and recreational purposes and should be protected through voluntary incentives. The Rim of the Valley Corridor contains endangered habitats and privately owned lands critical for scenic, environmental, and recreational purposes. Efforts to protect these lands have been hindered by a lack of financial resources and expertise that the Federal Government could provide. The Rim of the Valley Corridor is being studied for potential inclusion in the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area to protect endangered habitats and privately owned lands for scenic, environmental, and recreational purposes. The Secretary of the Interior will conduct a special resource study of the Rim of the Valley Corridor in Southern California to evaluate its national significance and feasibility of becoming part of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. The study will follow criteria for potential National Park System inclusion and involve consultation with relevant advisory committees. The Rim of the Valley Corridor and Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area Advisory Committee is established to advise the Secretary of the Interior on a study and recommend boundaries for a new recreation area. The boundaries should reflect the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area and include the lands of the Rim of the Valley Corridor. The Committee, consisting of 24 members appointed by the Secretary of the Interior, is tasked with submitting a recommendation including maps depicting proposed boundaries for a Santa Monica Mountains and Rim of the Valley National Recreation Area within 365 days of their first meeting. Public participation in and comment on the recommendation of boundaries is also required. The Committee, comprised of 24 members appointed by the Secretary of the Interior, includes 17 representatives of local governments in the vicinity of the recreation area. Public participation in and comment on the recommended boundaries is encouraged. The city councils of Agoura Hills, Westlake Village, Malibu, Calabasas, Burbank, Glendale, La Canada-Flintridge, Pasadena, Sierra Madre, South Pasadena, Santa Clarita, Moorpark, and the board of supervisors of Los Angeles county are designated to represent unincorporated communities within the East Rim of the Valley Trail Corridor, in consultation with the Town Council of Altadena and the Crescenta Valley Town Council. The board of supervisors of Los Angeles county, along with various designated representatives from different organizations, are appointed to represent the unincorporated communities within the East Rim of the Valley Trail Corridor. The Committee consists of representatives from different park districts, a chairperson, and a vice chairperson. Members serve without compensation but are reimbursed for expenses. A quorum of 13 members is required for business transactions, and the Committee will terminate upon the submission of a special resources study to Congress."
