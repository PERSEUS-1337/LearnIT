The Act defines a \"Federal agency\" as an Executive agency under section 105 of title 5, United States Code. The Federal Research Public Access Act of 2006 requires Federal agencies with research expenditures over $100,000,000 to develop a policy for public access to research papers. This policy includes submitting final manuscripts of research papers to the agency, incorporating peer review changes, and providing free online access to the final published version. The Federal Research Public Access Act of 2006 mandates Federal agencies to provide free online public access to final peer-reviewed manuscripts or published versions within 6 months of publication. It also requires the creation of an online bibliography linking to full-text papers and the long-term preservation of research findings in a digital repository maintained by the agency. The Federal Research Public Access Act of 2006 requires Federal agencies to ensure research findings are stored in a stable digital repository meeting specified criteria. The policy applies to researchers employed or funded by the agency, ensuring public domain works are marked as such and made immediately available. The Federal Research Public Access Act of 2006 mandates that Federal research findings be stored in a digital repository meeting specific criteria. The policy excludes certain materials like laboratory notes and classified research, and does not affect rights under patent or copyright law. A report must be submitted annually by October 1st. The Federal Research Public Access Act of 2006 requires Federal agencies to submit an annual report on their research public access policy effectiveness to specific Congressional committees. This policy does not impact copyright or patent rights under title 17 or 35, United States Code. The Federal Research Public Access Act of 2006 mandates Federal agencies to provide an annual report on the effectiveness of their research public access policy.
