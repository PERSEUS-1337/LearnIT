    "content": "Since Burma's military junta transferred power to a quasi-civilian government in 2011, Congress has mostly deferred to the White House and State Department on U.S. policy towards Burma. The Obama Administration has made adjustments using executive authority, but may need congressional action for further changes. Congress may reassess its role in shaping policy towards Burma. The Obama Administration has made changes to U.S. policy towards Burma, including engaging in direct dialogue with the ruling military junta and cooperating on international security issues. Congress may need to take further action to implement additional changes in policy towards Burma. The Obama Administration revised U.S. policy towards Burma, focusing on promoting democracy, human rights, and international security cooperation. Key goals included releasing political prisoners, ending conflicts with ethnic minorities, and severing ties with North Korea. Coordination with other nations was emphasized to achieve these objectives. The Obama Administration revised U.S. policy towards Burma, emphasizing promoting democracy, human rights, and international security cooperation. Key goals included releasing political prisoners, ending conflicts with ethnic minorities, and severing ties with North Korea. The new policy led to a dramatic political transformation in Burma, with parliamentary elections held in 2010 and power transferred to a quasi-civilian government in 2011. Since 2011, Burma has been governed by a quasi-civilian government led by ex-general President Thein Sein. The government has implemented political and economic reforms, including releasing political prisoners and amending oppressive laws. In 2012, parliamentary by-elections saw Aung San Suu Kyi's party win a majority of seats, signaling positive political development. The Obama Administration responded by increasing high-level meetings with the Burmese government. Despite flaws in the by-elections, the acceptance of results by Thein Sein administration and Burmese military was viewed positively. The Obama Administration responded by easing sanctions, appointing an ambassador, and increasing assistance to Burma. Plans include reopening USAID mission after 23 years. Plans are underway to increase U.S. assistance to Burma, including reopening the USAID mission after a 23-year hiatus. Despite reforms, the political and economic situation in Burma remains serious, with ongoing fighting between the Burmese military and ethnic-based militias. Human rights violations are reported in conflict areas, particularly in Kachin State. Ethnic tensions have been exposed by rioting in Rakhine State. The Tatmadaw has been accused of human rights violations in conflict areas, while ethnic tensions have been revealed by rioting in Rakhine State. Despite some laws protecting civil liberties being passed, oppressive laws still exist. The NLD participated in the 2012 by-elections, but many political parties have faced registration issues. Over 200 political prisoners remain in Burma's prisons, raising questions about the government's commitment to democracy and human rights. The 113th Congress may address these issues and Burma's political and economic development. The Obama Administration's Burma policy raises questions about democracy, human rights, and economic development in Burma. Key issues include the government's commitment to reforms, relations with ethnic minorities, sanctions enforcement, and aid support from the United States. The Obama Administration's Burma policy, influenced by a 2007 article in Foreign Affairs, focuses on pressing Burma's military junta for political and economic reforms through direct engagement and sanctions. This policy raises questions about democracy, human rights, and economic development in Burma, as well as its role in the geopolitical dynamic between China and India. The Obama Administration's approach towards Burma evolved over time, initially expressing skepticism towards the government but later becoming more optimistic. The policy recommended direct engagement with the military regime and continuation of sanctions, similar to the State Department's approach in 2009. Obama's administration balanced relations with the government and opposition parties, including Aung San Suu Kyi. The Obama Administration's approach towards Burma evolved over time, initially expressing skepticism towards the government but later becoming more optimistic. Efforts were made to balance relations with the new government, Aung San Suu Kyi, opposition parties, and ethnic groups. The policy shifted to promoting progressive forces within the Thein Sein government and isolating anti-reform individuals and organizations. This led to a closer partnership with President Thein Sein's government, possibly at the expense of relations with traditional opposition parties and ethnic organizations. The Obama Administration shifted its approach towards Burma, aligning more closely with President Thein Sein's government and focusing on promoting further reforms. This change in policy has sparked debate among experts and interest groups. The Obama Administration's shift in Burma policy has sparked debate among experts and interest groups. Some believe the administration has moved too fast in rewarding modest progress, while others think it has been too slow in lifting sanctions that hinder reforms in Burma. Despite holding high-level meetings with the SPDC, existing U.S. sanctions on Burma remained in place. The Obama Administration maintained existing U.S. sanctions on Burma despite holding high-level meetings with SPDC officials. They stated sanctions would remain until concrete progress towards reform was seen, with the possibility of implementing additional sanctions if needed. The administration also mentioned the potential for relaxing or removing sanctions if Burma met specified criteria in U.S. law, influenced by the tense political situation in Burma in 2010. The political situation in Burma in 2010 was tense, with the NLD and other pro-democracy parties boycotting the November elections due to unfair laws. The SPDC transformed the USDA into the USDP, led by Prime Minister Thein Sein, and announced the transformation of ethnic militias into Border Guard Forces. Refusal to join the BGF led to military offensives in the Kokang region. In 2009, ethnic militias in Burma were pressured to become Border Guard Forces (BGF) by the military, leading to conflicts and refugee crises. Concerns about Burma's alleged nuclear weapons program and arms trade with North Korea also influenced the cautious response of the Obama Administration. In 2009, reports surfaced about Burma's alleged nuclear weapons program and arms trade with North Korea. U.S. naval vessels monitored a cargo ship carrying arms from North Korea to Burma in violation of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1874. The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) warned in 2010 that Burma was exploring nuclear weapons development. Al Jazeera's report claimed the SPDC had a nuclear weapons program with support from North Korea. Despite doubts about Burma's technical ability, the arms trade continued, raising concerns for the Obama Administration. Resolution 1874 was a major concern for the Obama Administration due to Burma's unfair elections and continued repression. President Obama criticized the regime for detaining political prisoners, including Aung San Suu Kyi, and silencing pro-democracy parties. The regime's actions were seen as a preference for repression over transparency. The unfair electoral laws and partisan Election Commission in Burma silenced pro-democracy parties and denied registration to certain ethnic parties. The United States will continue pressure on Burmese authorities to release political prisoners, uphold human rights, and engage in dialogue with minority groups. Acting Deputy Department Spokesman Mark C. Toner criticized the flawed electoral process in Burma. The United States continues to pressure Burmese authorities to release political prisoners, uphold human rights, and engage in dialogue with minority groups.

The Special Representative for Burma, Derek Mitchell, coordinates U.S. policy towards Burma and consults with foreign governments and Congress. The new Burmese government had both positive and negative developments, including the release of political prisoners and overtures for political reconciliation. However, there were incidents like the interception of a cargo ship suspected of carrying banned weapons technology and the Burmese Army breaking a ceasefire with the Kachin Independence Army. The cargo ship suspected of carrying banned weapons technology was reportedly in transit between North Korea and Burma, with the North Korean crew refusing to be boarded. The Burmese Army broke a ceasefire with the Kachin Independence Army, leading to fighting spreading in Burma. The Obama Administration expressed disappointment with the progress of the new Burmese government in 2011. In June 2011, Deputy Assistant Secretary Yun disagreed with the assessment of Burma's new government, citing concerns about former SPDC officials holding key positions.

The Burmese government's actions following President Obama's visit included commitments to ceasefire in Kachin State, preventing attacks on civilians in Rakhine State, and seeking political solutions with ethnic armed groups. However, there were concerns raised about the government's commitment to political reform after violent incidents occurred, such as police attacking a peaceful protest and the military launching assaults on the Kachin Independence Army. Despite sporadic fighting between the Tatmadaw and the KIA since the ceasefire was broken in 2011, ceasefire talks had been unsuccessful. The Burmese government, despite promises to President Obama, took steps to protect assembly rights and media freedom. Fighting between the Tatmadaw and KIA escalated in 2012 with Operation Thunderbolt, violating ceasefire instructions and leading to international criticism for civilian casualties and human rights abuses. The attack on the KIA in 2012 drew international criticism for violating ceasefire instructions, causing civilian casualties, and human rights abuses. Allegations of child soldiers were made against the KIA, while the Burmese government claimed self-defense. A ceasefire announced in January 2013 quickly broke down. The fragile ceasefire in Kachin State broke down as Tatmadaw forces attacked a KIA base near Laiza. The U.S. Embassy criticized the Burmese Army for continuing the military offensive despite the ceasefire announcement, leading to civilian casualties and hindering national reconciliation efforts. Burma's Ministry of Foreign Affairs blamed the KIA for violating the ceasefire. The United States strongly opposes the ongoing fighting in Kachin State, resulting in civilian casualties and undermining national reconciliation efforts. Burma's Ministry of Foreign Affairs blames the KIA for violating the ceasefire and describes the attacks as \"terrorist.\" Negotiations between the Union Government and KIO/KIA were held, but fighting continues. It is uncertain if the Tatmadaw supports the negotiations or will abide by any agreements. Despite ongoing conflict, some policy changes were made to improve civil liberties. In early 2013, amidst continued fighting in Kachin State, the Union Government and Parliament made policy changes to enhance civil liberties. The Press Scrutiny and Registration Division was dissolved, a new Copyrights and Registration Division was established, and Order No. 2/88, banning gatherings without permission, was abolished. A draft media legislation was also introduced, criticized by media groups in Burma.

Media groups in Burma condemned the draft legislation, particularly objecting to provisions prohibiting reporting on ethnic conflicts and criticizing the 2008 constitution. The draft bill proposed by the Ministry of Information in Burma has faced criticism from journalist associations for its restrictive provisions, including a ban on reporting on ethnic conflicts and criticizing the 2008 constitution. The bill also gives the MOI the power to appoint a registration official to control publishing licenses, which is seen as a form of media censorship. The proposed penalties for violations are harsher than those in the 1962 law, with imprisonment of three to six months and fines up to $12,000. Additionally, on February 22, 2013, OFAC issued general license No. 19 to facilitate financial transactions with certain Burmese banks, while also adding Ayeyarwady Bank to the SDN list.

General Khin Kyunt announced a roadmap for a \"disciplined democracy\" in Burma in 2003, with the transfer of power to the Union Government and Parliament in 2011 marking progress towards a modern, developed, and democratic nation. However, the development of democracy in Burma is still a work in progress, with key debates on the military's control and the definition of a \"disciplined democracy.\" The roadmap for a \"disciplined democracy\" in Burma announced in 2003 by General Khin Kyunt lacks clarity on key elements such as civilian control over the military, federal vs. central government structure, balance of power between branches of government, and citizenship conditions including rights for Rohingyas. The military in Burma retains significant power, with unclear details on key aspects such as the selection of President and Vice Presidents, citizenship conditions, and civil liberties. The Tatmadaw, led by Commander-in-Chief Vice Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, remains opaque in its views on political reforms and its role in Burma's \"disciplined democracy.\" The relationship between the military and the Union Government is also unclear, with recent ministerial changes appointing former generals to key positions. The military in Burma retains significant power, with unclear details on key aspects such as the selection of President and Vice Presidents, citizenship conditions, and civil liberties.

Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hliang's actions, including not publicly confirming orders to cease military operations against certain groups, have raised concerns about his political intentions. Additionally, the replacement of military-appointed members of the Union Parliament in April 2012 and strained relations between the military and the Union Parliament highlight ongoing tensions in the country's political landscape. The military in Burma has strained relations with the Union Parliament due to incidents involving the military budget and land seizures. The military's extensive economic involvement and ownership of major corporations remain unresolved issues in the country's political landscape. The military in Burma has extensive economic power through ownership of major corporations like UMEHL and MEC, providing independent revenue and control over the economy. This has strained relations with the Union Parliament, leading to unresolved issues in the country's political landscape. The Tatmadaw, owned by MEC, generates revenue independently of the federal budget, giving them control over the economy. Burma has faced a civil war since 1948 due to ethnic minorities feeling the government did not honor the Panglong Agreement. The military coup in 1962 was attributed to the government's failure to suppress ethnic militias. The 2008 Constitution designates the military as the main entity for safeguarding national integrity. The Union Government has proposed a peace process to end the civil war and reconcile with the Burman majority. The 2008 Constitution designates the Burmese military as the main entity for safeguarding national integrity. The Union Government has proposed a three-step peace process to negotiate an end to the civil war and achieve reconciliation with ethnic organizations. This includes negotiating ceasefire agreements, broader agreements on political and economic development, and a national agreement on amending the Constitution. The proposal assumes the preservation of the 2008 Constitution with amendments and the disbanding of ethnic militias or their merger into the Tatmadaw. The Union Government has proposed a three-step peace process for negotiating an end to the civil war and achieving reconciliation with ethnic organizations. This includes negotiating ceasefire agreements, broader agreements on political and economic development, and a national agreement on amending the Constitution. Former Railway Minister Aung Min is seen as the lead negotiator in talks with ethnic organizations, although the Union Government's proposal has been rejected by some prominent ethnic organizations. The United Nationalities Federal Council (UNFC) has proposed an alternative path to national reconciliation involving direct negotiations with the Union Government, followed by a national conference of ethnic organizations and the convening of a national convention to negotiate the terms of a \"national accord\" for the establishment of a federal union of Burma. The United Nationalities Federal Council (UNFC) has proposed an alternative path to national reconciliation in Burma, involving direct negotiations with the Union Government, followed by a national conference of ethnic organizations and the convening of a national convention to negotiate the terms of a \"national accord\" for a federal union. Talks between the Union Government and ethnic organizations have had mixed results, with preliminary ceasefire agreements reached with 13 out of 21 groups. The UNFC has appointed a negotiating team, but none of the negotiations have completed the second step of the Union Government's peace process. Several unresolved issues remain in efforts to achieve national reconciliation. Informal talks between the UNFC and the Union Government in Ruili, China in February 2013 resulted in an agreement for future discussions. However, none of the negotiations have completed the second step of the Union Government's peace process. Key issues include the power balance between the central government and ethnic States, the Tatmadaw's support for national reconciliation, and reports of Burmese Army attacks on ethnic militias despite ceasefire agreements. The Burmese military has not actively participated in current negotiations, raising doubts about their support for the peace process. The Union Government is pushing for reconciliation within the framework of the 2008 Constitution, while ethnic groups prefer equal talks without accepting the constitution's legitimacy. The future of the 2008 Constitution is a critical element in any proposal for national reconciliation. The drafting and adoption of the 2008 Constitution in Burma is seen as politically problematic, with many opposition parties and ethnic organizations not participating in the process. The Constitution is viewed as being written by the military to maintain their power. The legitimacy of the Constitution, as well as the Union Government and Parliament, is questioned due to limited public access to the text and fraudulent referendum results. President Thein Sein and the military consider the Constitution as the legitimate governing document. The 2008 Constitution in Burma is considered fraudulent and not free or fair, raising concerns about the legitimacy of the Union Government and Parliament. President Thein Sein is open to limited amendments to the constitution, including changes to the Tatmadaw's privileged status. Opposition parties, led by Aung San Suu Kyi, also seek amendments to allow her to serve as President after the 2015 elections. The NLD and other opposition parties in the Union Parliament, led by Aung San Suu Kyi, are pushing for amendments to the 2008 Constitution to allow her to serve as President after the 2015 elections. While they are willing to follow the constitution's amendment process, many ethnic organizations reject the constitution and prefer direct negotiations with the Union Government and Tatmadaw for a new constitution. The arduous requirements to amend the constitution may hinder a negotiated agreement. The 2008 Constitution outlines the process for amending it, requiring support from at least 20% of Union Parliament members and 75% for adoption. Certain sections also need approval from over 50% of eligible voters in a nationwide referendum. These sections include the government's structure, military's role, state of emergency conditions, and more. The 2008 Constitution outlines the process for amending it, requiring support from at least 20% of Union Parliament members and 75% for adoption. Specific sections need approval from over 50% of eligible voters in a national referendum, including the government's structure, military's role, state of emergency conditions, and more. Any amendment must also obtain support from a portion of military appointees in the Union Parliament, posing a challenge for potential changes to satisfy ethnic organizations. Voter turnout could be a hurdle, as seen in the April 2012 by-elections. The 113th Congress may play a more active role in shaping U.S. policy towards Burma during a potential political transition. Critics have differing views on the Obama Administration's approach to Burma, with some saying it has moved too fast in relaxing sanctions and others claiming it has moved too slowly, leading to a loss of influence. Congress passed five laws, introduced 28 bills, and held six hearings related to Burma during the 112th Congress. The 112th Congress passed five laws and introduced 28 bills related to Burma, mostly extending sanctions. Three new laws extended import bans, while two others pertained to fund use and international financial matters. Three of the five new laws passed by the House Committee on Foreign Affairs extended import bans on Burma, while the other two laws pertained to fund use and international financial matters. Section 7014 of Division I of P.L. 112-74 banned the use of funds for international assistance to Burma if they support military training or operations involving child soldiers.

The 113th Congress may conduct oversight on the Obama Administration's implementation of U.S. policy towards Burma, potentially adjusting policy in response to changes in the country. Congressional committees have the authority to request testimony from senior Administration officials and examine funding for assistance programs in Burma. Such oversight activities are a long-standing authority granted by the U.S. Constitution. The 113th Congress may conduct oversight on the Obama Administration's implementation of U.S. policy towards Burma, potentially adjusting policy in response to changes in the country. This oversight may examine the reasoning behind the shift in the Administration's approach to Burma and assess the conduct of U.S. policy in Burma. Key aspects of current U.S. policy Congress may consider include the political situation in Burma, the easing of sanctions, and the focus on President Thein Sein and other Burmese officials. The Obama Administration's approach to Burma is under scrutiny by the 113th Congress, questioning the pace of easing sanctions and focus on President Thein Sein. Key questions include acceptance of the Union Government, views on the Burmese military, and potential reestablishment of military relations. The Obama Administration's assessment of the Burmese military's attitudes towards political reform in Burma, the best approach to dealing with them in the future, and considerations for reestablishing military-to-military relations are key issues. Additionally, views on ethnic groups and militias, establishing closer relations with ethnic organizations, and specific issues related to U.S. policy towards Burma are being examined by Congress. This includes the Administration's implementation of existing laws, intentions regarding the Special Representative for Burma, administration of lists of sanctioned Burmese nationals, and submission of required reports to Congress. The Obama Administration is assessing the Burmese military's stance on political reform and future relations. Congress is examining U.S. policy towards Burma, including the appointment of a Special Representative and Policy Coordinator, administration of sanctions lists, and report submissions to Congress. Ambassador Derek J. Mitchell is the appointed Special Representative and Policy Coordinator for Burma. The Special Representative and Policy Coordinator for Burma cannot hold another executive branch position. Ambassador Derek J. Mitchell was confirmed for the role but stepped down after becoming U.S. Ambassador to Burma. W. Patrick Murphy is currently acting in the position, exceeding the 210-day limit allowed by the Federal Vacancies Act of 1998. Congress may inquire about the Obama Administration's plans regarding this appointment. The State Department's posting shows that W. Patrick Murphy's temporary appointment as Special Representative and Policy Coordinator for Burma has exceeded the 210-day limit allowed by the Federal Vacancies Act of 1998. Congress may question the Obama Administration's intentions regarding this appointment. Additionally, the compilation of lists of Burmese individuals subject to sanctions under various laws has faced criticism. The 2003 BFDA and the Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE Act prohibit entry visas for certain Burmese nationals unless deemed in the US national interest. Presidential determinations and executive orders block visas for selected Burmese individuals. The Department of State maintains a list of prohibited Burmese nationals and freezes assets of certain individuals. Financial sanctions are administered by the Secretary of the Treasury. The Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE Act and the 2003 BFDA impose financial sanctions and visa bans on certain Burmese individuals entering the United States. The Secretaries of State and Treasury are required to identify potential sanctioned persons. Criticisms have been raised against the State Department and Treasury for not fully enforcing these sanctions. The State Department has not disclosed the names on its visa ban list, raising concerns about compliance with the law. Burmese government officials have visited the US in recent years, potentially violating these sanctions. The US has not publicly disclosed the names on its visa ban list, raising concerns about compliance with sanctions laws. Burmese government officials have visited the US in recent years, potentially violating these sanctions. The Treasury Department delegates the responsibility of maintaining the list of sanctioned Burmese individuals to its Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), but human rights organizations claim that the current list is incomplete. The current SDN list of sanctioned individuals and entities by the Department of the Treasury is incomplete, according to human rights organizations. There are criticisms regarding the delivery and quality of mandated reports to Congress, with some reports not being provided on time or lacking in detail. Existing sanctions on Burma remain in effect until certain conditions are met or Congress acts. The existing sanctions on Burma remain in effect until certain conditions are met or Congress acts. President Obama has used authority to waive some sanctions, but they can be resumed at any time. The current extension of the import ban ends on July 25, 2013, with Congress considering an extension given the presidential waiver. The 113th Congress may consider extending the import ban on Burma, altering U.S. policy towards Burma, and providing guidance on conducting U.S. policy towards Burma. Funding levels for assistance programs in Burma will also be discussed. The 113th Congress may consider funding levels for assistance programs in Burma proposed by the Obama Administration, which include aid to landmine victims, English language training, and democracy programs. The Budget Control Act of 2011 may affect the amount of federal funding available for these programs. The Budget Control Act of 2011 may impact federal funding for assistance programs in Burma, including aid to landmine victims, English language training, and democracy programs. Sequestration could lead to a 5% reduction in funding, with the Department of State and USAID having the authority to reprogram funds. Post-sequestration funding levels for Burma are uncertain, but a rough estimate could involve reducing FY2012 estimates by 5%. Once Congress passes final FY2013 funding legislation, the Department of State can determine country and program allocations.
