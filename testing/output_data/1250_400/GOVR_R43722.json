The OIG's blog addressed concerns about ammunition purchases, stating it is standard issue for law enforcement agencies. OIG agents use this ammunition for training and safety. The USDA's OIG received inquiries about procurement for new firearms. OIG's criminal investigation responsibilities are extensive. The OIG's Investigations division conducts numerous criminal investigations each year, involving potentially life-threatening situations for OIG agents, USDA employees, and the public.

An OIG can be vested with law enforcement authority through the IG Act or by the Attorney General. The IG Act of 1978 provides law enforcement authority to 25 federal entities, with the Attorney General able to delegate this authority when necessary. Additionally, OIGs within 10 agencies have been vested with law enforcement authority by the Attorney General. The Attorney General has granted law enforcement authority to OIGs in 10 agencies, including the National Archives, Amtrak, and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Guidelines were established by then-Attorney General John Ashcroft in 2003, outlining training requirements for OIG employees with law enforcement authority. Mr. Ashcroft's guidelines require OIG employees with law enforcement authority to complete various training programs, including firearms training and qualification. They must also adhere to the DOJ's deadly force policy and receive periodic refresher training in various legal and investigative areas. OIGs must follow DOJ law enforcement policies, consult before using electronic surveillance, and obtain approval for undercover investigations. Additionally, five OIGs have law enforcement authority through laws outside the IG Act. Five additional OIGs have law enforcement authority through laws outside the IG Act. The Bureau of Justice Statistics maintains a Census on Federal Law Enforcement Officers, reporting that 33 OIGs had 3,501 agents authorized to carry firearms in September 2008. No law enforcement officers within an OIG were assaulted or injured in 2008."
