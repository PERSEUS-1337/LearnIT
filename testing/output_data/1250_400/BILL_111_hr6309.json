    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Notification of Origin of Telecommunications and Internet Consumer Exchanges Act of 2010\" or the \"NOTICE Act of 2010\". Definitions are provided in Section 2. In this Act, \"business entity\" refers to any organization established for profit through commerce in the United States. \"Commerce\" is defined as in the Consumer Product Safety Act. A \"consumer\" is an individual in the US who purchases goods or services for personal use. \"Customer service communication\" is any communication between a consumer and a business entity in commerce. The term \"wire communication\" refers to the transmission of information using wire, cable, or similar connections, including all services related to such transmission. Telecommunication involves the transmission of chosen information without alteration between specified points. Business entities engaged in customer service communications must disclose their physical location. Business entities must disclose their physical location at the beginning of customer service communications, with exceptions for those located in the United States or for communications initiated by consumers to foreign entities. Exceptions to the disclosure requirement for business entities in customer service communications include communications initiated by consumers, employees or agents located outside the US, emergency services, and potential exclusions determined by the Federal Trade Commission based on compelling circumstances. The Federal Trade Commission may exclude certain business entities or customer service communications from disclosure requirements if exceptionally compelling circumstances justify it. Business entities participating in customer service communications must certify compliance annually. The FTC will establish necessary regulations within a year of the Act's enactment, and the requirements will apply to communications one year after the Act's enactment. SEC. 4. ENFORCEMENT. The Federal Trade Commission has the power to prevent violations of the Act and its regulations, with penalties and enforcement mechanisms similar to those in the Federal Trade Commission Act. The Act grants the same privileges and immunities as the Federal Trade Commission Act, preserving the authority of the Federal Trade Commission under other laws."
