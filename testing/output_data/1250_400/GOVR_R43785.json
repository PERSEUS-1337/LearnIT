    "content": "The cultivation, distribution, and possession of marijuana are prohibited under federal law, but several states have legalized medical and recreational use. Colorado and Washington were the first states to legalize recreational marijuana in 2012, followed by Alaska, Oregon, and the District of Columbia in 2014. Commercial sales of recreational marijuana began in Colorado in 2014 and in Washington in 2014. The commercial marijuana market in Washington opened on July 7, 2014. Alaska and Oregon approved ballot initiatives to legalize marijuana for recreational purposes on November 4, 2014. The District of Columbia also approved measures to legalize marijuana cultivation, possession, and exchange. Polls show a majority of Americans support marijuana legalization, leading to debates at the federal level on bills to remove marijuana from Schedule I drugs and impose federal taxes on production and importation. The 113th Congress introduced bills to legalize marijuana at the federal level, including removing it from Schedule I drugs and imposing a federal excise tax. The debate on legalization spans criminal justice, public health, and revenue generation. This report focuses on the economic aspect of imposing a tax on legalized marijuana, discussing production, arguments for taxes, and tax designs. The curr_chunk discusses marijuana production, arguments for taxes, and tax designs. Marijuana is derived from the Cannabis sativa plant and contains THC as the main psychoactive ingredient. Different strains may contain other cannabinoids like CBD for various effects. Consumers may desire different strains of marijuana based on cannabinoid content, such as high CBD strains for anxiety relief. The potency of marijuana products can vary depending on preparation and plant parts used. Female marijuana plants grown without pollination can produce higher resin content buds, known as sinsemilla, with 10%-18% THC. Various consumption methods exist for marijuana. Marijuana can be grown without pollination to produce sinsemilla varieties with higher THC content. Consumption methods include smoking joints or blunts, as well as using devices like vaporizers. Different marijuana products have varying THC concentrations, such as hashish made from pressed trichomes. Different methods of consuming marijuana exist, from glass pipes to vaporizers. Cannabis can be processed into various products with different THC concentrations. Hashish, for example, has over 40% THC content. THC can also be used in edibles like candy or baked goods. Excise taxes on marijuana are discussed for reasons such as reflecting external costs, discouraging use, preventing price drops, funding programs, and raising revenue. Economic efficiency is achieved when the price of a commodity equals its costs. An excise tax on marijuana is discussed to reflect external costs, discourage use, prevent price drops, fund programs, and raise revenue. Economic efficiency is achieved when the price of a commodity equals its costs. The rationale for imposing a tax on marijuana is similar to that of alcohol and tobacco. Economic analysis suggests that the tax should be equal to the consumption cost to achieve economic efficiency. The external costs should be separate from the costs borne by the user, such as the value of lost years of life and costs of treating illness. Society bears the loss of tax revenue from lost earnings and some costs of treating illness, but also receives gains from reduced health costs and future transfer payments. The external costs of marijuana use, similar to alcohol and tobacco, are smaller than the total costs. A study estimated a cost of $30 billion for alcohol, which can be used to estimate the cost for marijuana. While no U.S. study on marijuana exists, comparing costs of cannabis use to alcohol can help determine the necessary tax to correct for externalities. The external costs of marijuana use are smaller than total costs. Comparing cannabis to alcohol, studies show cannabis has lower harm and health costs. Marijuana's non-health costs are likely lower than alcohol's, with evidence suggesting less impairment in driving ability and lower domestic violence rates. Enforcement costs for marijuana may be higher due to its illicit status. The Canadian study found larger enforcement costs for marijuana, but that effect is probably due to marijuana's illicit status. Marijuana usage is less common than alcohol, with external costs ranging from $0.5 billion to $1.7 billion. A 2014 report by the White House ONDCP provides estimates of market size, price, and consumption weight. The 2014 White House ONDCP report provides estimates of the total market size, price, and consumption weight of marijuana in the United States. The report suggests that external costs of marijuana range from $0.5 billion to $1.7 billion, translating to a potential tax of 0.8% to 5.3% of the current price. Additionally, the report indicates an increase in THC levels in marijuana from 2000 to 2010. Estimates of total U.S. expenditures on marijuana in 2010 range from $30 billion to $60 billion. THC levels in marijuana increased from 2000 to 2010. The White House's 2014 ONDCP report provides estimates of the price per gram of marijuana, which was $7.11 per gram in 2010. Anecdotal prices from anonymous sources and informal interviews also contribute to estimating the price of marijuana. Estimates of marijuana prices are gathered from various sources, including anonymous reports and data from priceofweed.com. Prices range from $224 to $317 per ounce, with some areas offering high-quality marijuana for as low as $28 per eighth of an ounce. Tax rates and the illicit nature of the market contribute to the higher prices, but in a legal market, prices would be lower. In a legal market, marijuana prices could be as low as $5 per ounce, with tax rates ranging from 0.8% to 5.3% of the price. Estimates of external cost range from $1.60 to $16.80 per ounce. The tax on a joint would be about the same as the tax on a six-pack of beer. The tax on a joint would be similar to the tax on a six-pack of beer, with states likely to impose additional taxes on marijuana. Some argue for a tax to discourage users who underestimate long-term health costs and potential dependence, especially among underage users. Some argue for a tax on marijuana to discourage users who underestimate long-term health costs and potential dependence, especially among underage users. Studies show that a percentage of users become dependent, and medical marijuana laws increase the probability of abuse or dependency among adults. More research is needed to improve information on the risks of marijuana addiction. Economists debate whether users' behavior is rational or influenced by time-inconsistent choices. Some economists argue that individuals may engage in hyperbolic discounting, leading to time-inconsistent choices. A tax on marijuana, similar to alcohol and tobacco taxes, would primarily affect heavy users. This regressive tax may be undesirable, but current users could benefit from lower prices if marijuana is legalized. A tax on marijuana, like alcohol and tobacco taxes, would mainly impact heavy users. The regressive nature of the tax may be undesirable, but current users could benefit from lower prices if marijuana is legalized. The effect of imposing taxes to discourage consumption depends on users' response to price changes, as measured by elasticities. Low price elasticity means the tax may not significantly alter behavior but still impose a burden on users. Gallet (2014) analyzed 42 studies on illicit drug demand, including 13 on marijuana elasticity. The demand for marijuana is relatively unresponsive to price changes, with elasticities ranging from -0.15 to -0.31. Imposing a tax on marijuana may harm users, as their consumption is minimally affected by price increases. Government policies aim to restrict drug use by minors, despite state laws prohibiting marijuana purchases for those under 21. Government policies aim to restrict drug use by minors, despite state laws prohibiting marijuana purchases for those under 21. Taxes may be more effective in reducing usage among youth, with estimates of price elasticity for minors being larger. The policy question is how much of a tax burden should be placed on non-responsive adult users to limit consumption of youth, similar to the issue with tobacco taxation. Setting the tax to prevent a substantial price decrease with legalization and expanded demand, especially among minors, is a potential objective. After legalization, the cost of marijuana is expected to decrease significantly due to increased production and reduced enforcement costs. This may lead to a need for a tax to prevent prices from falling too much, especially to deter youth consumption. The tax level may need to be adjusted based on the outcomes of a legal market. The cost of marijuana is expected to decrease significantly after legalization due to increased production and reduced enforcement costs. This could lead to the need for a federal tax rate to prevent prices from falling too low. After legalization, marijuana production costs are expected to decrease, leading to lower prices. A federal tax rate should be considered to prevent prices from falling too low. Caulkins (2010) estimates production costs per pound, with outdoor cultivation being cheaper but potentially lower in THC levels. Processing costs are estimated to add $20 to $35 per pound. Outdoor production of marijuana is estimated to cost substantially less per pound, with processing costs adding an additional $20 to $35. Greenhouse production costs around $215 plus processing, while outdoor production costs around $10 plus processing. THC concentration varies, with sinsemilla containing 10% - 18% THC. Government-sponsored marijuana in Canada can be produced at 33 cents per gram, with retail market costs estimated at 10 cents per gram. This leads to an expected price range of $5-$18 per ounce. The cost of government-sponsored marijuana production in Canada is 33 cents per gram, with retail market costs estimated at 10 cents per gram. This leads to an expected price range of $5-$18 per ounce. In jurisdictions where marijuana is quasi-legal, prices are generally lower than street prices but higher than these cost estimates. The price of medical marijuana in Canada ranges from $1.80-$5 per gram to the final consumer, with street prices listed at $10-$15 per gram. Beginning in April 2014, the Canadian government set the price of medical marijuana at $7.60 (CAD) per gram, higher than the average price. Small growers and homegrown marijuana will no longer be permitted under the new law. Actual prices can be observed in Colorado marijuana shops through websites like Leafly.com, which provides consumer reviews and menu prices of products available. Leafly is a website that provides consumer reviews and menu prices for marijuana shops, similar to Yelp for restaurants. Prices for marijuana in Denver range from $9 to $15 per gram, $29 to $40 per eighth of an ounce, and $190 to $350 per ounce. Prices in Colorado are lower than the national average, with high-quality marijuana priced at $238 per ounce and medium quality at $197 per ounce. These prices include taxes on legal purchases. Prices for marijuana in Colorado are lower than the national average, with high quality at $238 per ounce and medium quality at $197 per ounce. These prices reflect a mix of illicit and legal markets, but may not fully represent a legal market due to quasi-legal status. Marijuana businesses in Colorado face challenges with banking assistance and high federal taxes. In a study on the effects of marijuana legalization in California, researchers estimate a potential 80% decrease in pretax retail prices, with projections ranging from $40-$150 per ounce. Despite challenges with federal taxes and enforcement, prices in Colorado suggest a mix of illicit and legal markets. The Netherlands, like Colorado, has not fully legalized marijuana due to import bans and anti-drug laws. Street prices range from $200-$300 per ounce, indicating room for taxes up to $200 per ounce to align with legal prices. However, high taxes may fuel the illicit market, so a cautious approach is advised. Legalizing marijuana can help eliminate the illicit market and reduce law enforcement costs. Lowering taxes and monitoring market conditions may be the best approach. Tax revenue could fund research on medical marijuana, which is approved in 23 states and the District of Columbia. Barriers to marijuana research include federal approval challenges and the drug's Schedule I classification. Legalization would allow for more comprehensive studies on marijuana's benefits and side effects. The report discusses the benefits of legalizing marijuana, including funding research on medical marijuana and potential revenue from excise taxes. It highlights the need for comprehensive studies on marijuana's effects and suggests using tax revenue for information programs and discouraging use by minors. An excise tax on marijuana can generate significant revenue if it were to become legal, with potential for increased revenue from casual consumers entering the market. The uncertainty surrounding price and quantity in the market makes revenue projections uncertain. Legalization at the state level could impact revenue collected from a federal excise tax. The potential revenue from a federal excise tax on marijuana could be significant if it were to become legal. Analysts estimate that a federal excise tax could raise $5.8 billion annually if marijuana is taxed at a rate equal to 50% of its price to consumers. The pace of legalization at the state level could also impact revenue collected from a federal excise tax. Analysts estimate that a federal excise tax on marijuana could raise $5.8 billion annually if taxed at 50% of its price to consumers. This calculation considers a $50-$75 per ounce tax, a 50% price decrease after legalization, and a 25% increase in consumption. Additionally, there could be $3.3 billion in annual savings from reduced law enforcement expenditures. The calculation outlines how to estimate revenues from an excise tax on marijuana, assuming a $50 per ounce tax. It considers the effects on aggregate consumption, interactions with income taxes, and specific market conditions. Data on price and quantity are needed, with a market value estimated at $40 billion and a current price of $250 per ounce. Assuming a fully legalized industry nationwide with taxes and costs bringing the total price to $150 per ounce, the federal excise tax collection is calculated as $50 multiplied by the quantity in ounces. Assuming a fully legalized industry nationwide with taxes and costs bringing the total price to $150 per ounce, the federal excise tax collection is calculated as $50 multiplied by the quantity in ounces. With federal, state, and local taxes, the price is $150 and the increase in quantity is 14%, leading to a projected excise tax collection of $9.1 billion. The effect of marijuana legalization, with a price of $150 per ounce including taxes, would lead to a 14% increase in quantity and a projected excise tax collection of $9.1 billion. This revenue estimate is based on various assumptions and could change depending on the extent of legalization and taxation of medical marijuana in other states. The movement for marijuana legalization is limited to Colorado and Washington for recreational use, representing less than 4% of the population. Short-term revenue may be less than $300 million, but more could be gained by taxing medical marijuana in other states. Tax collection data from Colorado and Washington could provide insights into the potential tax base of a national legalized market. Marijuana sales are subject to multiple layers of taxation at the state and local level, with effective tax rates ranging from 15% to 25%. The state of Colorado imposes a 15% marijuana excise tax on unprocessed products, a 10% retail marijuana excise tax, and a 2.9% general sales tax. Local taxes may also apply. From January to September 2014, Colorado collected over $37.0 million in taxes and fees on recreational marijuana. Extrapolating from this data, the national market for marijuana could be estimated at $15.9 billion to $17.0 billion per year. After adjusting the September 2014 tax data from Colorado to control for usage rates in different states, the national sales tax base for recreational marijuana could be between $15.9 billion and $17.0 billion per year. Medical marijuana consumption could roughly double that base. Combined medical and recreational marijuana sales in Colorado suggest a market of at least $30 billion, but this may be understated due to non-resident sales and illicit market activity. The Colorado marijuana market may still have substantial illicit sales due to underdeveloped legal market and pot tourism. Implementing an excise tax at earlier production stages reduces administrative costs and tax evasion risks. Federal excise taxes are typically levied on manufacturers and imports. Marijuana can be taxed based on a per unit measurement or product price. Federal excise taxes on marijuana are generally levied on manufacturers and imports, with options for taxation based on weight or potency. Weight-based taxes are easier to administer but could lead to the production of more potent marijuana. Potency-based taxes are typically based on THC content per ounce. A weight-based tax at the manufacturing level is preferred over a retail-based tax to avoid issues with different products. Potency-based tax proposals are based on THC content per ounce, but they are more complex and costly to enforce. The main challenge with a potency-based tax is ensuring accurate lab testing of marijuana strains. Regulations would be needed to define sample sizes for testing. Lab testing costs vary but could decrease with more competition in the market. If marijuana is legalized, more labs may enter the market, potentially reducing testing prices. However, accuracy in measuring THC content could be challenging due to the nature of some products. A tax based on THC potency may lead to increased consumption of less-potent marijuana. An alternative could be a tax based on the THC to CBD ratio to encourage sedative effects. Ad valorem taxes, based on the retail price, have advantages in adjusting for market changes. An alternative potency calculation for taxing marijuana could be based on the THC to CBD ratio to encourage sedative effects. Ad valorem taxes, which adjust for market changes, have advantages in taxing marijuana based on the manufacturers or retail sales price. The main disadvantage of ad valorem taxes is the need for regulations to specify the taxable price. Manufacturers tax, imposed after the plant is first grown and harvested, is a simpler form of administration due to fewer firms involved in manufacturing. A manufacturers tax is a simple form of administration imposed after the plant is grown and harvested. Federal excise taxes are typically imposed at the manufacturer stage for products like tobacco, alcohol, and firearms. Retail tax regimes, resembling sales taxes, can capture price markups due to product type or market power. The price of products like marijuana can be determined by various characteristics. Per unit taxes can be indexed for inflation using measures like the Consumer Price Index. The tax rate for THC or marijuana can be adjusted for inflation using measures like the Consumer Price Index. Sunset provisions could be included in the initial marijuana tax laws to reflect changing market conditions. Tax rates could start low to combat the illicit market and gradually increase to limit consumption, or authority could be given to adjust rates based on certain criteria. Various taxation methods could be combined for effective regulation. The tax rate for legalized marijuana could be set low initially to combat the illicit market and then gradually increased to limit consumption. Different methods of taxation, such as a general tax based on price or weight with surcharges for higher-THC products, could be implemented. Differential tax rates could shape consumption to reduce negative social costs, but may also create unequal tax burdens. Comparisons can be made to alcohol and cigarette taxation methods. The tax rates for beer, wine, and distilled spirits vary based on alcohol content. Cigarettes are taxed per unit, while cigars have a high ad valorem tax. The potential federal marijuana tax raises questions about integrating existing stocks into the tax base. Lawmakers must consider taxing marijuana plants and products in jurisdictions where sales are legal. Integrating more existing marijuana products could help meet demand, simplify tax regulations, and increase federal revenue. However, some products may not meet new federal standards. An alternative option is to have a lead time between enacting the tax and the start of legalized sales. Some preexisting marijuana plants and products may not comply with new federal regulations or purity standards that could come with a federal tax regime. An alternative option is to provide ample lead time between enacting the tax and the start of legalized sales to allow producers to comply with regulations. Colorado and Washington have different approaches to integrating existing plants into the legal market. When federal excise taxes increase, untaxed floor stocks may be subject to tax to prevent stockpiling. In Washington, existing plants can be converted to legal stocks with a producer license and meeting state guidelines. Federal excise tax increases may tax untaxed floor stocks to prevent hoarding. Policy makers could implement federal regulations or allow states to create their own laws. Age restrictions on recreational marijuana purchases could limit the tax base, but trends may change post-legalization. Age restrictions on recreational marijuana purchases could limit the tax base, as younger individuals use marijuana at higher rates. Excluding these consumers may support underground production or indirect sales. Colorado residents can possess up to one ounce, while non-residents are limited to one quarter of an ounce per transaction to reduce risks of diversion. It is uncertain if these restrictions have had a significant effect. Non-Colorado residents are restricted to purchasing one quarter of an ounce (7 grams) in a single transaction to reduce risks of diversion. Production limits could be enacted based on the total market size or per grower, with Washington having a target of 80 metric tons for its marijuana market. Concerns about diversion of underground exports to countries where marijuana is illegal could be addressed with a tax administered closer to the production chain. Production limits could reduce the power of larger marijuana producers and prevent negative social consequences. However, they may lead to inefficiency and windfall profits for firms. The tax treatment of medical marijuana varies among jurisdictions that have legalized it. The federal government has never considered production limits for any other commodity and they are unlikely to work for states and a national legal market. Tax treatment of medical marijuana varies among jurisdictions, with some applying general sales tax or special gross receipts tax. Evidence shows a negative correlation between medical marijuana and prescription drugs, with deaths from prescription drug overdoses declining in states with medical marijuana. Differences in after-tax prices of recreational and medical marijuana could incentivize users to seek medical prescriptions. The analysis of tax data in Colorado suggests that exempting medical marijuana from federal tax could limit the tax base if strict standards for medical prescriptions are not enforced. Segregation of sales and marking devices may be necessary if medical marijuana is exempt. Rules for home growing of marijuana vary between states, with Colorado allowing up to six plants for recreational use and Washington not allowing home growing for recreational use. Federal law prohibits home distilling of alcohol. Rules for home growing of marijuana vary by state. Colorado allows up to six plants for recreational use, while Washington does not permit home growing for recreational use. Federal law prohibits home distilling of alcohol. Pat Oglesby suggests that a single plant can yield a pound of marijuana, with the average user consuming less than four ounces per year. Home production may not pose a significant threat to taxation, as users often opt for the illicit market even where homegrown marijuana is legal. Home production of marijuana may not significantly impact taxation as users often choose the illicit market even where homegrown marijuana is legal. Banning home production could enhance tax revenue, similar to tax reductions for small wine and beer producers. However, a small businesses exemption may lead to evasion and hinder tax collection efficiency. The value of a lower tax for small producers is unclear. It is more efficient to collect tax from larger producers, and a benefit for small firms would go against that objective. A small businesses exemption could lead to evasion. Lower tax on outdoor marijuana cultivation could reduce costs. Concerns exist about negative environmental effects. Incentives for higher-potency marijuana could encourage indoor production. Another option is levying a special occupational tax on businesses involved in marijuana production. The Marijuana Tax Equity Act of 2013 proposes an occupational tax on marijuana producers, importers, and manufacturers. Enforcement and administrative efforts are crucial for a sustainable federal tax regime on marijuana, as seen in historical examples like bootleg spirits trade post-Prohibition. Enforcement and administrative efforts are essential for a sustainable federal tax regime on marijuana. Historical examples show that increased enforcement can deter illicit transactions and compel producers to obtain licenses and pay taxes. Without adequate resources for tax enforcement authorities, legalizing and taxing marijuana could undermine the federal tax base in the long term. Legalizing and taxing marijuana could undermine the federal tax base without sufficient resources for tax enforcement. Marijuana smuggling may increase due to its compact nature, but it is more pungent than alcohol. Collecting taxes closer to the point of production could reduce the number of taxable entities. Various methods like tax stamps, seals, or genetic markers could be used for tax enforcement. Colorado has implemented a system to track marijuana plants from seed to sale using RFID tags. This system, along with traditional enforcement methods, aims to regulate the marijuana industry effectively. Additional regulations on weights and potency measurements would likely accompany a marijuana tax regime. The Department of Revenue's Marijuana Enforcement Division utilizes a linked-computer system called Marijuana Inventory Tracking Solutions (MITS) to complement traditional enforcement methods. Standardizing weights and potency measurements would be necessary for a marijuana tax regime to ensure consumer safety and accurate dosing. The U.S. Department of the Treasury could establish marketing standards for labeling and branding different marijuana strains, negotiating with industry representatives to inform consumers and maintain quality standards. Different tax rates for medical and recreational marijuana could lead to arbitrage opportunities, especially for heavy users looking to avoid high taxes. The 113th Congress made changes to U.S. policies regarding industrial hemp during the omnibus farm bill debate, allowing certain research institutions and state departments of agriculture to grow industrial hemp. Hemp has no commercial value as a psychoactive due to its low THC concentrations. The 113th Congress made changes to U.S. policies regarding industrial hemp in the omnibus farm bill, allowing research institutions and state departments of agriculture to grow hemp if permitted by state laws. Hemp can be distinguished from marijuana based on its THC content, with proposed legislation using a THC content of less than \u00bd of 1% or less than 1% by weight. Europe and Canada allow hemp with less than 0.3% THC. Concerns about marijuana being hidden in hemp fields are likely overstated due to cross-pollination weakening marijuana plants. An argument is made that marijuana can be hidden in hemp fields, but cross-pollination would weaken marijuana plants. The delay in federal legalization could impact state marijuana tax policies. State-based monopolies for marijuana sales are debated for their regulation and revenue-raising purposes. State-based monopolies for marijuana sales are debated for their regulation and revenue-raising purposes, with uncertainties surrounding the effects of a legalized and taxed marijuana market. State-based monopolies for marijuana sales are debated for their regulation and revenue-raising purposes, with uncertainties surrounding the effects of a legalized and taxed marijuana market. The uncertainties include post-legalization price, market size, consumer response to price changes, and the projection of tax revenues. Setting the level of tax is challenging due to uncertainties about prices, spillover effects, and health impacts of marijuana. Revenue potential from legalized marijuana sales is limited compared to alcohol or tobacco, especially if medical marijuana sales are exempt from federal tax. The discussion in the text provides information on the social costs and benefits of marijuana, with this appendix focusing on some components of social costs. If medical marijuana sales are exempt from federal tax, it could have a significant impact on the outcome. The relationship between marijuana and alcohol consumption plays a role in determining the social costs of marijuana legalization. While some studies suggest marijuana could have positive spillover effects if it substitutes for alcohol, the issue is still debated among researchers. Economic studies measuring the relationship between marijuana and other substances may not capture long-term effects accurately. Researchers have not reached a consensus on the negative spillover effects of marijuana when consumed with alcohol. Economic studies on marijuana and other substances may not accurately capture long-term effects. The uncertainty surrounding the relationship between alcohol and marijuana use limits the plausibility of levying a marijuana tax based on external costs to society. The uncertainty surrounding the relationship between alcohol and marijuana use limits the plausibility of levying a marijuana tax based on external costs to society. Initiatives in Colorado and Washington could provide insight into the effects of broader legalization policies. The social costs of marijuana legalization could vary based on polydrug use, with some claiming marijuana as a \"gateway drug\" to further illicit drug use. Studies indicate that marijuana has a lower risk of addiction and abuse compared to cocaine, crack, or heroin. Survey data shows that heavy marijuana users are more likely to use other illegal drugs. Research on the effects of marijuana on traffic fatalities is limited, with marijuana being the most frequently detected substance in drivers involved in crashes. However, a causal link between marijuana use and traffic fatalities has not been established. Marijuana is the most frequently detected substance in drivers involved in crashes, but there is no established causal link between marijuana use and traffic fatalities. Testing technology is limited in detecting marijuana intoxication levels accurately, making it challenging to differentiate between recent users and chronic medical marijuana patients not under the psychoactive effects. Some claim that marijuana legalization could lead to savings in criminal justice spending at the federal, state, and local levels. Estimates vary, with some suggesting significant savings while others propose smaller figures. For example, Jeffrey Miron estimated in 2005 that legalizing marijuana could save $7.7 billion per year in enforcement costs. However, subsequent research indicates that the savings may be smaller. Sevigny and Caulkins found that 8% of state and federal prison inmates serving drug-related sentences were marijuana-only offenders, suggesting that not all criminal incarcerations would be eliminated by marijuana legalization. Federal legalization of marijuana would likely not affect federal inmates already serving sentences for marijuana-related charges. It is unclear how federal legalization of marijuana might impact the future federal prison population. In state and local jails, drug violations account for about one-fifth of incarcerations and marijuana-only violations account for less than 10% of those charges. Legalizing marijuana could lead to 2% fewer prisoners in jails over time. Federal legalization of marijuana may not affect federal inmates with marijuana-related charges. In state and local jails, drug violations make up one-fifth of incarcerations, with marijuana-only violations less than 10%. Legalizing marijuana could reduce jail populations by 2% over time. However, the impact would not affect current inmates or future incarcerations in non-legalized jurisdictions. The benefits of legalization would be tied to marijuana itself, not taxation. If taxes or regulations are too burdensome, it could hinder gains by sustaining the illicit market. The majority of costs from the black market are linked to illegal stimulants and opiates, not marijuana, due to their higher prices. Marijuana transactions often occur indoors with less conflict risk compared to other drugs. The black market for illicit drugs is mainly driven by illegal stimulants and opiates, not marijuana, due to their higher prices. Marijuana transactions often occur indoors among friends and family, reducing conflict risk. Marijuana producers and retailers are unable to deduct business expenses for federal tax purposes under IRC Section 280E. The IRS enforces a provision that disallows business deductions for marijuana-related businesses, resulting in a significant tax burden. Some businesses, like Canna Care marijuana dispensary, have challenged these tax penalties in court. The IRS refused to accept millions in business deductions, leading to legal disputes over tax liabilities. Canna Care marijuana dispensary is challenging IRS tax penalties of over $800,000 in a case before the U.S. tax court in San Francisco, CA. The IRS refused $2.6 million in business deductions for employee salaries, rent, and other costs over three years. The discrepancies in tax treatments create economic incentives for underground economy engagement. Federal tax laws disadvantage legal marijuana businesses compared to illicit sellers. The Small Business Tax Equity Act of 2013 aims to exempt marijuana businesses complying with state laws from certain federal tax restrictions. Estimates for national marijuana sales volume are based on tax data from Colorado and Washington, but may underestimate total demand due to pending licenses and unknown impact on the underground market. The most recent tax revenue data from Colorado is used to estimate the state's marijuana tax base, taking into account the 10% retail marijuana sales tax and the 2.9% general sales tax. The calculations result in an average monthly aggregate tax base for recreational sales, with tax base calculations of $29.4 million and $30.6 million in September 2014. The Colorado Department of Revenue reported that the 10% retail marijuana sales tax collected $2.9 million and the 2.9% sales tax collected $886,915 in September 2014. This led to an estimate of $30.0 million in recreational marijuana sales in Colorado for that month. The data can be extrapolated to estimate the national sales tax base by considering population and marijuana usage rates in each state or district. Based on population and marijuana usage rates, the national sales tax base for recreational marijuana in Colorado could be estimated at $14.5 billion to $15.4 billion per year. Medical marijuana sales in Colorado were $31.3 million in September 2014, with monthly sales ranging between $31 million and $35 million from January to September 2014. The medical marijuana tax base in Colorado is calculated using the 2.9% general sales tax. In FY2013, the annual medical marijuana tax base was $314.2 million. It is uncertain if the opening of the recreational marijuana market has impacted medical marijuana demand in Colorado. Extrapolating Colorado's medical marijuana data to the U.S. population is challenging due to incomplete data in some states and potential self-selection bias among medical marijuana patients. Medical marijuana patient data may have a self-selection bias, as some individuals may relocate to states allowing medical marijuana use. Colorado's tax collections suggest medical marijuana consumption could significantly increase total marijuana consumption. Even with stricter regulations post-legalization, individuals denied a medical card could still purchase marijuana for recreational use."
