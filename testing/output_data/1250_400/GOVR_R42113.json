In the post-World War II era, corporate tax revenue peaked in 1952 at 6.1% of GDP and has since declined. Currently, corporate tax revenue is around 1.3% of GDP, but projections suggest it may increase to over 2.4% as the economy recovers. Overall federal tax revenues have remained stable at around 17.7% of GDP, with individual tax revenues also stable at around 8.1% of economic output. Payroll tax revenue has increased while excise tax revenue has decreased. At its peak in 1952, the corporate tax generated 32.1% of all federal tax revenue. Corporate tax revenue has decreased in importance relative to other revenue sources. In 1952, the corporate tax generated 32.1% of all federal tax revenue, but today it only accounts for 8.9%. The decline in corporate tax revenues may be due to factors such as tax rate reductions and changes in the corporate tax base. Payroll tax revenue has increased while excise tax revenue has decreased. The decline in corporate tax revenue is influenced by factors like tax rate reductions and changes in the tax base. The average effective corporate tax rate has decreased from 55.8% in 1951 to 28.4% in 2010, leading to lower revenue. The reduction in the tax base has also contributed to the decline in corporate tax revenue. The average effective corporate tax rate decreased from 55.8% in 1951 to 28.4% in 2010, resulting in lower revenue. Factors driving this decline include reductions in the top statutory rate and the availability of investment tax credits. Since 1962, corporations could claim an investment tax credit for new investments, reducing their effective tax rate. The Section 199 deduction since 2004 also lowers the tax rate for certain activities, mainly in manufacturing. Changes in depreciation rules, including bonus depreciation in 2002 and 2009, further contributed to reduced effective tax rates. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 brought tax depreciation closer to physical depreciation. Bonus depreciation in 2002 and 2009 aimed to stimulate the economy. Other factors like inflation and tax credits have had small effects on effective corporate tax rates. Despite a general decline, there were spikes in 2000 and 2007 due to recessions and business losses. The average effective corporate tax rate spiked above the 35% statutory rate in 2000 and 2007 during recessions. Businesses can use current losses to offset income from previous years, but in severe downturns, a two-year carryback period may not be sufficient. This led to higher taxes for struggling corporations. Congress extended the carryback period to five years in 2002 and 2008 to stimulate the economy. Lower effective tax rates are not the sole reason for the decline in corporate tax revenue. In response to higher taxes for struggling corporations, Congress extended the carryback period to five years in 2002 and 2008 to stimulate the economy. The decline in corporate tax revenue is not solely due to lower effective tax rates, as partnerships and S corporations have seen an increase in business income share, shifting away from C corporations. The distribution of business income in the United States shifted from C corporations to partnerships and S corporations between 1980 and 2007. This change led to a smaller corporate tax base and a drop in corporate tax revenues. Additionally, there was a decrease in the number of C corporations and an increase in the popularity of S corporations, especially after the Tax Reform Act of 1986. By 2007, S corporations represented 12% of all businesses. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 set lower tax rates, leading to a rise in S corporations. The shareholder limit for S corporations increased from 35 to 100, making them more attractive. By 2007, S corporations accounted for 12% of businesses, up from 4% in 1980. Corporate profitability has declined significantly since 1966. Corporate profitability has fallen significantly since 1966, with the profit to asset ratio showing a decline. Economists attribute this decrease to factors such as a shift to more volatile industries and a change in the age distribution of corporations. The shift in corporate profitability since 1966 is attributed to factors like moving to more volatile industries, a shift in the age distribution of corporations, profit-shifting to lower-tax countries, and discrepancies in reported income for tax and financial purposes. This has led to a decline in corporate tax revenues over the last six decades. Corporate tax revenues have been declining for the last six decades due to factors such as decreasing effective corporate tax rates, a shift towards pass-through business structures, and falling corporate sector profitability. This decline is relevant in the ongoing tax reform debate focused on reducing statutory rates. The ongoing tax reform debate focuses on reducing statutory rates and achieving revenue neutrality by broadening the tax base. Research suggests that reducing the top corporate tax rate from 35% to 25% would require repealing all corporate tax expenditures and making reforms to business taxation. As corporate tax revenues have declined due to factors like decreasing effective tax rates and falling profitability, understanding the reasons behind this decline is crucial. Reducing the top corporate tax rate from 35% to 25% would require repealing all corporate tax expenditures and making reforms to business taxation. Business activity may return to the corporate sector, broadening the tax base. Other reforms may include changes to the taxation of American multinationals operating overseas, reducing profit shifting. The calculation of the average effective tax rates is explained with data sources and equations."
