The Congress emphasizes the importance of maintaining the US's position in science and technology to advance human understanding and improve lives. Research and development in science and technology contribute significantly to the economic growth of the country. Basic research explores the universe while applied research addresses practical problems. The United States emphasizes the importance of research and development in science and technology to promote economic growth. Education is crucial in developing intellectual capital for innovation. The country needs scientists, engineers, technologically proficient workers, and scientifically literate individuals to drive progress. The United States emphasizes research and development for economic growth, requiring technologically proficient workers and scientifically literate individuals. Student performance in math and science shows shortcomings in education, necessitating new teaching methods, curricula, and teacher training. Science is a process of inquiry beyond facts and theories. Improved teaching methods and curricula, along with better teacher training and parental involvement, are essential for enhancing education in mathematics and science. Science is a process of inquiry based on observations and data, leading to a deeper understanding of the universe through concepts and theories. Students should learn science by actively engaging in experiments and hands-on activities. It is crucial to start science education at an early age and maintain it throughout the school years. High-quality teachers play a vital role in connecting students with the content they are learning. Teachers are crucial for connecting students with the content they are learning in science. High-quality, well-trained teachers need to be recruited and retained with incentives for improvement. Training teachers in their content area, curriculum, and up-to-date research is essential for superior results.
