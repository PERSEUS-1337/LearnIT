To address the challenge of limited labeled data, a methodology for extending training datasets and training data-hungry models using weak supervision is proposed. This approach is applied to biomedical relation extraction, enhancing the performance of LSTM networks significantly. The methodology offers a way to extract important information from the increasing number of scientific papers in the biomedical field. The methodology discussed focuses on automating semantic triple extraction from biomedical abstracts, specifically targeting two important relations: Regulations (CPR) and Chemically Induced Diseases (CID). This approach aims to improve information extraction from scientific papers in the biomedical field, which is crucial for tasks like drug design and safety. Semantic triple extraction from biomedical abstracts is crucial for drug design and safety. The methodology focuses on two key relations: Regulations (CPR) and Chemically Induced Diseases (CID). Extracting semantic triples involves identifying entities of interest and building a classifier for relation extraction, with a focus on increasing the learning algorithm's capacity while ensuring an adequate training dataset size. The methodology proposed focuses on relation extraction in biomedical abstracts, specifically targeting Regulations (CPR) and Chemically Induced Diseases (CID). To address the labor-intensive task of annotating training datasets, a new methodology based on weak supervision is introduced. This approach combines ideas from semi-supervised and ensemble learning, training multiple base learners on a small labeled dataset to predict labels for a larger unlabeled dataset. A denoiser is then used to derive weak labels for the unlabeled set, followed by training a strong meta-learner using weak supervision. This methodology is detailed and can be adapted to various supervised learning tasks.

It introduces a new methodology based on weak supervision, combining ideas from semi-supervised and ensemble learning. The approach involves training multiple base learners on a small labeled dataset to predict labels for a larger unlabeled dataset, using a denoiser to derive weak labels for the unlabeled set, and finally training a strong meta-learner using weak supervision. The methodology is detailed and can be adapted to various supervised learning tasks. The methodology focuses on relation extraction in biomedical text using semi-supervised and ensemble learning methods. It discusses different approaches such as fully-supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised methods like Open Information Extraction. Bootstrapping algorithms like DIRPE and Snowball are mentioned, along with the use of contextual data augmentation. The methodology aims to avoid excessive manual annotation by combining learning algorithms. Recent approaches in biomedical relation extraction focus on bootstrapping new data without excessive manual annotation. Distant supervision uses Knowledge Bases to generate weak labels for unlabeled data, proving beneficial on large-scale datasets. Our work complements distant supervision by incorporating weak classifiers. BioCreative competitions have motivated much of the research in this area, with a focus on extracting Chemically-induced Diseases at a document-level. Recent research in biomedical relation extraction has been influenced by BioCreative competitions, particularly focusing on extracting Chemically-induced Diseases at both document and sentence levels. Teams have utilized ensemble methods with Support Vector Machines, LSTM, CNN, and SVMs to improve performance due to the lack of training data in this domain. The importance of ensemble methods for improving generalization in Machine Learning models, especially when Deep Neural Networks are used, is highlighted. The combination of ensemble learning with semi-supervised learning has not been thoroughly studied, despite indications of its potential benefits. Ensemble learning can enhance semi-supervised learning by providing multiple views and improving performance with less data. Co-training was the first system to combine distinct learning algorithms using unlabeled data, but recent research shows independence is not always necessary for success. Expert-defined lexicons and natural language processing systems are now used to create noisy annotations for improved performance. Recent research has shown that complete independence is not always necessary for success in semi-supervised learning. Expert-defined lexicons and natural language processing systems are now used to create noisy annotations and improve performance without manually labeled data. Tri-training and Co-forest are extensions of co-training that involve multiple learners to enhance the learning process. Co-forest BID18 is an extension to multiple learners, where an ensemble system decides whether to re-train using unlabeled examples. The base learners in the ensemble system are only used to generate weak labels, not for final predictions. This approach allows for the use of all unlabeled data, unlike previous methods that only re-trained with a few high-confidence examples. Additionally, weak supervision and data programming have influenced this methodology, which complements research on learning language representations for specific machine learning tasks. Weak supervision and data programming have heavily influenced the development of the methodology. Weak supervision involves training models using labels of questionable quality, while data programming focuses on creating training sets when no ground-truth labels are available. The process involves defining weak supervision sources, encoding them into Labeling Functions, applying them to unlabeled data points, and denoising to derive weak labels. Weak supervision involves using various sources to provide training labels, such as textual patterns or crowd-workers. The process includes applying Labeling Functions to unlabeled data points to create a vote matrix, denoising to derive weak labels using a Generative Model, and training a noise-aware discriminative model. The methodology proposed involves using data programming to maximize the likelihood of observed votes under a Generative Model, generating probabilistic weak labels, and training a noise-aware discriminative model. This approach aims to leverage semi-supervised learning by augmenting a gold-labeled training set with additional lower quality data to scale the dataset size. The methodology involves augmenting a gold-labeled training set with lower quality data to scale the dataset size. Machine learning models of lower complexity are used as weak supervision sources, adapting an already implemented pipeline with little effort. The approach requires a labeled training set, an unlabeled dataset drawn from the same distribution, a validation set for hyperparameter tuning, and a test set for evaluation. Multiple base learners are trained on the task, maximizing individual performance while capturing different views of the data through varying hyperparameters and design choices. The methodology involves using a validation set for hyperparameter tuning and a test set for evaluation. 162 base learners are trained with varying hyperparameters and design choices to capture different views of the data. Important design choices include sentence pruning and sequential features. In this work, the methodology involves using different approaches for feature engineering and machine learning algorithms. This includes constructing dependency-based parse trees, using sequential features like tri-grams, converting text to numerical representation with token occurrences or TF-IDF weights, and employing various machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest Classifiers, LSTMs, and CNNs. Subset selection of base learners is done to manage computational costs. After constructing dependency-based parse trees and using sequential features like tri-grams, various machine learning algorithms were employed including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest Classifiers, LSTMs, and CNNs. Subset selection of base learners was necessary to manage computational costs and maximize diversity in the ensemble. A performance threshold was set above random guess baseline to include less accurate but diverse classifiers, with a similarity-based clustering method used to select the most diverse classifiers. To select diverse classifiers for the ensemble, a similarity-based clustering method is used on the predictions of base learners. K-means clustering is performed on a similarity matrix to pick representative base learners. The number of clusters is determined using the silhouette score coefficient. The labels of D U are predicted using the selected base learners, and a denoiser is used to reduce the vote matrix into weak labels. The Generative Model of data programming is utilized for this process. The silhouette score coefficient is used to select diverse base learners for predicting labels of D U. A denoiser is then applied to reduce the vote matrix into weak labels. Different denoisers are considered, including Majority Vote and Average Vote denoisers. A discriminative model is used as a meta-learner, trained with weak supervision to trade label quality for quantity. High-capacity models like Deep Neural Networks are employed as meta-learners to learn their own features and improve accuracy. In experiments using Snorkel, high-capacity models like Deep Neural Networks are employed as meta-learners with weak supervision to trade label quality for quantity. The BioCreative CHEMPROT and CDR datasets are used, with training, development, and test sets. The methodology requires three gold-labeled datasets and a held-out test set, with the original test sets used for this purpose. The original training and development sets are merged and shuffled to create datasets for training base learners and validation. The methodology involves using three gold-labeled datasets and a held-out test set. The original training and development sets are merged and shuffled to create datasets for training base learners and validation. The remaining documents are treated as unlabeled data. This setup ensures no bias in document selection and all documents undergo the same pre-processing steps. The text discusses the pre-processing steps for labeled and unlabeled datasets, utilizing Named Entity Recognition algorithms and SpaCy for tasks like sentence splitting and tokenization. Snorkel is used for candidate extraction, focusing on relationships within the same sentence. The approach allows for comparison of meta-learner performance with weak supervision against optimal performance with ground-truth labels. The text discusses using Named Entity Tags for Candidate Extraction in Natural Language understanding. Snorkel is utilized for mapping candidates to ground-truth labels, with entities replaced by tokens for prediction. A bi-directional LSTM network is used with random under-sampling for class balance, exploring different hyperparameters like dropout values and training epochs. The text discusses using a bi-directional Long-Short Term Memory network for Natural Language tasks, exploring hyperparameters like dropout values and training epochs. Research questions focus on enhancing biomedical relation extraction with Machine Learning classifiers and determining the optimal setting for weak supervision. The performance of the meta-learner is expected to improve with an increase in weakly labeled data. The related literature suggests that adding weakly labeled data can enhance the performance of the meta-learner BID30 quasi-linearly. The weak supervision sources need to be accurate, diverse, and capture different 'views' of the problem to produce meaningful weak labels. It is uncertain if there is a diverse and sufficiently large set of base learners trained on the same dataset for this task. Machine Learning classifiers have not been used as weak supervision sources in this setting before. It is unclear if there is a diverse and big enough set of base learners trained on the same dataset. To evaluate weak supervision, experiments are conducted with different setups. The performance of the meta-learner is compared when trained on full-supervision, weak-supervision, and a combination of both. The optimal number of base learners is crucial, as adding more can sacrifice performance for diversity. The meta-learner uses ground-truth labels and the number of base learners is crucial. Increasing base learners can sacrifice performance for diversity. The denoising component determines the quality of weak labels used for training. Different denoising methods are assessed for their impact on training and final performance. The study investigates using supervised machine learning classifiers as weak classifiers and evaluates their effect on the meta-learner's performance. The study investigates the impact of different distributions on the training and final performance of the meta-learner. It compares the performance of weak supervision with weak labels versus full supervision, showing that training with weak labels always performs better. Training the meta-learner with weak labels (D U) and increasing the training set size by 2-2.5x outperforms training with fewer gold labels (D B). Performance is further enhanced when combining weak labels with ground-truth labels. Weak supervision can achieve comparable performance to full supervision, with some cases even showing slightly better results. However, these differences are not statistically significant due to high variance in performance. Undersampling based on weak labels can lead to a larger training set size for the final learner in weak supervision. The differences in performance between weak supervision and full supervision are minor and not statistically significant due to high variance. Undersampling based on weak labels can result in a larger training set size for the final learner. Majority Vote often outperforms the meta-learner, but this does not diminish the importance of the results. Visualizing the learning curves of the meta-learner shows an upward trend, with statistically significant results. The F1 score on the training set is consistently higher than the test score, indicating overfitting. The F1 score on the training set is consistently higher than the test score, indicating overfitting. Additional training data is needed to improve the meta-learner's performance. The F1 score of weak Majority Vote labels for 5 learners is the lowest, while the Generative model weak marginals show no significant pattern. The meta-learner's performance with Average Vote marginals improves with more than 10 base learners. The meta-learner's performance varies with different weak label distributions. Generative model marginals show improvement with more base learners, except for a few cases. Average Marginals consistently yield the best performance. GM marginals depend on hyperparameters chosen based on F1 score validation. Denoisers can produce binary or non-binary weak labels. The performance of the meta-learner varies with weak label distributions. Generative model marginals improve with more base learners, with Average Marginals consistently performing the best. Marginal weak labels outperform binary labels, with GM marginals following a U-shaped distribution. Average Vote labels are of higher quality, with misclassified labels closer to 0.5. The error analysis on the validation set shows that Average Vote labels have higher quality compared to GM marginals. Training with marginal labels results in higher training error, especially with Average weak marginals. Training a classifier with marginal labels is akin to a regression problem, where the model is penalized for not predicting the exact number. Training a classifier with marginal labels is similar to a regression problem, where the model is penalized for not predicting the exact number. The distributions of predicted logits become more spread as the training marginals become more uniform. Applying the methodology on the CPR task shows a decrease in performance with weakly labeled data, indicating a problem with the quality of the data or weak labels. There is also a predicted class imbalance on the outgoing citations dataset compared to the original dataset. The performance of the meta-learner decreases with weakly labeled data, indicating issues with data quality. A class imbalance is observed in the outgoing citations dataset compared to the original. Visualization confirms unsuitability of the new dataset for the task at hand. Weak supervision enhances complex model performance using unlabeled data and multiple base learners. Weak supervision can enhance the performance of complex models like deep neural networks by utilizing unlabeled data and multiple base learners. The methodology is feasible as long as the unlabeled data comes from the same domain as the labeled data. This approach reduces human effort in hand-labeling examples and focuses on feature engineering and diverse learner construction. Once a diverse set of learners is available, the method can scale training datasets while improving performance over supervised learning. The pipeline can be reused for similar tasks with appropriate datasets. The methodology of weak supervision can enhance deep neural network performance by utilizing unlabeled data and diverse learners. This approach reduces the need for hand-labeling large datasets and focuses on feature engineering. Once a diverse set of learners is available, the method can scale training datasets while improving performance over supervised learning. Further exploration is needed to construct a large enough unlabeled dataset to improve metalearner performance and draw stronger conclusions. Further investigation is needed to determine the optimal hyperparameters of the Generative Model and explore different approaches for the meta-learner, such as using pre-trained word embeddings or other model architectures. It is crucial to find a more suitable metric than the F1 score for evaluating weak labels, as the current lack of an appropriate metric hinders drawing direct conclusions from weak labels without additional steps. Additionally, collecting an appropriate unlabeled dataset is a challenging task, and semi-supervised algorithms should not assume the existence of such a dataset. The performance improvement with an increase in unlabeled data needs to be examined, along with identifying any performance thresholds that cannot be surpassed using weak supervision. Further investigation is needed to determine optimal hyperparameters of the Generative Model and explore different approaches for the meta-learner. Experimenting with the meta-learner using pre-trained word embeddings or other model architectures is also recommended. It would be interesting to examine how the system would behave if Base Learners abstained from voting on examples they are less certain about, potentially providing the Generative Model with a modeling advantage. This could lead to improved performance compared to unweighted methods like Majority Voting."
