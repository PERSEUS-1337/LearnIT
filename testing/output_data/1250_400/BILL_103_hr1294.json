    "content": "Designation of military installations and certain communities as enterprise zones and redevelopment areas. Designation of military installations selected for closure or realignment as enterprise zones and redevelopment areas by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and Secretary of Commerce respectively. The designated zones and areas include the local communities within the jurisdiction of the military installations. The Secretary of Commerce designates military installations for redevelopment areas within local communities. Designations must be made within 60 days of closure or realignment recommendations. The Congress disapproves military installation closures or realignments under a joint resolution. Enterprise zones designated under this Act are additional to existing zones authorized by the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987. Economic assistance for enterprise zones may be funded by the Secretary of Defense or Commerce. Review of redevelopment area designations is required. The enterprise zone under this Act can be funded from programs by the Secretary of Defense or Commerce for economic adjustment or community planning in relation to military installation closures. The designation of a military installation as a redevelopment area remains valid for 5 years, with annual reviews conducted by the Secretary of Commerce. The base closure law includes the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 and title II of the Defense Authorization. The term \"base closure law\" refers to the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 and title II of the Defense Authorization Amendments and Base Closure and Realignment Act. \"Substantial realignment\" is defined as a reduction in military installation operations where 50% or more of personnel are reassigned to another installation. Priority for commercial use of property on military installations designated as enterprise zones and redevelopment areas is emphasized. The Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act is amended to restrict the use of buildings on military installations designated as enterprise zones and redevelopment areas for homeless assistance until certain certifications are met."
