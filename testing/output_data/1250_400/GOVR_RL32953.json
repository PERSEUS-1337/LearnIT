    "content": "In 1992, the United States ratified the UNFCCC, calling for reducing greenhouse gases. Despite various proposed actions, carbon dioxide emissions have continued to rise. President George W. Bush rejected the Kyoto Protocol and mandatory emissions reductions, focusing instead on voluntary initiatives to curb greenhouse gas growth. The Administration under President George W. Bush focused on voluntary initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, as seen in the 2002 Climate Action Report. Only six out of over 50 programs were regulatory, aimed at achieving energy or environmental goals with incidental greenhouse gas reductions. Congressional proposals in the 109th Congress aimed to improve monitoring of emissions for research and development purposes. In the 109th Congress, congressional proposals aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through three tracks: monitoring emissions, enacting a market-oriented reduction program, and implementing energy programs. This report focuses on comparing two proposals from the Senate's debate on the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Senators McCain and Lieberman introduced the Climate Stewardship Act of 2005, which focused on reducing greenhouse gases. The report compares two proposals from the Senate's debate on the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Senators McCain and Lieberman introduced the Climate Stewardship Act of 2005 to reduce U.S. emissions of greenhouse gases through market-based mechanisms. S. 1151, an expanded version of S.342, includes provisions for innovation and deployment of less carbon-intensive technologies. The bill's emission reduction provisions were similar to previous amendments but were ultimately defeated in a Senate vote. S. 1151, introduced as S.Amdt. 826 during the Energy Policy Act of 2005 debate, aimed for mandatory economy-wide emission reductions through market-based strategies. The bill allowed participation in international trading systems and carbon sequestration programs to meet reduction goals, excluding residential and agricultural sources. Senator Bingaman's draft amendment, based on the NCEP report, proposed a tradeable permit program for limiting greenhouse gases, mandating accelerated reduction in greenhouse gas intensity by 2010. The Climate and Economy Insurance Act of 2005, based on the NCEP report, proposes a mandatory permit program for reducing greenhouse gases. It requires a 2.4% annual reduction in emissions per dollar of GDP from 2010 to 2019, increasing to 2.8% thereafter. Implementation involves a market-oriented allowance trading program, with a cost-limiting safety valve allowing entities to pay DOE instead of reducing emissions at $7 per ton in 2010. The draft amendment includes a cost-limiting safety valve allowing covered entities to pay DOE instead of reducing emissions at $7 per ton in 2010. It aims to reduce greenhouse gas intensity, unlike S. 1151 which places an absolute cap on emissions. Economic growth will determine if total U.S. emissions grow or decline under the draft amendment. The draft amendment includes a cost-limiting safety valve allowing covered entities to pay DOE instead of reducing emissions at $7 per ton in 2010. It aims to reduce greenhouse gas intensity, unlike S. 1151 which places an absolute cap on emissions. Economic growth will determine if total U.S. emissions grow or decline under the draft amendment. The two proposals differ in various aspects such as covered entities, primary responsibility for the program, generation of credits for early action, and utilization of proceeds from the sale/auction of allowances. The draft amendment includes a cost-limiting safety valve allowing covered entities to pay DOE instead of reducing emissions at $7 per ton in 2010. It aims to reduce greenhouse gas intensity, unlike S. 1151 which places an absolute cap on emissions. The two proposals differ in various aspects such as covered entities, primary responsibility for the program, generation of credits for early action, and utilization of proceeds from the sale/auction of allowances. Emission reduction estimates under both options involve uncertainty, with S. 1151 projected to achieve a 6.7% reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions in 2010, while the draft amendment is estimated to result in a 2.5% reduction. The draft amendment aims to reduce greenhouse gas intensity with a safety valve allowing entities to pay instead of reducing emissions. Emission reductions may be slower than business-as-usual, with potential for emissions to rise faster in the long term compared to S. 1151. The draft amendment aims to reduce greenhouse gas intensity by allowing entities to pay instead of reducing emissions. Emissions could potentially rise faster under the draft amendment compared to S. 1151. The draft amendment aims to reduce greenhouse gas intensity by allowing entities to pay instead of reducing emissions. Estimates for emission reductions under the draft amendment are more uncertain compared to S. 1151 due to varying assumptions on the number of covered entities. The draft amendment proposes emission reductions based on GDP growth and carbon intensity improvement projections, leading to uncertainties in achieving reductions. Economic growth assumptions range from 2.5% to 3.6% annually, with a reference case of 3.1%. Carbon intensity improvement projections are also uncertain, impacting the estimated emissions baseline. The draft amendment proposes emission reductions based on GDP growth and uncertain carbon intensity improvement projections. The estimated emissions baseline could be off by 20% or more, with potential coverage gaps in entities not included. The safety valve for emissions reductions remains uncertain. The draft amendment proposes emission reductions based on GDP growth and uncertain carbon intensity improvement projections. The estimated emissions baseline could be off by 20% or more, with potential coverage gaps in entities not included. The safety valve for emissions reductions remains uncertain, with conflicting projections on when it would be triggered. The projected cost under the draft amendment is more uncertain than under S. 1151, with future growth in greenhouse gas emissions adding to the uncertainty. The uncertainty surrounding future growth in greenhouse gas emissions by covered entities under S. 1151 is a major concern. The firm cap on emissions based on the year 2000 means any increased emissions from economic growth would need to be offset. The more robust the economic growth, the higher the potential for emissions that would need to be offset, leading to higher costs for emission reductions. Cost estimates for S. 1151 are affected by uncertainties related to permit prices and various factors like energy efficiency improvements, non-CO2 greenhouse gas reductions, carbon sequestration, and natural gas supply. The cost estimates for S. 1151 are sensitive to factors like energy efficiency improvements, non-CO2 greenhouse gas reductions, carbon sequestration, and natural gas supply. A market-based allowance trading system could increase projected costs by restricting options. The draft amendment's cost estimates are less sensitive and incorporate economic growth into emissions limitations, resulting in lower costs compared to S. 1151. The draft amendment incorporates economic growth into emissions limitations, allowing for some increase in future emissions if economic growth exceeds the mandated improvement in greenhouse gas intensity. It requires fewer offsets, leading to lower costs compared to S. 1151. The projected cost is influenced by cost-effective control measures and does not include international credits like S. 1151. The safety valve limits the potential cost to $7 per ton. The draft amendment proposes a permit price of $5 a ton in 2010, with a safety valve limiting the cost to $7 per ton. The safety valve aims to control costs while allowing for economic growth. Market-based mechanisms focus on emissions levels or compliance costs to find efficient solutions. Market-based mechanisms for reducing CO2 emissions focus on setting acceptable emissions levels or compliance costs, allowing the marketplace to determine the economically efficient solution. A tradeable permit program sets emissions caps while letting the market determine permit values. A carbon tax or safety valve sets maximum costs for reducing emissions, with the marketplace determining actual reductions. The preference for a tradeable permit system or safety valve depends on views of cost uncertainty and benefits. A tradeable permit program allows for efficient handling of CO2 emissions reduction by concentrating efforts at least cost sources. Including a safety valve caps the cost of control, but the level of CO2 reduction achieved is less certain. Emitters would spend money controlling emissions up to the safety valve level. The safety valve in the draft amendment acts as a contingent carbon tax, capping the cost of control for CO2 emissions. It raises a policy question of prioritizing economic cost or achieving specific emission reduction levels efficiently. S. 1151 focuses on total emissions, while the draft amendment leans towards price control. Both proposals aim to establish market-based systems to limit emissions. S. 1151 and the draft amendment propose market-based systems to limit greenhouse gas emissions, but differ in approach. S. 1151 sets an absolute cap on emissions with larger reductions, while the draft amendment limits emissions intensity with a cost-limiting safety valve. Both aim to reduce short-term U.S. emissions below business-as-usual levels, but total U.S. emissions are expected to continue rising, albeit at a slower rate."
