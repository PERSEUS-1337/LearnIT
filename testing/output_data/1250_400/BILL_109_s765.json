    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Math and Science Incentive Act of 2005\". Congress finds the United States needs a robust scientific and technical enterprise, more scientists and engineers, improved education in science and mathematics, and a recommitment to leadership in these fields. The country is lagging behind internationally and must invest in research and development to stay competitive, especially in areas like nanotechnology. Loan forgiveness programs are proposed to attract talent. The United States needs to recommit to leadership in science, mathematics, and engineering, with a focus on nanotechnology advancements. A loan forgiveness program is suggested to attract students to careers in these fields and maintain technological leadership. Establishment of program for loan forgiveness to attract students to careers in science, mathematics, and engineering, with a focus on nanotechnology advancements. The Secretary will implement a program to cover interest payments on loans for eligible borrowers who are teachers of STEM subjects or professionals in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics. The program covers interest payments on loans for eligible borrowers who are teachers of STEM subjects or professionals in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics. Participants must complete 5 consecutive years of service in a qualifying position.
