    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Tar Creek Restoration Act\". It includes findings related to the restoration project. The Tar Creek Superfund Site in Oklahoma was a lead and zinc mining area that operated from the early 1900s to the 1970s. Mining activities on Indian land produced significant amounts of waste tailings. During World War I, the site supplied a large portion of the nation's lead and zinc needs. During World War I and II, mining at the Tar Creek Superfund Site accounted for a significant portion of the nation's lead and zinc supply. The Department of the Interior recommended stockpiling waste tailings aboveground for later reprocessing. In the 1970s, as mining declined, underground mine workings began to fill with water, leading to the creation of acid mine water discharge in 1979. The underground mine workings at the Tar Creek Superfund Site began refilling with water from the Boone Aquifer, leading to the creation of acid mine water discharge in 1979. The Environmental Protection Agency started remediation efforts in 1984 but concluded in 1994 that it was essentially impossible to fully remediate the acid mine water due to the presence of numerous open mine shafts and boreholes at the site. Millions of tons of chat scar the surface area of the site. The Tar Creek Superfund Site has over 1,300 open mine shafts and 100,000 boreholes, contributing to recharge of underground mine workings. Millions of tons of chat, laced with toxic heavy metals like lead, scar the surface area. Stockpiled chat also causes flood problems and contaminates residential areas with heavy metals. The Environmental Protection Agency started remediation efforts in 1994 to address unsafe lead levels in residential yards. The use of chat in construction has contaminated residential areas with heavy metals, including lead. Scientific studies show elevated blood lead levels in children at the Site, which can cause learning disabilities and other health problems. Dust from stockpiled chat poses a danger to human health. Underground cavities from mining have led to repeated cave-ins, some over 100 feet in diameter, occurring in populated areas and near schools. No government agency has remediated the stockpiled chat. Repeated cave-ins, some over 100 feet in diameter, have occurred at the Site in populated areas and near schools. No government agency has taken action to address the dangers posed by the stockpiled chat or subsidence issues. Comprehensive epidemiological studies of the Site have not been conducted, and due to its unique environmental problems, the Site can never be safe for human habitation. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency will provide assistance to residents in the Tar Creek Superfund site in Oklahoma. The EPA will work towards a comprehensive resolution for the environmental and health issues in the area."
