    "content": "Under the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, the President can propose rescinding funding from appropriations acts by sending a special message to Congress. If Congress does not approve within 45 days, the funding must be made available for agencies to use. President George W. Bush advocated for a line-item veto similar to what he had as Governor of Texas. A bill called the Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006 was sent to Congress, aiming to expedite rescissions by requiring at least one house to vote on the proposals. The Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006 (LLIVA) was transmitted to Congress on March 6, 2006, proposing expedited rescission requiring at least one house to vote on presidential recommendations for spending reductions. Enhanced rescission, available under the Line Item Veto Act of 1996, favored the President by making spending reductions permanent unless Congress enacted a disapproval bill. The expedited rescission process allows for quick approval of the President's spending reduction proposals, requiring congressional approval but with fast-track procedures. This approach is seen as transferring less power from Congress to the President compared to other methods. In the past, the House has passed expedited rescission bills to facilitate the process. In 1992, 1993, and 1994, the House passed expedited rescission bills to allow the President to propose spending cuts quickly. The bills included provisions for fast-track procedures and limitations on the amount that could be rescinded. H.R. 1578 and H.R. 4600 were expedited rescission bills passed by the House in 1994. They included fast-track procedures for considering a substitute for the President's package and allowing special messages proposing spending cuts or repealing targeted tax benefits. H.R. 4600, introduced in 1994, authorized special messages from the President proposing spending cuts or repealing targeted tax benefits. A draft expedited rescission bill, titled the Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006, was introduced in March 2006, proposing additional rescission authority for the President. The Legislative Line Item Veto Act (LLIVA) would authorize the President to propose rescissions of discretionary budget authority, direct spending items, or targeted tax benefits in a special message to Congress. The President would have flexibility in submitting these messages, with no time constraints and the ability to include multiple rescissions in one message. Any amounts rescinded must be used for deficit reduction, and adjustments to committee allocations and spending caps would be required within five days of enactment of a rescission approval bill. The rescission approval bill would require adjustments to committee allocations and spending caps within five days of enactment. Rescission requests from the President would be fast-tracked, with a strict timeline for introduction, committee review, and final passage. Debate would be limited, and no amendments would be allowed in either chamber. The LLIVA bill would expedite the process for the President to withhold budget authority or suspend spending for up to 180 days. This provision is unique to expedited rescission bills and aims to allow temporary withholding until Congress can review the President's requests. The LLIVA bill includes provisions for the President to withhold funds or suspend spending for up to 180 days. Supporters argue it allows temporary action until Congress can review the President's requests, while critics see it as potentially enabling policy deferrals with a one-house veto. Critics argue that the 180-day withholding mechanism in the LLIVA bill could potentially enable policy deferrals with a one-house veto, which was invalidated by previous court decisions. Supporters stress that the President can release funds earlier if deemed necessary, but there is no requirement for early release even if one chamber rejects the approval bill. The LLIVA bill states that its provisions are severable, meaning that if any part is found unconstitutional, the rest would still be in effect. The LLIVA bill provisions are severable, allowing for judicial review if found unconstitutional. It would be effective upon signing and only apply to spending or tax provisions in bills enacted after its passage. Other measures with expedited rescission provisions have been introduced in the 109th Congress, including H.R. 2290 for enhanced consideration of proposed rescissions by the President. Provisions in H.R. 2290 allow the President to propose rescissions of \"wasteful\" budget authority in appropriations acts. The President can also suggest reducing discretionary spending limits. Representative Mark Udall introduced H.R. 4699 for expedited rescission in the 109th Congress. In the 109th Congress, Representative Mark Udall introduced H.R. 4699, also known as the \"Stimulating Leadership in Cutting Expenditures Act (or SLICE Act) of 2006,\" which enables the President to propose budget cuts for Congress to debate and vote on. The bill includes provisions for special messages and expedited procedures for rescinding budget authority provided in appropriations acts or the Omnibus Transportation Authorization Act. Senator John Kerry also introduced S. 2372, the Expedited Budget Item Veto. Senator John Kerry introduced S. 2372, the Expedited Budget Item Veto Review Act of 2006, which is similar to the Line Item Veto Act of 1996. This bill would allow the President to propose cancelling discretionary budget authority, new direct spending items, and limited tax benefits. The President would need to submit a special message proposing cancellations and a draft bill for each item within three days of the law's enactment. Expedited procedures would ensure a vote on an approval bill within 10 legislative days. The omnibus reform bill introduced by Representative John Spratt, H.R. 5667, includes provisions for a legislative line item veto allowing the President to propose canceling discretionary spending and limited tax benefits. The bill features expedited procedures for congressional consideration and would allow one special message per bill. The omnibus reform bill, H.R. 5667, includes a legislative line item veto allowing the President to propose canceling discretionary spending and limited tax benefits. The bill also features expedited procedures for congressional consideration and allows one special message per bill. On June 22, the House approved H.R. 4890 by a vote of 247-172. Senator Judd Gregg introduced the Stop Over Spending Act on June 14, containing a modified version of the Legislative Line Item Veto Act. The Senate Budget Committee voted 12-10 to report the bill favorably on June 20. Noteworthy differences exist among the versions of the expedited rescission bills. The House-approved version of H.R. 4890 and the Senate Budget Committee's version of S. 3521 have differences in the deadline for submission of special rescission messages and the limit on the number of messages allowed. The House version requires submission within 45 days of enactment, while the Senate version allows up to one year. The Senate version limits the President to four messages per year, while the House version allows five messages per act or 10 for omnibus measures. The House version is more permissive in these aspects. The House-passed version of the bill allows for more special messages to be submitted compared to the Senate version. The House version also allows for a longer period of withholding funds after submission of a special message. Additionally, the House version includes a sunset termination date for the expedited rescission authority, while the Senate version does not. The House-passed version of the bill allows the President a 45-day extension for withholding funds, totaling up to 90 days. The expedited rescission authority would expire after six years in the House version and after four years in the Senate version. Both versions narrow the range of targeted tax benefits compared to the Administration's proposal. The House version applies to revenue-losing provisions affecting a single beneficiary, while the Senate version defines targeted tax benefits as affecting a particular or limited group of taxpayers. The House-passed version of H.R. 4890 and S. 3521 narrow the range of targeted tax benefits compared to the Administration's proposal. The Senate version defines targeted tax benefits as affecting a particular or limited group of taxpayers, placing its scope between the Administration's proposal and the House-passed version. The House version would repeal the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, except for certain sections. The House-passed version of H.R. 4890 and S. 3521 would repeal the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, except for specific sections related to deferral authority and suits by the Comptroller General. The bills aim to amend Title X of the ICA by removing the Line Item Veto Act of 1996 and introducing new text for expedited rescissions. A manager's amendment was added to clarify that any cancelled funds from trust or special funds would be returned. The House-passed version of H.R. 4890 and S. 3521 would repeal the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, except for specific sections related to deferral authority and suits by the Comptroller General. A manager's amendment clarified that cancelled funds from trust or special funds would be returned to their original fund. The amendment to S. 3521 prohibits the President from resubmitting rejected direct spending or targeted tax benefits, but allows resubmission of proposed cancellations if Congress fails to act. The bill would prohibit the President from resubmitting rejected direct spending or targeted tax benefits, but allows resubmission of proposed cancellations if Congress fails to act. It also proposes to reduce the period for suspending new spending or tax benefits. Various versions of expedited rescission bills in Congress aim for a vote within 10 days of introduction. In the early 1990s, bills included provisions for considering substitute rescission packages or striking specific rescissions from approval bills. The expedited rescission bills aim for a quick vote on proposed cancellations within 10 days of introduction. Earlier bills had provisions for substitute rescission packages or striking specific rescissions. The current bill, H.R. 4699, expands the scope to include transportation projects for possible cancellations by the President. H.R. 4699 expands the President's authority to cancel transportation projects and discretionary budget authority. The Line Item Veto Act of 1996 had possible constitutional flaws, but the expedited rescission approach is seen as constitutionally sound. The LLIVA includes a severability provision to protect the act if any part is found unconstitutional. The Line Item Veto Act of 2006 expands the President's authority to cancel targeted tax benefits and submit special rescission messages for expedited consideration. The Bush Administration is seeking enactment of the LLIVA in the 109th Congress, with the President calling for quick passage to target pork in large spending bills and enhance fiscal discipline."
