    "content": "The changing structure of U.S. agriculture has raised concerns about reduced competition in various agricultural markets, including dairy. The dairy industry faces issues of consolidation and industry concentration. Public workshops were announced by the Administration in 2009 to address competition problems in agriculture. A workshop on the dairy industry is scheduled for June 25, 2010, in Madison, WI. This report provides background on the U.S. dairy industry structure, financial stress for dairy farmers, historical development, farm and retail prices for dairy products, and industry consolidation and concentration at different market levels. The financial stress in the dairy industry in 2009 led to federal support programs for dairy farmers, including over $1 billion in government spending. Despite this assistance, the number of U.S. dairy farms decreased by 3% to 65,000 farms by December 2009. In response to financial stress in the dairy industry in 2009, Congress granted $350 million in financial assistance to dairy farmers. Despite this support, the number of U.S. dairy farms declined by 3% to 65,000 farms by December 2009. The decrease in dairy cows led to a decline in milk production, but increased foreign demand for dairy products raised average farm milk prices to $15.10 per hundredweight in March 2010. Dairy farmers continue to face financial concerns due to lost farm equity and high feed prices. The dairy industry faced financial stress in 2009, leading to a decline in dairy farms and milk production. Despite government assistance, dairy farmers continue to struggle with high feed prices and fluctuations in milk prices. The industry has evolved over the years, with a focus on national markets and government intervention. The Obama Administration and Congress are examining consolidation and concentration issues in the dairy industry. Advancements in milk marketing, including efficient transportation over long distances, shaped by government intervention. Dairy farmers formed cooperatives in the early 1900s to negotiate with milk handlers. The Capper-Volstead Act of 1922 provided limited antitrust exemption to farmer cooperatives. Classified pricing for milk based on its use (fluid or manufactured products) was established by 1925 and is still in use today. During the Great Depression, the classified pricing system for milk broke down, leading to the establishment of Federal milk marketing orders (FMMOs) to stabilize the market. FMMOs aimed to equalize the market power between dairy farmers and processors, ensure adequate milk supply for consumers at reasonable prices, and protect against foreign competition through import quotas. The government also began supporting milk prices in the late 1940s to prevent price declines. Advancements in milk marketing have significantly changed the U.S. dairy industry over the last century. In the early 20th century, raw milk was transported to processing plants by truck or rail, with distances ranging from local markets to large cities like New York, Boston, and Chicago. Various dairy programs, such as the Dairy Product Price Support Program, Dairy Export Incentives Program, and Milk Income Loss Contract, have been implemented to support milk prices and protect against price declines. Advancements in milk marketing have transformed the U.S. dairy industry over the past century. Raw milk was initially transported short distances by truck or rail to processing plants, with milk primarily bottled for home delivery. However, improved roadways and larger tanker trucks in the second half of the 20th century facilitated the transition to a national milk market. Retail milk sales shifted to stores, with bulk milk now being transported thousands of miles by truck to meet market demands. Advancements in milk marketing, such as improved roadways and larger tanker trucks, have revolutionized the U.S. dairy industry. Retail milk sales have transitioned to stores, with bulk milk now being transported long distances to meet market demands. The relationship between farm and retail prices has been a long-standing issue, with a declining farm share of the retail food dollar in recent decades. The farm share of the retail food dollar has decreased in recent decades across the agricultural sector, including for dairy farmers. In 1950, the farm share was 41%, but by 2006, it had dropped to 18.5%. Factors contributing to this decline include increased agricultural productivity, demand for value-added products, and changes in food marketing. Milk and dairy products have a farm share of approximately one-third of the retail dollar, higher than the all-food average. The farm share of the retail food dollar has decreased over the years, with milk and dairy products accounting for approximately one-third of the retail dollar. Factors contributing to this decline include various marketing factors such as labor, packaging, profit, transportation, and energy. The farm share trend for milk and dairy products remained generally flat between 2000 and 2008, with a slight uptrend for cheddar cheese. In 2008 and early 2009, there was a decline in the farm-value share of retail product values, leading to a widening of the marketing margin. Between July 2008 and December 2008, the farm price of milk fell by $0.33 per gallon, while the retail price only fell by $0.28, resulting in a marketing margin increase to $2.35 per gallon. In January 2009, the difference between retail and farm prices reached a record-high of $2.43 per gallon. Throughout 2009, retailers reduced prices due to lower farm milk costs, leading to a decline in the price difference to $1.69 per gallon in December. The price spread returned to the five-year average level in early 2010. Time lags in retail price response to farm price changes are generally months in length, even for perishables like milk. In 2010, farm prices weakened slightly and the price spread returned to the five-year average level. Retail prices respond slowly to farm price changes, with adjustments to higher farm prices happening faster than adjustments to decreases. Consumer behavior and store strategies can limit retail price adjustments to downward farm price movements, but this does not necessarily indicate excessive market power by retailers. Supermarket competition can also impact retail prices. Consolidation in agriculture, including the dairy sector, has led to fewer but larger operations, resulting in lower costs and increased competitiveness. Retail prices may not fully adjust to downward farm price movements due to consumer behavior and store strategies. Supermarket competition can attract less price-sensitive consumers, leading to higher prices for products like milk. This can create a disconnect between farm and retail prices for agricultural products. Consolidation in the dairy industry has led to fewer and larger operations, resulting in lower costs and increased competitiveness. The number of dairy farms has decreased due to firms becoming more competitive and increasing market share. Concentration in the industry has increased over time, with most segments becoming more consolidated. Advances in technology have also led to a reduction in the number of dairy farms. The dairy industry has become more concentrated over time, with a sharp reduction in the number of dairy farms due to increased cow output and advances in technology. Despite a slow growth in domestic demand for milk, total milk production has steadily increased. Exports of dairy products have also risen, reaching record levels in 2008. Domestic demand for milk products has grown slowly at 0.4% per year since 1990, with cheese consumption offsetting a decline in fluid milk consumption. Dairy exports have increased, reaching record levels in 2008. Farm numbers have shifted, with smaller farms declining and larger farms increasing due to lower production costs. In 2009, farms with 1,000 cows or more produced 47% of U.S. milk output. In 2009, the largest portion of U.S. milk output (47%) was produced on farms with 1,000 head or more, while small farms (fewer than 100 head) accounted for only 16% of the total. Larger dairy farms benefit from scale economies, modern facilities, and automated systems, leading to lower production costs. Farm sizes vary by region, with western states having larger farms compared to states like Wisconsin. The structure of dairy farms varies by region, with large farms in western states like California and smaller farms in Wisconsin. Operating costs are affected by feed prices, with larger farms in the west facing higher costs due to purchasing feed. Farmer-owned dairy cooperatives manage milk distribution systems for the benefit of members. Costs are lower when grain and feed prices rise for dairy farms with fewer cows, leading to higher per-unit overhead costs. Farmer-owned dairy cooperatives manage milk distribution systems, procuring raw milk, coordinating product movements, and managing surplus milk. The number of dairy cooperatives has decreased since the 1940s, with consolidations and alliances leading to 155 cooperatives in 2007, accounting for 83% of farm milk marketings. The number of dairy cooperatives has decreased over time, with 155 cooperatives in 2007 accounting for 83% of farm milk marketings. Consolidations and alliances have enabled cooperatives to serve large retail customers efficiently. In 2008, the top four cooperatives accounted for 40% of U.S. milk production. The top four dairy firms in the U.S. - America, California Dairies, Land O'Lakes, and Northwest Dairy Association - make up 40% of milk production. The National Milk Producers Federation supports the Capper-Volstead Act for cooperative action by farmers. Dairy cooperatives help farmers in bargaining with milk handlers and influencing federal milk marketing orders. Some producers believe cooperatives may not always act in their best interests. The dairy processing industry faces challenges like changing demand for dairy products. The dairy processing industry in the United States has been impacted by changes in demand, technological advancements, and shifts in the retail sector. Despite a decline in the number of dairy firms, the number of manufacturing plants has stabilized around 1,100 facilities. The largest dairy processor/manufacturing companies operate between 9 to 81 plants, showing concentration trends similar to other food processing sectors. The dairy processing industry in the United States has around 1,100 facilities, with the largest companies operating between 9 to 81 plants. Concentration trends in the industry are comparable to other food processing sectors, with the four-firm concentration ratio for cheese processing at 35% and for fluid milk processing at 43%. While industry concentration is not unusually high nationally, local or regional markets can be more concentrated, raising concerns for farmers and policymakers. Industry concentration in the fluid milk industry has recently increased due to a merger between Suiza, Inc., and Dean Foods in 2001. The level of industry concentration in the fluid milk industry has increased following a merger in 2001 between Suiza, Inc., and Dean Foods. The retail sector for food products has seen changes with competition from nontraditional retailers, leading to consolidation in the U.S. grocery retailing industry. Top four firms accounted for 17% of national sales in the early 1990s, increasing to 17% by 2005. Changes in retail sector strategies and competitive pressures have led to consolidation in the U.S. grocery retailing industry. The top four firms accounted for 17% of national sales in the early 1990s, increasing to 36% by 2005 due to acquisitions and mergers. Local-level concentration in the retail food sector is typically higher than at the national level, with four-firm concentration shares averaging 74% in specific market areas in 2003. In 2003, market shares in specific areas averaged 74%, with four-firm shares ranging from 63% to 85%. Retail consolidation has led to larger dairy processors and manufacturers. Concerns about market power and reduced competition exist due to concentration in the food retail sector. The concentration of food retailers may reduce competition but could also lead to efficiency gains and lower retail prices for consumers. Research findings by the Government Accountability Office suggest that concentration in the beef, pork, dairy, and retail sectors has not adversely affected agricultural commodity or food prices. Experts predict that concentration is likely to increase in the future. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reviewed studies on the impact of concentration in the retail sector on agricultural commodity and food prices. Most studies found no evidence of market power, with efficiency effects outweighing market power effects. However, experts predict increased concentration in the future, raising concerns about market power and price manipulation. Concentration in dairy processing was found to have little impact on prices, with efficiency benefits often outweighing market power effects. Dairy cooperatives were noted to offset market power of dairy processors. The report highlighted that efficiency benefits in the dairy industry outweigh market power effects, with dairy cooperatives offsetting the power of processors. Studies on regional milk markets showed evidence of market power, such as noncompetitive behavior in some metropolitan areas. Experts predict increased concentration in the retail sector, leading to fewer outlets and potential pressure on food processors to consolidate. This could result in further concentration at the food processor level. Some experts believe that large retail firms are pressuring food processors to consolidate, leading to fewer retail outlets. Concerns arise about how this concentration affects price transparency in dairy markets, with fewer transactions impacting market efficiency. The move towards a more integrated dairy market results in fewer trades on the spot market, reducing the visibility of current prices. The dairy industry is shifting towards a more integrated market with closer ties between market players, leading to fewer trades on the spot market. The primary spot market for dairy is at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), where prices are determined for products like cheese, butter, and nonfat dry milk. Some believe the CME is an inadequate pricing mechanism due to thin trading, lack of transparency, and market volatility. The USDA uses wholesale dairy prices to set monthly minimum prices for farm milk under federal orders. Some dairy producer groups criticize the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) as an inadequate pricing mechanism due to thin trading, lack of transparency, and market volatility. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) identified the CME spot cheese market as susceptible to manipulation due to a small number of trades and traders. However, industry participants are prepared to counteract any manipulation by monitoring the market closely. There are calls for increased sales volume on the CME to reduce the risk of price manipulation. Some industry participants are prepared to counteract price manipulation on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) by monitoring trading activities closely. In the past, dairy industry participants faced penalties for attempting to manipulate milk futures prices. The CME has introduced new futures and options contracts for skimmed milk powder to manage international dairy risks. Producers and policymakers are interested in enhancing dairy price transparency by expanding the USDA's mandatory price reporting system. The international dairy industry uses milk powder as a risk management tool with six delivery points. Producers and policymakers aim to improve dairy price transparency by expanding USDA's price reporting system. U.S. antitrust laws focus on market competition and prohibit unlawful mergers and business practices. The Sherman Act and Clayton Act are the two main antitrust laws enforced by the DOJ or FTC, allowing private individuals to claim economic injury from violations. The Sherman Act and Clayton Act are key antitrust laws in the United States enforced by the DOJ or FTC. They prohibit anti-competitive behavior such as price fixing and monopolization. Violations can result in fines or imprisonment. The Clayton Act specifically targets mergers that may lessen competition. The Clayton Act prohibits mergers that may lessen competition, with potential fines or imprisonment for violations. It also allows for premerger notification and remedies such as legal action or conditioning approval on modifications to address antitrust concerns. The \"Merger Guidelines\" issued by DOJ and FTC are being updated to reflect current practices. The premerger remedies DOJ/FTC might seek for a proposed merger include legal action to stop the merger or conditioning approval on modifications to address antitrust concerns. The Capper-Volstead Act provides an exemption for farmer cooperatives from antitrust liability for joint processing and marketing of agricultural products. In April 2009, Dean Foods purchased two plants owned by Foremost Farms, a cooperative in Wisconsin. The Department of Justice filed a civil antitrust suit against Dean Foods, alleging that the purchase violated the Clayton Act by lessening competition in the market for selling milk to schools and supplying fluid milk to grocery chains in Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin. The Department of Justice filed a civil antitrust suit against Dean Foods for purchasing two plants from Foremost Farms, which lessened competition in the market for selling milk to schools and supplying fluid milk to grocery chains in Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin. DOJ claims the acquisition eliminated competition between Dean and Foremost, hurting school milk and fluid milk purchases. The lawsuit seeks to require Dean Foods to sell the acquired dairy processing plants. Dean Foods believes the acquisition complies with antitrust laws and benefits dairy farmers. Dean Foods acquired plants from Foremost Farms, giving them a 57% market share for processed milk in northeastern Illinois, Wisconsin, and upper Michigan. The acquisition is under scrutiny by the DOJ for potential antitrust violations. The case highlights consolidation in the dairy industry and its impact on competition. A class action antitrust complaint was also filed against major firms in the Northeast dairy market. On October 8, 2009, a class action antitrust complaint was filed against four major firms in the Northeast dairy market in the U.S. District Court for Vermont on behalf of Northeast dairy farmers. The lawsuit alleges that the defendants, including Dairy Farmers of America, Inc., Dairy Marketing Services, Dean Foods, and HP Hood, conspired to control the supply of fluid milk in the region, leading to lower prices for farmers. The lawsuit focuses on the lack of competition in a milk marketing system once dominated by family-owned processors and cooperatives. Dairy producers are now required to affiliate with either DFA or DMS due to exclusive supply agreements with Dean Foods and HP Hood. The lawsuit alleges that dairy farmers in the Northeast must affiliate with either DFA or DMS due to exclusive supply agreements with Dean Foods and HP Hood, leading to lower prices for farmers. The defendants are accused of using their market power to the detriment of independent producers and cooperatives. DFA claims to increase returns for dairy farmers through cost-saving efficiencies. Another ongoing case involves class action lawsuits in the southeastern United States against Dean Foods, National Dairy Holdings, and DFA. The net effect of concentration on farmer prices is still being determined. The ongoing litigation involving multiple class action lawsuits in the southeastern United States against Dean Foods, National Dairy Holdings, and DFA may take years to resolve. Determining the net effect of concentration on the dairy industry is complex due to various factors influencing market power and efficiency gains. Economic events and government policies can also impact commodity prices, making it challenging to pinpoint the effects of concentration."
