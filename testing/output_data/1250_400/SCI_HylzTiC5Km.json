It addresses challenges in encoding vast context and preserving global coherence and detail exactness. SPN generates images as a sequence of slices, using multidimensional upscaling to grow images in size and depth. State-of-the-art likelihood results are achieved in generating CelebAHQ and ImageNet images of various sizes. The Subscale Pixel Network (SPN) proposes using multidimensional upscaling to grow images in size and depth through intermediate stages corresponding to distinct SPNs. It achieves state-of-the-art likelihood results in generating CelebAHQ and ImageNet images of different sizes. Autoregressive models have excelled in producing high-fidelity samples across various domains, but struggle with long-range structure and semantic coherence in large-scale image generation. The relationship between maximum likelihood estimation scores and sample fidelity poses challenges in achieving visual quality. The challenges in high-fidelity image generation include the complex relationship between MLE scores and sample fidelity, as well as the high dimensionality of large images requiring significant memory and computation. The challenges in high-fidelity image generation include the complex relationship between MLE scores and sample fidelity, as well as the high dimensionality of large images requiring significant memory and computation. To address these challenges, the goal is to learn the full distribution over 8-bit RGB images of size up to 256 \u00d7 256 with a focus on visually salient subsets of the distribution. To guide the model in focusing on visually salient parts of the distribution, two subsets are identified: small size sub-images and significant bits of RGB channels. Multidimensional Upscaling is used to map between these subsets by upscaling images in size or depth. Three networks are trained: a decoder for small size, low depth image slices, a size-upscaling decoder, and a depth-upscaling decoder. The Subscale Pixel Network (SPN) architecture is developed to train decoders for generating large size, low depth images and large size, high depth images. The SPN divides images into sub-images and uses two networks to predict target slices based on context embedding, sharing weights for all slices. The Subscale Pixel Network (SPN) consists of a conditioning network and a decoder that predicts target slices based on context embedding. It can be used for implicit or explicit size upscaling and has shown state-of-the-art results on image generation benchmarks like CelebAHQ-256 and ImageNet. The Subscale Pixel Network (SPN) has achieved state-of-the-art results on image generation benchmarks like CelebAHQ-256 and ImageNet-64. It demonstrates strong benefits of multidimensional upscaling and produces high-quality samples at full 8-bit resolution. The SPN also sets a fidelity baseline for future methods on unconditional ImageNet-128. The PixelCNN model generates color images pixel by pixel using a deep neural network. An alternative ordering method divides large images into slices, allowing for long-range dependencies and spatial structure. This approach enables consistent application of the decoder across all slices and supports self-attention. The subscale ordering method divides large images into slices, aligning them to induce spatial structure and implicit size upscaling. This allows for consistent application of the decoder and supports self-attention in the neural architecture. The ordering is the two-dimensional analogue of the one-dimensional subscale ordering, with a scaling factor S selected to obtain interleaved slices specified by row and column offsets. The subscale ordering method divides large images into interleaved slices specified by row and column offsets. These slices are used to generate the image according to the subscale ordering by the main network. The single-slice model can act as a full-blown image model and a size upscaling model when initialized with the outputs of a single-slice decoder. The model can be trained on slices of images at all positions, capturing subscale ordering. It can act as an image model and size upscaling model. Multidimensional upscaling includes depth upscaling in stages, generating bits of the image sequentially. The model can be trained on slices of images at all positions, capturing subscale ordering. It can act as an image model and size upscaling model. Multidimensional upscaling includes depth upscaling in stages, generating bits of the image sequentially. In depth upscaling, lower significance bits are only generated after more significant bits have been generated in previous stages. The goal is to focus on visually salient bits of an image. The Subscale Pixel Network (SPN) addresses challenges in image processing by reducing memory and computational requirements while maintaining global context. Existing approaches struggle with large images due to quadratic memory requirements, but SPN captures subscale ordering and focuses on visually salient bits of an image. The Subscale Pixel Network (SPN) tackles challenges in image processing by reducing memory and computational demands while preserving global context. It utilizes a scaling factor to obtain slices of the original image, maintaining constant memory and computation requirements. The SPN architecture consists of an embedding part for preceding metapositions that conditions the decoder for the current slice being generated. The SPN architecture uses a scaling factor to obtain slices of the original image, maintaining constant memory and computation requirements. It consists of an embedding part for preceding metapositions that conditions the decoder for the current slice being generated. The slices are ordered along the channel dimension when concatenated, using empty padding slices to preserve relative meta-positions. The embedding architecture achieves equivariance with respect to the offset of a slice. Padding slices maintain input slice tensor depth. The embedding part receives meta-position and pixel intensity values as input. The decoder processes the target slice in raster-scan order using masked convolution and self-attention. Initial 1D self-attention network gathers context before inputting to masked 1D self-attention layers. The decoder uses a hybrid architecture combining masked convolution and self-attention to process the target slice in raster-scan order. An initial 1D self-attention network gathers context before inputting to masked 1D self-attention layers. The output is reshaped and concatenated with the slice embedding network for conditioning input to a Gated PixelCNN, reducing memory requirements significantly. The log-likelihood decomposes as a sum over slices. The decoder utilizes a hybrid architecture with masked convolution and self-attention to process target slices efficiently. Memory requirements are reduced significantly due to the smaller spatial size of slices and their concatenation along the channel dimension. The log-likelihood is decomposed as a sum over slices, and maximum likelihood learning is performed through stochastic gradient descent. The SPN can also serve as a size-upscaling network for images by dividing them into slices. The SPN decoder can be used to upscale the depth of image channels by dividing the image into slices. These slices are then concatenated along the channel dimension to create a conditioning image.

The network operates on small images (32x32 slices) allowing for large networks with deep layers. The context-embedding network includes convolutional and self-attention layers, while the masked decoder consists of a PixelCNN with 15 layers. The 1D Transformer in the decoder has 8-10 layers.
