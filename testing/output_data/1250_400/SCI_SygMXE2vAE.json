Our qualitative analysis of hidden state visualizations in BERT reveals insights into the system's reasoning process and its ability to incorporate task-specific information into token representations. Fine-tuning has minimal impact on semantic abilities, and prediction errors can be identified in early layers. Transformer models have gained popularity in Natural Language Processing due to their advancements over RNNs in Machine Translation.

It addresses the issue of black box models and highlights the system's reasoning process and task-specific information incorporation. Fine-tuning has minimal impact on semantic abilities, and prediction errors can be identified in early layers. Transformer models have surpassed RNNs in Machine Translation. The paper focuses on interpreting Transformer Networks, specifically BERT BID8, which has shown improvements in NLP tasks. It explores the lack of transparency in black box models and examines hidden states between encoder layers for interpretation. The study aims to determine how Transformers answer questions and if they decompose information similarly to humans. This paper takes a different approach to interpreting Transformer Networks, focusing on hidden states between encoder layers. It addresses questions about how Transformers answer questions, the tasks different layers solve, the influence of fine-tuning, and evaluating network layers to understand failures in prediction. The study uses fine-tuned models on QA datasets, highlighting the complexity of tasks like Question Answering in NLP. Preliminary tests on the GPT-2 model show similar results to BERT architecture. The paper focuses on interpreting Transformer Networks, specifically the BERT architecture, through layer-wise visualizations and NLP Probing Tasks. It shows that BERT's transformations follow similar phases across different tasks, with general language properties encoded in earlier layers and utilized in later layers for task-solving. The curr_chunk discusses the analysis of BERT's abilities and transformations, as well as mentions other Transformer models like GPT-2, Universal Transformer, and TransformerXL. It highlights how language properties are encoded in BERT's layers and utilized for downstream tasks. OpenAI has chosen not to release their pre-trained models. Other notable Transformer models include Universal Transformer BID7 and TransformerXL BID6, which aim to enhance the Transformer architecture by incorporating a recurrent inductive bias. The field of neural model interpretability and probing is growing, with research focusing on building and applying probing tasks to trained models. Recent advancements in this area include Tenney et al.'s \"edge-probing\" framework, which examines semantic and syntactic information in pre-trained models like ELMo, BERT, and GPT-1. BERT has been probed in various tasks, including semantic and syntactic analysis. Different studies have focused on probing tasks for pre-trained models like ELMo, BERT, and GPT-1. Some research also delves into analyzing BERT specifically for ranking tasks and attention values in different layers. Additionally, there are studies that use qualitative visual analysis to understand models, such as exploring phoneme recognition in DNNs and training diagnostic classifiers for analysis. In their paper, Zhang and Zhu BID41 offer a survey of different approaches limited to CNNs. Nagamine et al. BID24 explore phoneme recognition in DNNs by studying single node activations in speech recognition. Hupkes et al. BID14 conduct a qualitative analysis and train diagnostic classifiers to support their hypotheses. Li et al. BID17 examine word vectors and the importance of specific dimensions on sequence tagging and classification tasks. Liu et al. BID20 focus on probing pre-trained models like BERT, while our work is motivated by Jain and Wallace BID15, who argue that attention may not be well suited for explainability and interpretability. Our work is motivated by Jain and Wallace BID15, who argue that attention may not be well suited for explainability and interpretability. We propose evaluating hidden states and token representations instead, focusing on fine-tuned BERT models. By analyzing token vectors qualitatively and probing language abilities quantitatively, we track the transformations of each token throughout the network. This allows us to understand the changes made to the tokens' representations in every layer. The architecture of BERT and Transformer networks allows for analyzing token transformations in each layer. Hidden states are collected from correctly and falsely predicted samples for qualitative analysis. Dimensionality reduction is applied to visualize token relations in two-dimensional space. The text discusses the use of dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA and t-SNE to visualize token relations in BERT's pre-trained models. K-means clustering is also applied to verify the clusters in 2D space. Semantic probing tasks are used to analyze the information stored within the transformed vectors.

Semantic probing tasks are used to analyze information stored within transformed vectors, focusing on specific layers and language information retention in the model. Edge Probing is utilized for standardized probing across various NLP tasks, including Named Entity Labeling, Coreference Resolution, Relation Classification, Question Type Classification, and Supporting Fact Identification for Question Answering. The text discusses semantic probing tasks for analyzing information in BERT's pre-trained models, including Named Entity Labeling, Coreference Resolution, Relation Classification, Question Type Classification, and Supporting Fact Identification for Question Answering. Tasks involve predicting entity categories, identifying coreferences, and classifying relations between entities. Source code for tasks is available. BERT's pre-trained models are analyzed through semantic probing tasks like Relation Classification, Question Type Classification, and Supporting Fact Identification for Question Answering. Relation Classification involves predicting relation types between entities, Question Type Classification identifies question types, and Supporting Fact Identification extracts important context parts for answering questions. Source code for experiments is made publicly available. BERT's token transformations are examined to understand how they distinguish important context parts from distracting ones in Question Answering tasks. A probing task is constructed to identify Supporting Facts, where the model predicts if a sentence contains relevant information for a specific question. Different datasets like HotpotQA and bAbI provide sentencewise Supporting Facts, while SQuAD considers the answer phrase as the Supporting Fact. Task-specific probing tasks are created for each dataset to evaluate their ability to recognize relevant parts. All samples are labeled sentencewise as true if they are supporting facts or false otherwise. In a probing task to identify Supporting Facts, sentences are labeled as true if they contain relevant information. Input tokens are embedded using a fine-tuned BERT model for each sample, considering only tokens of \"labeled edges\" for classification. The tokens are pooled for a fixed-length representation and fed into an MLP classifier to predict label-wise probability scores. This process is applied to pretrained BERT-base and BERT-large models without fine-tuning. Our aim is to understand how BERT works on complex downstream tasks like Question Answering (QA), which requires a combination of simpler tasks. We analyze three diverse QA datasets - SQUAD, bAbI, and HotpotQA. Detention is a common punishment in the UK, Ireland, and other countries. Detention is a common punishment in the UK, Ireland, and other countries, requiring students to stay in school at specific times. HotpotQA is a Multihop QA task with 112,000 question-answer pairs designed to combine information from various parts of a context. The context includes supporting and distracting facts, with the distracting facts reduced by a factor of 2.7 to fit the input size of the pre-trained BERT model. The distractor-task of HotpotQA involves a context with supporting and distracting facts, reduced by a factor of 2.7 to fit the input size of the pre-trained BERT model. The QA bAbI tasks are artificial toy tasks designed to test neural models' abilities in reasoning over multiple sentences. The analysis is based on BERT BID8 and GPT-2 BID28 models, which are Transformers extending previous ideas. The analysis is based on BERT BID8 and GPT-2 BID28 models, which are Transformers extending previous ideas. Both models have a similar architecture and represent one half of the original encoder-decoder Transformer. The models are fine-tuned on datasets and hyperparameters are tuned through grid search. The study utilizes BERT BID8 and GPT-2 BID28 models, fine-tuned on datasets with hyperparameters tuned through grid search. Models are trained for 5 Epochs with evaluations every 1000 iterations. Input length varies for different tasks, with a focus on span prediction and sequence classification for bAbI tasks. In November 2019, in Beijing, China, models like BERT and GPT-2 were trained on various tasks. Span prediction and Sequence Classification were distinguished, with a focus on HotpotQA tasks. Results showed high accuracy on SQuAD tasks, but HotpotQA tasks were more challenging. The evaluation results of the best models show high accuracy on the SQuAD task, close to human performance. HotpotQA tasks are more challenging, with the distractor setting being the most difficult. GPT-2 performs better on bAbI tasks compared to BERT, especially in tasks requiring positional or geometric reasoning. Qualitative analysis of vector transformations reveals recurring patterns in the data. The qualitative analysis of vector transformations reveals recurring patterns in the data. Results from probing tasks comparing different BERT models are presented, showing variations in performance across tasks. The PCA representations of tokens suggest the model goes through multiple phases when answering questions, observed consistently across different QA tasks. These findings are supported by the results of probing tasks, highlighting four distinct phases in the model's reasoning process. The model goes through multiple phases while answering questions, observed in different QA tasks. Results from probing tasks support these findings. The four phases include Semantic Clustering in early layers grouping tokens, and Connecting Entities with Mentions and Attributes in middle layers forming task-specific clusters. In the middle layers of neural networks, entities are connected based on their relation within a specific input context rather than topical similarity. Task-specific clusters filter question-relevant entities, as seen in clusters related to questions about punishments in the UK and Ireland and facts about wolves. The HotpotQA model also shows similar clusters with more coreferences. The model's ability to recognize entities and their relationships is supported by probing results. The model's ability to recognize entities and their relationships improves in higher network layers. Named Entity Labeling is learned first, while coreference resolution and relation recognition require input from additional layers. BERT models transform tokens to match questions with supporting facts for Question Answering and Information Retrieval. BERT models transform tokens to match questions with supporting facts for Question Answering and Information Retrieval. The models show the strongest ability to distinguish relevant information from irrelevant information in their higher layers, as demonstrated by the performance increase over successive layers for SQuAD and bAbI. However, the fine-tuned HotpotQA model does not perform as well as the model without fine-tuning, indicating an inability to identify correct Supporting Facts. The performance of the fine-tuned HotpotQA model is less distinct from the model without fine-tuning and does not reach high accuracy. The BERT model struggles on this dataset as it fails to identify the correct Supporting Facts. Vector representations help in understanding which facts are considered important by the model. In the last network layers, the model separates correct answer tokens from the rest, forming homogeneous clusters. The task-specific vector representation learned during fine-tuning leads to a performance drop in general NLP probing tasks. This loss of information is especially evident in the large BERT model fine-tuned on HotpotQA. The vector representation in the last layers of the fine-tuned BERT model on HotpotQA shows a performance drop in general NLP tasks. This loss of information is observed in the separation of correct answer tokens into homogeneous clusters. The model's ability to identify important facts is hindered by the task-specific vector representation learned during fine-tuning. Additionally, the phases of answering questions in BERT can be compared to human reasoning processes, with differences in the order of steps due to BERT's ability to process all input parts simultaneously. BERT's ability to process all input parts simultaneously allows for multiple processes and phases to run concurrently during the answering process. A comparison between BERT and GPT-2 models reveals that GPT-2 pays particular attention to the first token of a sequence, leading to a separation of clusters in its hidden states. This issue persists across all layers of GPT-2 except for the Embedding Layer, the first Transformer block, and the last one. During dimensionality reduction, GPT-2 focuses on the first token of a sequence, causing a separation of clusters in its hidden states. This issue is present in all layers of GPT-2 except for the Embedding Layer, the first Transformer block, and the last one. GPT-2, like BERT, separates relevant Supporting Facts and questions in the vector space, and also extracts similar sentences. Unlike BERT, GPT-2 does not distinctly separate the correct answer but includes it in the sentence. These findings suggest that the analysis extends beyond BERT to other Transformer networks, with future work planned to confirm this observation. Our analysis in GPT-2 extends beyond BERT to other Transformer networks. Future work will include more probing tasks to confirm this observation. Visualizations can show failure states and reveal insights into why wrong predictions occur, such as selecting the wrong Supporting Fact or misresolution of coreferences. Early layers can provide clues as to why a wrong candidate was chosen. In GPT-2 analysis, visualizations can reveal insights into wrong predictions, like selecting the wrong Supporting Fact or misresolution of coreferences. Early layers provide clues on why a wrong candidate was chosen, even when network confidence is low. Fine-tuning has little impact on core NLP abilities of the model, as the pretrained model already contains sufficient information about words and their relations. The network maintains 'Semantic Clustering' similar to Word2Vec in later layers, with little impact from fine-tuning on core NLP abilities. Positional embedding remains crucial throughout Transformer layers, preserving sequential information. The positional embedding in Transformer networks is crucial for preserving sequential information, as shown in visualizations on the SQuAD dataset. Fine-tuning on different tasks affects the model's ability to resolve question types, with SQuAD outperforming base models and bAbI tasks losing this ability. HotpotQA fine-tuning does not lead to improved performance. The model fine-tuned on bAbI tasks loses the ability to distinguish question types due to static structure. Fine-tuning on HotpotQA does not improve performance. Qualitative analysis of token vectors in Transformer models reveals interpretable information for identifying misclassified examples and model weaknesses. The analysis of token vectors in Transformer models reveals interpretable information that can identify misclassified examples and model weaknesses. Lower layers may be more suitable for certain problems in Transfer Learning tasks, suggesting the need to choose layer depth based on the specific task. The findings also suggest modularity in Transformer networks, with specific layers solving different problems, hinting at potential benefits in fitting parts of the network to specific tasks. Further research is needed on methods to process this information and explore skip connections for direct information transfer between non-adjacent layers. Our findings suggest that specific layers in Transformer networks solve different problems, indicating a potential modularity that can be leveraged in training. It may be beneficial to tailor parts of the network to specific tasks during pre-training. Further research should focus on understanding how state-of-the-art models tackle downstream tasks to enhance their performance."
