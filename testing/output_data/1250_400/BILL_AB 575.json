Procedures for submitting instructional materials must be established, with restrictions on resubmission of rejected materials without substantive changes. The state board must adopt basic instructional materials for various subjects, including mathematics, science, social science, and bilingual or bicultural subjects. Publishers or manufacturers submitting revisions after the specified timeframe will be charged a fee not exceeding the department's review costs. Instructional materials must be adopted or rejected within six months, with the possibility of an additional three months if needed. Review committees will include volunteer content experts and classroom teachers from different grade levels and subject areas. The review process for instructional materials involves committees with volunteer content experts and teachers from various grade levels and subjects. The adoption rules are transparent and applicable to all formats of materials. The state board uses specific criteria to ensure consistency with the curriculum framework.

The state board's criteria for instructional materials include alignment with curriculum frameworks, compliance with requirements, factual accuracy, content standards, and restrictions on commercial branding. If the use of commercial branding is necessary for educational purposes or incidental to illustrations, it may be allowed. Other criteria may be established by the state board to fulfill specific constitutional and statutory intents. The state board may adopt fewer than five basic instructional materials in each subject area for each grade level if fewer than five materials are submitted or if they do not meet the criteria outlined in the curriculum framework. The board must provide a written explanation if materials are rejected, based on established criteria. The state board has the authority to adopt materials that are not basic instructional materials and must ensure that the adopted materials provide for the educational needs of diverse pupil populations, represent cultural pluralism, and offer a broad spectrum of knowledge and technology-based materials. The state board adopts instructional materials and provides a listing with unit costs for procurement. The list remains available until a new curriculum framework is adopted. Information on adopted materials is posted online, including publisher details and logos for identification. The state board may adopt regulations for exceptions, as determined by the board. The Superintendent will develop guidelines for implementation. Section 60227 of the Education Code defines followup adoptions and requires notice and fees for publishers participating in the process. The notice for followup adoptions includes a fee based on the number of programs and grade levels, intended to cover the cost of the process while minimizing duplication of work from the primary adoption. The department requires publishers or manufacturers to declare intent and pay a fee before submitting programs for followup adoption. The fee must be paid in full before any review can take place. The Legislature intends for the fee to be reasonable to allow small publishers to participate, and the state board may reduce the fee for small publishers upon request. The Legislature intends for the fee for participation in followup adoptions to be reasonable, allowing small publishers and manufacturers to participate. Small publishers or manufacturers may request a fee reduction, and revenue from fees will be used to cover adoption and instructional material review costs. The revenue from fees charged for follow-up adoptions will be used to cover adoption and instructional material review costs. If there is little interest from publishers and manufacturers, a follow-up adoption may not be conducted. General fund revenue cannot be used for follow-up adoption costs. This section will be in effect until January 1, 2024, unless extended or repealed by a later statute."
