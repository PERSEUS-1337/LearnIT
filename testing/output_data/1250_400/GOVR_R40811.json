    "content": "Severe wildfires have been burning more structures and area due to unnaturally high accumulations of biomass. Congress is urged to provide more funding and authority for activities like prescribed burning and thinning to reduce biomass fuels and wildfire severity. Current federal authorities for fuel reduction are broad but lack sufficient reporting on funding and progress. The reporting on hazardous fuel treatment funding and accomplishments for various fuel reduction activities is insufficient for Congress to assess progress. Information on funding for thinning and other wildfire protection activities is inadequate to compare benefits and costs. Improved reporting on funding and results, disaggregated by ecosystem or fire regime, may help Congress in allocating appropriate funding among activities and agencies. Improved reporting on funding and results, disaggregated by ecosystem or fire regime, may assist Congress in allocating appropriate funding among activities and agencies. Wildfires in temperate ecosystems are inevitable due to dry conditions and various ignitions. Different types of wildfires, such as surface fires and crown fires, depend on fuel characteristics and weather conditions. Efforts focus on altering fuel characteristics to prevent or minimize damages caused by crown fires. Characteristics of biomass fuels, such as moisture content and size, significantly affect wildfire behavior and effects. Efforts in fire protection focus on altering fuel characteristics to prevent or minimize damages caused by crown fires. Four key characteristics of biomass fuels affecting wildfire behavior are moisture content, size, distribution, and quantity. Moisture content is crucial as it controls flammability, with green foliage fluctuating based on weather conditions. Fuel with up to 20%-30% moisture can be ignited, while 100% moisture content can burn, especially in high winds. The moisture content of biomass fuels is crucial for wildfire behavior. Fuel with up to 20%-30% moisture can be ignited, while 100% moisture content can burn, especially in high winds. Different time lag fuels, such as fine fuels, woody twigs, and larger diameter fuels, contribute to fire intensity and spread. Fine fuels ignite and burn quickly, while larger fuels burn more slowly. The 100-hour and 1,000-hour time lag fuels are important for spreading fires, with fine fuels being the most crucial. The 1-hour time lag fuels contribute little to fire intensity due to their quick burn rate. The 10-hour time lag fuels also contribute to the rate of spread, as they ignite quickly and can be carried aloft by winds as firebrands. Larger fuels, like the 1,000-hour time lag fuels, burn intensely but do not contribute much to the rate of spread. Fuel distribution and compactness are important factors in wildfire behavior. The 1,000-hour time lag fuels burn intensely but contribute little to the rate of spread. Fuel distribution is crucial, with compactness and continuity playing key roles in wildfire behavior. Highly compact fuel beds resist burning by reducing ventilation, while continuity of fuels allows fires to spread. Firelines are used to break the continuity of fuels and control wildfires. Fuel distribution is crucial for wildfire behavior, with continuity playing a key role. Firelines are used to break the continuity of fuels and control wildfires. Steep slopes and high winds can increase flammability by reducing fuel moisture content and raising temperatures. Vertical continuity, such as \"fuel ladders,\" can spread fires into the canopy, turning a surface fire into a crown fire. Wind is often necessary to initiate and sustain a crown fire. Fuel distribution is crucial for wildfire behavior, with continuity playing a key role. Ladders help spread fires into the canopy, turning a surface fire into a crown fire by providing continuous fuels between the ground and the canopy. Wind is often necessary to initiate and sustain a crown fire, which can increase its intensity and spread. Fuel loads vary widely, including dead biomass, undergrowth, and undesirable trees, ranging from less than 1 ton to over 200 tons per acre. Fuel loads can range from less than 1 ton to over 200 tons per acre, including dead biomass, undergrowth, and undesirable trees. Live crown biomass plays a significant role in sustaining crown fires, with not all fuel being consumed in a wildfire. Large-diameter fuels often remain after a fire, with different fuel components being consumed at varying rates. The size of the fuel affects the proportion consumed in fires. High intensity fires can consume 100% of foliage and 75% of understory vegetation, but only 10% of tree branches and 5% of large tree stems. Different ecosystems are adapted to various fire intensities, with some experiencing frequent low-intensity surface fires, while others have periodic high-intensity crown fires. Many ecosystems in the US are adapted to relatively frequent wildfires, characterized by large amounts of fine fuels like grasses and needles. Forested frequent-fire ecosystems have fire-resistant trees and open spaces due to frequent fires killing seedlings and shrubs. Frequent wildfires occur in ecosystems with large amounts of fine fuels like grasses and needles, such as grasslands and meadows. Forested frequent-fire ecosystems are dominated by fire-resistant trees like ponderosa pine and southern yellow pine, with open spaces due to frequent fires killing seedlings and shrubs. These ecosystems have few small to mid-sized trees, reducing the risk of crown fires. Surface-fire ecosystems make up 34% of U.S. wildlands historically fueled by grasses, needles, and low-growing shrubs. Grazing and logging have altered these ecosystems by reducing grass cover and allowing fuel loads to expand. Heavy grazing in the West since the late 1800s reduced grass cover, leading to an increase in fuel loads of branches and small to mid-size trees. Logging practices focused on large pines, leaving fire-resistant trees like firs and spruces to dominate the understory. Fire suppression further increased fuel loads by eliminating surface fires. This has resulted in ecosystems with higher fuel loads and fuel ladders, increasing the risk of catastrophic crown fires. Activities that reduce fuel loads have been shown to decrease wildfire severity in surface-fire ecosystems. On the other hand, ecosystems adapted to high-intensity crown fires have dense, uniform fuels. Activities that reduce fuel loads and remove fuel ladders have been proven to decrease wildfire severity in surface-fire ecosystems. Ecosystems adapted to high-intensity crown fires have dense, uniform fuels, with examples like chaparral and lodgepole pine. Crown-fire ecosystems make up about 42% of wildlands in the United States. The classic example of lodgepole pine, which grows in dense, even-aged stands and relies on serotinous cones that open after being heated by fire. Crown-fire ecosystems, covering 42% of US wildlands, have uniform biomass fuels. Human activities like grazing and logging have not significantly impacted fuel loads or fire behavior in these ecosystems. Fuel treatments may not prevent catastrophic crown fires, as seen in southern California chaparral. Wildfires respond to localized moisture variations and do not completely destroy all vegetation. The fuel treatment in southern California chaparral may not prevent large fires, as they are not dependent on old age classes of fuels. Wildfires are patchy and do not completely destroy all vegetation. Even in crown-fire ecosystems, like the Yellowstone fires in 1988, only about half of the reported acres burned severely. Some ecosystems consistently burn with mixed fires of limited scale, including ladders for crown fires and low-intensity surface fires. In mixed-fire-regime ecosystems, some areas burn severely while others have patchy fires. Whitebark pine is a classic example, with slow growth allowing for regeneration after sporadic mixed-intensity fires. Clark's nutcrackers help spread seeds for regeneration in burned areas. Other species can also have mixed-fire-regime characteristics under certain circumstances. In mixed-fire-regime ecosystems, various species exhibit mixed-fire characteristics under certain conditions. Fuel reduction activities in these ecosystems raise uncertainties about the impact on wildfire severity and extent. The consequences of fuel reduction on fuel levels, sizes, and distributions remain unclear. In mixed-fire-regime ecosystems, uncertainties exist regarding fuel levels, sizes, and distributions, and their impact on wildfire severity and extent. Fuel reduction activities may not significantly alter wildfire severity or extent, and reducing fuel loads may not protect structures and communities from wildfires, as evidenced by the Hayman Fire in 2002. The Hayman Fire in 2002 showed that fires in the wildland-urban interface may not protect infrastructure effectively. 83% of homes within the fire perimeter survived, with 53% destroyed by crown fire and 47% by surface fire. Reducing fuel loads and eliminating fuel ladders are necessary for safe wildfire management. Observers suggest expanding the area burned in low-intensity surface fires to maintain natural conditions and values. Activities like prescribed burning and thinning are proposed to reduce fuel loads, but caution is advised as they may not always prevent crown fires due to changes in microclimate. Thinning can increase surface fire intensity and the likelihood of crown ignition. Prescribed burning and thinning in forests can increase surface temperatures, decrease fire fuel moisture, and lower relative humidity, potentially leading to more intense surface fires and increased risk of crown ignition. However, prescribed fires can escape control and cause extensive damage if conditions change. Prescribed burning primarily eliminates fine and small fuels by converting biomass to smoke and ashes. It has limitations in reducing large diameter fuels and is not effective in reducing tree density or crown density. Prescribed fire burns whatever biomass is available depending on site-specific conditions. Prescribed burning has limitations in reducing large diameter fuels and is not effective in reducing tree density or crown density. It can be risky, leading to notable wildfires and health hazards from smoke. Federal land management agencies have policies in place for fire management objectives. The federal land management agencies have policies in place to allow wildfires to burn with monitoring for fire management objectives. Wildland fire use, also known as \"let-burn\" or prescribed natural fire, is similar to prescribed burning but uses natural ignition sources. Thinning involves cutting and removing trees in a stand, either for commercial use or precommercial purposes. Thinning involves cutting and removing trees in a stand, either for commercial use or precommercial purposes. Three basic approaches to thinning are low thinning, crown thinning, and selection thinning, each serving different purposes in altering biomass fuels. Thinning has advantages over prescribed burning as it is controlled and can emphasize eliminating ladder fuels. Thinning, a method of cutting and removing trees in a stand, offers advantages over prescribed burning in reducing fuels. It allows for controlled selection of trees to cut, emphasizing ladder fuel elimination and reducing crown density. Thinning can create targeted stand structure and reduce vertical fuel continuity, but leaves slash on the ground, increasing short-term fuel load. Thinning is a more precise method than prescribed fire for targeting ladder fuels and specific fuel components. However, it leaves slash on the ground, increasing the fuel load in the short run. Mechanical treatments are labor-intensive and costly, and not all thinning is intended to reduce biomass fuels. Thinning can also increase fire hazards in the short run and provide little wildfire protection in crown-fire ecosystems. Thinning trees can lead to larger, more valuable trees but may increase fire hazards in the short term. Thinning combined with prescribed burning can reduce the risk of catastrophic crown fires, but the effectiveness of this approach is limited and costly. Other methods, such as logging dead trees, are also suggested to reduce fuel loads. The combined treatment of thinning trees and prescribed burning to reduce fire hazards has limited effectiveness and high costs. Logging dead trees, especially salvage logging of stands with dead trees, is sometimes proposed to reduce fuel loads. However, commercial logging focuses on large trees and does not address the \"ladder effect\" of wildfire behavior caused by branches, seedlings, and saplings. Standing dead trees may contribute less to crown fires than live trees. Salvage of standing dead trees may reduce fuels, but standing dead trees without needles may contribute less to crown fires than live trees. Pruning lower tree branches can reduce fuel ladders and crown density for wildfire protection. Five federal agencies are responsible for wildfire protection on federal lands, but none are explicitly authorized to reduce biomass fuels. The federal agencies responsible for wildfire protection on federal lands, including the Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, National Park Service, Fish and Wildlife Service, and Bureau of Indian Affairs, are implicitly authorized to reduce fuels for wildfire protection within their mandate to preserve and protect the lands and resources under their jurisdiction. Since 1897, the Forest Service has been directed to protect public forests from destruction by fire, while the National Park Service is directed to conserve scenery and natural resources. The Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 provides implicit authority for the Bureau of Land Management to manage public lands in a manner that protects various resources. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and other federal agencies are directed to conserve scenery, natural resources, and wildlife on their lands. The Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 gives BLM authority to manage public lands to protect various values. The Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) also have broad directives for conservation and management of resources. BIA specifically includes activities like forest land development and restoration for the benefit of present and future generations. The BIA has explicit direction for Indian forest land management activities, including forestation, thinning, tree improvement, and wildfire protection. Specific funding programs and general management funds are available for biomass fuel reduction activities, with the Forest Service having accounts for prescribed burning and other fuel reduction activities. The Forest Service has funding accounts for biomass fuel reduction activities, with the Hazardous Fuels sub-account being the primary source for prescribed burning. Funding for prescribed burning and other activities rose substantially in FY2001, continued to rise through FY2008, spiked in FY2009 due to economic stimulus legislation, and has since declined. Thinning activities are funded within the Vegetation and Watershed Management account, which also covers reforestation, rangeland improvements, and watershed protection. Funding for thinning activities, including fuel reduction, has decreased over the years within the Vegetation and Watershed Management account of the National Forest System line item. Approximately 20% of appropriations in FY2008 were allocated to thinning and related activities, but the specific portion used for thinning varies annually. The Forest Service also has mandatory spending accounts, such as Brush Disposal, which collects deposits from timber purchasers to treat slash from logging operations in national forests. These treatments include mechanical and manual efforts. The Forest Service has mandatory spending accounts like Brush Disposal and Knutson-Vandenberg Fund, funded by timber purchasers, for activities like slash treatment and reforestation following logging operations. These funds can be used for thinning and improving the forest, similar to Vegetation and Watershed Management Appropriations. The Forest Service has mandatory spending accounts like Brush Disposal and Knutson-Vandenberg Fund, funded by timber purchasers, for activities like slash treatment and reforestation following logging operations. These funds can be used for thinning and improving the forest, similar to Vegetation and Watershed Management Appropriations. Additionally, stewardship contracting allows for forest stewardship activities, including thinning for fuel reduction, to be included in timber sale contracts. Funds from these contracts can be used for various activities, including thinning, but the specific amount allocated for thinning and wildfire protection is not reported. The Hazardous Fuels sub-account within the Wildland Fire Management line item provides the majority of funding for prescribed activities. The DOI agencies receive appropriations for fuel reduction activities, including thinning and prescribed burning. Funding comes from the Hazardous Fuels sub-account within the Wildland Fire Management line item. While the amount used for prescribed burning is not specified, funding has been stable since FY2001. Other fuel reduction activities are funded through general land and resource management accounts. These funds can be used for various activities to reduce fuel loads and improve wildfire protection. Funding for fuel reduction activities within DOI agencies has been stable since FY2001. Various accounts within each agency fund activities to reduce fuel loads and improve wildfire protection. The BLM, NPS, FWS, and BIA have specific accounts that could be used for fuel reduction activities. Several accounts within DOI agencies fund activities to reduce wildfire threats, including for migratory birds, wildlife habitats, and Indian lands. The Forest Ecosystem Health and Recovery Fund can be used for activities like reducing wildfire risk in damaged forests. Federal authorities for assisting fuel reduction on nonfederal lands are indirect. The FS has two wildfire protection assistance programs. The FS has two wildfire protection assistance programs that can include fuel reduction. One program is State Fire Assistance, providing technical and financial assistance to states for fire prevention and prescribed burning. The other program is Volunteer Fire Assistance, offering assistance for fire prevention and control. Funding allocation for fuel reduction activities is at each state's discretion. The FS has two wildfire protection assistance programs: State Fire Assistance and Volunteer Fire Assistance. State Fire Assistance provides technical and financial aid to states for fire prevention and prescribed burning, while Volunteer Fire Assistance offers assistance for fire prevention and control. Funding allocation for fuel reduction activities is at each state's discretion. Additionally, the FS supports Community Wildfire Protection to expand outreach, education, and establish defensible space around private homes and property. The FS was authorized to support Community Wildfire Protection through outreach, education, and establishing defensible space around homes. The program, created in the 2002 farm bill, allows for reducing biomass fuels on private lands with the landowner's consent. No funds have been appropriated for this program yet, but State Fire Assistance funding could be used. The FS also offers technical and financial assistance programs for forest stewardship, forest health protection, and emergency restoration, but the portion of funds that contribute to wildfire protection through biomass fuel reduction is unknown."
