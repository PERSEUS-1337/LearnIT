    "content": "The Act titled \"Quincy Library Group Forest Recovery and Economic Stability Act of 1997\" establishes a pilot project for Plumas, Lassen, and Tahoe National Forests to implement the Quincy Library Group proposal. The Quincy Library Group-Community Stability Proposal is an agreement by a coalition in northern California to develop a resource management program for Federal lands in the Sierra Nevada area. It includes a map dated June 1993. The Secretary of Agriculture is required to conduct a pilot project to implement and demonstrate the effectiveness of the resource management activities described in the proposal. The Secretary of Agriculture must conduct a pilot project on Federal lands in California to demonstrate resource management activities outlined in the Quincy Library Group-Community Stability Proposal. The project will take place in designated areas within Plumas National Forest, Lassen National Forest, and the Sierraville Ranger District of Tahoe National Forest. During the pilot project in California, spotted owl habitat areas and protected activity centers within the designated areas will be deferred from resource management activities and timber harvesting. The Regional Forester for region 5 will ensure that no resource management activities, road building, or timber harvesting will be conducted on Federal lands in specified forests during the project term. During the pilot project in California, timber harvesting activities are prohibited in designated Federal lands within specified forests. Riparian protection guidelines apply to resource management activities and timber harvesting in the pilot project area. During the pilot project in California, resource management activities must comply with guidelines for the conservation of the California spotted owl as outlined in specific documents. Timber harvesting is prohibited in designated Federal lands within specified forests, and riparian protection guidelines apply to these activities. During the pilot project in California, resource management activities will be carried out on Federal lands according to specific guidelines for the conservation of the California spotted owl. This includes constructing fuelbreaks and implementing forest management prescriptions to achieve a fire-resilient condition. During the pilot project in California, resource management activities will be carried out on Federal lands utilizing group selection and individual tree selection methods to achieve a desired future condition of all-age, multistory, fire resilient forests. The total acreage for these activities shall not exceed 70,000 acres each year, including riparian management programs consistent with guidelines for riparian protection. During the pilot project in California, resource management activities will be carried out on Federal lands utilizing group selection and individual tree selection methods to achieve a desired future condition of all-age, multistory, fire resilient forests. The total acreage for these activities shall not exceed 70,000 acres each year, including riparian management programs consistent with guidelines for riparian protection. The Secretary will use cost-effective means and specific funds allocated for the administration and management of designated forests. During the pilot project in California, resource management activities will be carried out on Federal lands using group and individual tree selection methods to achieve fire-resilient forests. The Secretary will allocate excess funds for the administration and management of designated forests, with a total acreage not exceeding 70,000 acres annually. The forest supervisors have flexibility to use available funds for resource management activities. The Tahoe National Forest may use excess funds for managing designated forests, with restrictions on limiting other activities. Overhead costs are limited to 12%, with 88% allocated for required activities. Additional funds are authorized for the pilot project implementation. The pilot project for managing designated forests limits overhead costs to 12%, with 88% allocated for required activities. Additional funds are authorized for implementation, with a term lasting until completion of land and resource management plans or five years after commencement. Consultation is required for each statement. The Forest Service will revise land and resource management plans for Plumas National Forest, Lassen National Forest, and Tahoe National Forest within five years of the pilot project's commencement. Consultation with the Quincy Library Group is required, and private contracts may be used for implementation. The Regional Forester will initiate the process to amend the plans within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The Forest Service will revise management plans for Plumas National Forest, Lassen National Forest, and Tahoe National Forest, incorporating the pilot project and other designated activities. Reporting requirements include submitting an annual report to Congress on the pilot project's status. The Secretary must submit an annual report to Congress on the pilot project's status, including a complete accounting of funds used and a description of resource management activities and benefits achieved. The annual report to Congress must include a description of total acres treated for various resource management activities, economic benefits to local communities, a comparison of revenues and costs before and after the pilot project, and a schedule for resource management. The annual report to Congress must include a description of total acres treated for various resource management activities, economic benefits to local communities, a comparison of revenues and costs before and after the pilot project, a schedule for resource management, and a science-based assessment of the pilot project's effectiveness in meeting its goals. The assessment should include watershed monitoring of treated lands. The expenditure limit for each annual report is $50,000. The assessment and report on the pilot project's effectiveness must include watershed monitoring addressing water releases, quality changes, and yield changes. It should also analyze any adverse environmental impacts and be compiled in consultation with the Quincy Library Group. The report must be submitted to Congress by July 1, 2002, with a limit of $150,000 in federal funds for expenditures, excluding watershed monitoring costs. The pilot project's assessment and report must include watershed monitoring on water releases, quality changes, and yield changes. Federal funds for the assessment and report are limited to $150,000, with an additional $75,000 allocated for watershed monitoring in fiscal years 2000, 2001, and 2002. The project is not exempt from any Federal environmental laws."
