    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 65961 of the Government Code in the State of California is amended. Section 65961 of the Government Code in the State of California states that within five years of final map approval for a residential subdivision, a city or county cannot impose new conditions for building permits beyond those previously approved. The Government Code in California prohibits cities or counties from imposing new conditions for building permits on a residential subdivision within five years of final map approval. Local agencies can impose conditions for health and safety reasons, to comply with state or federal law, or to ensure compliance with zoning ordinances. This also applies to cities incorporating areas from a tentative or parcel map after January 1, 1985. The section applies to cities incorporating areas from a tentative or parcel map after January 1, 1985. Conditions imposed by the county before incorporation can still apply. For extended subdivision maps, the five-year period is reduced to three years. For extended tentative subdivision or parcel maps, the five-year period is reduced to three years. Cities can still levy fees or impose conditions upon issuance of a building permit. Section 66452.25 of the Government Code extends the expiration date of approved tentative maps, vesting tentative maps, or parcel maps within certain counties by 24 months if approved between January 1, 2002, and July 11, 2013. Section 66452.25 of the Government Code allows for a 24-month extension of approved tentative maps, vesting tentative maps, or parcel maps in specific counties if found consistent with zoning and general plan requirements. The extension can be denied if not meeting the requirements, and an automatic 60-day extension is granted upon application for an extension. The legislative body or advisory agency may deny or conditionally approve an extension for a period of 24 months for approved tentative maps. An automatic 60-day extension is granted upon application for an extension, and if denied, the subdivider can appeal to the legislative body within 15 days. In a county, the conditions for applying this section include: annual mean household income less than 80% of statewide income, annual nonseasonal unemployment rate at least 2.75% higher than statewide rate, and poverty rate at least 4% higher than statewide median. The extension of expiration dates for development projects in a county with specific poverty and unemployment criteria is provided, in addition to any existing extensions. Any approvals related to a development project in the extended map will also be extended by 24 months. The provisions of Section 65961 regarding conditions for building permits in residential subdivisions are modified for tentative maps extended under this section. No reimbursement is required for this act, and it is deemed an urgency statute for public safety. This act is deemed urgent for public safety to allow cities and counties to extend development applications affected by economic conditions in the construction industry."
