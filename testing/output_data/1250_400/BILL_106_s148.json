    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act\". Congress recognizes the importance of neotropical migratory bird species that provide environmental, economic, and aesthetic benefits to the United States and the Western Hemisphere. Many of these bird populations are declining due to habitat loss and degradation, threatening their long-term survival. Conservation efforts require collaboration among countries along their migration routes. Neotropical migratory birds need conservation efforts from all countries along their migration routes. Initiatives to protect them can be improved with better coordination. The purposes of this Act are to perpetuate healthy populations of neotropical migratory birds, support conservation initiatives in the United States, Latin America, and the Caribbean, and provide financial resources for international cooperation.
