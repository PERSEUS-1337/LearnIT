    "content": "The PACT Act requires remote retailers of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco to pay state and local taxes before delivering goods. Three retailers challenged the Act, citing violations of the Due Process Clause. Courts granted preliminary injunctions, suggesting the Act may violate due process. The district courts in New York and D.C. granted preliminary injunctions, stating that the PACT Act's requirement for remote retailers to pay state and local taxes violates due process. The Second Circuit upheld the injunction in Red Earth, while the D.C. Circuit will review the Gordon case. However, the Eastern District of Pennsylvania rejected the due process argument in Musser's Inc. v. United States, stating that the PACT Act is a federal statute requiring compliance with state laws and does not implicate due process. The PACT Act is a federal statute that requires compliance with state and local laws, not violating due process. The plaintiff had minimum contacts with jurisdictions due to transacting business through its website. Congress may not be able to require remote retailers to pay taxes to jurisdictions without minimum contacts. The constitutionality of the PACT Act depends on what constitutes minimum contacts for remote retailers. The constitutionality of the PACT Act hinges on defining minimum contacts for remote retailers. The Act aims to enforce equal laws for remote and brick-and-mortar retailers, increase tax collection, deter smuggling, and limit youth access to cheap tobacco products. The PACT Act aims to enforce equal laws for remote and brick-and-mortar retailers, increase tax collection, deter smuggling, and limit youth access to cheap tobacco products by deeming interstate sales as intrastate sales and requiring remote sellers to pay all applicable taxes prior to delivery. The PACT Act enforces laws on excise taxes, licensing requirements, and sales restrictions for cigarettes and smokeless tobacco. Remote sellers must pay all applicable taxes before delivery, following Commerce Clause and Due Process Clause guidelines on state taxation of out-of-state businesses. The PACT Act enforces laws on excise taxes, licensing requirements, and sales restrictions for cigarettes and smokeless tobacco. States cannot tax foreign businesses without a sufficient connection and taxes must relate to the value received. The Commerce Clause and Due Process Clause are distinct. Remote retailers challenge the PACT Act under the Due Process Clause, citing the Quill case where physical presence was required for taxation. The Court upheld jurisdiction over out-of-state businesses without physical presence, citing modern commercial practices of conducting business across state lines through mail and wire communications. The Court upheld jurisdiction over out-of-state businesses conducting business across state lines through mail and wire communications, emphasizing the importance of purposeful direction of activities towards residents of another State. In the case of Quill, the Court found that directing catalogues to North Dakota residents provided fair warning of tax liability, satisfying the minimum contacts requirement. The issue under Quill is whether the out-of-state business has directed activities at the taxing state and has fair warning of tax liability. In Red Earth, members of the Seneca Nation of Indians who own tobacco retail businesses sought to block the PACT Act's tax requirements on their sales. The plaintiffs argued that the Act violated Due Process by subjecting them to state taxes without sufficient minimum contacts. The United States claimed that maintaining websites and shipping goods into the taxing jurisdictions satisfied minimum contacts, but the court disagreed, noting not all plaintiffs had websites. The court rejected arguments that maintaining websites and shipping goods into taxing jurisdictions satisfied minimum contacts for the plaintiffs in the case. The court found that not all plaintiffs had websites, and those that did had passive websites that did not allow for online purchases. Additionally, the court disagreed that shipping goods into a state met the minimum contacts requirement. The court determined that a passive website and shipment into a state did not satisfy the minimum contacts requirement for imposing taxes on an out-of-state seller. The court rejected the argument that each sale creates the necessary contacts, stating that a single sale may not be enough to establish jurisdiction. The court emphasized that the Supreme Court in Quill focused on continuous solicitation rather than a single sale. The court found that a single sale may not satisfy the minimum contacts requirement for jurisdiction, emphasizing the importance of continuous solicitation. The court also noted that the PACT Act may violate the Due Process Clause by broadening jurisdictional reach without regard to due process constraints. The district court granted a preliminary injunction, which was appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The PACT Act seeks to eliminate the due process requirement, but the Court of Appeals upheld the district court's preliminary injunction. The issue is whether Congress can mandate a vendor to collect taxes in any state with just one sale, which raises concerns about due process. The Supreme Court has not definitively ruled on whether a single sale satisfies due process requirements. Courts have avoided deciding if a single sale meets due process requirements. The Supreme Court has not definitively ruled on this issue. In Musser's case, a tobacco retailer sought a preliminary injunction under the PACT Act. The district court denied the injunction, but the Court of Appeals upheld it. The question remains whether Congress can require tax collection with just one sale, raising due process concerns. Red Earth, the plaintiff in Musser's case, sought a preliminary injunction under the PACT Act, arguing that it violates the Due Process Clause by requiring retailers to pay state and local taxes without minimum contacts with the jurisdictions. The district court denied the injunction, stating that Congress, not the states, imposes the tax-payment requirement, and federal legislation regulating interstate commerce has historically required businesses to comply with state and local laws. This requirement has been found not to violate due process. The court found that businesses like firearms distributors, online pharmacies, and farmers must comply with state and local laws when distributing their products. Congress has the authority to require compliance with state laws for interstate commerce. The court also ruled that a plaintiff had minimum contacts in all 50 states due to the interactive nature of their website. The court concluded that the plaintiff had minimum contacts in all 50 states due to the interactive nature of its website, using the sliding scale approach to determine personal jurisdiction based on the level of interactivity and commercial nature of the exchange of information on the website. The court in Musser's case found that the plaintiff had established minimum contacts in all 50 states through its interactive website, where customers could place orders, pay online, and have products delivered. This suggests that a single sale through an interactive website could satisfy the minimum contacts requirement for personal jurisdiction. The court's reasoning suggests that a single sale through an interactive website could establish minimum contacts for personal jurisdiction. Gordon, a member of the Seneca Nation of Indians, sought to challenge the PACT Act's tax requirements on the grounds of due process. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit reversed the district court's denial of Gordon's motion, stating that it was timely and offering observations on Due Process violations. The Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit reversed the district court's decision, stating that Gordon's motion was timely. They noted that Due Process violations can still occur even when Congress authorizes state levies based on minimum contacts. The government argued that Gordon only needed minimum contacts with the U.S., not individual states, due to the PACT Act being a federal law. The government argued that under the PACT Act, Gordon only needed minimum contacts with the U.S., not individual states, to comply with federal law. The court distinguished previous cases where interstate businesses were not subject to specific state jurisdictions, stating that the PACT Act imposes a new duty on delivery sellers to ensure state and local taxes are paid. The court distinguished previous cases where interstate businesses were not subject to specific state jurisdictions, stating that the PACT Act imposes a new duty on delivery sellers to ensure state and local taxes are paid. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit rejected the argument that Congress can authorize violations of the Due Process Clause in relation to the PACT Act. The court discussed the opinion in Musser's and how it collapsed the Due Process and Commerce Clause aspects of the PACT Act challenge. The court in Musser's case collapsed the Due Process and Commerce Clause aspects of the PACT Act challenge by reviewing key due process cases on personal jurisdiction law. It emphasized the need for minimum contacts with the jurisdiction to ensure fair play and substantial justice, citing cases like International Shoe Co. v. Washington and Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz. The court highlighted that personal jurisdiction can be established if a commercial actor's efforts are purposefully directed towards residents of another state. The court in Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz emphasized that personal jurisdiction can be established if a commercial actor's efforts are purposefully directed towards residents of another state. The Supreme Court noted that a single act creating a substantial connection with the forum state can support jurisdiction, but acts creating only an attenuated affiliation are not sufficient. The district court emphasized the importance of foreseeability in due process analysis, stating that a defendant's conduct and connection with the forum state should reasonably anticipate being haled into court there. This focus on foreseeability provides predictability to the legal system, allowing potential defendants to structure their conduct with assurance of where they may be liable to suit. The Supreme Court's decision in Quill reiterated the requirement of a definite link or minimum connection between a state and the person for due process to be satisfied. The district court discussed Quill's due process challenge, emphasizing the need for a definite link between a state and the person for due process to be satisfied. Quill's mail order business had minimum contacts with North Dakota, meeting the due process requirement. However, the Quill standard was not met in Gordon's case as his business did not purposefully avail itself of the benefits of the states where he sells his products. The district court found that the Quill standard was not met in Gordon's case, as his business did not purposefully avail itself of the benefits of the states where he sells his products. The court also stated that the tax on Gordon's products was not rationally related to the values connected with the taxing State. The court found that the PACT Act may violate due process as it subjects out-of-state businesses to state taxation without minimum contacts, potentially not meeting the requirements of the Due Process Clause. Congress exercised its authority under the Commerce Clause, but the constitutionality of the Act was analyzed under the Due Process Clause in cases like Red Earth and Gordon. The PACT Act may not comply with the Due Process Clause if it allows states to tax out-of-state businesses without minimum contacts. Courts have analyzed its constitutionality under the Due Process Clause, questioning if a single sale into a jurisdiction meets the minimum contacts requirement. This issue was highlighted in cases like Red Earth and Gordon."
