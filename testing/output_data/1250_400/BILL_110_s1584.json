    "content": "The Act titled \"Hydrographic Services Improvement Act Amendments of 2007\" redesignates sections 302 through 306 as sections 303 through 307 and adds a new section 302 for findings and purposes. The Congress finds the importance of maintaining federal expertise in hydrographic data and services to support a safe marine transportation system. The need to maintain federal expertise in hydrographic data and services is crucial for supporting a safe marine transportation system, promoting international trade, and ensuring economic prosperity. The increasing congestion in the nation's marine transportation system, expected growth in international maritime commerce, and the importance of hydrographic data for emergency response and homeland security further emphasize the significance of this expertise. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration plays a crucial role in providing hydrographic data and services to support various national needs, including emergency response, homeland security, marine resource conservation, and coastal resiliency. They also establish and maintain national standards for hydrographic data and services, with the Director of the Office of Coast Survey serving as the U.S. National Hydrographer and primary representative to the international hydrographic community. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration maintains national standards for hydrographic data and services. The Director of the Office of Coast Survey serves as the U.S. National Hydrographer and represents the U.S. internationally. Their expertise supports baseline and boundary demarcation, researches new technologies for efficiency and safety, and promotes national competitiveness. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration aims to enhance efficiency, competitiveness, safety, and environmental protection through research, development, and application of new technologies. The purposes of this Act include augmenting NOAA's capabilities, providing accurate hydrographic data for safe international trade, supporting homeland security and emergency response, and promoting coastal resiliency. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration aims to enhance efficiency, competitiveness, safety, and environmental protection through research, development, and application of new technologies. This includes providing hydrographic data for safe international trade, supporting homeland security and emergency response, promoting coastal resiliency, and improving integrated ocean and coastal mapping and observations. Additionally, it involves research and development in hydrographic data and services to enhance efficiency, accuracy, and availability, thereby promoting the Nation's scientific and technological competitiveness.

SEC. 4. CHANGES IN DEFINITIONS. Section 303 of the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998 (33 U.S.C. 892) is amended to define hydrographic data as information acquired through various surveying methods for providing hydrographic services, including the management, maintenance, and dissemination of related information. The Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998 is amended to include the production of nautical charts and databases derived from hydrographic data, as well as amending the definition of the Coast and Geodetic Survey Act. SEC. 5. Changes in functions of the Administrator. Section 304 of the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998 is amended to fulfill data gathering and dissemination duties under the Coast and Geodetic Survey Act, promote safe marine transportation, and provide hydrographic services. The Administrator may procure, operate vessels and equipment for safe navigation, maintain hydrographic monitoring systems, and provide hydrographic services to support coastal and ocean resource management. The Administrator may acquire hydrographic data and provide services to support conservation, manage resources, save lives, protect property, and resume commerce during emergencies. They have the authority to create joint centers and enter contracts to carry out the purposes of this Act. The Administrator has the authority to create joint centers, enter contracts, and acquire hydrographic data to support conservation, resource management, emergency response, and commerce activities. They may also award contracts for hydrographic data acquisition in accordance with the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949. SEC. 6. Changes to quality assurance program by amending sections in the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998. SEC. 7. Changes in Hydrographic Services Review Panel. Section 306 of the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998 is amended to change the composition of the Hydrographic Services Review Panel, increasing the number of voting members to 15 who are qualified in hydrographic data and services. The Hydrographic Services Review Panel is amended to have 15 voting members who are qualified in hydrographic data and services. Voting members will be reimbursed for expenses incurred in the performance of their duties. SEC. 8 of the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998 authorizes $168,771,000 for the Administrator in fiscal year 2008 and subsequent years for carrying out the Act."
