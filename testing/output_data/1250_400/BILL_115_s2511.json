    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Commercial Engagement Through Ocean Technology Act of 2018\" or the \"CENOTE Act of 2018\". The table of contents for this Act is provided. The \"Commercial Engagement Through Ocean Technology Act of 2018\" or the \"CENOTE Act of 2018\" includes definitions, coordination for assessment and acquisition of unmanned maritime systems by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, regular assessments, acquisition, reports on usage, funding, and additional authorities. Key terms like Administration, Administrator, and cooperative activities are defined within the Act. The \"Commercial Engagement Through Ocean Technology Act of 2018\" defines key terms like cooperative activities, data specifications, and test or training range for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's use of unmanned maritime systems. The \"Commercial Engagement Through Ocean Technology Act of 2018\" defines a test or training range as an area for operating unmanned maritime systems to evaluate performance or train personnel. Unmanned maritime systems are remotely operated or autonomous vehicles designed to function without human presence, including undersea vehicles, surface vehicles, and autonomous underwater vehicles. The \"Commercial Engagement Through Ocean Technology Act of 2018\" defines unmanned maritime systems as including undersea vehicles, surface vehicles, autonomous underwater vehicles, unmanned aerial vehicles, and autonomous aerial vehicles used for maritime purposes. The Act establishes coordination for research, assessment, and acquisition of these systems by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The Administrator directs the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (OAR) and the Office of Marine and Aviation Operations (OMAO) to coordinate research and acquisition of unmanned maritime systems. This includes considering their use in cooperative activities. Coordination is facilitated through the Unmanned Systems Executive Oversight Board (USEOB), with representation from the Office of Ocean Exploration (OER) and the Integrated Ocean Observing System program office. The Administrator ensures representation on the Unmanned Systems Executive Oversight Board (USEOB) from various offices within the Administration actively engaged with unmanned maritime systems. Additionally, efforts are made to coordinate with the Secretary of the Navy to leverage expertise in developing and transitioning unmanned maritime systems, align with strategic priorities, and utilize Naval test ranges. The Secretary of Commerce for Operations and the Oceanographer of the Navy collaborate on strategic priorities for missions and geography within the Administration's purview. They aim to utilize Naval unmanned systems test ranges, such as the Gulf of Mexico Unmanned Systems Test and Training Range, and enhance interagency cooperation. To formalize coordination, a memorandum of understanding with the Secretary of the Navy is proposed to incorporate Administration priorities into Navy research and development activities, facilitate partnership in procuring unmanned maritime systems, and establish test ranges and facilities. The Administrator collaborates with the Secretary of the Navy on development activities, including partnering to procure unmanned maritime systems and accessing test ranges. The activities are aimed at gaining efficiencies through collaboration and advancing the development of unmanned maritime systems. Other topics include mapping, bathymetry, observations, and ocean exploration. The activities are to be carried out at a co-located facility for better coordination. The Administrator and the Secretary of the Navy collaborate on activities to advance unmanned maritime systems, including research, testing, modifications, and integration. They may utilize the National Oceanographic Partnership Program for interagency coordination and coordinate with academic research institutions. The Administrator and the Secretary of the Navy may coordinate with academic research institutions for research, training, and commercialization of unmanned maritime systems. This includes maximizing research opportunities, providing education programs, and facilitating public-private partnerships for testing and certification of operational capacity. The Administrator and the Secretary of the Navy may coordinate with academic institutions to support testing, training, and commercialization of unmanned maritime systems. This includes arranging access to facilities, engaging with other academic institutions, promoting information sharing, and coordinating with the private sector for commercialization support. The Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of the Navy, may coordinate with the private sector to support the commercialization of unmanned maritime systems and assess their availability for Navy and Administration missions. Additionally, the Administrator will regularly assess publicly and commercially available unmanned maritime systems for potential use in supporting National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration missions. The Administrator, in coordination with the Secretary of the Navy, may work with the private sector to commercialize unmanned maritime systems for Navy and Administration missions. The Administrator will assess the suitability, feasibility, and cost-effectiveness of unmanned maritime systems for data specifications required by Administration programs. Additionally, assessments will be conducted to determine the operational reliability, feasibility, and cost-effectiveness of unmanned maritime systems for making observations needed by Administration programs. The Assistant Administrator and Director will convene the Unmanned Maritime Systems Ocean Technology Coordinating Committee and consult with other offices of the Administration, the academic sector, and developers. The Administrator will coordinate the acquisition of unmanned maritime systems to meet data requirements identified by OAR and OMAO. They may develop a memorandum of agreement with the Secretary of the Navy for procurement and acceptance of decommissioned systems. The Administrator may develop a memorandum of agreement with the Secretary of the Navy to participate in procurements, accept decommissioned unmanned maritime systems, share policies, and create efficiency in Federal acquisition. Reports on unmanned maritime systems usage for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's mission must be submitted to Congress every four years. The Administrator must submit reports to Congress every four years on the usage of unmanned maritime systems for the Administration's mission. Reports include an inventory of current systems, data summaries, benefits, data requirements, and available systems. Appropriate committees of Congress are defined as the Committee on Appropriations, Armed Services, and Commerce, Science, and Transportation. SEC. 7. FUNDING AND ADDITIONAL AUTHORITIES. The Administrator will use existing funds for this Act and may enter contracts with governments, accept donations, and utilize the National Oceanographic Partnership Program. The Administrator may accept donations, services, and funds from other Federal departments and agencies, utilize the National Oceanographic Partnership Program, transfer funds to organizations, and use resources from various government entities. The curr_chunk is about the roles of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Vice President of the United States as President of the Senate."
