    "content": "SECTION 1. CREDIT FOR PURCHASE OF PRINCIPAL RESIDENCE BY FIRST-TIME HOMEBUYER. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to include a new section for the purchase of a principal residence by a first-time homebuyer. The new section in the Internal Revenue Code allows a credit for first-time homebuyers equal to 10% of the purchase price of their first principal residence, capped at $2,500. A first-time homebuyer is defined as an individual who has not owned a principal residence in the past 3 years. The definition of a first-time homebuyer is clarified as an individual who has not owned a principal residence in the past 3 years. Additionally, all individuals purchasing a residence are treated as one individual for determining the maximum credit under the new section in the Internal Revenue Code. The eligibility period for a first-time homebuyer is defined as a 1-year period starting from the enactment of the section. During this period, if the purchaser enters into a binding contract to purchase a residence, it will be considered as purchased within the eligibility period. The term 'purchase' refers to acquiring property, as long as it is not acquired from a disqualified person and the basis of the property is not determined in a specific way. A binding contract to purchase a residence within 3 months after the eligibility period is considered purchased. The term 'purchase price' refers to the adjusted basis of a residence at the time of acquisition. The definition of 'principal residence' remains the same as in section 1034. Unused credit can be carried over if it exceeds the limitation imposed by section 26(a). The excess credit from sections 21 and 22 can be carried over to the next taxable year, with a 5-year limit on carryforward. If a taxpayer disposes of property within 36 months of acquiring it as their principal residence, the credit may be recaptured. If a taxpayer disposes of their principal residence, the tax for that year is increased by the credit amount. If they purchase a new principal residence within the specified period, the increased tax is adjusted based on the credit claimed for the new residence. The tax credit for disposing of a principal residence does not apply in cases of death, casualty loss, or involuntary conversion. It also does not apply in cases of a disposition due to divorce or legal separation. The tax credit for disposing of a principal residence does not apply in cases of death, casualty loss, or involuntary conversion. It also does not apply in cases of a disposition due to divorce or legal separation. A new item is added to the table of sections for subpart A of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Code. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years ending after the date of the enactment of this Act."
