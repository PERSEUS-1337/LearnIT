The \"Rural Land Conservation Act of 1993\" amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 by addressing the estate tax treatment of land subject to a qualified conservation easement. If the executor elects, the value of such land (minus any debt) can be excluded from the gross estate. The term 'land subject to a qualified conservation easement' refers to land located near a metropolitan area or national park, owned by the decedent or their family, and can be excluded from the gross estate for estate tax purposes. The decedent or a family member must have owned the property for at least 3 years before their death, and a qualified conservation contribution must have been made on the property. Certain contributions are excluded, and a family member is defined for these purposes. For estate tax purposes, if a donor retained a development right when making a qualified conservation contribution, an additional tax is imposed on the first person disposing of the property after the decedent's death. The definition of a family member is the same as specified in section 2032A(e)(2). The additional tax imposed on the first person disposing of property after the decedent's death is based on the increase in estate tax liability if the value of the development right had been included in the gross estate. The tax is pro-rated if only a portion of the property is disposed of, and must be paid within a specified time frame. The tax imposed on property disposition is due by April 15 of the following year. A development right refers to the right to use land for commercial purposes not directly supporting conservation. The election for land subject to a qualified conservation easement must be made on the tax return and is irrevocable once made. Executors making this election must calculate and notify potential estate tax due. The executor must compute and file a 'Notice of Potential Estate Tax Due' for land with a qualified conservation easement. The filing must be done in the locality where the land is located, following the forms and manner prescribed by the Secretary. Additionally, there is an amendment to the Internal Revenue Code regarding the basis of property acquired from a decedent. The amendment to the Internal Revenue Code changes the basis of property excluded from the gross estate of a decedent under section 2031(c). This amendment applies to estates of decedents dying after December 31, 1992, including land subject to qualified conservation easements granted after that date. Gift tax on land with a qualified conservation easement. Gift Tax With Respect to Land Subject to a Qualified Conservation Easement: The transfer of land with a qualified conservation easement may not be considered a taxable gift, as per the amendment to Section 2503 of the Internal Revenue Code. This applies when the donor elects for this treatment, with specific definitions and conditions outlined. If the donor retains any development right when making a gift of land subject to a qualified conservation easement, an additional gift tax is imposed on the first person disposing of the property after the gift. The tax amount is based on the increase in gift tax liability that would have occurred if the value of the development right had been treated as a gift. The amendments made by this section apply to gifts of land subject to qualified conservation easements granted after December 31, 1992. SEC. 4 amends the special rule for qualified conservation contributions where surface and mineral rights are separated. It states that if the probability of surface mining on the property is remote, the contribution qualifies. The amendment applies to contributions made after December 31, 1992. SEC. 5 clarifies that a qualified conservation contribution is not considered a disposition. (a) Qualified Conservation Contribution Is Not a Disposition.-- Subsection (c) of section 2032A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to clarify that a qualified conservation contribution by gift or otherwise is not considered a disposition for tax purposes. This applies to qualified real property subject to a qualified conservation easement. (b) Land Subject to a Qualified Conservation Easement Is Not Disqualified.-- Subsection (b) of section 2032A is amended to ensure that land subject to a qualified conservation easement remains eligible for the alternative valuation method. The amendments made by this section apply to estates of decedents dying after December 31, 1992, which include land subject to qualified conservation easements granted after December 31, 1992."
