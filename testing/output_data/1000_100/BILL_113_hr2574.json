The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 requires distribution of an employee's interest within 5 years of their death for a trust to be qualified, with exceptions for eligible designated beneficiaries who will receive distributions over their life expectancy starting within 1 year of the employee's death. The employee's death or such later date as the Secretary may prescribe, then, for purposes of clause (i) and except as provided in clause (iv) or subparagraph (E)(iii), the portion referred to in subclause (I) shall be treated as distributed on the date on which such distributions begin. Special rule for surviving spouse of employee: If the eligible designated beneficiary is the surviving spouse of the employee, the date on which the distributions are required to begin under clause (ii)(III) shall not be. The rules for distribution of an employee's interest upon their death include provisions for eligible designated beneficiaries to receive distributions over their life expectancy. If the surviving spouse dies before distributions begin, the spouse is treated as the employee. If an eligible designated beneficiary dies before the distribution is complete, certain rules apply to the remaining beneficiaries. The rules for distribution of an employee's interest upon their death include provisions for eligible designated beneficiaries to receive distributions over their life expectancy. The term 'eligible designated beneficiary' refers to any individual designated as a beneficiary by the employee. Designated beneficiary of an employee upon their death can be the surviving spouse, a child under majority age, a disabled individual, or a chronically ill person.

Additionally, there are special rules for individuals not meeting the criteria mentioned above, such as being not more than 10 years younger than the employee. An individual described in clause (ii)(II) will no longer be an eligible designated beneficiary upon reaching majority age. Any remaining portion of an employee's interest must be distributed within 5 years after this date. Additionally, if an employee becomes a 5-percent owner after age 70 1/2, special rules apply. The amendments made by this section apply to distributions for employees who die after December 31, 2013. The amendment regarding employees becoming a 5-percent owner applies. Employees who become a 5-percent owner before January 1, 2013, and have not retired before 2014, will be treated as a 5-percent owner for the year 2013 for distribution purposes. The amendments made by subsection (c) apply to beneficiaries of employees who die before January 1, 2014, and certain existing annuity contracts are exempt from these changes. The Act defines a qualified annuity as a commercial annuity or one payable by a defined benefit plan, with substantially equal periodic payments over the lives of the employee and a designated beneficiary.
