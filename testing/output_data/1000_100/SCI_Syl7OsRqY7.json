    "content": "End-to-end neural models have advanced question answering, but recent studies suggest they assume answers and evidence are in close proximity in a single document. The Coarse-grain Fine-grain Coattention Network (CFC) is a new model that combines evidence from multiple documents. It includes a coarse-grain module for interpreting documents with respect to the query and finding relevant answers, and a fine-grain module that scores candidate answers by comparing their occurrences across all documents with the query. The CFC achieves a state-of-the-art result of 70.6% accuracy on the Qangaroo WikiHop multi-evidence question answering task. The Coarse-grain Fine-grain Coattention Network (CFC) achieved a state-of-the-art result of 70.6% accuracy on the Qangaroo WikiHop multi-evidence question answering task, outperforming the previous best by 3% accuracy. This model focuses on multi-evidence QA, aggregating evidence from multiple documents to answer questions effectively. The Coarse-grain Fine-grain Coattention Network (CFC) achieved a new state-of-the-art result on the blind Qangaroo WikiHop multi-evidence question answering task, with a focus on selecting candidate answers based on support documents and a query. The CFC combines coarse-grain reasoning, building a summary of support documents, and fine-grain reasoning, matching specific contexts with the query to assess candidate relevance. The model utilizes hierarchical attention to integrate information from support documents and candidates. The CFC achieves a new state-of-the-art result on the blind Qangaroo WikiHop test set with 70.6% accuracy, surpassing previous best by 3%. It also improves accuracy on the TriviaQA task by 3.1% for exact match and 3.0% for F1. The attention hierarchies in the CFC modules focus on distinct parts of the input, enabling better representation of long documents. Common errors in CFC include difficulty in aggregating references, noise in distant supervision, and challenging relation types. The CFC model consists of coarse-grain and fine-grain modules for reasoning strategies. The coarse-grain module summarizes support documents using coattention and self-attention, while the fine-grain module retrieves specific contexts for each candidate. This division of labor allows attention hierarchies to focus on different parts of the input, effectively representing potentially long support documents. The CFC model includes coarse-grain and fine-grain modules for reasoning strategies. The coarse-grain module summarizes support documents using coattention and self-attention. It encodes sequences with bidirectional GRUs and builds codependent representations of support documents and queries. The CFC model utilizes coattention and self-attention to summarize support documents and queries, creating codependent representations. This involves computing affinity matrices, obtaining document context, and concatenating it with summary vectors to form the coattention context. The CFC model uses coattention and self-attention to summarize support documents and queries, creating codependent representations. It involves computing affinity matrices, obtaining document context, and concatenating it with summary vectors to form the coattention context. The coattention context is summarized using hierarchical self-attention, producing a fixed-length summary vector through a multi-layer perceptron. The CFC model utilizes coattention and self-attention to summarize support documents and queries, creating interdependent representations. It involves computing affinity matrices, obtaining document context, and concatenating it with summary vectors to form the coattention context. The summary vector is produced through hierarchical self-attention, resulting in a fixed-length summary vector via a multi-layer perceptron. The model then applies a self-attention layer to compute a summary vector of all support documents, which is multiplied with the candidate answer's summary to generate a coarse-grain score. The fine-grain module identifies the specific context of the candidate in the supporting documents using coreference resolution. The model utilizes coattention and self-attention to summarize support documents and queries, creating interdependent representations. It involves computing affinity matrices, obtaining document context, and concatenating it with summary vectors to form the coattention context. The fine-grain module identifies the specific context of the candidate in the supporting documents using coreference resolution. The model uses coattention and self-attention to summarize support documents and queries, generating interdependent representations. It computes affinity matrices, obtains document context, and concatenates it with summary vectors to create the coattention context. The fine-grain module identifies the specific context of the candidate in the supporting documents through coreference resolution. The model then determines the candidate's score by combining coarse-grain and fine-grain scores, and is trained using cross-entropy loss. The effectiveness of the model is evaluated on two tasks: multi-evidence question answering on the WikiHop dataset and multi-paragraph extractive tasks. The Qangaroo WikiHop task involves multi-evidence question answering by linking entities in a document corpus with a knowledge base, creating a bipartite graph. This dataset facilitates the study of question answering by using support documents to form paths between entities in the graph. The Qangaroo WikiHop task involves selecting the correct candidate answer from a set of plausible candidates based on support documents. The task uses unmasked and masked versions of WikiHop to evaluate candidate answers. Data is tokenized using Stanford CoreNLP and embeddings from GloVe and character ngrams are utilized. Symbolic query relations are split into words for analysis. The CFC model achieves state-of-the-art results on both masked and unmasked versions of WikiHop, with a new best accuracy of 70.6% on the blind test set. It outperforms previous models by 3% without using pretrained contextual encoders. The division of labour between coarse-grain and fine-grain modules allows attention hierarchies to focus on different parts. The fine-grain module enables attention hierarchies to focus on different parts of the input, improving the CFC model's ability to handle long documents in WikiHop. The model's effectiveness is also tested on TriviaQA by decomposing the task into proposing candidate answers and reranking them. Ablation study on WikiHop dev set shows the impact of removing different modules and using different techniques. The CFC model is used for reranking answer candidates obtained from the BiDAF++ question answering model. Reranking with the CFC consistently improves performance, regardless of the correctness of the initial answer set. Overall, using the CFC results in a 3.1% EM and 3.0% F1 gain on the TriviaQA dev set, showing its effectiveness in refining outputs from question answering models. The performance contributions of the coarse-grain and fine-grain modules, self-attention, and bidirectional GRUs are shown in Table 3. Replacing self-attention with mean-pooling and bidirectional GRUs with unidirectional GRUs results in less performance degradation. The encoder's replacement with a projection over word embeddings leads to a significant performance drop, highlighting the importance of contextual encodings. The fine-grain-only model consistently under-performs the coarse-grain-only model across various dataset lengths. The fine-grain-only model outperforms the coarse-grain-only model on examples with many support documents or long support documents due to better entity-matching coreference resolution. Hierarchical attention maps show that coattention layers focus on similar phrases between documents and queries, while self-attention layers capture entity characteristics. The entity described in the document is characterized using attention maps. Coattention aligns the relation part of the query to the context in the text. The mentions in the query refer to locations in Richmond upon Thames. Summary self-attention focuses on relevant documents for the query. Top support documents are presented for the query about the country of origin of the troll. The top three support documents focus on information about the literary work \"The Troll\", its author Julia Donaldson, and Old Norse. Coarse-grain summary self-attention and fine-grain coattention over mention representations are illustrated in figures. Attention maps of more examples can be found in the Appendix. The CFC examined 100 errors on the WikiHop development set, categorizing them into four types. The first type (42% of errors) is due to the model aggregating the wrong reference. The second type (28% of errors) results from unanswerable questions. Ways to reduce errors include using robust pretrained contextual encoders and coreference resolution. The support documents do not provide the narrative location of the play \"The Beloved Vagabond\" for the query. Errors in the WikiHop dataset are categorized into four types, including queries with multiple correct answers and complex relation types. Using tunable symbolic embeddings can help alleviate errors in question answering tasks. The Qangaroo WikiHop dataset challenges question answering models to reason over multiple pieces of evidence across documents, unlike traditional QA tasks. Query-focused multi-document summarization also requires aggregating information from multiple documents. Large-scale QA datasets have spurred the development of end-to-end QA models. Recent developments in large-scale QA datasets have led to the creation of various end-to-end QA models, including document attention models, multi-hop memory networks, cross-sequence attention models, and the use of reinforcement learning. These models incorporate techniques such as convolutions, self-attention, and reranking to improve span-extraction output. Our work extends previous research on single-document QA to multi-evidence QA using attention mechanisms for information aggregation. Attention has been successfully used in various tasks like machine translation, relation extraction, summarization, and visual question answering. Self-attention has also shown effectiveness in textual entailment and coreference resolution. The CFC introduces a novel approach combining self-attention and coattention hierarchically to create effective representations of long documents. Coarse-to-fine modeling, gradually increasing complexity, is effective for handling long documents. This technique has been applied in various tasks such as question answering and semantic parsing. The CFC model combines coarse-grain and fine-grain reasoning for multi-evidence question answering, achieving 70.6% test accuracy on the WikiHop task. The modules focus on different aspects of the input and are effective for representing long documents. Simple lexical matching is used instead of coreference resolution systems, with potential integration for future work. The CFC model combines coarse-grain and fine-grain reasoning for multi-evidence question answering, achieving 70.6% test accuracy on the WikiHop task. Simple lexical matching is used for candidate token extraction in the document. The best-performing model is trained using Adam with specific parameters and a cosine learning rate decay approach. The model's accuracy is evaluated on the development set every epoch, with the best model tested on the held-out test set. The CFC model utilizes fixed embeddings and GRUs with hidden size of 100, along with dropout regularization at various layers. Attention maps from the CFC model on the WikiHop development split are included, showcasing fine-grain mention self-attention and coattention, as well as coarse-grain summary self-attention. The section includes identifiers and examples of unanswerable questions found during error analysis in the development set of WikiHop. It highlights 100 randomly sampled errors made by the CFC model on the dev split.
