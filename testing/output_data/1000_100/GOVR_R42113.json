In contrast, overall federal tax revenues have remained stable at around 17.7% of GDP since 1946. Individual tax revenues have also been relatively stable at around 8.1% of economic output. Payroll tax revenue has increased from 1.4% of GDP in 1946 to 6.0% in 2010, while excise tax revenue has decreased. The corporate tax revenue has decreased from 1.4% of GDP in 1946 to 6.0% in 2010, while excise tax revenue has decreased. The corporate tax has also decreased in importance relative to other revenue sources, now accounting for 8.9% of federal tax revenue. The decline in corporate tax revenues can be attributed to factors such as tax rate and tax base. The decline in corporate tax revenue from 1.4% of GDP in 1946 to 6.0% in 2010 can be attributed to factors such as tax rate and tax base. The effective corporate tax rate has decreased from 55.8% in 1951 to 28.4% in 2010, contributing to the decline in revenue. The analysis suggests that both the reduction in tax rates and the corporate tax base have played a role in the decrease in corporate tax revenues. The effective corporate tax rate has decreased from 55.8% in 1951 to 28.4% in 2010 due to a reduction in the top statutory rate and investment tax credits. Since 2004, corporations have been able to claim Section 199 deductions for certain activities, reducing the effective tax rate on corporate income. Changes to depreciation rules also contributed to lower effective tax rates, with enhancements like \"bonus depreciation\" in 2002 and 2009 to stimulate the economy. The effective corporate tax rates have generally fallen over time due to factors like accelerated depreciation and investment tax credits. However, there were spikes in the average effective tax rate above the 35% statutory rate around 2000 and 2007 during recessions. Businesses can use current losses to offset previous income. The carrying back of losses allows businesses to receive tax refunds by reducing taxes paid in previous years, lowering their average effective tax rate. Extending the carryback period from two to five years in 2002 and 2008 aimed to stimulate the economy. Decline in corporate tax revenue is not solely due to lower effective tax rates, but also because the nonfinancial corporate tax base has shrunk. The nonfinancial corporate tax base has shrunk as more business income is generated by partnerships and S corporations, which are not subject to corporate income tax. This shift has led to a smaller corporate tax base, with C corporations generating only 44% of business income in 2007 compared to 78% in 1980. The shift in business income from C corporations to S corporations and partnerships has led to a smaller corporate tax base. The popularity of S corporations increased after the Tax Reform Act of 1986, with S corporations representing 12% of businesses in 2007, up from 4% in 1980. Legislation increasing the S corporation shareholder limit made this form more attractive and practical. The profitability of firms in the corporate sector has significantly impacted the tax base due to a shrinking corporate sector. Economists use the profit to net assets ratio to measure profitability, which has decreased since 1966. Falling profitability has been more significant than changes in the average tax rate according to economists Alan Auerbach and James Poterba. The decline in nonfinancial corporate profitability has been more important than changes in the average tax rate in accounting for the reduction in corporate taxes. Possible reasons for the profit decline include a shift to more volatile industries, a change in the age distribution of corporations, and the shifting of profits to lower-tax countries. The decline in corporate tax revenues is attributed to three main factors: decreasing effective corporate tax rates, profit-shifting behavior among multinational corporations, and incentives for firms to reduce income for tax purposes. This trend has led to a decline in corporate tax revenues over the last six decades. The decline in corporate tax revenues is due to decreasing effective tax rates, profit-shifting by multinational corporations, and incentives for income reduction. The shift towards pass-through business structures and declining corporate profitability have also eroded the corporate tax base. The focus of corporate tax reform has been on reducing statutory rates and broadening the tax base to achieve revenue neutrality. Effective tax rates are typically lower than statutory rates, indicating the need for a revenue-neutral reduction in the top corporate tax rate. The reduction of the top statutory corporate tax rate may be possible in a revenue-neutral manner by broadening the base and repealing tax expenditures. Changes to tax preferences for noncorporate businesses and reforms to business taxation are necessary. Business activity may shift back to the corporate sector as the rate is reduced. Reforms to the taxation of American multinationals operating overseas could reduce profit shifting and expand the domestic corporate tax base. The text provides an overview of the mathematics behind calculating average effective tax rates. Table A-1 shows data sources and descriptions for variables used in the calculation. Equations with superscripts identify government levels and subscripts denote years. The equation for average effective corporate tax rate (AECTR) is presented."
