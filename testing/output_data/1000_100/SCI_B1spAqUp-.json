    "content": "Deconvolutional layers are commonly used in deep models for up-sampling, but they often lead to the checkerboard problem due to the lack of direct relationships among adjacent pixels. To address this, the PixelDCL is proposed to establish direct pixel relationships in the up-sampled feature map. This method can replace deconvolutional layers without compromising the model's trainability, although it may slightly reduce efficiency. Experimental results show that PixelDCL improves semantic segmentation by considering spatial features like edges and shapes, outperforming deconvolutional layers. In image generation tasks, PixelDCL can effectively address limitations and enhance outputs. Deep learning methods, including deconvolutional layers, are used in various artificial intelligence tasks like image classification and natural image generation. Deconvolutional layers are essential for up-sampling feature maps in deep models but suffer from checkerboard artifacts, limiting their capabilities. The PixelDCL method addresses checkerboard artifacts in deconvolution operations by reinterpreting the process and proposing a solution to improve the generation of photo-realistic images and smooth outputs on semantic segmentation. The PixelDCL method introduces pixel deconvolutional operations to address checkerboard artifacts in deconvolution. This new layer generates intermediate feature maps sequentially to establish direct relationships among adjacent pixels, improving semantic segmentation and image generation tasks. The proposed PixelDCL method effectively addresses the checkerboard problem in deconvolution, improving semantic segmentation and image generation tasks. It can replace deconvolutional layers in a plug-and-play manner, offering faster prediction times compared to PixelRNNs and PixelCNNs. PixelDCL can replace deconvolutional layers efficiently, overcoming checkerboard artifacts with an implementation trick. Deconvolutional layers are commonly used in deep models for tasks like semantic segmentation and generative models. The up-sampled output feature map is created by shuffling intermediate feature maps obtained through convolutional operations on input feature maps. The deconvolutional operation in 1D and 2D can be decomposed into several convolutional operations based on the up-sampling factor. Assuming a factor of two, a deconvolutional layer generates an up-sampled output from an input feature map. The intermediate feature maps are produced by independent convolutional kernels, showing no direct relationship between them. The deconvolutional operation generates up-sampled output from an input feature map using independent convolutional kernels. Checkerboard artifacts can occur due to the shuffling operation, leading to significant differences in adjacent pixels. To address this issue, pixel deconvolutional operation is proposed to add direct dependencies among pixels. The pixel deconvolutional layers address the checkerboard artifact problem in semantic segmentation by adding direct dependencies among pixels, making adjacent pixel values close to each other. This approach can replace deconvolutional layers without compromising the fully trainable capability. The iPixelDCL addresses the checkerboard artifact problem in semantic segmentation by adding dependencies among intermediate feature maps, making adjacent pixels on output feature maps directly related to each other. This approach aims to solve the issue to some extent by utilizing the relationships among intermediate feature maps and adjacent pixels. The iPixelDCL addresses the checkerboard artifact problem in semantic segmentation by adding dependencies among intermediate feature maps. This approach simplifies the dependencies among pixels, improving computational efficiency and reducing trainable parameters in deep models. The purple feature map is generated from the input feature map, while subsequent feature maps depend only on previously generated ones. The purple feature map is generated from the input feature map. The orange feature map depends on both the input feature map and the purple feature map. The green feature map relies on the input feature map, purple, and orange intermediate feature maps. The red feature map is generated based on the input feature map, purple, orange, and green intermediate feature maps. PixelDCL removes connections to avoid repeated influence of the input feature map, with only the first intermediate feature map depending on the input. In PixelDCL, the orange feature map only depends on the purple feature map, while the green feature map relies on the purple and orange feature maps. The PixelDCL method simplifies dependencies in feature maps, improving computational efficiency. Experimental results show better performance compared to models with complete connections. Pixel deconvolutional layers can replace deconvolutional layers in models like U-Net, VAEs, and GANs, offering enhanced up-sampling operations. Pixel deconvolutional layers (PixelDCN) replace deconvolutional layers in networks like U-Net, VAEs, and GANs for improved performance. They are used for upsampling in semantic segmentation and image reconstruction tasks. Experimental results show that PixelDCN outperforms deconvolutional layers in these networks. The PixelDCN layer efficiently implements pixel deconvolution by up-sampling a 4\u00d74 feature map to 8\u00d78. It involves generating purple and orange feature maps through convolutional operations, dilating and adding them, and combining them to produce the final output feature map. This process reduces sequential dependencies for better performance. The proposed pixel deconvolutional methods improve performance in semantic segmentation tasks using datasets like PASCAL 2012 and MSCOCO 2015. The models predict labels for each pixel without post-processing, showing consistent improvement in supervised and unsupervised learning settings. The U-Net architecture BID23 is used for training from scratch experiments, with four blocks in the encoder and decoder paths. The final output layer is adjusted based on the number of classes in the dataset, with the MSCOCO 2015 dataset having more classes than the PASCAL 2012 dataset. The baseline U-Net model employs deconvolutional layers in the decoder path for up-sampling feature maps. The decoder path in the U-Net architecture uses deconvolutional layers for up-sampling feature maps. The proposed pixel deconvolutional layers (iPixelDCL and PixelDCL) are compared to regular deconvolutional layers, with different kernel sizes and parameters. This allows for evaluation while controlling other variables. The DeepLab-ResNet model is fine-tuned from ResNet101 BID5 and uses external data for training, boosting performance on accuracy and mean IOU. Output is eight times smaller than input, recovered with three up-sampling blocks. Deconvolutional layers are replaced by PixelDCL and iPixelDCL. The U-Net models using iPixelDCL and PixelDCL show improved local information capture compared to regular deconvolutional layers. PixelDCL considers more spatial features, resulting in smoother semantic segmentation outputs. PixelDCL outperforms iPixelDCL with fewer training epochs, but they perform similarly with more training epochs. In semantic segmentation, PixelDCL is more efficient and effective than iPixelDCL, with better performance and fewer parameters. Models using PixelDCL outperform those using iPixelDCL in most cases. The evaluation results show that PixelDCL yields better pixel accuracy and mean IOU compared to regular deconvolution. Models fine-tuned from Deeplab-ResNet using iPixelDCL and PixelDCL perform better than those using DCL, with iPixelDCL showing the best performance. The dataset CelebFaces attributes (CelebA) is used for image generation with a focus on facial information. The image generation task aims to reconstruct faces without backgrounds using a VAE base model. PixelDCL is proposed to replace deconvolutional layers in the decoder, resulting in better image quality compared to the baseline model. PixelDCL in decoders effectively overcomes checkerboard artifacts in generated images. It establishes direct relationships among adjacent pixels, producing photo-realistic images without the issue. Results show PixelDCL's usefulness for generative models, considering local spatial information. Comparisons of image quality and training time are shown for VAE models using different up-sampling techniques. The U-Net models using iPixelDCL and PixelDCL take slightly more time during training and prediction than the model using DCL due to sequential generation of intermediate feature maps. PixelDCL efficiently solves the checkerboard problem in deconvolutional layers by adding direct dependencies among generated feature maps. This approach does not significantly increase training and prediction time, making it a viable solution for improving image generation quality. PixelDCL generates intermediate feature maps sequentially to establish dependencies, ensuring direct relationships between adjacent pixels on output feature maps. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in overcoming checkerboard artifacts and improving segmentation by considering local spatial features like edges and shapes. Future plans include integrating PixelDCL into a broader range of models, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs)."
