    "content": "In the design of deep neural networks, the focus has been on improving accuracy, resulting in complex architectures that are hard to deploy practically. To address this, new metrics like NetScore evaluate network performance based on accuracy, computational complexity, and architecture complexity. This study introduces NetScore as a universal metric for evaluating deep neural networks for on-device edge usage, aiming to provide a balanced assessment. The study compares NetScore, top-1 accuracy, and information density metrics across 60 deep convolutional neural networks for image classification on the ILSVRC 2012 dataset. Results aim to guide practitioners in balancing accuracy and complexity in deep learning applications. In the study, the focus is on balancing accuracy and complexity in deep neural networks. The information density metric is widely cited but does not consider computational requirements for network inference. There is a need for universal performance metrics that account for accuracy, architectural complexity, and computational complexity to improve network model search and design. NetScore is a new metric introduced in this study to assess the balance between accuracy, computational complexity, and network low accuracy. The results can serve as a reference guide for practitioners in the field. The deep convolutional neural networks evaluated include AlexNet BID22."
