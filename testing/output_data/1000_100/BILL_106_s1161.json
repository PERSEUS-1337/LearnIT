    "content": "The \"Economic Sanctions Reform Act of 1999\" aims to establish a framework for enacting unilateral economic sanctions legislation to promote U.S. national interests while minimizing adverse effects on businesses and workers. The \"Economic Sanctions Reform Act of 1999\" defines new unilateral economic sanctions laws and legislation as those enacted after the date of the Act, authorizing the implementation of unilateral economic sanctions by the United States. The term \"unilateral economic sanction\" refers to measures taken by the United States to advance foreign policy or national security interests, constraining economic activities of individuals, entities, or countries, as well as government programs and benefits. It excludes any obligations or commitments. The term \"unilateral economic sanction\" does not include any obligation or responsibility of the United States under an international agreement or other international regime. SEC. 4. GUIDELINES FOR NEW UNILATERAL ECONOMIC SANCTIONS LEGISLATION. Any new unilateral economic sanctions legislation should include a statement of the foreign policy or national security objective, provide authority for the President to refrain from imposing sanctions if in the national interest, ensure contract sanctity unless it hinders effectiveness, and authorize the President to consider the impact. The legislation authorizes the President to consider the impact of sanctions on innocent parties and to target sanctions narrowly. It also prohibits restrictions on humanitarian aid, agricultural exports, medicine, or activities aimed at changing targeted conduct, unless deemed in the national interest. The legislation authorizes the President to review sanctions annually, evaluating their effectiveness and objectives, seeking multilateral support for their continuation. The legislation allows the President to annually review sanctions, considering factors like multilateral support, costs, gains, and any decisions made regarding the authorities of the Act. SEC. 5. GUIDELINES FOR CONGRESSIONAL CONSIDERATION OF NEW UNILATERAL ECONOMIC SANCTIONS LEGISLATION. In considering new unilateral economic sanctions legislation, Congress should ensure complete information on costs and gains, consider international legal obligations, and assess consistency with existing sanctions provisions. When considering new unilateral economic sanctions legislation, Congress should take into account administrative costs and assess the likelihood of each sanction achieving its objective within a reasonable time frame. Additionally, they should consider the importance to US national interests, the impact on humanitarian conditions and activities, and the likely impact on specific countries. When considering new unilateral economic sanctions legislation, Congress should assess the impact on US national interests, humanitarian activities, relations with allies, and other foreign policy interests. They should also evaluate diplomatic efforts, the likelihood of multilateral adoption of similar measures, and the availability of alternative ways to achieve the same objectives. Imposition of sanctions in proposed legislation may lead to retaliation against US interests and harm US business, agriculture, and international reputation as a reliable supplier. SEC. 6. CONGRESSIONAL RULES OF PROCEDURE. The House of Representatives and Senate cannot consider new unilateral economic sanctions legislation unless it includes specific requirements. Any new sanctions legislation is considered a Federal private sector mandate and must be assessed for its impact on the US economy, including trade. The House of Representatives and Senate must consider the potential impact on US trade, employment, and growth, as well as the international reputation as a reliable supplier of products. This section is enacted by Congress as an exercise of their rulemaking power. The House of Representatives and Senate have the constitutional right to change their rules at any time, similar to any other rule of that House. SEC. 7. EXECUTIVE BRANCH ACTION. The President should adopt guidelines for imposing sanctions and establish procedures for public outreach. SEC. 8. RULES REGARDING SANCTIONS IMPOSED BY THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH OR BY STATUTORY ENACTMENTS. The President has the authority to suspend, terminate, or not impose sanctions if the gains for national interests do not outweigh the costs. If sanctions are refrained from or suspended, they can be reimposed with notification to Congress. President has the authority to suspend, terminate, or not impose sanctions with notification to Congress. Congress can disapprove the decision within 30 days. The President can suspend, terminate, or not impose sanctions with notification to Congress, who can disapprove within 30 days. Congressional procedures for joint resolutions are outlined in the Senate and House of Representatives. This provision supersedes other laws. The provisions of this section supersede any other provision of law."
