    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Nanotechnology in the Schools Act\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings section. The rapidly growing field of nanotechnology is generating breakthroughs that will benefit society by improving design and production. Nanotechnology is expected to have a positive impact on security, economy, and health in the US. To maximize benefits, the US must maintain leadership in nanotechnology despite competition from other nations. In 2003, students on temporary visas earned 32% of all science and engineering doctorates in the US, with foreign students earning 55% of engineering doctorates. To maintain leadership in nanotechnology, the US must invest in educating its students for nanoscience research and development. The Act aims to enhance the educational capacity of US schools and higher education institutions in nanotechnology by providing grants for necessary scientific tools like electron microscopes. The Act aims to enhance educational capacity in nanotechnology by providing grants for scientific tools like electron microscopes. SEC. 3 defines key terms. The Act defines \"eligible institution\" as a public or charter secondary school offering advanced placement or international baccalaureate science courses, a community college, or a 4-year institution of higher education. The term \"qualified nanotechnology equipment\" refers to equipment used for teaching nanotechnology in the classroom, manufactured in the United States with at least 50% domestic materials. The program authorized under Section 4 involves the use of qualified nanotechnology equipment for teaching purposes, with specific requirements for domestic manufacturing materials. The Director of the National Science Foundation will establish a nanotechnology in schools program to enhance teaching capacity. Grants up to $150,000 will be awarded to institutions for acquiring equipment and providing educational services in nanotechnology. The program aims to provide teacher education and certification in nanotechnology for students and faculty seeking approved degrees. Only a quarter of the grant funds can be used for software, educational services, or teacher education. The Act provides funds for undergraduate programs at eligible institutions through a grant application process overseen by the Director. Eligible institutions must apply within 180 days of the Act's enactment, with selection based on set criteria. To promote diversity and inclusion in grant distribution under the Act, the Director will prioritize selecting eligible entities in various locations, encourage historically Black colleges and universities, minority institutions, and institutions in EPSCoR states. Matching requirements and limitations apply to grant recipients. The Director may not award a grant to an eligible institution under this Act unless the institution agrees to provide non-Federal contributions equal to 1/4 of the grant amount. The matching requirement can be waived for institutions with no endowment or an endowment below $5,000,000. If a branch or institution receives a grant over $100,000, they are not eligible for another grant under this Act for 2 years. SEC. 5. ANNUAL REPORT AND EVALUATION. Each institution receiving a grant must submit a report on grant fund usage to the Director within a year. The Director will review these reports annually and evaluate the program every third year for its impact on students, faculty, and staff. Additionally, a report to Congress must be made within six months after evaluation. The Director must report to Congress within 6 months after evaluating the program, including recommendations on the need for Federal support. Authorization of appropriations for the Director to carry out the Act includes $15,000,000 for fiscal year 2008 and necessary sums for fiscal years 2009 through 2011."
