    "content": "The \"After School Education and Safety Act of 1997\" aims to improve academic and social outcomes for students by offering productive activities during after school hours. Congress recognizes the increased social risks faced by today's youth, the lack of supervision during after school hours, and the peak in violent acts involving youth between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. Academic failure consequences are more severe in 1997. The goals of the Act include increasing academic success, improving students' skills, promoting safe environments, preparing for workforce participation, and providing alternatives to negative activities. The Act defines \"school\" and \"Secretary\" and authorizes a program. The Secretary is authorized to award grants to schools for carrying out specified activities. Each school receiving a grant under this Act must conduct mentoring programs, academic assistance, recreational activities, and technology training. Additionally, schools may also choose to offer drug, alcohol, and gang prevention activities, health and nutrition counseling, and job skills preparation activities. These activities must take place after regular school hours during the school year. A school receiving a grant under this Act must conduct activities tailored to the needs of the population, students, and community. The activities should take place in a designated school building or public facility. The school is encouraged to seek volunteers from the business and academic communities, request computer equipment donations, and collaborate with state and local park and recreation agencies to avoid duplication of activities. SEC. 8. APPLICATIONS. Each school seeking a grant must submit an application to the Secretary, detailing how they will meet the goals of the Act, show collaboration among stakeholders, describe administration of activities, avoid duplication with other programs, and outline funding sources. The application for a grant must include a plan for obtaining non-Federal funding for the activities. Authorization of appropriations for the Act includes $50,000,000 for each fiscal year from 1998 to 2002."
