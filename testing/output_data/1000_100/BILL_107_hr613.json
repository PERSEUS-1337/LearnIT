    "content": "The \"Character Learning and Student Success Act of 2001\" (CLASS Act of 2001) grants funds for developing and promoting character education initiatives. Character education in schools focuses on improving students' character by teaching ethical values and virtues, promoting a compassionate society, and enhancing self-esteem while reducing the risk of negative behaviors. Character education in schools integrates ethical values and virtues into the curriculum, fostering responsible individuals and reducing the risk of negative behaviors. States and educational agencies are increasingly promoting character education initiatives, emphasizing the importance of effective methodologies and professional development opportunities for teachers. The implementation of character education in schools is being coordinated nationally through electronic means. A central source of information on the activities of States and local educational agencies is becoming increasingly necessary. Information on the effectiveness of initiatives at all levels and the advancement of character education is essential for student education. The Secretary is authorized to grant a single 5-year grant to the eligible organization demonstrating expertise on a national level. The eligible organization must have expertise in providing comprehensive information on character education policies, initiatives, and assessment at a national level.

Authorization of $750,000 for each fiscal year from 2002 to 2006 is provided. SEC. 3. GRANT TO CONDUCT CHARACTER EDUCATION RESEARCH. Congress finds that states and local educational agencies have received Federal funding for character education initiatives in schools, but there are minimal reporting requirements on their impact. The number of schools implementing these initiatives, their success, and the needs of schools already implementing them are unknown. Efforts should be made to assess the extent and effectiveness of character education in schools. Schools are implementing character education initiatives, and there is a need to assess their effectiveness and the use of Federal funds for these programs. The Secretary is authorized to grant a 5-year grant to an organization with expertise in evaluation, research, and developing character education initiatives in schools. The grant recipient must assess character education initiatives in schools, identify approaches, evaluate funding impact, and measure effectiveness. The grantee must submit an annual report to the Secretary detailing research progress, results, future needs in character education, and grant fund usage. $700,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2002 through 2006.
