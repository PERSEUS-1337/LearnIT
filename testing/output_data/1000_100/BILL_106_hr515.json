    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Child Handgun Injury Prevention Act\" and includes findings related to the prevention of child handgun injuries. The Congress finds that in the 10 years from 1987 through 1996, nearly 2,200 children in the United States aged 14 or younger died from unintentional shootings. The United States leads in rates of children lost to unintentional firearms-related death compared to other industrialized countries. In the United States, nearly 2,200 children aged 14 or younger died from unintentional shootings between 1987 and 1996. Additionally, children as young as 3 years old are capable of firing most commercially available handguns. Gunshot wounds involving handguns are common in unintentional firearms deaths among children. The study revealed that young children have the finger strength to fire a high percentage of commonly available handguns. Firearms in the US lack minimum safety standards, despite public support for regulation. Firearms and related safety measures are part of interstate commerce. Many trigger locks and similar devices are ineffective in preventing accidental firearm discharge or children accessing firearms during interstate commerce. Regulation of handgun discharge protection products. The Secretary of the Treasury will regulate handgun discharge protection products to reduce the risk of injury to children. Regulations will establish a minimum safety standard for these products, including those permanently installed in handguns. The Secretary of the Treasury will regulate handgun discharge protection products to prevent children from operating a handgun. The standard will require quality construction and a method of access like a key or combination. Test protocols for poison prevention packaging standards may be considered. The standard must be issued within 12 months of the enactment of the Act. The standard issued under subsection (b) must meet the requirements within 6 months of issuance. SEC. 4. ORDERS; INSPECTIONS. The Secretary has the authority to issue orders prohibiting the manufacture, sale, transfer, or delivery of handgun discharge protection products that violate the Act. They can also require the recall, repair, or replacement of such products and provide notice of associated risks to the public. The manufacturer or dealer of a product must take actions such as bringing the product into compliance with regulations, repairing or replacing the product, refunding the purchase price, recalling the product, or submitting a plan for implementation of required actions. The Secretary may conduct inspections to ensure compliance with the Act and its regulations, including entering places where handgun discharge protection products are manufactured, stored, or transported for commercial purposes. SEC. 5 of the Act makes it unlawful for licensed manufacturers, importers, and dealers to sell handguns without a handgun discharge protection product that meets the standard. There is an exception for sales to government agencies. Additionally, SEC. 6 requires warning labels for handguns. SEC. 6 of the Act mandates warning labels for handguns, stating that children can operate handguns and cause severe harm. The label advises keeping handguns locked and unloaded to prevent access. SEC. 6 of the Act requires warning labels on handguns to prevent children from accessing and operating them. The label must be in contrast with other packaging and include specific information. Handguns cannot be sold without proper packaging or descriptive materials. The section will take effect 60 days after the Act's enactment. SEC. 7 of the Act mandates reporting requirements for licensed manufacturers, importers, and dealers regarding any incidents of unintentional or self-inflicted gunshot wounds caused by handguns sold after the Act's effective date. The information must be reported to the Secretary if the incident resulted in death, serious injury, or medical treatment. The Act allows for civil penalties up to $10,000 for violations, revocation of federal firearms licenses for violations, and provides for private cause of action for damages in case of violations. Private enforcement of the Act allows any interested person to bring an action in federal court to enforce or restrain violations, with the possibility of attorney's fees awarded to the prevailing plaintiff. Compliance with the Act is not a prerequisite for pursuing remedies under it. The Act or any regulation under it does not exempt anyone from liability under common law or State statutory law. The Secretary's failure to act under the Act cannot be used in litigation. Criminal penalties, including fines and imprisonment, apply to those who knowingly violate the Act or its regulations regarding handgun discharge protection products. SEC. 9. NO EFFECT ON STATE LAW. This Act does not override State laws unless they conflict with it, and State laws providing greater protection for children regarding handguns are not considered inconsistent with this Act. SEC. 10. DEFINITIONS. This section defines terms such as \"handgun discharge protection product,\" \"children,\" \"licensed importer,\" \"licensed manufacturer,\" \"licensed dealer,\" \"Secretary,\" and \"handgun\" as per section 921(a) of title 18, United States Code."
