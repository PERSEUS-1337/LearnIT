    "content": "This report provides an overview of U.S. foreign assistance to the Middle East, including historical aid levels, specific country programs, and current issues. Congress authorizes and appropriates foreign aid, overseeing executive agencies' management of aid programs. The Middle East is a major recipient of U.S. economic and security assistance, making it a focus of congressional interest. Data sources include the Greenbook, appropriations data from CRS, executive branch notifications, and annual reports from State Department and USAID. U.S. foreign aid to the Middle East supports key interests such as Israel's relations with Arab neighbors, energy security, and counterterrorism efforts. Aid also backs peace treaties between Israel and Egypt, Jordan, and seeks a two-state solution for Palestinians. Military assistance is provided to Iraq and Lebanon. The United States provides military assistance to Iraq and Lebanon to counter Iranian influence in the Arab world. The region has faced upheaval since 2011, with civil wars and terrorist violence in Iraq, Syria, Libya, and Yemen threatening neighboring states. Al Qaeda and ISIS affiliates are fighting security forces, potentially reshaping the Middle East map. Only Tunisia has made progress towards stable democracy. Only Tunisia has made progress towards a stable democratic political system in the Middle East, but its gains are fragile due to a weak economy and continued terrorist violence. Questions remain about the level of resources the United States should allocate to address the region's challenges, with some changes in foreign assistance due to violence in Syria and Iraq. Congressional support for Israel and peace in the region has remained strong, while bilateral aid recipients have largely stayed the same since 2010. Since FY2012, over $4 billion has been allocated for the Syrian refugee crisis and new funding has been authorized for security assistance in the region to counter the Islamic State. Congress provided the Defense Department with three new train and equip authorities to address the threat posed by the Islamic State. The US has allocated over $4 billion for the Syrian refugee crisis and new funding for security assistance in the region to counter the Islamic State. Funding for conflicts in Syria and Iraq comes from new appropriations or authorized reprogramming from Defense Department accounts. The Administration is seeking $3.45 billion for State and Defense Department funding to address the conflicts in Syria and Iraq. Future appropriations may be affected by domestic-budgetary considerations. Total State Department, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs funding remained relatively flat at $51 billion per year during the Obama Administration. To address regional crises within budget constraints, officials utilized Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funds, exempt from budget caps. Recent years saw OCO designation for aid to Iraq, Syrian opposition, Jordan, and multilateral accounts for humanitarian crises. Lawmakers are considering FY2016 funding amidst Budget Control Act implications. The House version of the State Department, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs bill (H.R. 2772) proposes $47.8 billion in total funding, including grant assistance and loan guarantees to non-oil producers in the region. The IMF has provided loans to Morocco, Tunisia, Jordan, and Yemen totaling over $9 billion, contingent on economic reforms. The Arab Gulf states have increased aid to the Middle East region to counter Islamist influence and ensure regime continuity. Gulf countries have given $30 billion to Egypt since 2013. Iran also provides assistance to allies in the region. The Administration has requested $7.14 billion in non-humanitarian aid for Near East and North Africa countries for FY2016, representing a 5.4% increase over FY2014. The FY2016 budget request for non-humanitarian aid to Middle Eastern countries is $365.1 million higher than FY2014 levels, with over 80% allocated to Israel, Egypt, Jordan, and the West Bank and Gaza. The budget includes assistance from various accounts such as Development Assistance, Global Health Programs, Economic Support Fund, and Foreign Military Financing. 95% of non-humanitarian aid is within the ESF and FMF accounts. The FY2016 budget request includes OCO funds for Middle Eastern bilateral aid and humanitarian aid for the crisis in Syria and Iraq, comprising one-third of all OCO funds sought. Congress did not provide specific OCO funds for countering the Islamic State in FY2015 but increased OCO funds in many accounts for Middle Eastern countries. The United States provides aid to Middle Eastern countries through regional programs like Middle East Regional (MER) and Near East Regional Democracy (NERD). MER focuses on women's rights, public health, water scarcity, and education with a requested funding of $40 million for FY2016. NERD promotes democracy and human rights in Iran with a requested funding of $30 million for FY2016. For FY2016, the Administration is requesting $30 million in ESF for NERD, a program supporting opposition activities in Iran. MERC, funded through ESF, promotes research cooperation between Israel and its Arab neighbors, with a requested funding of $5 million for FY2016. MEM, a State Department-managed program funded through ESF, focuses on multilateral efforts in the Middle East. Middle East Multilaterals (MEM) is a State Department-managed program funded through ESF that supports technical cooperation between Arab and Israeli parties on issues like water scarcity, environmental protection, and renewable energy. The Administration is requesting $1.4 million for MEM in FY2016. Trans-Sahara Counter-Terrorism Partnership (TSCTP) is a State Department-led initiative funded through multiple foreign assistance accounts to improve counter-terrorism capacity in 11 North and West African countries. The Administration is requesting $69.8 million for TSCTP in FY2016. The Administration is requesting $69.8 million for TSCTP in FY2016, with $13.4 million specifically for North African countries. MCC selects countries for assistance based on performance in ruling justly, investing in people, and economic freedom. In the Middle East and North Africa, Morocco and Jordan have received MCC grants. Morocco's first compact focused on private agricultural and tourism sectors, while the second compact aims to address secondary education and industrial land reform. Jordan's compact aims to increase water supply and improve water delivery and treatment. Critics have raised concerns about aid recipients' democratic indicators. Some critics argue that countries with poor democratic indicators should be ineligible for MCC aid. Freedom House suggested bypassing countries with low scores on political rights and civil liberties, like Jordan. Development analysts also believe Jordan should not qualify for aid due to its existing U.S. aid, access to private capital, and lack of democracy. The debate on aid eligibility has been ongoing for nearly fifteen years. The debate over funding democracy promotion in the Arab world has been ongoing since the \"Arab Spring\" of 2011. The U.S. reoriented its policy post-9/11, leading to increased diplomatic attention and funding for democracy promotion in the Middle East. However, amidst the Arab Spring, U.S. funding became a source of contention in countries like Egypt. As authoritarianism resurges in the Arab world, the U.S. foreign policy community is once again debating the role of democracy promotion in light of overall U.S. interests. The U.S. government lacks a centralized agency for coordinating democracy promotion in the Middle East. The Administration requested $442 million for democracy and governance activities in the region for FY2016, with funding coming from various sources including the State Department, USAID, and the National Endowment for Democracy. MEPI, funded by Congress, supports political reform, women's empowerment, and economic opportunity in the Arab world. It directly funds NGOs in the Middle East and North Africa through its Local Grants Program. In countries with restrictions on foreign funding, cooperation with U.S. officials and grant recipients may face risks. Egypt arrested and convicted NGO workers between 2011 and 2013. The State Department is requesting $70 million for MEPI in FY2016, with a history of annual allocations averaging $76-80 million. MEPI plans to continue supporting local civil society organizations with $8.5 million in direct funding. Israel has received $124.3 billion in U.S. bilateral assistance since World War II. Israel has received $124.3 billion in U.S. bilateral assistance, mostly in military aid.

Between 1948 and 2015, Egypt received $76 billion in bilateral foreign aid, including $1.3 billion annually in military aid. Egypt receives a significant amount of foreign aid, including $1.3 billion annually in military assistance. The President has requested $150 million in economic aid for FY2016, the same amount as FY2015. Aid to Egypt has been conditioned since the military's ouster of President Mohammed Morsi in 2013. The FY2015 Consolidated Appropriations Act includes provisions and conditions on U.S. assistance to Egypt. The FY2014 Act included a waiver for providing assistance to Egypt for national security interests. U.S. aid to Jordan totaled $15.83 billion from FY1951 to FY2015. A non-binding MOU was signed in 2015 for $1 billion in annual foreign assistance to Jordan from FY2015 to FY2017. The Administration is requesting nearly $1 billion in total aid for Jordan for FY2016. The United States provides economic aid to Jordan through cash transfers and USAID programs, totaling nearly $1 billion for FY2016. This aid is used to service foreign debt, support Syrian refugees, provide loan guarantees, and enable the Jordanian military to procure and maintain weapons systems. FMF grants support Jordan's Air Force with F-16 fighters, AMRAAM missiles, and Blackhawk helicopters for border monitoring and counterterrorism. Since the mid-1990s, the U.S. has provided over $5 billion in bilateral assistance to Palestinians for limited self-rule in the West Bank and Gaza. However, due to political concerns related to Israeli-Palestinian disputes, little to no aid has been given since FY2014. The Bush and Obama Administrations allocated between $100 and $200 million annually for budgetary assistance in the West Bank and Gaza, with the rest going to USAID programs. Future plans for funding, including potential budgetary assistance for the PA, remain uncertain. The U.S. has provided over $5 billion in bilateral assistance to Palestinians for self-rule in the West Bank and Gaza since the mid-1990s. However, aid has been limited since FY2014 due to political concerns. Currently, most bilateral funds for Gaza are dedicated to humanitarian and economic recovery needs. The Administration is seeking $442.0 million for West Bank and Gaza in FY2016, with $370.0 million for economic and development programs and $72.0 million for security assistance. Additionally, $3.45 billion is requested for responding to the crisis in Syria and fighting the Islamic State in FY2016. The U.S. is requesting $3.45 billion in FY2016 for responding to the crisis in Syria and fighting the Islamic State. This includes $1.82 billion in Department of Defense and State Department security assistance accounts, as well as $1.63 billion in multilateral humanitarian accounts. The majority of the request is for Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funds and includes Department of Defense train & equip funds, non-lethal aid to the Syrian opposition, FMF for the Iraqi army, and multilateral humanitarian aid. For FY2016, $715 million is requested for train and equip programs for Iraqis and $600 million for Syrians, drawn from Department of the Army Operations and Maintenance O&M-OCO funding.

In FY2016, $255 million is designated for assistance to opposition groups in Syria, with $65 million from the peacekeeping operations account and $160 million from ESF-OCO for non-lethal aid to Syrian opposition groups. The $255 million requested includes non-lethal assistance for Syrian opposition groups, justice sector support, law enforcement training, border security training, and weapons abatement initiatives. Additionally, there are plans for Foreign Military Sales of combat aircraft, tanks, and armored vehicles to replenish equipment lost to the Islamic State. $250 million is allocated for building up the capabilities of the Iraqi Security Forces against the Islamic State. The Administration's FY2016 budget request seeks $5.64 billion in global humanitarian assistance, including $1.63 billion in OCO funds for the crisis in Syria and Iraq. This includes $810 million for humanitarian assistance to Syria and Iraq, as well as $819 million for refugee programs. The United States has allocated over $4 billion for humanitarian needs since 2011, adjusting foreign aid policy in response to the changing Middle East region. The State Department and USAID have repurposed foreign aid for countries in transition or civil war, seeking more legal latitude and funding from Congress in FY2013 and FY2014. They proposed creating the Middle East and North Africa Incentive Fund (MENA-IF) to address the needs of Arab transition states. In FY2015, the Administration sought increased transition support funding for the MENA Initiative, using ESF and INCLE-OCO funds. Lawmakers had reservations about the broad spending authorities proposed. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 included language supporting the \"Middle East Response.\" The White House announced flexibility in transferring funds for unanticipated contingencies in U.S. foreign aid to Egypt, amid proposals to restructure assistance. Concerns include military aid not aligning with current threats and potentially perpetuating military control. The White House announced the resumption of weapon system deliveries to Egypt but will stop providing cash flow financing starting in FY2018. Critics argue that this financing undermines congressional independence, while supporters believe it is necessary for Egypt's military efforts. The White House announced the resumption of weapon system deliveries to Egypt but will stop providing cash flow financing starting in FY2018. The Administration's proposed policy change comes after a review of U.S. foreign assistance policy toward Egypt following the 2013 ouster of former president Mohammed Morsi. The decision to phase out CFF to Egypt may reflect a broader policy approach balancing national security interests and democratic principles in dealing with the military-backed Egyptian government. The White House announced resuming weapon system deliveries to Egypt but will end cash flow financing in FY2018. The proposed policy changes aim to shift the relationship away from traditional military aspects, with restrictions on arms sales and aid conditions for Palestinians. Public discussion on the President's policy changes has been limited. The US has enacted conditions on aid to Palestinians, prohibiting ESF aid if they support an ICC investigation against Israeli nationals. Congressional holds have delayed aid disbursement due to Palestinian statehood initiatives. The Palestinians have taken actions with the ICC regarding alleged crimes against Israelis. Some lawmakers want to suspend aid to Palestinians, but the State Department believes restrictions have not been triggered. U.S. support for Tunisia's transition to democracy is seen as crucial for regional stability. The Administration is requesting $134 million for Tunisia in FY2016 to support the coalition government, combat terrorism, and promote economic growth. This is more than double the FY2015 request, with 60% allocated for security assistance. Congress previously allocated $580 million in aid for Tunisia between FY2011 and FY2014. Both the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations have reported bills for FY2016 Foreign Operations Appropriations. The bills' committee reports include Middle East-related provisions. See Table 6 for a comparison of select provisions."
