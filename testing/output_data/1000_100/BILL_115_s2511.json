    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Commercial Engagement Through Ocean Technology Act of 2018\" or the \"CENOTE Act of 2018.\" The table of contents for this Act is provided. The \"Commercial Engagement Through Ocean Technology Act of 2018\" or the \"CENOTE Act of 2018\" includes definitions for terms like \"Administration\" and \"Administrator\" related to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's assessment and acquisition of unmanned maritime systems. Funding and additional authorities are also addressed in the Act. The \"Commercial Engagement Through Ocean Technology Act of 2018\" defines terms like \"cooperative activities of the Administration,\" \"data specifications,\" and \"test or training range\" related to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's use of unmanned maritime systems. The term \"unmanned maritime systems\" refers to remotely operated or autonomous vehicles designed to function without human presence, including control, communications, instrumentation, data transmission, and processing systems. The term \"test or training range\" may include specialized instrumentation for operating unmanned maritime systems and other types of systems. The term \"unmanned maritime systems\" encompasses unmanned undersea vehicles, unmanned surface vehicles, autonomous underwater vehicles, and autonomous surface vehicles. It also includes unmanned and autonomous aerial vehicles used for maritime purposes. The Administrator is tasked with coordinating the assessment and acquisition of these systems by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The Administrator, through the Office of Marine and Aviation Operations (OMAO), coordinates the research, assessment, and acquisition of unmanned maritime systems. The Unmanned Systems Executive Oversight Board (USEOB) is utilized for coordination within the Administration, ensuring representation from relevant departments. The Administrator, through OMAO, coordinates unmanned maritime systems research and acquisition. Coordination with the Navy is emphasized to leverage expertise and align with strategic priorities. The Administrator, through OMAO, coordinates with the Navy to utilize Naval unmanned systems test ranges and maximize interagency cooperation. A memorandum of understanding with the Secretary of the Navy formalizes coordination, incorporating Administration priorities into research activities and facilitating partnership in procuring unmanned maritime systems. The Administrator, through OMAO, collaborates with the Navy to utilize test ranges and facilities for various purposes, including unmanned maritime systems development and ocean exploration. The activities are carried out at co-located facilities to enhance efficiency and collaboration. The Administrator and the Secretary of the Navy collaborate on unmanned maritime systems research, testing, modifications, and integration. They also work on accelerating the transition from concept to manufacturing. Coordination with other federal agencies and academic sectors is facilitated for advancement in this field. The consortium of academic research institutions aims to maximize research and development opportunities for unmanned maritime systems, provide training in this field, facilitate commercialization through partnerships, and arrange access to facilities for testing and training operators in real or simulated environments. The Administrator may coordinate with academic institutions and the private sector to support the commercialization of unmanned maritime systems and facilitate information sharing for mission-oriented systems. The Administrator will regularly assess unmanned maritime systems for potential use in supporting National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration missions. This assessment will be science-based and focus on suitability, feasibility, and cost-effectiveness to meet data specifications required by Administration programs. The Administrator will assess unmanned maritime systems for operational reliability, feasibility, and cost-effectiveness to meet data specifications required by Administration programs. They will coordinate and centralize the acquisition of these systems. The Administrator will coordinate the acquisition of unmanned maritime systems to meet data requirements identified by OAR and OMAO. They may develop agreements with the Navy to participate in procurements, accept decommissioned systems, share resources, and create efficiency in federal acquisition. The Administrator will submit reports on unmanned maritime systems used by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, including data inventory and benefits realized. The reports will also prioritize data requirements for the Administration's mission. The Administrator will submit reports on unmanned maritime systems used by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, including data inventory and benefits realized. The reports will prioritize data requirements for the Administration's mission. The appropriate committees of Congress are defined in this section. Funding for this Act will be carried out using existing amounts appropriated or otherwise made available to the Administration. The Administrator may enter into contracts, agreements, and transactions with governments, accept donations and services, receive funds from other agencies, utilize the National Oceanographic Partnership Program, transfer funds to organizations, and use resources with consent for the implementation of the Act. The Administrator can utilize resources from various government entities, including the United States, State, local, tribal, foreign governments, or international organizations, with their consent and subject to availability of funds. The curr_chunk is about the roles of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Vice President of the United States as President of the Senate."
