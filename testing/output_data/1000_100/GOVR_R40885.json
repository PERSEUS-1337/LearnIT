    "content": "H.R. 3962, Affordable Health Care for America Act, passed by the House of Representatives on November 7, 2009, is based on H.R. 3200. The Congressional Budget Office estimates it would reduce federal deficits by $109 billion over 10 years and insure 96% of the non-elderly U.S. population by 2019. The Affordable Health Care for America Act, passed by the House of Representatives on November 7, 2009, includes provisions such as Exchange subsidies, increased federal Medicaid expenditures, and tax credits for small employers totaling $1.052 trillion. The net cost of the coverage provisions over 10 years is estimated to be $891 billion. Other spending changes are projected to save $427 billion, while increased federal revenues from income tax surcharges on high-income individuals are estimated to be $574 billion over the same period. The Care for America Act, passed by the House of Representatives on November 7, 2009, focuses on reducing the number of uninsured individuals, restructuring the private health insurance market, and setting minimum standards for health benefits. It includes provisions for individuals to maintain health insurance and employers to provide insurance or pay a payroll assessment. Market reforms such as modified community rating and guaranteed issue and renewal would be implemented. Acceptable health insurance coverage would be linked to both individual and employer mandates. The Care for America Act, passed by the House of Representatives on November 7, 2009, aims to reduce the number of uninsured individuals and restructure the private health insurance market. It includes provisions for individuals to maintain health insurance and employers to provide insurance or pay a payroll assessment. Acceptable coverage would include plans offered through the Exchange or outside through employer plans, grandfathered plans, and other coverage like Medicare and Medicaid. Subsidies would be available for individuals with incomes below 400% of the federal poverty level through the Exchange. The Care for America Act, passed in 2009, aims to reduce the number of uninsured individuals and restructure the private health insurance market. It includes provisions for individuals to maintain health insurance and employers to provide insurance or pay a payroll assessment. The bill would establish a Consumer Operated and Oriented Plan (CO-OP) program to encourage the creation of not-for-profit health insurance cooperatives. Revenues would be raised by limiting employer deductions for certain health insurance plans and modifying tax-advantaged accounts for health care spending. H.R. 3962, passed in 2009, aims to reform health insurance by prohibiting insurers from excluding individuals based on pre-existing conditions. The bill also includes provisions to alter how private health insurance markets function for individuals purchasing coverage directly or through small employers. In a system where individuals voluntarily choose health insurance, adverse selection can lead to higher premiums and uninsurance. Insurers guard against this by excluding preexisting conditions. AHIP suggests requiring individuals to purchase coverage to prevent adverse selection. Adequate premium subsidies may be necessary for those who cannot afford insurance. The curr_chunk discusses the individual mandate to obtain health insurance and the importance of various provisions in H.R. 3962 for market reforms. It includes topics like individual and employer mandates, private health insurance market reforms, and the Health Insurance Exchange. The removal of one provision could negatively impact the implementation of others. In 2008, 60% of the U.S. population had employment-based health insurance, while approximately 46 million Americans were uninsured. Individuals may obtain health coverage through private sector or publicly funded programs like Medicare or Medicaid. There is no federal law mandating individuals to have health insurance or employers to offer it. In 2008, an estimated 46 million Americans were uninsured. The private health insurance market is divided into three segments: large group, small group, and nongroup. Large employers, who make up over 95% of the market, can offer lower premiums due to economies of scale and a larger risk pool. Employers provide substantial subsidies for health insurance, attracting both healthy and sick workers. States have tried to create a centralized platform for individuals to access coverage. States have experimented with creating a single site for individuals and small employers to compare insurance plans and obtain coverage. Past experiments like California's PacAdvantage failed, but states like Massachusetts have developed more sustainable models. Private-sector companies like eHealthInsurance also help individuals and small groups compare plans. Less than half of small employers offer health insurance due to cost, with limited ability to spread risk across a small pool being a major reason. Insurers view small firms differently than large employers. Small firms struggle to provide health insurance due to limited ability to spread risk across a small pool. Insurers see small groups as less stable than larger ones, making it harder for them to negotiate benefits and rates. Allowing small firms to purchase insurance through a larger pool could lower premiums for high-cost employees. Individuals in the nongroup market may face rejection or higher premiums based on their health status. In the nongroup market, individuals may face rejection or higher premiums based on their health status. Reforms in premium ratings could increase costs for some and decrease costs for others based on age, health, and behaviors. States primarily regulate the private health insurance market, with federal regulations mostly impacting employer-sponsored health insurance. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requires small group coverage to be sold on a guaranteed issue basis. In the small group and individual markets, states regulate insurance carriers with premium rating rules ranging from pure community rating to adjusted community rating. Only two states use pure community rating in nongroup markets, while New York imposes pure community rating rules in the small group market. Adjusted community rating prohibits issuers from pricing health insurance policies based on health factors, allowing it for other key factors like age or gender. Rate bands limit premium variation based on health within a specified range set by the state. Federal law mandates limits on excluding coverage for preexisting conditions in group health plans. As of January 2009, 21 states had preexisting condition exclusion rules exceeding the federal standard in the small group market. In December 2008, 42 states limited the period for excluding coverage of preexisting health conditions in the individual market. There are over 2,000 state-imposed benefit mandates for health insurance, with some federal mandates for group coverage. Congressional attention is on the debate over offering a publicly sponsored health insurance plan as part of market reform, with proponents arguing it could be less expensive and increase competition. Some opponents question whether a public health insurance plan would provide the government with an unfair advantage in setting prices and fear it might drive private plans from the market. Studies suggest that non-profit health insurance organizations perform better in quality measures compared to for-profit organizations. Non-profit health insurance organizations outperform for-profit ones on quality measures. Studies show this trend across various health plans, with health insurance co-operatives like Group Health Cooperative of Seattle and HealthPartners of Minnesota excelling. Advocates push for more co-operatives, citing their reinvestment of earnings into lower premiums for enrollees. Congressional attention has turned to incentivizing the creation of new health insurance co-operatives. Opponents argue that health insurance co-operatives may not be successful nationwide and question their ability to make insurance more affordable. Some provisions of the bill would take effect before full implementation on January 1, 2013, including prohibiting postretirement reductions in retiree health benefits and allowing individuals to keep COBRA coverage until the Exchange is operational. The bill includes provisions to allow individuals to keep their COBRA coverage until the Health Insurance Exchange is established. A temporary national high-risk pool program would provide health benefits to eligible individuals until the Exchange is operational. Health insurance issuers must provide a rebate if their coverage has a medical loss ratio below a specified level. Issuers must justify any premium increases to the Secretary and states before implementation. The bill allows individuals up to age 26 to stay on their parents' insurance plans, reduces lookback period for pre-existing conditions, prohibits domestic violence as a pre-existing condition, mandates coverage for congenital disorders, and bans lifetime benefit limits. The Secretary will issue guidance on prohibiting rescission in both group and individual markets. The bill mandates coverage for individuals up to age 26 on their parents' insurance plans, reduces lookback period for pre-existing conditions, prohibits domestic violence as a pre-existing condition, and bans lifetime benefit limits. The Secretary will issue guidance on limiting insurer rescission in group and individual markets, and establish a temporary reinsurance program to assist employment-based plans with providing health benefits. H.R. 3962 includes a requirement for most individuals to have health insurance with penalties for noncompliance. Acceptable coverage includes qualified health benefits plans, Medicare, Medicaid, military coverage, veteran's health care, services for Indian tribes, and other specified plans. Individuals must have acceptable health insurance coverage or pay an additional tax, based on a percentage of their income or the national average premium. Some may receive subsidies, while others are exempt from the mandate. H.R. 3962 would require employers to offer health insurance to their employees or pay into the Exchange, with exceptions. Employers include private-sector, churches, and government entities. Current employment-based health plans would be grandfathered for five years. Employers must offer health insurance meeting essential benefits package requirements after five years. They must contribute at least 72.5% of the lowest-cost plan for individual coverage. Employees will be automatically enrolled in the plan with the lowest premium unless they opt out. Employers must provide written notice and show compliance with health participation requirements. Employers must provide information to show compliance with health participation requirements, including offering enrollment in a QHBP or current employment-based plan, monthly premiums, employee details, and other required information. The Secretary of HHS could terminate an employer's health insurance election for noncompliance. Employers with aggregate wages over $750,000 not offering coverage would face an 8% excise tax. Smaller employers have different payroll assessment levels. Beginning in 2014, employers with aggregate wages above $750,000 would be assessed 8% of average wages for employees who decline the employer's qualifying coverage. This payroll assessment would not apply to employees covered as spouses or dependents in an Exchange plan. Full-time employees offered employer coverage would generally not be eligible for premium or cost-sharing credits. Certain small businesses may be eligible for a 50% credit towards qualified employee health coverage for up to two taxable years. The credit phases out as employee compensation increases from $20,000 to $40,000 and as the number of employees increases from 10 to 25. Employees with compensation over $80,000 are not eligible for the credit. Adjustments for inflation will be made starting in 2013. The small business credit for qualified employee health coverage is available for up to two taxable years, with a 50% credit. It phases out as employee compensation increases and the number of employees increases. The credit is not refundable and is only available to businesses with a tax liability. H.R. 3962 establishes new federal health insurance standards for qualified health benefits plans (QHBPs), including prohibiting coverage exclusions based on pre-existing conditions. The provision requires health coverage to be offered on a guaranteed issue and guaranteed renewal basis, prohibiting coverage exclusions based on pre-existing conditions. Guaranteed issue means every applicant must be accepted, while guaranteed renewal allows for coverage to be renewed. This does not ensure affordability, which is addressed in the rating rules. The insurance offered was affordable and would be addressed in the rating rules. Premiums would be determined using adjusted community rating rules, allowing variation based on age, premium rating area, and family enrollment. New non-discrimination and adequacy standards for insurers would be imposed. H.R. 3962 would establish new standards for insurers, including non-discrimination rules, network adequacy standards, and mental health parity rules. It would also require coverage for dependent children under 27, notification of any changes in coverage or cost-sharing, and prohibit cost-sharing on preventive services. Additionally, it would limit annual out-of-pocket spending, prohibit benefit limits, and require compliance with network adequacy standards and essential benefits package. H.R. 3962 would establish new standards for insurers, including non-discrimination rules, network adequacy standards, and mental health parity rules. It would require coverage for dependent children under 27, notification of changes in coverage or cost-sharing, and prohibit cost-sharing on preventive services. The bill would also limit annual out-of-pocket spending, prohibit benefit limits, and require compliance with network adequacy standards and essential benefits package. Additionally, it would allow states to form Health Care Choice Compacts for the sale and purchase of individual health insurance plans across state lines. The bill would establish new standards for insurers, including non-discrimination rules, network adequacy standards, and mental health parity rules. It would require coverage for dependent children under 27, notification of changes in coverage or cost-sharing, and prohibit cost-sharing on preventive services. QHBPs sold in multiple states under the compact would be required to cover at least the essential benefits package, comply with network adequacy standards, and be equivalent to the average employer health plan in 2013. The Secretary would provide grants to states for regulating health insurance coverage sold in secondary states. The essential benefits package required for QHBPs under the bill includes hospitalization, outpatient services, physician services, prescription drugs, mental health services, preventive services, maternity care, pediatric care, and durable medical equipment. The annual out-of-pocket limit in 2013 for prosthetics, orthotics, and related supplies would be $5,000 for an individual and $10,000 for a family. Cost-sharing levels would be established using copayments, covering 70% of health care claims. Plans through the Exchange could offer richer benefit packages as Enhanced, Premium, and/or Premium-Plus plans. Employer plans could also offer different options. The Health Benefits Advisory Committee (HBAC) would recommend cost-sharing levels for plans offered through the Health Insurance Exchange, incorporating innovation in healthcare and reducing health disparities. The Committee would develop cost-sharing structures consistent with actuarial values for different plan tiers. Public input would be allowed in developing recommendations. H.R. 3962 would federalize private health insurance standards and create a Health Insurance Exchange to facilitate the purchase of Qualified Health Benefit Plans (QHBPs) by individuals and small businesses. The Secretary would be required to adopt benefit standards within 18 months based on recommendations from the Health Benefits Advisory Committee (HBAC) or propose initial standards if recommendations are not adopted. The Exchange would not be an insurer but would provide access to QHBPs. The Exchange under H.R. 3962 would provide individuals and small businesses access to insurers' plans, similar to how Travelocity or Expedia offer flights. It would be overseen by a new federal agency, the Health Choices Administration, and funded by a Health Insurance Exchange Trust Fund. The Health Insurance Exchange Trust Fund, funded by taxes and penalties, would support a single state-based Exchange approved by the Commissioner. State-based Exchanges would receive federal matching grants, with a presumption of meeting specified criteria if operating before January 1, 2010. Beginning in 2013, new nongroup coverage could only be obtained through the Exchange, with the public health insurance option and income-based credits available. CBO estimated that by 2019, 30 million people would have Exchange coverage, with 6 million enrolling in the public health insurance option. Individuals would be eligible for Exchange coverage. Individuals would be eligible for Exchange coverage through the public health insurance option starting in 2013. Eligibility criteria include not being enrolled in a group plan through a full-time employer, Medicare, or Medicaid. Once enrolled, individuals can continue coverage until they become eligible for other programs like Medicare Part A or Medicaid. An annual open-enrollment period lasting at least 30 days would be offered, with special enrollment periods for specific circumstances. Employers with 25 or fewer employees would be Exchange-eligible in 2013, with the threshold increasing to 50 or fewer employees in 2014, and 100 or fewer employees in 2015. Larger employers could potentially participate in the Exchange starting in 2015, based on the Commissioner's discretion. Exchange plans must meet federal requirements and have standardized cost-sharing options. Plans include Basic, Enhanced, and Premium tiers with varying levels of cost-sharing for benefits. An entity can offer one plan in each tier in a service area. The entity can offer a Premium plan with lower cost-sharing for benefits in the essential package. Premium-Plus plans can also be offered with additional benefits like adult oral health and vision care. Plans must adhere to cost-sharing levels set by the Secretary but can vary by up to 10%. State requirements for additional benefits beyond the essential package would apply if the state reimburses the Commissioner. The Secretary of HHS would establish a public health insurance option through the Exchange under H.R. 3962. The public option would offer Basic, Enhanced, and Premium plans, with the possibility of Premium-Plus plans. Geographically adjusted premiums would be set to cover expected costs, including claims and administration. The public option under H.R. 3962 would have limited start-up funding, to be repaid within 10 years. It would negotiate payment rates for healthcare providers and services, with rates not lower than Medicare and not higher than other qualified entities. Medicare-participating providers could also serve the public option, with the option for physicians to be preferred or non-preferred providers. The public option in H.R. 3962 allows for preferred and non-preferred providers, with preferred physicians not allowed to balance-bill. Non-physician providers are also prohibited from balance-billing. The Secretary can use innovative payment methods and implement successful payment and delivery system reforms. No-risk contracts can be entered into for the administration of the public option, similar to the Medicare program. The administration of the Medicare program includes determining payment amounts, making payments, beneficiary education, provider consultative services, and communication with providers. A memorandum of understanding with the Secretary of Veterans Affairs is required for collecting costs of nonservice-connected care in VA facilities. Enrollment in the public option is voluntary, allowing individuals, including Members of Congress, to choose health insurance through any Exchange plan. The bill would require Members of Congress to pay 100% of the premium for Exchange plans. It also establishes a CO-OP program for non-profit health insurance cooperatives in the Exchange, with $5 billion authorized for grants and loans. Grants and loans would only be given to cooperatives meeting specific conditions. The cooperative offering insurance coverage must not have been affiliated with an insurance company before July 16, 2009, and must adhere to ethical standards. It should primarily issue QHBPs through health insurance exchanges, be licensed in all states it operates, and have governance determined by member majority vote. The cooperative operates with a strong consumer focus, using profits to lower premiums and improve benefits. Grants and loans prioritize cooperatives with statewide operations, integrated delivery systems, or significant financial support. Violations of program terms would require repayment of funds plus interest. Cooperatives can integrate across state lines. Individuals eligible for premium credits under H.R. 3962 would also qualify for cost-sharing credits towards their health insurance. These subsidies would only apply to Basic plans in 2013 and 2014, but could be used for Enhanced or Premium plans starting in 2015. Exchange-eligible individuals could receive credits if they are lawfully present. Exchange-eligible individuals under H.R. 3962 could receive a credit in the Exchange if they meet certain criteria, including being lawfully present, having a MAGI of less than 400% of the FPL, and not being enrolled in certain other health coverage plans. The premium credit is based on an affordable premium amount for individuals to pay. The affordable premium amount is a percentage of individuals' income (MAGI) relative to the poverty level, as specified in Table 2 for 2013. The Commissioner would adjust the percentages in the table so that the percentage of premiums paid by the government versus enrollees in each income tier remains the same as in 2013. The \"affordability premium credit\" would be the lesser of how much the enrollee's premium exceeds the affordable premium amount or how much the reference premium exceeds the affordable premium amount. The Commissioner would establish premium percentage limits based on income tiers, with a linear sliding scale. Affordable premium credit would be calculated monthly, and assistance would be provided for cost-sharing. Reductions in cost-sharing amounts and annual out-of-pocket maximums would be specified to align with actuarial values for each income tier. Table 3 outlines the annual out-of-pocket maximums for cost-sharing. The House bill includes provisions to set annual out-of-pocket maximums for individuals and families, with flexibility for adjustments by the Commissioner. Limits would increase over time based on premium growth. Additional payments would be made to insurers for reduced cost-sharing for credit-eligible individuals. Provisions in the bill aim to raise revenues for expanded health insurance coverage by limiting employer deductions and modifying tax-advantaged accounts for health care spending. The curr_chunk discusses provisions related to health care spending and coverage, including employer subsidies for retiree prescription drug plans. H.R. 3962 would require employers to coordinate subsidies and deductions for these expenses. H.R. 3962 would require employers to coordinate the subsidy and deduction for retiree prescription drug coverage, reducing the allowable deduction by the federal subsidy received. This provision is estimated to raise $2.2 billion over 10 years. Various tax-advantaged accounts and deductions for health care spending will be affected by the revenue provisions in the bill. FSAs and HSAs are tax-advantaged accounts that reimburse employees for health care expenses. H.R. 3962 would limit annual FSA contributions to $2,500 per person starting in 2013, raising $13.3 billion over 10 years. HSAs allow individuals to fund medical expenses on a pre-tax basis with a high deductible health plan. H.R. 3962 proposes changes to tax-advantaged health accounts like FSAs and HSAs. It increases the penalty on non-qualified distributions from HSAs to 20% and modifies the definition of qualified medical expenses. Qualified medical expenses for FSAs, HSAs, and HRAs may no longer include over-the-counter medications under the House proposal. H.R. 3962 would not allow over-the-counter medications to be covered by tax-advantaged accounts like FSAs, HSAs, and HRAs unless prescribed by a physician. It also addresses state laws on abortion coverage and prohibits discrimination against health care entities for not providing abortion services. H.R. 3962 prohibits discrimination against health care entities for not providing abortion services and restricts the recommendation and adoption of standards related to abortion in the essential benefits package. It allows coverage for abortions in certain circumstances where federal funds are permitted. The Stupak Amendment, adopted by a vote of 240-194, added restrictions on the use of funds authorized by H.R. 3962. It prohibits using funds for abortions unless the woman's life is in danger, or in cases of rape or incest. Nonfederal entities can purchase separate coverage for elective abortions with funds not authorized by H.R. 3962. The Stupak Amendment restricts the use of funds authorized by H.R. 3962 for abortions, allowing separate coverage for elective abortions with nonfederal funds. Premiums for abortion coverage must be paid with non-H.R. 3962 funds, and administrative costs covered by premiums collected for that purpose. H.R. 3962 requires health benefits plans to offer identical plans without coverage for elective abortions. Exchange plans cannot discriminate against healthcare providers unwilling to provide abortion services. States can receive incentive payments for implementing alternative medical liability laws compliant with the bill. The effectiveness of these laws is determined by their ability to improve the medical liability system. The state law would be required to provide for an \"early offer\" system, a \"certificate of merit\" program, and must not limit attorneys' fees or impose caps on damages. An early offer system allows a defendant to offer periodic payments for economic losses within 180 days after a claim is filed. If an early offer is not made, the injured party can proceed with a tort claim for both economic and noneconomic damages. The bill includes provisions for an early offer system and a certificate of merit program in medical malpractice cases. It also mandates that states use incentive payments to improve healthcare. The bill clarifies that it does not change state laws on legal standards or procedures for medical malpractice cases. The bill mandates QHBPs to provide information on end-of-life planning, including advance directives and physician's orders for life-sustaining treatment, while prohibiting the promotion of suicide or hastening of death."
