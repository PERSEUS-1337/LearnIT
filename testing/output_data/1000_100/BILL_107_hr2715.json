    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Rim of the Valley Corridor Study Act\". It includes findings related to the study. The Congress finds that the greater Southern California metropolitan region, the second largest urban concentration in the US, lacks sufficient park and recreation lands per population. This deficiency deprives residents of health benefits and increases the risk of crime. The Rim of the Valley Corridor surrounding the San Fernando and La Crescenta valleys offers various benefits like reduced crime, lower social tension, and increased educational opportunities for urban populations. It provides scenic, environmental, recreational, educational, scientific, and economic assets to Southern California, deserving increased protection for public benefit in the future. The Rim of the Valley Corridor, including the San Gabriel Mountains and adjacent areas, contains the endangered Mediterranean chaparral ecosystem and unique ecotones. The San Gabriel Mountains within the Angeles National Forest are managed for watershed, recreational, and habitat values, not for commercial exploitation. Private lands in the corridor are crucial for scenic and environmental purposes. The Rim of the Valley Corridor, including the San Gabriel Mountains, holds significant environmental and recreational value. Efforts to protect these resources have been hindered by a lack of financial and technical support from the Federal Government, despite progress made by local governments and the State of California. The Rim of the Valley Corridor is being studied for inclusion in the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. The Secretary of the Interior will conduct a special resource study of the Rim of the Valley Corridor in Southern California to evaluate its national significance and feasibility of becoming part of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. The study will follow criteria for potential inclusion in the National Park System. The Secretary will consult with the Rim of the Valley Corridor and Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area Advisory Committee during the study. Establishment of Advisory Committee.
