    "content": "The federal K-12 education assistance legislation, starting with the IASA in 1994 and continuing through the NCLB in 2001, has focused on providing flexibility for grantees. This report outlines the authorizations for state and local flexibility in administering federal K-12 education programs, including waivers of federal program requirements. State and local aid recipients meeting eligibility criteria may have program requirements waived, allowing for flexibility in the use of federal aid. This includes consolidation of programs, fund transfers, and waivers of specific requirements. These authorities mainly apply to federal aid programs under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), with limited application to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). The report focuses on federal involvement in K-12 education through the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), excluding the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). The ESEA programs are authorized through FY2008, with discussions on potential amendments and extensions by the 110th Congress. The report reviews federal K-12 education program requirements, special flexibility authorities for waivers, and concerns expressed by grantees. The report discusses special flexibility authorities for waivers of program requirements under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA). These authorities allow for waivers or exemptions from certain accountability requirements to ensure federal funds are used appropriately. Federal K-12 education programs focus on specific student populations, instructional services, innovative approaches, and subject areas. These programs have specific requirements but also offer flexibility in areas like instructional methods and grade levels. Federal K-12 education programs are categorized into specific areas such as student populations, instructional services, innovative approaches, and subject areas. These programs, including ESEA Title I-A, are often referred to as \"categorical\" programs due to their targeted focus. Additionally, there are federal requirements and guidance provided to state and local recipients of federal aid, with a distinction between \"requirements\" and \"non-regulatory policy guidance.\" Federal K-12 education programs, like ESEA Title I-A, have specific requirements for grantees to meet as a matter of law. These requirements, derived from authorizing statutes or federal actions, may appear as regulations in the Federal Register and Code of Federal Regulations. Program regulations supplement statutory language on complex issues where the U.S. Department of Education prioritizes specific actions by grantees. For example, ESEA Title I-A addresses curriculum content and pupil performance standards. In some cases, authorizing statutes explicitly require ED to publish regulations. The U.S. Department of Education publishes regulations for aid programs as required by authorizing statutes. Additionally, non-regulatory policy guidance, such as \"Dear Colleague\" letters, is provided for various programs. Grantees are not obligated to follow this guidance, which aims to address specific questions on fund usage and pupil selection. Grantees often treat non-regulatory guidance as equivalent to regulations, especially in competitive grant programs where certain priorities are set for preferential consideration in funding allocation. While not required, meeting these priorities increases the likelihood of receiving support. The priorities for grant competitions are typically published in the Federal Register, with a trend towards less voluminous regulations for federal education programs. Some programs have no regulations, relying on statutory guidance, while others have briefer regulations addressing fewer issues than in the past. After the early 1990s, program regulations for federal education programs addressed fewer issues, following a minimalist approach. The regulations focused on standards, assessments, accountability, schoolwide programs, private school participation, and fund allocation. The Department of Education aimed to regulate only when necessary, providing flexibility and clarification through nonregulatory guidance instead of extensive regulations. The Secretary plans to issue nonregulatory guidance for Title I programs to inform stakeholders about flexibility in meeting program requirements and accountability for federal aid funds in K-12 education. Three types of accountability for federal aid funds in K-12 education include target accountability, outcome accountability, and fiscal accountability. Target accountability ensures funds are focused on eligible localities and pupils, outcome accountability ensures funds are used effectively to improve student achievement, and fiscal accountability ensures financial integrity and prevents supplanting of state or local funds. The accountability measures for federal aid funds in K-12 education include targeting resources on high need pupil groups or specific localities, limiting fund uses to high priority services, ensuring funds supplement state and local resources, enhancing parental participation, implementing staff qualifications, reporting program activities to parents, meeting student achievement goals, and evaluating instructional services. Non-compliance may result in fund repayment or grant disqualification. The Education Department General Administrative Regulations (EDGAR) outline general requirements for recipients of federal education assistance, including financial management rules from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Other regulations cover civil rights, student privacy, and compliance for federal child nutrition programs. Federal regulations, including requirements for free or reduced-price school lunches, apply to LEAs and schools. State and local agencies have discretion in areas like grade levels and instructional techniques under federal education assistance. Complaints about instructional methods are typically broad, allowing for state and LEA discretion. Program-specific requirements under ESEA and related programs often face criticism for restrictions on fund commingling, resource use limitations, pupil targeting, eligibility thresholds, and outcome accountability. These restrictions aim to establish fiscal accountability. Restrictions on fund commingling, resource use, pupil targeting, eligibility thresholds, and outcome accountability under ESEA and related programs aim to establish fiscal accountability and focus limited federal funds on those with the greatest needs. The new outcome accountability requirements of NCLB are intended to improve the effectiveness of federally supported education services. The categorical approach of larger ED programs directs aid at high-need pupil groups, but this may lead to fragmentation of services, inefficient resource use, and partial treatment of needs. Instruction in separate settings may not always be the most effective approach. The traditional federal categorical approach in education has been criticized for focusing more on resources and inputs rather than improving student outcomes. Difficulties in implementing federal programs arise from varying educational policies and demographics in states and LEAs. Problems with categorical program structures may stem from misunderstandings of federal requirements or strict interpretations at the state or local level. These issues may result from efforts to target aid to students in need while avoiding problems with program monitoring and audits. The 1998 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report highlighted concerns from state and local education officials about the constraints on the use of federal funds, including difficulties in obtaining current and concise information on federal requirements. LEA staff often struggle with inadequate technical assistance in complying with program-specific and cross-cutting requirements for federal K-12 education assistance. The GAO report found that LEA staff often lack awareness of available flexibility, express concerns about meeting administrative responsibilities, and face challenges with timelines and management in federal K-12 education programs. Waivers are available for certain program requirements, but are limited in scope. Some federal programs offer waivers for specific requirements, with different types of waiver authorities available. These include Ed-Flex, Secretarial case-by-case waivers, schoolwide program authority under ESEA Title I-A, Innovative Programs block grant, and flexibility for small, rural LEAs. These authorities provide varying levels of flexibility in the use of funds for schools. The Ed-Flex authority allows the Department of Education to delegate waiver authority to states to waive certain requirements under ESEA programs. Initially authorized for six states in 1994, it was expanded to 12 states in 1996 and further modified in 1999. The NCLB of 2001 made technical amendments to this authority. The Ed-Flex authority, initially authorized for six states in 1994 and expanded to 12 states in 1996, was further modified in 1999. Legislation in 2006 extended Ed-Flex authority until the next reauthorization of ESEA Title I, Part A. No state has been granted Ed-Flex authority since January 2002, and the authority to grant it to additional states expired in FY2004. Recent congressional action addressed the expiration of authority for the 10 Ed-Flex states by January 2007. States with Ed-Flex authority retain it until ESEA Title I, Part A is reauthorized. Ed-Flex states must waive state and federal requirements for LEAs and schools, meet curriculum and performance standards, monitor performance, and submit annual reports to ED. No new states have been granted Ed-Flex authority since 2002. The Education Department has interpreted the Ed-Flex statutes as allowing states to waive certain administrative requirements of the General Education Provisions Act and the Education Department General. The Education Department General Administrative Regulations (EDGAR) and General Education Provisions Act (GEPA) requirements that apply to certain programs cannot be waived by Ed-Flex states, except if the Secretary of Education is satisfied that the underlying purposes are met. These requirements include fiscal accountability, equitable participation by private school pupils and teachers, parental involvement, allocation of funds, school selection, and civil rights compliance. Local waivers in Ed-Flex states must be approved by the SEA, ensuring that statutory requirements are still met. Waivers can be terminated if student performance is inadequate or declines for two consecutive years. States must report annually on granted waivers, including their impact on student performance. Beginning two years after enactment of P.L. 106-25, ED is required to include information on the effects of waivers on student performance in annual state reports made available to Congress and the public. However, subsequent reports have not been published by ED, and the 2001 report lacked details on the use of Ed-Flex authority by states and program impacts. The U.S. Secretary of Education can grant waivers to SEAs or LEAs under Title IX, Part D of the ESEA, allowing flexibility in meeting program requirements. Requests for waivers must include specific educational goals and methods for measuring progress. The U.S. Secretary of Education can grant waivers under Title IX, Part D of the ESEA for flexibility in meeting program requirements. Certain requirements cannot be waived, including prohibitions on using funds for religious worship or instruction, sex education, and eligibility requirements for charter schools. ESEA Title IX-D does not have the same waiver authority as the Ed-Flex program. The Secretary of Education can grant waivers under ESEA Title IX-D for up to four years, extendable if it improves student achievement. Waivers can be terminated if performance is inadequate or no longer necessary. The Secretary must publish waiver decisions in the Federal Register. The Department had failed to publish notices for several years but did so in response to a memorandum from the Office of the Inspector General. Between January 2002 and December 2006, the Department of Education granted a total of 197 waivers under ESEA Title IX-D. Most waivers were related to administrative cost limitations and fund obligation periods, with a few granted for specific circumstances like Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, growth models for progress, and providing supplemental educational services. Between January 2002 and December 2006, the Department of Education granted 197 waivers under ESEA Title IX-D, primarily for administrative cost limitations and fund obligation periods. These waivers allowed exceptions to ESEA Title I-A requirements for fiscal accountability, school selection, and allocation. The Secretary is required to submit annual reports on the effects and effectiveness of waivers granted, but it is unclear if any reports have been submitted. Another waiver authority affects schools in the Public Charter Schools program, allowing for flexibility in requirements. The PCS waiver authority allows for flexibility in requirements, with the exception of those associated with the definition of a charter school eligible for funds. Schools with 40% or more low-income students in the ESEA Title I-A program can conduct schoolwide programs with flexibility in fund usage. Federal aid provided under Title I-A and other federal K-12 education programs can be used for schoolwide programs to improve services for all students, as long as they meet the program's intent and address the needs of intended beneficiaries. Schoolwide programs are exempt from certain regulations, such as health and safety, civil rights, and fiscal accountability, with the exception of specific requirements. Funds must supplement, not replace, other federal and non-federal funds. Flexibility in fund usage is allowed for schoolwide programs under IDEA. The IDEA allows for the use of funds in schoolwide programs, which must still meet all programmatic requirements. The schoolwide program authority primarily applies to Title I-A, offering flexibility in combining funds without separate accounting. This flexibility is significant compared to traditional methods. The IDEA allows for schoolwide programs under Title I-A, providing flexibility in fund usage without separate accounting. The eligibility threshold for schoolwide programs was reduced to 40% of low-income pupils by the NCLB, leading to a rapid growth in the number of schoolwide programs. The NCLB reduced the eligibility threshold for schoolwide programs to 40% of low-income pupils, allowing high poverty schools to operate programs for all disadvantaged students. Questions arise about the effectiveness of this expansion and its impact on overall school services. The Rural Education Achievement Program (REAP) allows small, rural LEAs to transfer funds among selected ESEA programs. LEAs with low attendance or in rural areas can combine funds from specific ESEA programs for flexibility. The Rural Education Achievement Program (REAP) allows small, rural LEAs to transfer funds among selected ESEA programs for flexibility in using funds more effectively. This special authority is granted under various ESEA Titles to address the challenge of small grant sizes received by these LEAs. The REAP Flex authority allows small, rural LEAs to transfer 100% of funds among ESEA programs for flexibility. This authority includes more programs than the broader Transferability authority and allows for supplementary grants. The REAP Flex authority allows small, rural LEAs to transfer funds among ESEA programs for flexibility. A study found that approximately 51% of eligible LEAs participated in this authority in 2005-2006, mostly transferring funds from Titles II-A and IV-A to Titles I-A and V-A. This flexibility was deemed useful as formula allocations were often too small for substantial school improvement activities. Confusion was noted between REAP Flex and general Transferability authority at the LEA level. The general Transferability authority allows LEAs to transfer funds among ESEA programs for flexibility, but confusion exists on which authority is being used. ESEA Title V-A, Innovative Programs, is considered a block grant providing flexibility to states and LEAs in using federal aid funds for a wide range of educational activities. Title V-A funds are allocated to states based on population aged 5-17, with a minimum grant percentage for each state. SEAs must allocate funds to LEAs using state-developed formulas that consider enrollment, high-cost pupils, and disadvantaged families. The specific minimum percentage of funds that must be suballocated to LEAs varies depending on the program's aggregate funding level. States must suballocate at least 85% of the grant received under the program for FY2002 to LEAs. Most states are required to suballocate 100% of their Title V-A grants above the FY2002 level to LEAs, except for states receiving the minimum grant amount, which must suballocate only 50%. States can retain up to 15% of the funds for administrative costs, with the remainder used for specified programs and services. The Title V-A funds can be used by LEAs for various purposes, including pupil assessments, achievement standards, charter schools, school choice options, school repair, and statewide education reform programs. LEAs have flexibility in using the funds for innovative assistance programs listed in Section 5131. Title V-A funds can be used by LEAs for education reform projects, activities to improve academic achievement, and programs for disadvantaged students. The program was first enacted in 1981 as part of the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act. The Title V-A funds, part of the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act, can be used by LEAs for education reform projects, academic achievement improvement, and programs for disadvantaged students. A study found that recipient LEAs used funds for instructional materials, educational technology, and targeted academic services. Title V-A funds are often used for teacher professional development and school-based improvement efforts, with limited targeting towards high-need pupils or schools. Funding for the program has decreased significantly over the years, with the possibility of termination due to lack of advocacy for increased funding. The primary factors influencing fund allocation are long-term LEA plans and individual school priorities. Title V-A program funding has been supplemented by other sources, but its support is diffuse. Limited information on its effects may reduce funding incentives. It receives less favorable treatment compared to programs with targeted funds or proven educational outcomes. Amendments require states to submit annual summaries to ED. The NCLB requires states to submit annual summaries to ED on how assistance is improving student achievement or education quality. SEAs and LEAs can increase Title V-A funding by transferring funds from other federal programs. Additional provisions offer flexibility but have marginal impact compared to the flexibility authorities. The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB) provides flexibility for SEAs and LEAs in administrative convenience, including consolidated applications, plans, and reports for ESEA programs. It also allows for the consolidation of certain funds for federal program administration. NCLB expanded flexibility authorities for ESEA programs, such as lowering eligibility thresholds for schoolwide programs and allowing LEAs to transfer funds among ESEA programs. LEAs can transfer up to 50% of their formula grants among four ESEA programs, with restrictions for those failing to meet AYP requirements. States can also transfer funds among these programs, except for administrative funds. The Transferability authority allows LEAs to shift up to 50% of their formula grants among four ESEA programs, excluding administrative funds. States can also transfer funds among these programs, with limitations on administrative funds. The total appropriations for the programs subject to LEA Transferability authority in FY2008 amount to approximately $3.5 billion. The process is straightforward, requiring modifications to state or LEA plans and informing the SEA, with a wide range of purposes for transferred funds. The Transferability authority allows LEAs to shift up to 50% of their formula grants among four ESEA programs, excluding administrative funds. Participation in Transferability is relatively modest, with approximately 12-16% of LEAs participating in 2005-2006. Estimates of participation levels are complicated by confusion between REAP Flex and Transferability authorities. LEAs participating in Transferability often moved funds between ESEA programs, primarily from Title II-A and Title IV-A to Titles I-A and V-A. This was done to compensate for reductions in formula grants, target resources on underperforming schools, and take advantage of the flexibility allowed under Title V-A. Many LEAs did not participate in Transferability, citing various reasons. Under a new State and Local Flexibility Demonstration Act (ESEA Title VI, Part A, Subpart 3), up to seven states may consolidate their state administration and activity funds under various federal programs. LEAs often cited reasons such as lack of information, satisfaction with existing flexibility, or insufficient funding for not participating in Transferability. Under the State-Flex authority, states can consolidate funds from different ESEA programs for any authorized purpose. States must meet AYP requirements to maintain this authority, which can be terminated by ED for non-compliance. If all requirements are met after five years, the authority is renewed. Selected states must make agreements with 4-10 LEAs, with at least half serving high-poverty areas. LEAs with poverty rates of 20% or more can consolidate funds under local flexibility authority, aligning with state uses. Only Florida has been granted State-Flex authority but withdrew before implementation. No state has participated in the program yet. Up to 80 LEAs can participate in the companion \"Local-Flex\" authority. Under the State-Flex program, up to 80 LEAs can consolidate funds under the Local-Flex authority for five years. Funds from various programs can be used for any ESEA program purpose, with a 4% limit for administration. LEAs risk losing authority if they don't meet AYP requirements or comply with the agreement, but successful LEAs can have their authority renewed. Under the Local-Flex program, LEAs can consolidate funds for two-year terms if they meet established goals. Certain requirements, such as civil rights and fiscal accountability, cannot be waived. Participating states and LEAs must report on fund usage annually. Seattle, the only LEA in the program, had its eligibility suspended for failing to make AYP. Seattle has recently applied for a new Local-Flex agreement after failing to make AYP for two consecutive years. Despite limited interest, only one LEA has participated in Local-Flex, with no states in State-Flex. Barriers to participation include additional responsibilities, limited organizational capacity, and lack of information dissemination about the programs. A new round of competition for State-Flex and Local-Flex authorities began on March 18, 2004, with no set deadline. States and LEAs participating in these programs would receive preference in future grant competitions. These programs aim to improve teacher quality and academic achievement, especially for disadvantaged students, with higher accountability standards compared to Transferability authority. The State-Flex and Local-Flex authorities allow funds from various ESEA programs to be used for authorized purposes with limited program requirements. Participation is limited to a maximum of seven states and a few LEAs, but interest has been low despite multiple invitations to compete. The State-Flex authority has limitations in terms of fund usage. The State-Flex and Local-Flex authorities allow funds from ESEA programs to be used for authorized purposes with limited requirements. States are responsible for meeting administrative responsibilities, with a small share of funds available for state administration. LEAs in the state demonstration program may have diminished flexibility in fund usage. The State-Flex and Local-Flex authorities under the ESEA allow for flexibility in fund usage, with states having control over administrative responsibilities. LEAs in the state demonstration program may have limited flexibility due to alignment with state fund usage and specified use of Title V-A funds. The inclusion of the ESEA Title V-A Innovative Programs block grant in the Local-Flex authority is of limited significance as those funds can already be used for a wide range of activities. Comparing these authorities to earlier versions of legislation shows similarities in local flexibility demonstrations but differences in broader state and local flexibility. The Senate version of H.R. 1 proposed a flexibility/performance agreement authority that was not included in the final legislation. This authority would have provided greater flexibility than the State-Flex and Local-Flex authorities, with increased outcome accountability. However, it was more limited than optional performance agreement/grant consolidation proposals considered in the past. The H.R. 1/Senate flexibility/performance agreement authority allowed up to 7 participating states and 25 LEAs in other states. It covered a broad range of ESEA programs with higher funding levels, including Title I-A grants for Education of the Disadvantaged. Funds could be used for various activities, including those under the Innovative Programs block grant. Under the performance agreement authority, participating states could reallocate funds among LEAs to target concentrations of poor children. The Senate version of H.R. 1 required states and LEAs to exceed AYP goals by a statistically significant amount, ensuring achievement gains were not due to random variations in pupil scores. The report concludes with an analysis of selected cross-cutting issues related to special flexibility in federal aid funds for states and LEAs. These flexibility authorities allow states and LEAs to prioritize their own needs over federal priorities, with limitations on participation, program size, and requirements that can be waived. States and LEAs have the authority to waive federal program requirements in exchange for increased accountability based on pupil achievement outcomes. This flexibility, particularly under the NCLB, reflects a policy shift towards more accountability and flexibility in ESEA programs. The NCLB has various flexibility authorities, with REAP Flex being the most widely used among small, rural LEAs. These authorities require regular reporting on their usage and impact on pupil achievement, but specific data on achievement impact is limited. Common issues and restrictions with these authorities are discussed, raising questions about their effectiveness in addressing state and LEA concerns about program restrictions. The ESEA Title I-A schoolwide program authority is limited to schools with slightly above average low-income pupil rates. The Secretarial waiver authorities require individual requests to the U.S. Secretary of Education. LEAs must apply to their SEAs for waivers under the Ed-Flex authority. States and LEAs can transfer up to 50% of funds received under any program. The rural LEA flexibility authority is limited to exceptionally low-enrollment LEAs, with only seven states eligible. Local-Flex authority is available in a maximum of 80 LEAs, with limited flexibility provided. Certain requirements, such as fiscal accountability and ESEA Title I-A, cannot be waived under these authorities. The Ed-Flex flexibility authorities do not address the main regulatory burdens of states and LEAs, such as requirements under IDEA, ADA, child nutrition programs, and environmental regulations. Some SEA staff believe Ed-Flex is of limited value due to these limitations. Some SEA staff believe Ed-Flex is limited in value due to few waived programs and requirements. Others see it as promoting innovation and flexibility. New authorities enacted in 2001 and 2002 have been adopted during a period of increased flexibility in federal program requirements, especially in programs like ESEA Title I-A. The NCLB program consolidated various education programs, providing states and LEAs more flexibility in fund usage. The special authorities for waivers under NCLB are seen as marginally beneficial. Limited data is available on the use of these waivers, with some not clearly related to innovation or reform. Waivers granted under pre-NCLB authorities were used for few purposes, some unrelated to innovation. The NCLB program provided states and LEAs with more flexibility in fund usage. Waivers granted under NCLB were used to move funds between different education programs, with a focus on Titles I-A and V-A. Many LEAs used authorities like ESEA Title I-A and V-A to compensate for grant reductions, target resources on struggling schools, and utilize funds flexibly. Pre-NCLB flexibility waivers were commonly used to waive requirements such as low-income pupil thresholds, targeting funds on high-need schools, deadlines for standards adoption, and fund use limitations. The curr_chunk discusses limitations on the use of funds under ESEA Title I-A, including restrictions on schoolwide programs for schools with low percentages of low-income students. Concerns are raised about the impact of granting authority to operate schoolwide programs to schools with low poverty rates. The curr_chunk highlights concerns about the effectiveness of schoolwide programs under ESEA Title I-A and the potential dispersion of funds to low-poverty schools. Waivers could impact accountability requirements. The curr_chunk discusses waivers requested by LEAs and states to accommodate strict limitations on the use of funds, particularly related to teacher hiring and training. These waivers are less relevant post-NCLB enactment. The NCLB lowered the schoolwide program eligibility threshold to 40% of pupils from low-income families nationwide. The CSR and Eisenhower programs were consolidated into a more flexible ESEA Title II program. Limited information is available on the impact of special forms of flexibility on pupil achievement. States with Ed-Flex authority have submitted reports on waivers granted, but the information provided has been of limited value. The Ed-Flex authority enacted in 1999 has not yet published reports on the purposes or effects of waivers in states. Anecdotal information on achievement effects was included in a 1999 ED report, primarily focused on meeting state AYP standards. Supporters argue that Ed-Flex authority has supported standards-based reform by facilitating program coordination and strengthening planning processes. Ed-Flex encourages coordination of programs, streamlines administration, and supports resources for increased student achievement. Limited data on improved outcomes with flexibility granted. The ED's lack of information dissemination on the use of special flexibility authorities makes it challenging to evaluate their benefits and impact on pupil achievement. Efforts to compile and publish relevant information have been infrequent, hindering the assessment of the advantages and disadvantages of these authorities. The lack of information dissemination on special flexibility authorities by the ED hinders the evaluation of their impact on pupil achievement. The outcome accountability requirements associated with these authorities involve goals set by states and LEAs, as well as meeting state-established AYP requirements under ESEA Title I-A. The Ed-Flex authority granted to states lacks clarity and specificity in outcome goals, with limited oversight from the ED. Five out of twelve original Ed-Flex states had no specific objectives for LEAs or schools granted waivers. Only one state had outcome objectives linked to affected LEAs, schools, and pupils. The current flexibility authorities do not require substantial additional outcome accountability for participating LEAs and states. Instead, they emphasize consequences for failing to meet generally applicable outcome requirements. The current flexibility authorities do not require substantial additional outcome accountability for participating LEAs and states. However, states without special flexibility authority still face significant accountability requirements under the NCLB. Special flexibility authority provides an extra incentive to meet requirements and additional consequences for failing to do so, aligning with the nature of the flexibility authorities. The enhanced outcome accountability is limited but consistent with recent legislation like the NCLB. The NCLB legislation expands outcome accountability requirements and flexibility in federal aid funds for all states, LEAs, and schools. Proponents argue that increasing flexibility in fund usage can lead to improved pupil outcomes without the need for increased accountability. Critics question the justification for granting special flexibility authorities. Critics argue that special flexibility authorities lack sufficient accountability provisions and are often used for unproven purposes, while defending the importance of national accountability requirements."
