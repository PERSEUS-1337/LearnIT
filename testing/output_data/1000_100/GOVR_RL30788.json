Two appendixes supplement the information, with Appendix A listing CRS products on Senate procedure and Appendix B providing an overview of primary websites for accessing resources. Basic familiarity with Senate procedures is assumed, and official guidance is available from the Office of the Senate Parliamentarian. The Senate follows various principles in its parliamentary procedures, including deriving rules from multiple sources, having the power to make its own rules, initiating enforcement of rules by Senators, conducting business by unanimous consent, following precedents, and adhering to informal practices. Senate procedures are not only based on standing rules but also on other requirements imposed by different sources. The Senate's parliamentary procedures are derived from various sources, including the Constitution, standing orders, precedents, statutory provisions, committee rules, party conference rules, unanimous consent agreements, and informal practices. These sources are considered when answering questions about Senate procedure. For example, Rule XIX states the order of recognition for Senators, with precedence given to certain leaders and managers. The Senate's parliamentary procedures are derived from various sources, including the Constitution, standing orders, precedents, statutory provisions, committee rules, party conference rules, unanimous consent agreements, and informal practices. Rule XIX states the order of recognition for Senators, with precedence given to certain leaders and managers. The Senate's constitutional rulemaking authority allows it to determine its rules of procedure through amendments, new standing rules, standing orders, and rulemaking provisions in statutes like the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974. Familiarity with Senate practices is crucial for understanding how the Senate conducts its business. The Senate's rulemaking authority allows it to determine its procedures through amendments, standing rules, and statutes like the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974. The Senate can waive its rules by unanimous consent or suspend them by a two-thirds vote. Unlike the House, the Senate cannot supersede its rules by majority vote. The Senate can overrule a decision of the presiding officer by majority vote, setting a precedent for future rulings. A Senator must raise a point of order if a violation of Senate rules occurs. The presiding officer typically makes a ruling when a point of order is raised. The presiding officer in the Senate can make rulings on points of order, which can be appealed by any Senator. The Senate can then vote to uphold or overturn the ruling, setting a precedent for future decisions. Some rules require a supermajority vote to overturn the presiding officer's ruling. Informal practices and party conference rules in the Senate do not have the authority of Senate rules and procedures. These practices evolve over time and are enforced by each party. The Senate's standing rules emphasize the rights of individual Senators, such as the right to debate at length and offer relevant amendments. Senators often agree by unanimous consent to operate efficiently on legislation. The Senate often operates outside its standing rules through unanimous consent agreements, which are carefully crafted by leaders and other Senators. These agreements have the same authority as the Senate's standing rules and control how measures are considered on the floor. Unanimous consent agreements in the Senate have the same authority as standing rules, altering them when necessary. Precedents detail how rules are interpreted and applied, serving as important guidance for proceedings, similar to case law in effect. Precedents in the Senate are cited by Senators and the presiding officer to support or defend points of order, or to argue for or against appeals of rulings. These precedents influence the application of current Senate rules by relating past decisions to the specific case at hand. They are established through Senate votes on questions of order or when the presiding officer decides a question of order. Precedents are followed until the Senate decides to reverse or modify them. Precedents in the Senate are important for decision-making. Senate precedents based on a vote carry more weight than those from the presiding officer. Recent precedents hold more weight than older ones, and established patterns of rulings are more authoritative. All precedents must be considered in the historical context of Senate rules and practices. The Senate's precedents are crucial for decision-making, with some based on unofficial practices that have evolved over time. These practices, although not enforceable on the Senate floor, are often followed, such as respecting \"holds\" by individual Senators and giving the majority leader the authority to offer motions.
