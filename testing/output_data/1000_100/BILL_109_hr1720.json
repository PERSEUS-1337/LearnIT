    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Raw Sewage Overflow Community Right-to-Know Act\" and includes findings related to the issue. Congress finds that there are millions of cases of waterborne diseases in the United States each year, caused by inadequately treated sewage filled with harmful bacteria, viruses, and parasites. Swimming in contaminated waters can lead to various gastrointestinal and respiratory illnesses, affecting millions of Americans annually. The economic impact of beach closures due to pathogen contamination is estimated at $1 billion. The economic impact of beach closures due to pathogen contamination is valued at $1-2 billion annually in the United States. Economic losses from swimming-related illnesses are estimated at $28 billion annually. Better monitoring and reporting of sewer overflows could prevent millions of Americans from getting sick each year. Public health authorities are not always notified of sewer overflows that pose a threat to public health. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. Section 502 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to define \"sanitary sewer overflow\" as an overflow, spill, release, or diversion of wastewater from a sanitary sewer system, excluding combined sewer overflows and wastewater backups caused by blockages in privately owned building laterals. This definition includes overflows or releases of wastewater that reach or do not reach waters of the United States, as well as backups caused by blockages in a sanitary sewer other than a building lateral. SEC. 4. MONITORING, REPORTING, AND PUBLIC NOTIFICATION OF SEWER OVERFLOWS. Section 402 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to require publicly owned treatment works to implement measures for timely detection and public notification of sanitary sewer overflows that may impact human health. Publicly owned treatment works must notify the public, public health authorities, and other affected entities of sanitary sewer overflows within 24 hours of becoming aware of the issue. Additionally, they must provide a report to the Administrator or State within 5 days of the overflow. Publicly owned treatment works must report sanitary sewer overflows to the Administrator or State within 5 days, detailing the overflow's magnitude, suspected cause, steps taken to prevent recurrence, and measures to mitigate its impact. Additionally, they must include all sanitary sewer overflows in their monthly discharge monitoring report. Publicly owned treatment works must report sanitary sewer overflows to the Administrator or State within 5 days, detailing the overflow's magnitude, suspected cause, steps taken to prevent recurrence, and measures to mitigate its impact. They must also report the total number of overflows in a calendar year, including details of each incident, location, responses, and actions taken to avoid future overflows. States receiving reports must annually summarize reported overflows to the Administrator. SEC. 5 amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to include requirements for monitoring, reporting, and notifying the public of sanitary sewer overflows. SEC. 6 authorizes appropriations of $2.2 billion for fiscal years 2006 through 2012."
