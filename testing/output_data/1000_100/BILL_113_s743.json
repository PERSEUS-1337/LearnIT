    "content": "The \"Marketplace Fairness Act of 2013\" authorizes the collection of sales and use taxes. The \"Marketplace Fairness Act of 2013\" allows Member States under the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement to require sellers to collect and remit sales taxes for remote sales. Non-Member States have an alternative option. Non-Member States can require sellers to collect and remit sales taxes for remote sales if they adopt minimum simplification requirements. This authority begins at least 6 months after enacting legislation specifying the applicable taxes, products, and services. The Act specifies products and services exempt from taxes and requires states to meet minimum simplification requirements for sales tax administration. This includes a single entity for tax processing, audits, and a unified tax return for remote sellers. The Act mandates that remote sellers must file sales and use tax returns no more frequently than nonremote sellers. States cannot impose additional requirements on remote sellers compared to nonremote sellers for tax collection. Local jurisdictions cannot require remote sellers to submit tax returns or collect taxes beyond what is outlined in the Act. Additionally, there should be a uniform sales and use tax base among states and local taxing jurisdictions. The Act requires remote sellers to comply with sourcing definitions, provide taxability information, offer free tax calculation software, and establish certification procedures. The Act requires certified software providers to be approved for calculating and filing sales and use taxes in all qualified States. It also relieves remote sellers and certified software providers from liability for errors made by the software provider in tax collection, remittance, or noncollection. The Act relieves remote sellers and certified software providers from liability for incorrect tax collection, remittance, or noncollection due to misleading information. It also requires a 90-day notice of rate changes by the State or locality. The Act allows for a 90-day notice period for rate changes to relieve remote sellers and certified software providers from liability for collecting sales and use taxes at the previous effective rate. States can only require remote sellers with over $1,000,000 in total remote sales to collect sales and use taxes. The rules apply to ownership relationships designed to avoid tax regulations under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. SEC. 3. LIMITATIONS. The Act does not subject sellers to various taxes other than sales and use taxes, does not affect tax application, and does not change state authority to impose taxes. It does not create nexus or change nexus standards between a person and a state. Sellers can choose their software provider. States can still license and regulate individuals without permission from the Act. The Act prohibits requiring qualifications for intrastate business, imposing unrelated state or local taxes, or exercising authority over interstate commerce. It does not encourage new taxes, only applies to remote sales, and does not affect intrastate sales or the Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Act. The Act does not alter or preempt the Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Act (4 U.S.C. 116-126). SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS AND SPECIAL RULES. In this Act, a certified software provider is defined as a person who provides software to remote sellers for tax compliance and is certified by a State. The terms \"locality\" and \"local\" refer to any political subdivision of a State. A Member State is defined as a state under the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement, excluding associate members. The Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement defines terms like \"person,\" \"remote sale,\" \"remote seller,\" and \"sourced\" for tax purposes in different states. The remote sale is sourced to the purchaser's delivery location or address provided by the customer. If no location is specified, it is sourced to the customer's known address or the seller's address. States must comply with the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement. The Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement applies to states, territories, tribal organizations, and certain agreements adopted on November 12, 2002. SEC. 5. SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Act is deemed unconstitutional, the rest of the Act remains unaffected. SEC. 6. PREEMPTION. This Act does not limit any powers of State or local jurisdictions unless specified."
