    "content": "Since Burma's military junta transferred power to a quasi-civilian government in 2011, Congress has mostly deferred to the White House and State Department on U.S. policy towards Burma. Changes in policy have been made using executive authority, but additional changes may require direct congressional action. The Obama Administration has consulted with congressional committees and key Members of Congress on bilateral relations. The Obama Administration introduced a new approach to U.S. relations with Burma in 2009, including a willingness to engage in direct dialogue with Burma's ruling military junta and cooperate on international security issues. Congressional action may be needed for further changes in U.S. policy towards Burma. The Obama Administration aimed to cooperate with the SPDC on international security issues like nuclear nonproliferation and counternarcotics efforts. They sought a unified, peaceful, prosperous, and democratic Burma, pressing for the release of political prisoners, ending conflicts with ethnic minorities, and initiating a political dialogue for reconciliation and reform. Additionally, they called for Burma to sever ties with North Korea and abandon its alleged nuclear weapons program. Coordination with other nations was also a priority. The new U.S. policy towards Burma led to significant political changes, including parliamentary elections in November 2010 and the release of opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest. The SPDC transferred power to a quasi-civilian government in March 2011, following a new constitution largely written by the military. Since 2008, Burma's quasi-civilian government, led by President Thein Sein, has implemented political and economic reforms, including the release of political prisoners and repealing oppressive laws. In April 2012, parliamentary by-elections were held, with Aung San Suu Kyi's party winning 43 out of 46 seats. The Obama Administration responded positively to these developments by increasing high-level meetings with the Burmese government. The Obama Administration responded positively to promising developments in Burma by increasing high-level meetings with the Thein Sein government and easing many sanctions. This included appointing the first U.S. ambassador to Burma in 20 years, Hillary Clinton's visit as the first Secretary of State in over 50 years, and President Obama's visit as the first U.S. President while in office. Specific sanctions on Burma have been waived, with plans to increase U.S. assistance, including reopening the USAID mission after a 23-year hiatus. The political and economic situation in Burma remains serious despite reforms. Fighting between the Burmese military and ethnic-based militias continues, with human rights violations reported. Ethnic tensions have been uncovered, and oppressive laws still exist. The NLD was able to register. The NLD was able to register for the April 2012 by-elections, but other political parties face registration challenges due to members in detention. Despite prisoner releases, over 200 political prisoners remain in Burma's prisons. The 113th Congress may consider issues regarding Burma's political and economic development, including the government's commitment to democracy and human rights, ability to implement reforms, and collaboration with Parliament and military for reform. The United States' policy towards Burma is questioned for being too focused on the government and opposition leaders, neglecting relations with ethnic minorities. Concerns include the pace of sanctions easing, enforcement, aid provision, and alignment with the Asia-Pacific region strategy. The role of Burma in the geopolitical dynamics between China and India is also highlighted. The Obama Administration's Burma policy, influenced by a 2007 article in Foreign Affairs, focused on engaging with Burma's military regime while maintaining sanctions. Over time, the approach towards Burma evolved, with initial emphasis on direct engagement. The policy was criticized for neglecting relations with ethnic minorities and its alignment with the Asia-Pacific region strategy. Burma's role in the geopolitical dynamics between China and India was also highlighted. The Obama Administration's Burma policy initially expressed skepticism towards the Union Government but later became more optimistic, focusing on closer ties with President Thein Sein's administration. This shift possibly strained relations with Burma's opposition parties and ethnic groups. U.S. policy shifted to promoting engagement after the NLD agreed to participate in parliamentary by-elections in April 2012. In April 2012, U.S. policy shifted to focus on promoting progressive forces within Thein Sein government and isolating anti-reform individuals. U.S. officials now speak of a partnership with President Thein Sein's government, with President Obama expressing commitment to work together. This shift in approach also involved a move towards fostering further reforms in Burma. The Obama Administration's Burma policy has shifted towards promoting reforms and fostering a partnership with Thein Sein's government. There is debate among experts and interest groups on whether the administration is moving too fast or too slow in rewarding progress and hindering reforms with remaining sanctions. The Obama Administration's policy on Burma involves maintaining existing sanctions to push for reform, while also considering the possibility of implementing more targeted sanctions or easing restrictions based on progress in the country. The Obama Administration's policy on Burma involves maintaining existing sanctions to push for reform, while also considering the possibility of implementing more targeted sanctions or easing restrictions based on progress in the country. The political situation in Burma in 2010 led to the NLD and other pro-democracy parties boycotting the November elections due to unfair election laws. The SPDC transformed the USDA into a political party, the USDP, with Prime Minister Thein Sein as its leader. In accordance with the new constitution, ethnic militias in Burma were required to become Border Guard Forces (BGF) under the control of the Burmese military or risk losing ceasefire agreements and facing renewed hostilities. Conflict arose when some militias, like the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army and the Shan State Army-North, refused to join the BGF, leading to military offensives and a surge of refugees. This resistance sparked clashes between the Burmese military and various ethnic militias in eastern Burma. The Obama Administration's cautious response to Burma's political transition may have been influenced by reports of alleged nuclear activities in the country. The Obama Administration's response to Burma's political transition was influenced by reports of alleged nuclear activities in the country, including arms trade with North Korea and suspicions of a nuclear weapons program. Despite doubts about Burma's technical ability, the continuation of arms trade prohibited by U.N. Security Council Resolution 1874 was a major concern for the Obama Administration. The Obama Administration responded cautiously to Burma's political transition, criticizing the unfair parliamentary elections in November 2010 and the regime's detention of political prisoners, including Aung San Suu Kyi. The National League for Democracy in Burma was silenced and sidelined by unfair electoral laws and a partisan Election Commission. The United States will continue pressure and engagement strategies, urging the release of political prisoners like Aung San Suu Kyi and accountability for human rights violations. Following the transfer of power in Burma on March 30, 2011, Acting Deputy Department Spokesman Mark C. Toner criticized the flawed electoral process that allowed military regime figures to continue dominating the government. He urged Burmese authorities to release political prisoners, recognize the National League for Democracy, and engage in inclusive dialogue for reconciliation. The cautious approach towards Burma persisted during the early months of Thein Sein's administration and the establishment of Burma's Union Parliament. Derek Mitchell was confirmed as the first Special Representative for Burma in response to political developments in the country. The position, created by the JADE Act, had been vacant for over three years. The Special Representative is responsible for coordinating U.S. policy towards Burma and consulting with foreign governments and Congress. Burma's new government faced a mix of positive and negative developments in its early months. In May 2011, Burma's new government commuted death sentences to life in prison, released political prisoners, and made overtures for political reconciliation. However, there were concerns about a intercepted cargo ship suspected of carrying banned weapons technology and the Burmese Army breaking a ceasefire with the Kachin Independence Army in June 2011. In June 2011, the Burmese Army broke a ceasefire with the Kachin Independence Army, leading to fighting spreading from eastern to northern Burma. The Obama Administration expressed disappointment with the progress of the new Burmese government during this time. The Obama Administration expressed disappointment with the new Burmese government's progress, especially with former SPDC officials still in key positions. Ambassador Mitchell visited Burma in 2011, meeting with President Thein Sein, Aung San Suu Kyi, and ethnic group representatives. Discussions included human rights abuses and ceasefire negotiations with ethnic militias. President Thein Sein's announcement of a large-scale prisoner pardon in October 2011, which included the release of 6,359 individuals, including 241 political prisoners. Ambassador Mitchell and Assistant Secretary Michael Posner visited Burma in November 2011 to discuss political reform, ongoing conflicts with ethnic militias, ceasefire talks, and human rights issues. President Thein Sein signed a law allowing peaceful protests in Burma. President Obama expressed concerns about human rights in Burma but noted progress. After consulting with Aung San Suu Kyi, Obama sent Clinton to explore positive transition in Burma. Clinton visited Burma from November 30 to December 2, 2011. During her visit to Burma in 2011, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced new U.S. development programs, including an English language program, aid for victims of internal conflict, and academic exchange programs. USAID also planned to expand an anti-malaria program in Burma. These initiatives were permissible under U.S. sanctions in place at the time, as the Burmese government had started implementing political reforms and negotiating ceasefire agreements. The Union Parliament passed laws improving civil liberties, including the Labour Organization Law and Law Relating to Peaceful Assembly. President Thein Sein ended pre-publication censorship for certain topics but kept post-publication censorship. The Myanmar National Human Rights Commission was appointed to protect citizens' rights. Ceasefire talks continued amid fighting in Kachin State. Ceasefire talks in Kachin State progressed with agreements signed with various ethnic groups. President Thein Sein granted prisoner pardons in January 2012. President Obama waived a section of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act for Burma in February 2012. The Obama Administration allowed for technical support to Burma through international financial institutions, despite restrictions in the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003. In April 2012, Burma held a parliamentary by-election that attracted national and international attention. The April 2012 parliamentary by-election in Burma attracted national and international attention due to pro-democracy opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi and other NLD members running as candidates. Despite concerns about the election's fairness, Aung San Suu Kyi and 42 NLD candidates won seats, with the remaining seats going to other parties. The Obama Administration, along with Australia, Canada, and the EU, congratulated Burma on their electoral process and Aung San Suu Kyi's strong showing in the polls. Following the official results, former Secretary Clinton announced five steps to support reforms in Burma using existing executive authority and relevant laws. Former Secretary Clinton announced five steps to support reforms in Burma, including relaxing restrictions on private U.S. organizations providing nonprofit activities and easing trade and investment restrictions. OFAC approved a new general license for financial services to Burma for not-for-profit projects. The officials aim to ease trade and investment restrictions in sectors like agriculture, banking, tourism, and telecommunications to benefit the people and support reform in Burma. They are cautious about activities in sectors like gems and timber, as well as projects in ethnic minority areas opposed by locals. The plan involves using existing waiver authorities and rescinding executive orders, with no current intention to involve Congress. The Obama Administration announced significant developments in U.S. policy towards Burma, including the establishment of a USAID mission, support for UNDP projects, relaxation of restrictions on nonprofit activities, and facilitation of travel for Burmese officials. This involved invoking presidential waiver authority and delivering a presidential determination to Congress. Burma's Foreign Minister visited Washington, DC, at the invitation of former Secretary Clinton. The White House renewed sanctions on Burma for another year, nominated Derek Mitchell as ambassador, and eased bans on financial services and investment. Former Secretary Clinton detailed steps to allow American investment and export of financial services, aiming to promote responsible investment and deter abuses. The U.S. government is promoting responsible investment in Burma and easing bans on financial services and investment. U.S. investors can now invest in all sectors in Burma as long as the partner is not on the SDN list. Criteria for the SDN list will include evaluations of business practices and attitudes towards Burma's reforms. Clinton urged U.S. businesses to set a good example of transparent and responsible business practices. The Obama Administration released documents to ease sanctions on Burma on July 11, 2012. Executive Order 13619 expanded sanctions to target individuals threatening Burma's stability, involved in human rights abuses, arms trade with North Korea, or assisting in such acts. On July 11, 2012, the Obama Administration eased sanctions on Burma by lifting the ban on new U.S. investments and the export of financial services. President Obama delegated the authority to waive the investment ban to Secretary Clinton, who then passed it on to Deputy Secretary of State Thomas R. Nides. This waiver led to the creation of General License No. 17 by OFAC. OFAC released General License No. 17, allowing new investments in Burma by U.S. persons with limitations: no investments with Burma's Ministry of Defense or armed groups, and compliance with State Department reporting requirements. Investments do not require pre-approval but investors are liable for dealings with sanctioned entities. Reporting requirements include notifying the State Department of investments involving Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise within 60 days. OFAC released General License No. 17, allowing new investments in Burma by U.S. persons with limitations. Investments over $500,000 must be reported to the State Department annually by April 1. General License No. 16 permits the export of financial services to Burma, with restrictions on certain entities. General License No. 16 supersedes previous licenses and allows the provision of financial services to Burma without pre-approval from OFAC. Sanctions on certain Burmese nationals were imposed by President Obama via E.O. 13619, prohibiting visas, asset freezes, and financial services for those involved in threatening Burma's stability or human rights abuses. The Obama Administration implemented policy changes in Burma in May 2012. Despite some positive developments, there were also setbacks, including Vice President Tin Aung Myint Oo's resignation and stalled peace agreements with ethnic groups. President Thein Sein reorganized his negotiating team, but conflicts persisted in various parts of the country. In Rakhine State, rioting erupted in June. In Rakhine State, rioting broke out in June between Rohingyas and Rakhines, leading to deaths, destruction, and displacement. Despite the unrest, President Thein Sein pardoned political prisoners and ended pre-publication censorship in August 2012. In August 2012, Burma ended pre-publication censorship for printed materials but maintained post-publication penalties. President Thein Sein reshuffled his cabinet, possibly to consolidate political power. The debate over the oversight authority of the Union Parliament continued. The Union Parliament debated the authority of parliamentary bodies to compel ministerial officials to testify. The Constitutional Tribunal ruled against this authority, leading to protests and the resignation of tribunal members. The Obama Administration eased sanctions on Burma in September 2012. In September 2012, President Thein Sein and Lower House Speaker Shwe Mann were removed from the OFAC list, lifting financial sanctions. H.R. 6431 was passed to allow IFI assistance to Burma, signed into law on October 5, 2012. Secretary Clinton announced steps before meeting with President Thein Sein on September 26, 2012. On September 26, 2012, Secretary Clinton announced easing import restrictions on Burmese goods in response to progress towards reform. President Thein Sein addressed the U.N. General Assembly the next day, highlighting Burma's transition to a democratic government with checks and balances. He mentioned amnesties, return of exiles, and successful parliamentary by-elections as evidence of this change. President Thein Sein acknowledged challenges in Burma, including the cessation of armed conflicts and communal violence in Rakhine State. Chris Milligan was sworn in as USAID's Mission Director to Burma, focusing on democracy, human rights, governance, peace, food security, and health programs. President Obama delegated authority to waive U.S. opposition to IFI assistance to Burma to Secretary Clinton via a presidential memorandum. Clinton determined it was in the national interest to support assistance for Burma, effectively waiving the requirement to oppose IFI assistance. The World Bank approved an $80 million grant for community-driven development in Burma on November 2, 2013. The World Bank approved an $80 million grant for community-driven development in Burma on November 2, 2013, with the support of the United States. Assistant Secretary of State Michael Posner led a U.S. delegation for a human rights dialogue in Naypyidaw, including Lieutenant General Francis Wiercinski. The dialogue covered topics like rule of law, human rights protection, and military code of conduct. Burma was later invited to attend the Cobra Gold military training exercise in the Asia-Pacific region. The White House announced President Obama's brief stopover in Burma to meet with President Thein Sein and Aung San Suu Kyi, and give a speech on political reform. This visit would make him the first U.S. President to visit Burma while in office. Special Assistant Samantha Power noted progress in Burma since Secretary Clinton's visit in 1955. Since Secretary Clinton's visit in 1955, progress towards democracy in Burma has been noted. The US has responded with specific steps to recognize and encourage further reform, while updating sanctions authorities to target those who interfere with the peace process or democracy transition. Senior Director Power highlighted challenges faced by Burma, such as ethnic unrest, conflicts, justice system development, free press cultivation, and civil society formation. She also listed key issues likely to be addressed during President Obama's trip, including prisoners of conscience, political reforms, rule of law, and peace and reconciliation. On November 15, 2012, National Security Advisor Thomas E. Donilon endorsed President Obama's visit to Burma, supporting ongoing reforms and promoting progress. The State Department waived the ban on imports from Burma, allowing the import of products of Burmese origin. General License No. 18 was authorized on November 16, 2012, permitting the import of these products. President Obama's visit to Burma in November 2012 included meetings with President Thein Sein and Aung San Suu Kyi, as well as a speech at the University of Yangon, known for its historical significance in Burma's anti-colonial movement. In his speech, President Obama addressed social issues in both Burma and the United States, highlighting the progress made in addressing these issues. President Obama emphasized the importance of free expression, assembly, and press for democracy in the United States during his speech in Burma. He also discussed the U.S. system of governance that limits the power of leaders and highlighted the need for national reconciliation and an end to ethnic discrimination in Burma's democratic reforms. Obama expressed confidence in the country's progress despite challenges ahead. President Obama had constructive meetings with President Thein Sein and Aung San Suu Kyi in Burma, emphasizing the need for political reforms and cooperation on non-proliferation issues. The discussions focused on developing democracy and promoting human rights in Burma, with Obama highlighting the long journey ahead for reforms. During his visit to Burma, President Obama discussed U.S. policy towards the country with Aung San Suu Kyi, emphasizing the need to sustain democratization momentum. Aung San Suu Kyi expressed concerns about being cautious of false success. The Burmese government agreed to comply with U.N. sanctions on North Korea, sign the Additional Protocol to the IAEA agreements, and allow ICRC to resume prisoner visits. The ICRC will resume prisoner visits in coordination with the Ministry of Home Affairs. The Burmese government agreed to various international agreements and commitments, including the U.S.-Myanmar Joint Plan on Trafficking in Persons and the ILO's Action Plan on Forced Labor. They also committed to becoming a full member of the Open Government Partnership by 2016. Additionally, efforts are being made to achieve a durable ceasefire in Kachin State and prevent violent attacks on civilians in Rakhine State. However, there are concerns about the government's commitment to political reform following President Obama's visit. The Burmese government faced criticism for its violent crackdown on a peaceful protest in Sagaing Region and its military assault on the Kachin Independence Army, despite promises made to President Obama. However, steps were taken to protect the people's right to assembly and freedom of the media. Fighting between the Tatmadaw and the KIA had escalated since the ceasefire was broken in June 2011, leading to a major offensive by the Tatmadaw in December 2012. Operation Thunderbolt in mid-December 2012 aimed to take over the KIA/KIO headquarters in Laiza. The Burmese military used aircraft and committed at least five battalions, drawing international criticism for civilian casualties and human rights abuses. Allegations of child soldiers were made against both sides. The Burmese government claimed self-defense, while Ambassador Mitchell and acting Special expressed concern. On December 17 and 18, 2012, Ambassador Mitchell and acting Special Representative Murphy visited Kachin State to assess the situation. The U.S. Embassy in Rangoon urged both sides to establish a dialogue process to address the conflict in Kachin State. A ceasefire announced on January 19, 2013, broke down as Tatmadaw forces attacked a KIA base. The U.S. Embassy criticized the Burmese Army's resumption of fighting in Kachin State. Despite the ceasefire announcement on January 19, the Burmese Army continues its offensive near the Kachin Independence Army headquarters in Laiza, resulting in civilian casualties. The Burmese Ministry of Foreign Affairs blames the KIA for violating the ceasefire, labeling their actions as \"terrorist attacks.\" Negotiations between the Union Government and KIO/KIA took place on February 4, 2013, in China's Yunnan Province, but fighting persists in Kachin State. The Union Government and Parliament made policy changes in early 2013, including dissolving the Press Scrutiny and Registration Division and abolishing a military junta order restricting gatherings. The status of Tatmadaw support for negotiations with KIO/KIA remains uncertain amidst ongoing fighting in Kachin State. The Ministry of Information in Burma repealed Order No. 2/88 for violating the constitution. A draft media legislation was sent to the Union Parliament, criticized for being more restrictive than the previous law. The move violated an agreement with the Myanmar Press Council. The draft legislation was published in the New Light of Myanmar. The Myanmar Journalist Association, Myanmar Journalist Network, and Myanmar Journalist Union condemned a draft bill on February 27, 2013. The bill prohibits publishing articles on ethnic conflicts, criticizing the constitution, or \"disturbing the rule of law.\" It also allows a MOI-appointed official to control publishing licenses, seen as a form of media censorship. The proposed penalties include imprisonment and fines, more severe than the 1962 law. On February 22, 2013, OFAC issued a general license waiving restrictions on financial transactions with four Burmese banks. On February 22, 2013, OFAC issued a general license waiving restrictions on financial transactions with four Burmese banks\u2014Asia Green Development Bank, Ayeyarwady Bank, Myanma Economic Bank, and Myanma Investment and Commercial Bank. Ayeyarwady Bank was also added to the SDN list on the same day. Critics raised concerns that these banks are owned by individuals with close ties to the Burmese military, hindering political reforms in Burma. The Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission held a hearing on human rights in Burma on February 28, 2013, with Assistant Secretary of State Michael H. Posner and Acting Special Representative W. Patrick Murphy testifying. They highlighted the Obama Administration's approach to U.S. policy towards Burma, recognizing and encouraging further progress in response to President Thein Sein's reform agenda. The Obama Administration supports Burma's government and people during a time of change, committing to be a long-term partner in the reform process. Despite positive and negative developments since the quasi-civilian government took power, the political situation in Burma remains fragile and complex. Key issues regarding the prospects for political reforms are examined. The SPDC announced a roadmap to a \"disciplined democracy\" in Burma, with the transfer of power completed in 2011. President Thein Sein acknowledges the ongoing democratization process but lacks clarity on what a disciplined democracy entails. Key elements of a future democratic Burma are still subject to political debate. Key elements of future democratic Burma are under political debate, including civilian control over the military, special powers of the Tatmadaw, federal vs. central government structure, balance of power among branches, selection of President and Ministers, citizenship conditions, and rights for Rohingyas. The military in Burma remains powerful and opaque, with little known about their attitudes towards political reforms. President Thein Sein appointed former generals to his Cabinet in 2013, raising questions about civilian control over the military and the balance of power in Burma. Force Commander-in-Chief General Myat Hein became Minister for Telecommunications, and Lieutenant General Thet Niang Win was appointed Minister of Border Affairs, with 18 out of 30 cabinet ministers being current or former military officers. The Tatmadaw's actions suggest limited support for political reform, as Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hliang has not publicly confirmed orders to cease military operations against the KIO/KIA despite presidential instructions. General Min Aung Hlaing's reassignment of military personnel and replacement of Union Parliament members in 2012 raise questions about his political intentions. The military's appointed members of the Union Parliament in April 2012 aimed to tighten discipline. Relations between the military and the Parliament are strained, with tensions over the military budget and land seizures. The Tatmadaw confiscated over 247,000 acres of land between July 2012 and January 2013. The military is recommended to return most of the land to owners or the state and provide compensation for displaced persons. The military's involvement in Burma's economy, with regional commanders benefiting from their political power and ownership of major corporations, remains unresolved. One prominent entity is the Union of Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited (UMEHL), reportedly owned by the Ministry of Defense. The military in Burma, through entities like Myanma Economic Holding and Myanmar Economic Corporation, owns conglomerates in various sectors, including banks. These corporate assets provide the military with independent revenue and control over the economy. The Tatmadaw has been involved in a civil war since 1948, with ethnic minorities feeling the government has not honored agreements for autonomy. The Tatmadaw in Burma is responsible for preserving the country's national integrity and sovereignty. The 2008 Constitution designates the military as the main entity for safeguarding the Union. The Union Government has proposed a three-step peace process to end the civil war and reconcile with ethnic organizations opposing the government. The Union Government in Burma has proposed a three-step peace process to end the civil war and reconcile with ethnic organizations. This includes negotiating agreements with ethnic militias, broader agreements on political and economic development, and a national agreement on amending the 2008 Constitution. A \"peace committee\" has been established, with former Railway Minister Aung Min leading negotiations with ethnic organizations. The Union Government's lead negotiator in talks with ethnic organizations, the United Nationalities Federal Council (UNFC), proposed an alternative path to national reconciliation involving direct negotiations, a national conference, and a national convention to negotiate a \"national accord\" for a federal union of Burma. The UNFC's proposal does not assume the preservation of the 2008 Constitution or the disbanding of militias. Talks between the Union Government and ethnic organizations, including the UNFC, have had mixed results. The Union Government and ethnic organizations, including the UNFC, have had mixed results in ceasefire agreements. Talks have not completed the second step of the peace process due to unresolved issues regarding the powers of the central government and ethnic States in Burma. Many ethnic groups seek autonomy, while the government and military prefer a stronger central government. The Burmese military's support for national reconciliation is crucial, but their participation in negotiations is lacking. Reports of military attacks on ethnic militias raise doubts about their commitment to the peace process. The Union Government aims to incorporate ethnic groups into the current governance system through negotiations within the framework of the 2008 Constitution. The major ethnic groups contesting parliamentary elections in Burma do not accept the legitimacy of the 2008 Constitution and the Union Government's approach. The drafting of the Constitution by the SPDC is seen as politically problematic, with limited public access to the text before the fraudulent referendum in 2008. The future of the Constitution is crucial for national reconciliation efforts. The 2008 plebiscite and parliamentary elections in Burma are widely viewed as fraudulent and not free or fair, casting doubt on the legitimacy of the Union Government and Parliament. President Thein Sein is open to limited amendments to the constitution, including potential changes to the privileged status of the military in Parliament. Opposition parties, led by Aung San Suu Kyi, are also pushing for constitutional reforms. The opposition parties, led by Aung San Suu Kyi, seek amendments to the 2008 Constitution to allow her to serve as President. While the NLD and other opposition members are willing to follow the constitution's amendment process, many ethnic organizations reject the constitution and prefer direct negotiations with the Union Government and Tatmadaw for a new constitution. The 2008 Constitution outlines the arduous process for amending it, requiring support from at least 20% of Union Parliament members and 75% for adoption. Certain sections also need approval from over 50% of eligible voters in a nationwide referendum. The 2008 Constitution outlines the process for amending it, requiring support from Union Parliament members and approval from eligible voters in a referendum. The Constitution specifies the special status of the military in the government, conditions for declaring a state of emergency, eligibility requirements for the President, and the process to amend the Constitution. Any amendment must have the support of military appointees in the Union Parliament, potentially influencing the Tatmadaw's stance. It is uncertain if an acceptable amendment will satisfy ethnic organizations. The 2008 Constitution outlines the process for amending it, requiring support from Union Parliament members and approval from eligible voters in a referendum. A compromise must still be approved by more than 50% of eligible voters, which could be a challenge. The 113th Congress may take a more active role in U.S. policy towards Burma during a potential political transition. Critics have differing views on the Obama Administration's handling of Burma relations. Congress may assess recent U.S. policy towards Burma and act accordingly. The 112th Congress passed laws and bills related to Burma, with most bills not seeing further action. Hearings were held on U.S. policy towards Burma. Three new laws extended import bans, while two others reiterated sanctions. Three laws (P.L. 112-61, P.L. 112-74, and P.L. 112-192) related to Burma were passed by the 112th Congress. P.L. 112-74 prohibited the use of funds for military training or operations involving child soldiers in Burma. Section 7044(b) of P.L. 112-192 allows the Secretary of the Treasury to instruct U.S. executive directors at international financial institutions to vote against financial support for Burma, unless the President determines it is in the national interest. Notice of this determination must be provided to specific congressional committees. During the 112th Congress, multiple bills related to Burma were introduced, with only a few becoming law. Congressional hearings on Burma were evenly split between the House Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. Additionally, H.Con.Res. 135 authorized the presentation of the Congressional Gold Medal to Aung San Suu Kyi. During the 112th Congress, hearings on Burma were held by the House Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. The hearings focused on topics such as religious freedom, democracy, and human rights in Asia, including the implementation of the Tibetan Policy Act and North Korean Human Rights Act. Derek J. Mitchell was nominated for two positions related to Burma, as the first Special Representative and Policy Coordinator for Burma, and as Ambassador to Burma. The 113th Congress may consider various aspects of U.S. policy towards Burma, including oversight of the Obama Administration's approach, implementation of existing laws, potential legislative adjustments, funding for assistance programs, and congressional oversight. The 113th Congress may choose to exercise oversight authority over the executive branch's administration of federal laws, particularly regarding U.S. policy towards Burma. This could involve holding hearings, requesting information, and examining the Obama Administration's approach to Burma. The 113th Congress may oversee the Obama Administration's approach to Burma, focusing on key aspects such as the political situation, sanctions easing, relations with different Burmese entities, acceptance of the government and constitution, and the approach towards Burma. The 113th Congress may oversee the Obama Administration's approach to Burma, focusing on key aspects such as political reform, military relations, ethnic groups, and specific issues related to U.S. policy. The 113th Congress may oversee the Obama Administration's approach to Burma, focusing on key aspects such as political reform, military relations, ethnic groups, and specific issues related to U.S. policy, including the appointment of a Special Representative and Policy Coordinator for Burma, administration of lists for sanctions, and timely submission of reports to Congress. The Special Representative and Policy Coordinator for Burma, except for the position of U.S. Ambassador to ASEAN, cannot hold another executive branch position. Ambassador Derek J. Mitchell served in this role from August 2, 2011, until becoming U.S. Ambassador to Burma on June 29, 2012. Deputy Special Representative W. Patrick Murphy then took over as acting coordinator. The Federal Vacancies Act of 1998 allows for temporary appointments in such positions. The Vacancies Act of 1998 allows temporary appointments for Senate-confirmed positions for up to 210 days, with exceptions for pending nominations. Murphy's appointment as Special Representative for Burma has exceeded this limit. Congress may question the Obama Administration's nomination plans. Criticism also surrounds the compilation of lists for sanctions on Burmese individuals and entities as required by existing laws. The Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003 and the Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE Act prohibit entry visas for certain Burmese nationals unless in the national interest. Presidential determinations and executive orders also block visas for selected Burmese individuals. The Department of State maintains the list of prohibited Burmese nationals and freezes assets of certain individuals under these acts. The Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE Act imposes financial sanctions on individuals subject to a visa ban in the United States. The Act requires the Secretaries of State and Treasury to identify potential persons for sanctions. However, human rights organizations criticize the lack of enforcement by the State and Treasury Departments. The State Department has not disclosed the names on its visa ban list, raising concerns about compliance with the law. The Treasury Department delegates responsibility for maintaining a list of Burmese persons subject to financial sanctions to its Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). The list is part of the Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list, which includes individuals, groups, companies, or entities subject to sanctions. The current SDN list maintained by the Treasury Department lacks dozens of Burmese nationals and companies that should be included based on relevant laws. Implementation of required reports to Congress on military assistance and foreign assets held by Burmese officials has been criticized for being incomplete and lacking detail. The existing sanctions on Burma remain in effect until certain conditions are met or Congress acts to remove them. President Obama has waived some sanctions, but they can be resumed at any time. The current extension of the import ban ends on July 25, 2013. The State Department determined that waiving the import ban was in the national interest. The 113th Congress may consider extending the sanctions. The 113th Congress may consider extending or altering current U.S. policy towards Burma, including imposing or re-imposing sanctions, modifying conditions for sanction termination, and providing guidance on conducting U.S. policy towards Burma. Funding levels for assistance programs will also be considered. The 113th Congress will consider funding levels for assistance programs in Burma proposed by the Obama Administration, which include aid for landmine victims, English language training, academic exchange programs, and democracy promotion. The reopening of the USAID mission in Rangoon will require additional federal funding, but budget constraints like sequestration may affect the amount available. The Relief Act of 2012 mandates a 5% reduction in funding for FY2013, with the Department of State and USAID allowed to reprogram funds. Uncertainty over country allocations makes it difficult to calculate post-sequestration funding levels for Burma, but a rough estimate could be a 5% reduction from FY2012 estimates. Once final FY2013 funding legislation is passed, the Department of State can determine country and program allocations to calculate sequestration at the country level. The Relief Act of 2012 mandates a 5% reduction in funding for FY2013, with the Department of State and USAID allowed to reprogram funds. Uncertainty over country allocations makes it difficult to calculate post-sequestration funding levels for Burma. The 113th Congress may play a role in influencing Burma's future during its transition to a civilian democratic government. The table below summarizes major events in Burma and U.S. policy developments since the Obama Administration's new approach. It lists required reports to Congress on Burma, including relevant laws, responsible agencies, reporting frequency, deadlines, and delivery methods."
