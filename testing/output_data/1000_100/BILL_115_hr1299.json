    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Berta Caceres Human Rights in Honduras Act\". Congress finds that the Honduran police are widely corrupt and commit human rights abuses with impunity, including torture, rape, illegal detention, and murder. The New York Times revealed documents showing top police officials ordered the killings of drug-crime investigators in 2009 and 2011, with knowledge of high-ranking government officials. Individuals in the police with records of gross human rights abuses continue to operate freely. International human rights bodies have reported that the Honduran military and police commit human rights abuses, including killings, with impunity. The Associated Press has documented death squad activity by police. Human Rights Watch reports chronic problems with the use of lethal force by the national police, inefficient and corrupt investigations into police abuses, lack of public information, and a culture of impunity. The Department of State's Honduran Human Rights Report for 2016 highlights the serious problem of impunity, with slow or inconclusive prosecution of military and police officials charged with human rights violations. Rights Action documented the Fifteenth Battalion of the Honduran Armed Forces allegedly participating in killings of small-farmer activists in the Aguan Valley since 2000. Efforts to clean up the Honduran police have largely failed, with minimal progress in prosecuting corrupt officers and addressing human rights abuses. Fundamental police reform is still needed. In the Aguan Valley, small-farmer activists have been targeted since 2000, with little to no consequences for the perpetrators. Key activists, including the president of MUCA, have been assassinated. Human rights abuses by the military, such as the killing of an Indigenous activist in 2013 and torture and killing of another individual in 2014, continue to occur. The Honduran Navy reportedly killed two Garifuna Afro-Indigenous men in 2015 while they were digging a car out of the sand on a beach. The government has expanded the military's role in domestic policing, leading to fatal incidents like the killings of a 15-year-old boy in 2012 and a student in 2014. The creation of Military Police in Honduras has led to increased allegations of human rights abuses, with the judicial system being corrupt and interconnected with organized crime. The Department of State's 2015 Human Rights Report for Honduras highlights widespread impunity due to corruption and institutional weakness in the justice system. Human Rights Watch reports in 2016 that rampant crime and impunity for human rights abuses persist in Honduras, with little progress in reforming public security institutions. The assassination of activist Berta Caceres in March 2016 highlights the human rights crisis in Honduras and the government's complicity. The Indigenous and Popular Organizations of Honduras reported 33 threats before Berta Caceres' killing, with no investigations done. The government failed to provide protection as mandated by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. Eight suspects, including four with ties to the military, have been arrested. Questions arise about the military's involvement in her assassination. The Government of Honduras continues to restrict. The Government of Honduras hinders access to the case file related to Berta Caceres' assassination despite calls for an independent investigation by various organizations. In a context of corruption and human rights abuses, various activists and critics face threats and restrictions. Activists, human rights defenders, and critics in Honduras face severe risks with previous abuses largely unpunished. The shooting of journalist Felix Molina in 2016 highlighted ongoing dangers. The US allocated $18 million to Honduran police and military, with plans for increased security funding in 2017. The Inter-American Development Bank lent $59,800,000 to the Honduran police in 2012 with US approval, calling for increased security funding for Honduras. SEC. 3 of the document suspends security assistance to Honduras for its police and military, including equipment and training. The Secretary of the Treasury is directed to vote against any loans for the Honduran police or military at multilateral development banks. SEC. 4 outlines conditions for lifting these suspensions and restrictions. The Act will end when the Secretary of State certifies that Honduras has pursued legal action for various murders and human rights violations, including those of Berta Caceres and small-farmer activists. Military and police members found guilty of human rights violations must be prosecuted. Honduras must comply with human rights, separate military from policing, protect various activists, and establish a strong judicial system. Honduras must ensure a strong judicial system to prosecute police and military human rights abuses."
