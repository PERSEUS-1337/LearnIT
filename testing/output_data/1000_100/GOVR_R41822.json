    "content": "The 112th Congress is considering legislative proposals to limit the government's risk from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, government-sponsored enterprises responsible for nearly half of the nation's residential mortgage debt. In 2008, their capital proved inadequate due to increased mortgage defaults and borrowing costs. The U.S. Department of the Treasury has purchased over $175 billion of special preferred stock to support Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac during the 2008-2009 financial crisis. Treasury and the Federal Reserve have also provided mortgage market support by purchasing nearly $1.4 trillion in MBS. Some proposed legislation may reduce the enterprises' future size by eliminating certain advantages conferred by their charters. Proposed legislation aims to increase costs for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, potentially leading to lower mortgage prices and higher interest rates for borrowers. It also includes new limitations on mortgage purchases, increased regulatory oversight, and disclosure requirements. These changes could reduce risks but also raise costs for the enterprises. The SEC would eliminate a competitive advantage for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, requiring them to follow the same rules as competitors. Legislative proposals aim to return the enterprises to stockholder control or dissolve them, with bills phasing out their charters. Other proposals suggest replacing the enterprises in the secondary mortgage markets. The enterprises faced financial difficulties due to increasing losses from mortgage delinquencies and inadequate capital. In September 2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac entered voluntary conservatorship under the FHFA, with the Treasury providing financial support to keep them solvent. Homeowners rely on them for mortgage money as they purchase mortgages from lenders and package them into MBS for investors. They are prohibited from making loans directly to borrowers. The Obama Administration's report presents three alternatives for the future of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, including a privatized system with government guarantee during a crisis. No legislation has been introduced yet to implement these proposals. The Obama Administration's report outlines three options for the future of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, including a privatized system with government backing during emergencies. Legislation introduced in the 112th Congress addresses various concerns, with H.R. 31 focusing on accountability and transparency for the enterprises. This bill would require quarterly reports on specific areas such as liabilities, executive compensation, and conforming loan limits. The Obama Administration's report outlines options for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's future, including a privatized system with government backing during emergencies. Legislation in the 112th Congress, like H.R. 31, focuses on accountability and transparency for the enterprises, requiring quarterly reports on areas such as executive compensation, conforming loan limits, foreclosure mitigation, mortgage fraud prevention, and enterprise investments. The FHFA inspector general would review the reports and inform Congress of findings. The bill, H.R. 31, focuses on accountability and transparency for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. It requires quarterly reports on various areas such as executive compensation, conforming loan limits, foreclosure mitigation, and enterprise investments. The FHFA inspector general would review the reports and inform Congress of findings, with the reports and comments to be posted on the FHFA website. The IG would also examine FHFA's loss mitigation policies, including the impact of principal reduction on financial condition and foreclosure rates. There is some overlap with current reporting requirements, such as the FHFA's quarterly financial performance report and monthly foreclosure prevention report. The Committee on Financial Services forwarded H.R. 31 to the full committee, emphasizing oversight of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. H.R. 463 aims to make the enterprises subject to FOIA requests, while H.R. 1221 seeks to limit executive pay at the enterprises. The bill proposes that the Senior Executive Service salaries be transferred to the Treasury, with other employees paid based on the federal government's general schedule. Executive compensation would be tied to the enterprise's profitability, and TARP provisions on executive compensation and corporate governance would apply. The bill also clarifies that enterprise employees are not considered federal employees. The House Financial Services Committee has ordered the bill to be reported as amended. The FHFA is prohibited from setting salaries but can withhold executive compensation deemed unreasonable. H.R. 1222 aims to align guarantee fees with private market rates. The bill was marked up by the House Subcommittee and FHFA has the authority to implement these provisions. H.R. 1223, GSE Credit Risk Equitable Treatment Act of 2011, would ensure fair treatment for mortgage-backed securities issued by enterprises. Regulatory determinations for \"qualified residential mortgages\" should not solely consider the enterprises' role in securitization, as per Dodd-Frank. Dodd-Frank requires joint regulations for risk retention on MBS mortgages, with QRMs exempt from this requirement. Under Dodd-Frank, QRMs would be exempt from the risk retention requirement for mortgage-backed securities issued by enterprises. The Federal Reserve's general counsel testified that the enterprises' guarantees may satisfy the risk retention requirements if they are in conservatorship or receivership. H.R. 1224 would accelerate the reduction of the enterprises' portfolios over five years. The enterprises, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are required to reduce their portfolios to $250 billion each over five years. H.R. 1224 accelerates this reduction, while companion bills propose different timelines. The House Subcommittee on Capital Markets discussed these portfolio reduction plans in April 2011. The House Subcommittee on Capital Markets discussed H.R. 1224 and H.R. 1225 in April 2011. H.R. 1224 accelerates portfolio reduction for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, while H.R. 1225 requires approval from the Secretary of the Treasury for new debt issuance. Services marked up H.R. 1225, forwarding it to the full committee. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's charters currently grant the Secretary of the Treasury authority, which could be asserted to formalize the approval process for new debt issuance. H.R. 1226, the GSE Mission Improvement Act, aims to repeal affordable housing goals established in 1992. The Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992 (P.L. 102-550, 106 Stat. 3672 et seq.) and the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-289, 122 Stat. 2654 et seq.) would be repealed, along with the duty to serve underserved markets and funding for the housing trust fund and capital magnet fund. FHFA would need to submit a report to Congress on the bill's impact on multifamily properties, loans to low-income borrowers, and loans to borrowers in rural areas within six months. H.R. 1227, GSE Risk and Activities Limitation Act of 2011, would prohibit the enterprises from meeting housing goals unless repealed. H.R. 1227, GSE Risk and Activities Limitation Act of 2011, would restrict FHFA from approving new products for enterprises in conservatorship or receivership unless deemed necessary to preserve assets or reduce losses. The bill was marked up by the House Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government-Sponsored Enterprises and forwarded to the full committee. Additionally, H.R. 2425, Transparency and Security in Mortgage Registration Act of 2011, would prohibit certain entities from purchasing or securitizing registered mortgages. MERS is a centralized mortgage registration system that bypasses state laws. Legal challenges question its authority in foreclosures. H.R. 2428 aims to reduce legal fees for GSE employees. FHFA can repudiate contracts under HERA. H.R. 2436, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Taxpayer Payback Act of 2011, aims to maintain dividend rates paid to Treasury. H.R. 2439 grants FHFA power to revoke enterprise charters during receivership. H.R. 2441 seeks to terminate Housing Trust Fund, Capital Magnet Fund, and Hope Reserve Fund. In the FY2010 budget, $80 million was appropriated for the Capital Magnet Fund. H.R. 2440 would direct FHFA to identify non-mission critical assets held by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, such as patents and mortgage data, and submit a plan to sell them. H.R. 2462 would set the maximum amount of support Treasury can provide each enterprise in the Preferred Stock Purchase Agreements. The Treasury has contracted to purchase preferred stock to support Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, with limits initially set at $100 billion each, later raised to $200 billion. The PSPA was amended to provide unlimited support in 2010-2012, with the $200 billion limits outside of those years. Various companion bills have been introduced in Congress with different provisions for the enterprises. H.R. 1221 through H.R. 1227, H.R. 1859, and H.R. 2413 aim to replace Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. H.R. 408 and S. 178, known as the Spending Reduction Act of 2011, address various issues beyond GSE reform. Title VI of these bills would end the enterprises' conservatorships within 24 months. After conservatorship, the enterprises would either dissolve or continue with revised charters, including reducing their portfolios to $250 billion each over four years. H.R. 1224 proposes a five-year plan for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, removing housing goals and focusing on a gradual exit from conservatorship. After returning to stockholder control, there would be a 10-year wind-down period before dissolution, with FHFA having more authority over capital levels. (Section 606) FHFA would have strengthened authority to set and enforce minimum capital levels. The conforming loan limit would be set at $417,000 nationwide with no high-cost exceptions, and the enterprises could not purchase homes selling for more than the area median home price. The limit would only increase in future years to reflect rising house prices. Enterprises would be prohibited from purchasing mortgages greater than the area median home price. The minimum downpayment for mortgages purchased by the enterprises would be 5% during the first 12 months after leaving conservatorship, 7.5% during the second 12 months, and 10% afterward. The enterprises would be required to pay all state and local taxes, register all stocks with the SEC, and be charged for government benefits. Companion bills H.R. 1182 and S. 693 include provisions from H.R. 408 and S. 178, with additional requirements such as a guarantee fee increase and portfolio reduction. The proposed legislation includes provisions to reduce the enterprises' portfolios to $250 billion each over five years, repeal affordable housing goals, end conservatorship in 24 months, phase out charters for new business after three years, lower conforming loan limits, and increase minimum capital requirements. H.R. 1859, Housing Finance Reform Act of 2011, would authorize FHFA to charter housing finance guaranty associations to pool and securitize single-family and multifamily mortgages. The associations would guarantee timely payment to investors, with a backup guarantee from the federal government. They would be restricted to purchasing existing mortgages and could specialize in specific markets like community banks and multifamily. The Housing Finance Reform Act of 2011 would authorize FHFA to charter housing finance guaranty associations to pool and securitize single-family and multifamily mortgages. The associations would guarantee timely payment to investors, with a backup guarantee from the federal government. The maximum mortgage size would be based on national and area median prices, with limits ranging from $256,000 to $897,300. Mortgages on one-to-four family dwelling units could be purchased with certain conditions, and FHFA would regulate the associations. The Housing Finance Reform Act of 2011 authorizes FHFA to charter housing finance guaranty associations to pool and securitize mortgages. These associations would guarantee timely payment to investors with a backup guarantee from the federal government. The maximum mortgage size would be based on national and area median prices, with limits ranging from $256,000 to $897,300. Additionally, H.R. 2413 proposes the creation of a federal corporation to purchase and securitize mortgages meeting certain underwriting standards, with fees charged to cover mortgage payments during normal times and compensate Treasury for a backup federal guarantee. The reinsurance fee under the Housing Finance Reform Act of 2011 would be based on mortgage quality, not location or volume. Eligible mortgages must be 30 years or less, up to 80% of the sales price (or 90% with private mortgage insurance), with a maximum size of $729,750 in high-cost areas. FHFA would oversee the facility."
