    "content": "The \"Crane Conservation Act of 2003\" may be cited as such. The Act includes findings related to crane conservation. Congress finds that crane populations in many countries are declining, endangering species like the Siberian crane, red-crowned crane, white-naped crane, black-necked crane, and hooded crane. The Crane Action Plan of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature focuses on conserving these crane species. The Conservation of Nature identifies 5 threatened crane species from Africa and Asia: wattled crane, blue crane, grey-crowned crane, black-crowned crane, and sarus crane. The whooping crane and Mississippi sandhill crane are listed as endangered species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. The whooping crane has fewer than 200 individuals in a self-sustaining flock migrating between Canada and the United States, while there are approximately 100 Mississippi sandhill cranes. Conservation resources have not been sufficient to cope with the continued diminution of crane populations from causes that include hunting, habitat loss, egg collection, poisoning, and collisions with power lines. Cranes are flagship species for wetland, grassland, and agricultural conservation, and establishing crane conservation programs would benefit numerous other endangered species. To effectively address threats to cranes in the wild, joint commitment and effort from countries in Africa, Asia, North America, and the private sector are required. Cranes serve as ambassadors promoting goodwill among countries due to their migration across continents. Conservation successes and methods developed in one region can be applied globally, as threats to cranes and their habitats are similar across continents. Conservationists in the United States have a significant role to play in crane conservation efforts. Conservationists in the United States collaborate with colleagues in other countries to conserve threatened cranes. The purposes of this Act are to perpetuate healthy populations of cranes, support conservation programs in countries where endangered cranes occur, assist private organizations dedicated to crane conservation, and provide financial resources for these efforts. The term \"conservation\" in this Act refers to methods and procedures to ensure the population of crane species in the wild is sufficient to prevent extinction, including habitat protection, research, and management assistance. The curr_chunk discusses the various aspects of crane conservation, including enforcement of the Convention, law enforcement, habitat protection, reintroduction of cranes to the wild, conflict resolution initiatives, and community outreach and education. The terms \"Convention,\" \"Fund,\" and \"Secretary\" are defined within the context of the Act. SEC. 5. CRANE CONSERVATION ASSISTANCE. The Secretary will use funds from the Fund to provide financial assistance for crane conservation projects with approved proposals. Applicants must submit project proposals meeting specified requirements for eligibility. The Secretary will use funds from the Fund to provide financial assistance for crane conservation projects with approved proposals. Applicants must submit project proposals meeting specified requirements for eligibility, including relevant wildlife management authorities, the Secretariat of the Convention, and experts in crane conservation. Required elements of a project proposal include a concise statement of the project's purpose. The project proposal must include a concise statement of the purpose, names and qualifications of individuals involved, methods for implementation and assessment, staff and community management details, logistics, estimated funds and time needed, and evidence of support from relevant government entities. The Secretary will review project proposals to determine eligibility for assistance under this Act, including information on matching funding and other necessary details. The Secretary will consult with relevant officials and countries to approve or disapprove project proposals within 180 days of receiving them. Written notification will be provided to the applicant and other federal officials. The Secretary may approve a project proposal under this section if it will enhance conservation programs for cranes by addressing conflicts with humans, ensuring compliance with laws, and developing scientific monitoring methods. The project proposal aims to develop scientific information on crane habitat, population numbers, and threats, promote cooperative projects among various entities, conduct necessary research on cranes, reintroduce cranes successfully into the wild, and provide relevant training and support. The project proposal aims to develop scientific information on crane habitat, population numbers, and threats, promote cooperative projects, conduct necessary research, reintroduce cranes into the wild, and provide relevant training and support for effective conservation. The Secretary gives preference to projects designed for long-term conservation and those with matching funds available. Recipients of assistance must submit periodic reports to the Secretary. The Secretary requires reports with necessary information to evaluate project progress and success for ensuring positive results, assessing problems, and fostering improvements. Reports and related documents must be made available to the public. A panel of experts, including specialists on cranes and wetlands, will be convened biennially to identify conservation needs. The Crane Conservation Fund is established. The Crane Conservation Fund is established within the Multinational Species Conservation Fund. It consists of transferred amounts, appropriations, and interest earned. The Fund allows for expenditures upon request by the Secretary of the Treasury. The Crane Conservation Fund allows the Secretary to transfer necessary amounts for assistance and limits expenses to 3% for administrative costs. Additionally, not more than 50% of the Fund can be used for projects related to North American crane species conservation. The Secretary of the Treasury is responsible for investing the remaining Fund amounts. The Secretary of the Treasury is responsible for investing the Crane Conservation Fund in interest-bearing obligations of the United States. The obligations can be acquired on original issue or by purchase at market price, and can be sold at market price. Interest and proceeds from the obligations are credited to the Fund. The Secretary of the Treasury transfers required amounts to the Crane Conservation Fund monthly based on estimates. Adjustments are made for any discrepancies. Donations can be accepted and used for assistance, with amounts transferred to the Treasury for deposit in the Fund. SEC. 7. ADVISORY GROUP. The Secretary may convene an advisory group of individuals involved in crane conservation. The group must hold open meetings, provide opportunities for public input, and keep minutes available to the public. SEC. 8. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Authorization of appropriations for the Fund is set at $3,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2004 to 2007, with funds remaining available until expended."
