    "content": "In February 2002, the Bush Administration introduced the \"Clear Skies\" proposal to address emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, mercury, and carbon dioxide from electric utilities. The proposal involved emission caps implemented through a tradeable allowance program in two phases: 2010 and 2018. A modified version of Clear Skies was introduced in the 109th Congress as S. 131 by Senator Inhofe, sparking debates on its cap-and-trade implementation scheme. The Clear Skies proposal focuses on a cap-and-trade implementation scheme for reducing emissions of SO2, NOx, and mercury. The EPA has already used a regional cap-and-trade program to control NOx emissions and has proposed similar regulations for SO2 and NOx reductions over 28 states and the District of Columbia. Additionally, the EPA has proposed cap-and-trade regulations for achieving mercury reductions as well. The Clear Skies proposal aims to reduce emissions of SO2, NOx, and mercury through a cap-and-trade system. The Administration believes that certain provisions of the Clean Air Act are no longer necessary with Clear Skies, including New Source Review, regional haze, BART, MACT standards, NOx SIP Call, 126 Rule, and acid rain regulations. The Clear Skies proposal aims to simplify regulations by combining various standards into one legislative process. The potential impact of Clear Skies legislation on the Clean Air Act is examined, particularly with respect to electric generating units and industrial sources opting into the program. Changes proposed by Clear Skies would mainly affect Title I of the Clean Air Act, impacting utility planning and operations based on the facility's location in clean or dirty air. The Clean Air Act, established in 1970, regulates emissions of SO2, NOx, and particulate matter. The addition of Title IV in 1990 did not change the Act's basic requirements but added a cap-and-trade program for SO2 emissions. The Act focuses on National Ambient Air Quality Standards, New Source Performance Standards, and Lowest Achievable Emissions Rate to protect air quality. The Clean Air Act of 1970 established National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) to regulate air pollutants. NAAQS set limits on specified pollutants in ambient air to protect public health with an \"adequate margin of safety.\" States are responsible for implementing these standards through State Implementation Plans (SIPs) to reduce emissions from existing facilities. EPA periodically reviews NAAQS based on the most recent health data for compliance. The 1970 Clean Air Act mandates states to regulate emissions from new sources to ensure compliance with National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). New plants must install Lowest Achievable Emissions Rate (LAER) technology and adhere to offset rules to prevent overall emissions increase. Existing sources in nonattainment areas must implement Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT). Additionally, New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) are imposed on major new stationary sources of air pollution. The Clean Air Act mandates states to regulate emissions from new sources to comply with NAAQS. NSPS are set for fossil fuel-fired electric generating facilities for SO2, NOx, and PM10. Interstate pollution is addressed through mechanisms like the NOx SIP Call, Ozone Transport Commission, and state petitions under Section 126. Emission budgets are given to affected states under the NOx SIP Call. The Clean Air Act mandates states to regulate emissions from new sources to comply with NAAQS. EPA successfully encouraged states to implement the rule through a cap-and-trade program. Existing sources in nonattainment areas are subject to state controls, while major new sources are subject to NSPS as the minimum requirement. The 1977 CAA added the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) program focusing on ambient concentrations of SO2, NOx, and PM in clean air. The Clean Air Act's Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) program focuses on ambient concentrations of SO2, NOx, and PM in clean air areas. It allows for some increase in pollution concentrations based on classification, with Class I areas having very little degradation allowed and Class II areas allowing moderate degradation. States can reclassify Class II areas to Class III, which can degrade up to the NAAQS. New sources in PSD areas must undergo preconstruction review (NSR) and install Best Available Control Technology (BACT) determined by state permitting agencies. The Clean Air Act's PSD program focuses on ambient concentrations of pollutants like SO2, NOx, and PM. BACT must be more stringent than federal NSPS. The regional haze program addresses visibility impairment from air pollution in national parks. Sources built between 1962 and 1977 must install BART. The EPA's regional haze program requires stricter controls on NOx and SO2. Table 1 outlines air quality control requirements for fossil fuel-fired electric generating facilities under Title I. The Clean Air Act's Title I imposes regulations on fossil fuel-fired electric generating facilities for hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) like mercury. The Act establishes a two-phase regulatory program for HAPs, with the first phase requiring Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) standards for major sources. Electric utilities receive special treatment under Section 112, with additional regulations possible to address residual risks from HAPs. EPA is required to report to Congress on public health hazards. In Section 112(n) of the Clean Air Act, EPA must report to Congress on public health hazards from electric generating units' emissions of HAPs and determine if regulation under Section 112 is necessary. EPA initially found regulation necessary in 2000 but later proposed a cap-and-trade program under Section 111 instead. States can implement stricter HAP standards than federal ones. Table 2 summarizes the current requirements imposed on fossil fuel-fired electric generating facilities by Section 112. Clear Skies would change numerous provisions of current law, including the establishment of national cap-and-trade programs for utility emissions of NOx and mercury, and the extension and revision of the Title IV cap-and-trade program for SO2. Other changes involve removing existing authority related to mercury emissions and modifying certain provisions for several years. The proposed changes under Clear Skies include the establishment of cap-and-trade programs for utility emissions of SO2, NOx, and Hg, as well as modifications to existing authorities related to mercury emissions and hazardous air pollutants. Major sources would no longer be considered under the new regulations. The proposed changes under Clear Skies include establishing a moratorium on petitions for controlling interstate air pollution, reducing noncompliance penalties for SO2 cap-and-trade, preempting state requirements for NOx and mercury, eliminating NSR and BART requirements, and extending deadlines for meeting ozone and PM 2.5 NAAQS. The Clear Skies proposal includes a cap-and-trade program for SO2, NOx, and Mercury, with phased emissions caps and trading programs for flexibility. Phase 1 caps for EGUs include 2.19 million tons of NOx in 2008, 4.5 million tons of SO2 in 2010, and 34 tons of mercury in 2010. The S. 131 Phase 2 caps, effective in 2018, are set at 1.79 million tons of NOx, 3.0 million tons of SO2, and 15 tons of mercury. Allowances would be allocated based on historic fuel usage, with adjustments for factors like fuel type. A small pool of allowances would be reserved for new units. National Emission Standards would be established for SO2, NOx, and Hg emissions from new and reconstructed EGUs under Clear Skies. The National Emission Standards for SO2, NOx, and Hg from new and reconstructed EGUs under Clear Skies are more stringent than current NSPS. The standards would be reviewed and revised every eight years. S. 131 allows non-utility sources to opt into the cap-and-trade program, with alternative methods for determining allowances based on emissions and output. Units would receive allocations for SO2 and NOx emissions starting at 70% in 2010 and 50% in 2018. Mercury allocations would follow federal or state standards. Units opting in would be exempt from hazardous air pollutant compliance deadlines. Units opting into the cap-and-trade program would be exempt from compliance deadlines for hazardous air pollutants in various categories of regulations. They would also be permanently exempt if their application is accepted by the EPA. Opt-in units would not be considered major sources for certain regulations for 20 years. This exemption would apply if the owner/operator properly maintains pollution control equipment and practices good combustion methods. Clear Skies aims to establish a new \"transitional area\" category to replace nonattainment designations for areas that demonstrate they will meet new ozone and PM 2.5 standards by 2015. This change would extend deadlines for reaching attainment and remove statutory requirements for nonattainment areas until after 2017. Additionally, Clear Skies would exempt units opting into the cap-and-trade program from compliance deadlines for hazardous air pollutants and consider them not major sources for certain regulations for 20 years. Clear Skies would exempt affected units from major source requirements under Parts C and D of the Clean Air Act for 20 years after enactment, excluding them from NSR, BART, and BACT requirements. Units near Class I areas would still be subject to PSD requirements. Clear Skies would exempt nonattainment areas from certain requirements, limiting their ability to impose controls on existing units. It would also revise Section 112 of the Clean Air Act to exclude regulation of hazardous air pollutants emitted by electric utility steam generating units. The Administrator would have the authority to address non-mercury hazardous air pollutants from EGUs based on public health concerns and emission controls, with a peer-reviewed study required before January 2015. Compliance deadlines under hazardous air pollutant regulations would be exempted for units opting into the cap-and-trade program. Changes to Section 126 Petitions under Clear Skies would establish a moratorium on petitions to control interstate air pollution from affected units and impose stricter requirements for acceptance of such petitions after the moratorium. This amendment would limit the Administrator's ability to require shutdowns or controls on upwind sources emitting pollutants that contribute significantly to downwind states' nonattainment. The amendment would prevent the Administrator from requiring SIP submissions for affected units under Section 126 with an effective date before December 31, 2014. When reviewing a petition under Section 126, the Administrator must consider emissions reductions needed by relevant nonattainment areas' attainment dates. The Administrator must also ensure that emission reductions from affected units are cost-effective compared to other sources and will improve air quality in nonattainment areas. Clear Skies would replace the Clean Air Act's existing Section 411 in 2008, reducing penalties for noncompliance with the sulfur dioxide cap-and-trade program. The penalties would be set at $2,000 per ton with no inflation adjustments, cutting the penalty by about one-third initially. The Clear Skies bill would allow states to adopt more stringent limits, but under cap-and-trade programs, states cannot interfere with the transfer of allowances. This could result in increased emissions in one jurisdiction offsetting reductions in another. The bill also eliminates New Source Review for certain facilities for 20 years. The Clear Skies bill eliminates New Source Review for certain facilities for 20 years, establishing National Emission Standards for new EGUs. Reconstruction of units must exceed 50% of the fixed capital cost to apply, and modifications are subject to technological and economic feasibility. EPA's attempt to set a 20% threshold was criticized and stayed by the U.S. Court of Appeals. The Clear Skies bill exempts EGUs and opt-in facilities from BART requirements for 20 years after enactment. Additionally, affected units within 50 km of a Class I area would still be subject to PSD requirements for new construction or reconstruction. Under the Clear Skies bill, affected units near Class I areas must obtain a new permit to ensure no adverse impact on visibility. Class II areas can moderately increase SO2, NOx, and PM concentrations without additional emission controls. Nonattainment areas have extended deadlines to meet ozone and PM2.5 standards. The Clear Skies bill introduces new standards for ozone and fine particles (PM 2.5) to be met by 2007, 2009, or 2010. Transitional areas can avoid penalties until 2015 if they show they will meet the standards by then. After 2015, nonattainment areas must impose controls to reach attainment by 2022. Ozone transitional areas are exempt from certain statutory requirements until 2017. The Clean Air Act's Subpart 2 requirements for ozone nonattainment areas may be eliminated under the Clear Skies bill, allowing transitional areas to avoid penalties and potentially roll back statutory obligations. The Clear Skies bill proposes to reclassify ozone and PM 2.5 nonattainment areas as \"transitional,\" eliminating conformity requirements until 2018. Additionally, the legislation would make changes to Title I regarding electric generating units and industrial sources. The Clear Skies bill proposes changes to Title I for electric generating units and industrial sources, including the elimination of location as a variable for controlling EGUs. This would also impact emission limitations and the allowance system, regardless of an EGU's location or state restrictions. States' ability to set stringent rules on EGUs in nonattainment areas would be eliminated. The Clear Skies bill would eliminate LAER or offset rules on EGUs in nonattainment areas, restrict state and local governments from influencing EGU emissions, and remove the state's enforcement mechanism NSR for EGUs. States would not be able to restrict allowance trading, limiting their control over emissions reductions achieved through state legislation. The Clear Skies bill aims to establish a new \"transitional\" designation for areas not meeting air quality standards, avoiding the need for stronger state and local regulations. It also seeks to protect Class I areas by implementing Part C requirements for facilities within 50 km. The Clear Skies bill aims to protect Class I areas by implementing Part C requirements for facilities within 50 km. States and localities face constraints in meeting requirements for areas not meeting Clear Skies' Class I requirement. Clear Skies addresses the controversy over EGU age but does not fully resolve it. Title I and Title IV of the CAA impose stringent requirements on new sources, while existing sources operate with fewer controls. Clear Skies aims to reduce this disparity by setting up allowance reserves for new sources. The Clear Skies bill aims to reduce disparities between new and existing sources by setting up allowance reserves for new sources. Existing sources have an advantage over new facilities in receiving more generous allocation formulas. Table 4 outlines the regulation of mercury and other hazardous air pollutants under Clear Skies, with new and existing EGUs no longer subject to Maximum Achievable Control Technology standards. The absence of unit-specific standards in the cap-and-trade program could make it harder to address mercury \"hot spots.\" States setting more stringent standards would not have complete control, as allowance trading cannot be restricted. The Administrator would still have authority to address non-mercury hazardous air pollutants from existing sources under strict conditions. The Clear Skies program may not meet ozone and particulate standards under the Clean Air Act by 2018. Additional controls and time may be needed for some areas to reach compliance. The program could potentially remove certain provisions designed to achieve the same goals for electric utilities. Clear Skies, as currently drafted, could limit states' options to achieve NAAQS attainment and PSD increments by removing electric utility controls. The program's modest mercury controls may not effectively address widespread contamination issues, as many states have issued fish consumption advisories due to mercury. The Clear Skies program could limit states' options to reduce mercury emissions, as it removes electric utility controls. The Administration argues that Clear Skies would achieve reductions sooner and at a lower cost compared to the Clean Air Act, despite extending compliance deadlines. However, past experiences with market-based cap-and-trade programs show that early reductions can be offset by later increases in emissions. Early reductions under cap-and-trade programs may not result in achieving more reductions in the long term. Allowing sources to use banked allowances adds complexity for state and local authorities in compliance strategies."
