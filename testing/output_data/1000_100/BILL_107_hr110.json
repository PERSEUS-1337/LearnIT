    "content": "The \"Private Land Conservation Tax Act\" allows small farmers and ranchers to receive a credit for charitable conservation contributions of land. This Act is cited as SEC. 30B in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"Private Land Conservation Tax Act\" provides a tax credit for eligible farmers and ranchers equal to 10% of the deduction allowed for qualified conservation contributions. The maximum credit for any taxable year is $360,000 minus the total credits claimed in the previous 15 years. The tax credit under the \"Private Land Conservation Tax Act\" is subject to limitations based on the amount of tax and allocation rules for joint returns and controlled groups of corporations or individuals under common control. The tax credit for eligible farmers or ranchers is limited by the regular tax minus credits allowed, compared to the tentative minimum tax for the year. Eligible individuals must have 60% or more of their income from farming, while C corporations must meet the same criteria. The tax credit for eligible farmers or ranchers is limited by the regular tax minus credits allowed, compared to the tentative minimum tax for the year. To qualify, farming must account for 60% or more of the corporation's gross income, the stock is not publicly traded, and the fair market value of farming assets does not exceed $20,000,000. Special rules include making an irrevocable election for the application of the tax credit and restrictions on deductions for qualified conservation contributions if the credit is taken.

Special rules include making an irrevocable election for the application of the tax credit and restrictions on deductions for qualified conservation contributions if the credit is taken. The credit allowable under subsection (a) for any taxable year that exceeds the limitation imposed by subsection (b)(2) will be carried forward to the succeeding taxable year. Private land conservation donations defined in section 170(h) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 will apply after the enactment of this Act. Additionally, there is an increase in the charitable contribution limit for farmers and ranchers operating in corporate form. The amendments to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 allow qualified farmers and ranchers to be treated as individuals for conservation contributions. The changes also specify that certain corporations are excluded from this provision. These amendments will be effective for taxable years ending after the enactment of the Act. SEC. 4 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 expands the estate tax exclusion for land under qualified conservation easements. The amendment applies to estates of decedents dying after the enactment of the Act."
