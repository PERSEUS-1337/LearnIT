    "content": "Restoration of deduction for interest on educational loans. The amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 restores the deduction for interest on qualified educational loans, defining such loans as indebtedness provided through certain guarantee programs. The deduction for interest on qualified educational loans applies to loans provided through guarantee programs, organizations exempt from tax, or financial institutions under a supplemental education program. The loans must be used for qualified educational expenses within a reasonable timeframe. The deduction for interest on qualified educational loans is subject to a phaseout of benefits based on the taxpayer's adjusted gross income. The reduction in the amount of interest taken into account is determined by the ratio of the taxpayer's income over a certain threshold to the phaseout range. The deduction for interest on qualified educational loans is subject to a phaseout based on the taxpayer's adjusted gross income. For an unmarried individual, the applicable dollar amount is $40,000 with a phaseout range of $15,000. For joint filers, the applicable amount is $60,000 with a phaseout range of $30,000. In any other case, the applicable amount is zero. The deduction is only allowable for the first 48 months of repayment. The deduction for interest on qualified educational loans is subject to a phaseout based on the taxpayer's adjusted gross income. Qualified educational expenses include tuition, related expenses, and reasonable living expenses for the taxpayer, spouse, or dependent attending an eligible educational institution. The deduction for interest on qualified educational loans includes reasonable living expenses while away from home. The $40,000 and $60,000 phaseout amounts are adjusted for inflation annually. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1993, but only with respect to loans the first required payment on which is after such date."
