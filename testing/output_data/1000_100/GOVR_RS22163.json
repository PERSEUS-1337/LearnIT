Both sides are interdependent in terms of security, prosperity, and addressing global challenges such as economic concerns, terrorism, and nuclear proliferation. Supporters argue that working together allows for greater accomplishments in promoting democracy, human rights, and free markets. The trade and investment relationship between the United States and Europe is also significant and mutually beneficial. The transatlantic partnership between the United States and Europe is based on common values, interests, and goals. Both sides share a significant trade and investment relationship. The U.S. Congress engages with European legislators on various economic, security, and diplomatic issues, considering the dynamics of cooperation and competition. Many Members of Congress support a close transatlantic relationship and value organizations like the European Union and NATO. During the Cold War, a more integrated Europe was seen as a way to counter the Soviet Union. Congressional interest in Europe now focuses on finding like-minded partners for global challenges. The Euro-Atlantic community, including NATO and the EU, has been successful in promoting prosperity and security in Europe. The U.S. strongly supports these institutions to foster democratic states, reliable military allies, and strong trading relationships. The relationship between the United States and the EU has been growing in significance, with the EU becoming an important interlocutor for the US due to its common decisions and policies across various areas. The EU is also working on strengthening its Common Foreign and Security Policy and Common Security and Defense Policy. NATO remains the primary security institution in the Euro-Atlantic community, with the US playing a leading role in the alliance. The Euro-Atlantic community, led by the United States, maintains a significant interest in NATO. The alliance has expanded with 12 new member states from Central and Eastern Europe since the Cold War. Recent discussions have focused on NATO's future role and capabilities, influenced by the conflict in Ukraine and tensions with Russia. In 2014, leadership transitions occurred in the Euro-Atlantic institutions, including EU-wide elections for the European Parliament. In 2014, leadership transitions occurred in Euro-Atlantic institutions. The Socialists and Democrats group was reelected as President of the Parliament, Jens Stoltenberg became NATO Secretary General, and a new European Commission with Jean-Claude Juncker as President took office. Federica Mogherini replaced Catherine Ashton as the EU's High Representative, and Donald Tusk became President of the European Council. European perceptions of U.S. foreign policy under Obama were relatively favorable compared to the Bush Administration. The tone of transatlantic relations has been positive in recent years, with common approaches to global challenges. However, frustrations and reality checks have reminded both sides to be realistic. The crisis in Ukraine has led to a reevaluation of European security, with the US still playing a leading role in NATO and managing relations with Russia. The US continues to play a leading role in NATO and managing relations with Russia. There are hopes for Europe to share the burden of its own security, take a leading role in regional and international issues, and be an effective partner in addressing common threats. Concerns remain about Europe's economic difficulties, defense spending, military capabilities, and common foreign policy coherence. US officials and Members of Congress face complex political dynamics within the EU. The European financial crisis post-2008 global downturn revealed unresolved issues in EU integration, causing tensions among member states. Anti-establishment sentiment is rising due to mainstream parties' perceived inability to address economic and social problems, leading to the emergence of populist parties in many countries. In various countries, new populist parties with far-right and far-left policies are gaining strength, many of which are anti-EU to some extent. Euro-skeptic parties won a significant portion of votes in the 2014 European Parliament election. The trend will be further tested in national elections in several countries, including the UK, where a possible referendum on EU membership is anticipated. The possible national referendum on EU membership in the UK, the deterioration of US and European relations with Russia, and the transformation of Russia from a strategic partner to a strategic problem are key issues affecting Europe's ability to partner with the United States. Relations between Russia and the West have been strained for over a decade. Relations between Russia and the West have been tense for over a decade. Despite some efforts to improve cooperation, disagreements persist over various issues such as NATO enlargement, Kosovo's independence, and Russia's actions in Georgia. The \"reset\" initiative under the Obama Administration led to some improvements, but strains have increased due to ongoing disagreements. Relations between Russia and the West have been tense for over a decade, with disagreements persisting over NATO enlargement, Kosovo's independence, and Russia's actions in Georgia. Strains increased due to criticism of Russia's elections and backlash from Moscow. Russia's negative reactions included strong criticism of U.S. foreign policy, support for Assad in Syria, and opposition to NATO operations in Libya. The political crisis in Ukraine in 2013 further strained relations, bringing them to their lowest point. In November 2013, Russia pressured Ukraine to halt EU agreement in exchange for financial incentives. Yanukovych was ousted in February 2014 after protests against the move. Russia then annexed Crimea in February-March 2014, citing historical and military significance. The annexation of Crimea by Russia in 2014 was justified as rectifying a historical transfer, protecting inhabitants, and responding to the will of the population. The annexation and referendum are not recognized internationally, leading to sanctions. The conflict in eastern Ukraine since April 2014 has resulted in over 4,300 deaths. The conflict in Ukraine since April 2014 has led to over 4,300 deaths. The United States and Western governments believe Russian military units are directly involved, providing support to separatists. U.S.-European coordination in response to the situation has been strong, with aligned analyses and mutual sanctions. Russia denies providing more than political and humanitarian aid to the separatists. The shooting down of commercial passenger jet MH17 in July 2014 over eastern Ukraine, killing 298 people, including over 200 Europeans, prompted the EU to expand sanctions on Russia beyond individuals and specific entities to target wider sectors of the Russian economy. EU debates over sanctions are influenced by varying attitudes towards Russia, economic ties, and doubts about effectiveness. US policy makers express frustration with the EU's decision-making process. The EU expanded sanctions on Russia after the MH17 plane crash, targeting wider sectors of the Russian economy. Despite some European skepticism, all 28 EU member states unanimously agreed on the sanctions, viewing them as a political necessity. The sanctions are reviewed monthly and require unanimous consensus for renewal. Russia's economy has suffered from recession, a weakened ruble, and high inflation, mainly attributed to a sharp drop in oil prices. Most analysts attribute Russia's high inflation to a sharp drop in oil prices and Western sanctions. Speculation surrounds Russia's next steps in eastern Ukraine, ranging from maintaining a \"frozen conflict\" to seeking a de-escalation. EU proposed easing sanctions if Russia complies with ceasefire agreement. The High Representative emphasized that any proposal for resolving the Ukraine crisis depends on Russia's full implementation of the ceasefire agreement. With Vladimir Putin expected to remain Russia's leader, U.S. and European relations with Russia will continue to be a central topic for policy makers. Members of Congress may consider adopting additional sanctions and cooperating with European counterparts on Russia and Ukraine issues. The U.S. provided significant financial aid to Ukraine in 2014, including non-lethal aid and a $1 billion loan guarantee. Additional support in the form of $139 million in bilateral assistance was allocated in the FY2015 Omnibus Appropriations Act. The Ukraine Freedom Support Act authorized $350 million in military assistance, including lethal weapons, but the Administration has not provided such aid yet. The EU's policies towards Ukraine are also being examined for alignment with the U.S. efforts. The EU has provided over \u20ac11 billion in development assistance to Ukraine between 2014 and 2020. International financial aid is tied to Ukraine's economic reforms and anti-corruption efforts. Developments in Ukraine have sparked debates about NATO's role and influenced U.S. views on European defense issues. Russia's actions in Ukraine have led to calls for NATO to focus on collective territorial defense. The Obama Administration's European Reassurance Initiative (ERI) aims to reassure European allies of the U.S. commitment to European security in response to Russian aggression. Congress allocated $810 million for the initiative, which includes troop rotations to Poland and the Baltic states and pre-positioning military equipment in Eastern Europe. The U.S. military presence in Europe under ERI is rotational. The U.S. military presence in Europe under the European Reassurance Initiative (ERI) is rotational, with no plans to permanently increase personnel. Despite budget constraints, concerns remain about declining European defense budgets and a growing transatlantic military \"capabilities gap\" potentially undermining NATO unity. European militaries lack key capabilities such as strategic air- and sealift, aerial refueling, helicopters, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. Efforts for defense integration through initiatives like NATO's \"Smart Defense\" have had limited success. NATO faces differing views on focusing on out-of-area operations versus collective territorial defense. The 2010 NATO summit outlined three core tasks: collective defense, crisis management, and security cooperation. The 2010 NATO summit outlined three core tasks for NATO: collective defense, crisis management, and cooperative security. The Strategic Concept emphasizes NATO's role in ensuring collective defense and security, while also urging member states to develop capabilities for expeditionary operations and address unconventional security challenges. However, concerns exist about public opposition to combat operations, political will, and resource shortages in Europe. In response to increased threat perceptions from Russia, some European countries, including Poland and the Baltic states, have called for permanent U.S. and NATO forces on their territory. The European Reassurance Initiative involves rotating forces, increased exercises, and pre-positioning of assets to enhance security. NATO has tripled fighter aircraft for the Baltic Air Policing mission, and at the 2014 Summit, member countries agreed to a \"Readiness Action Plan\" for collective defense reinforcement. The NATO allies have outlined measures in Central and Eastern Europe to enhance infrastructure, pre-position equipment, and establish bases for troop deployments. They have agreed to create a new Very High Readiness Joint Task Force (VJTF) as part of the NATO Response Force, with a land force of about 4,000 soldiers capable of deploying within days. Additionally, allied leaders pledged to increase defense spending to 2% of national GDP within a decade. Tensions between the EU and Russia have also raised concerns about European energy security. Europe's energy security is a major concern due to its heavy reliance on Russian gas imports. Moscow has been using energy supplies as a tool for foreign policy leverage, acquiring ownership of European energy infrastructure. Concerns arise from Russia's lack of transparency and market reciprocity in business practices. The possibility of gas cutoffs adds to the unease. Europe's heavy reliance on Russian gas imports raises concerns about energy security. The potential for gas cutoffs, as seen in past disputes between Russia and Ukraine, adds to the unease. U.S. officials view European energy security as a priority and have encouraged diversification of energy sources to reduce dependence on Russia. However, Europe faces challenges in diversifying its energy supply. Europe faces challenges in diversifying its energy supply, with North Africa and Central Asia being potential alternate suppliers. Political and economic instability in North Africa hinders its role as a supplier, while Russia opposes the development of alternative pipelines to Central Asia. European countries are also focusing on renewable energy, but the contribution remains uncertain. Efforts to develop a common European energy strategy have had mixed success, including initiatives to liberalize and integrate the internal energy market. Efforts to liberalize and integrate the European energy market have been accelerated due to recent events in Ukraine and Crimea. Countries have built LNG terminals, expanded pipeline interconnectivity, and developed mechanisms to mitigate gas supply disruptions. A proposal for an EU \"energy union\" with a single agency purchasing gas for all members has been suggested, along with solidarity mechanisms for supply disruptions. Before recent events in Ukraine, the EU had already adopted legislation to increase competition and transparency in the energy sector by separating gas production from distribution and requiring an independent operator for transit systems. Russia criticized this legislation and canceled the South Stream project in December 2014, which was seen as a response to EU bureaucratic obstacles and criticism of Russia's actions in Ukraine. Russia abandoned a politically and financially burdensome project in Europe, seeking to diversify its gas markets with China and Turkey. The US led a coalition to combat the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, with NATO countries participating in airstrikes and providing support to Iraqi forces. European countries have pledged trainers, advisers, weapons, and aid to Iraqi forces and Kurdish forces in Iraq. European military action against IS has been limited to Iraq due to political and legal challenges in Syria. The EU has condemned the Assad government in Syria and imposed sanctions, alongside the US. The EU lifted an embargo on arming Syrian rebel forces in 2013, but European countries' support for opposition forces has consisted mainly of non-lethal equipment, humanitarian assistance, and training. Concerns about Europe's vulnerability to terrorism were heightened after the January 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris. Authorities conducted raids to break up an Islamic State-linked terrorist cell in Belgium shortly after the attacks. Growing concerns about \"foreign fighters\" joining the Islamic State have been expressed by analysts and European governments. Recent estimates from Europol suggest that 3,000 to 5,000 individuals from Europe and other Western countries, including significant EU countries, have traveled to Syria and Iraq to join extremist groups. Authorities are concerned that these fighters may return home with extremist views and training, potentially carrying out terrorist attacks in Europe. Some experts question the widespread threat, noting that not all foreign fighters intend to return to Europe. European governments are addressing security concerns by increasing surveillance, combating terrorist recruitment, and prohibiting travel. Measures include arresting individuals suspected of planning to travel to Syria, confiscating passports, detaining returning fighters, and setting up websites and hotlines for concerned family members. However, challenges remain in stemming the flow of European fighters to Syria and Iraq and tracking their movements due to differing national views hindering an EU-wide approach. The EU faces challenges in coordinating counterterrorism efforts due to differing national views on issues like intelligence-sharing and data privacy. The Paris attacks have reignited debates on enhancing security measures, including the potential creation of an EU airline passenger name record system. Transatlantic cooperation on counterterrorism has been strong since 9/11. Since the 9/11 attacks, transatlantic cooperation on counterterrorism between the U.S. and EU has been robust. Regular dialogues are maintained at various levels, with agreements on extradition, legal assistance, container security, and airline passenger data sharing. Efforts to strengthen aviation, transport, and border security are ongoing, including tracking and countering terrorism financing through forums like the Financial Action Task Force and the U.S.-EU \"SWIFT agreement.\" The EU and US have strong counterterrorism cooperation, but tensions exist over data privacy safeguards. European concerns have delayed agreements on SWIFT and airline passenger data sharing. Negotiations for a Data Privacy and Protection Agreement have been ongoing since 2011. The EU and US have been negotiating a Data Privacy and Protection Agreement (DPPA) since 2011. The EU added Hezbollah's military wing to its terrorist list in 2013, a move supported by the US. There are concerns that listing only Hezbollah's military wing is insufficient as the group can still fundraise in Europe. In 2014, the EU General Court ruled that Hamas should be removed from the terrorist list due to procedural issues. The EU External Action Service responded that the ruling to remove Hamas from the terrorist list was not a political decision. The United States and Israel urged the EU to maintain sanctions against Hamas. Europe has played a central role in international efforts to ensure Iran's nuclear program is peaceful, with close transatlantic cooperation. France, Germany, and the UK formed the P5+1 group with the US, Russia, and China for negotiations with Iran. Between 2006 and 2010, the EU-3 and the United States pushed for UN Security Council sanctions on Iran. Since 2010, the EU has imposed additional sanctions independently, aligning with US policy. This includes an oil embargo, restrictions on nuclear technology, arms embargo, and financial transaction limitations with Iran. Following concerted sanctions by the United States, the EU, and other international partners, Iran faced restrictions on financial transactions, cargo vessels, and aircraft. More than 100 individuals involved in Iran's nuclear program were subjected to a visa ban and asset freeze, along with over 480 entities supporting the program. The pressure led to a shift in Iran's stance on negotiations, culminating in the Joint Plan of Action (JPA) agreed upon by the P5+1 and Iran in November 2013 after the election of President Hassan Rouhani. The Joint Plan of Action (JPA) was agreed upon in November 2013 to address Iran's nuclear program. It required Iran to freeze some nuclear activities and cooperate with monitoring by the IAEA in exchange for limited sanctions relief. The relief measures included allowing Iran to repatriate proceeds from oil sales, suspending certain trade restrictions, and increasing financial transfer thresholds. The JPA's terms have been extended twice, most recently to July 6, 2015, as negotiators work towards a final deal. Despite progress, significant differences remain. Negotiators are working towards a final deal on Iran's nuclear program in 2015, but significant differences remain. Concerns exist about Iran's potential to develop a nuclear weapon and increase regional power. The EU-3 foreign ministers oppose new U.S. sanctions, fearing they could jeopardize negotiations. The diplomatic quartet, including the U.S., EU, Russia, and the UN, is involved in mediating the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The EU is involved in mediating the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, advocating for a two-state solution. Recent talks have been unsuccessful, and European support for Palestinians has caused concerns for Israel. Avigdor Lieberman highlighted European support for Palestinians as Israel's top diplomatic challenge. Several European countries, including Sweden, France, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, and the UK, have passed resolutions in favor of recognizing a Palestinian state. Concerns also arise regarding potential economic repercussions with the EU, Israel's largest trading partner. Possible ICC investigations of Israelis' actions in the West Bank and Gaza, potential EU measures such as funding restrictions and product labeling for settlements, and speculation about another U.N. Security Council resolution. Analysts believe these actions do not pose a significant economic threat to Israel, as no European government supports boycotting Israel. High Representative Mogherini stated that there are no current plans for sanctions, but rather a focus on motivating parties to restart discussions. The EU is focused on motivating parties to restart peace talks rather than imposing sanctions. Reports suggest financial incentives and an upgrade in ties for Israel and Palestinians with a successful peace agreement. The US and EU have a significant trade relationship, generating $5 trillion annually and providing millions of jobs. Merchandise trade totaled $787 billion in 2013, with European companies being major investors in the US. The total assets of European affiliates in the United States were approximately $8.7 trillion in 2012, and U.S. corporate assets in Europe totaled over $13 trillion. The transatlantic economic relationship between the United States and the EU is highly influential in shaping global standards and regulations. Efforts to liberalize world trade have been primarily driven by U.S.-EU cooperation. Negotiations for a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) have been ongoing since July 2013, aiming to reduce barriers and boost jobs and growth on both sides of the Atlantic. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) aims to harmonize regulations and standards between the U.S. and EU to boost GDP and define global standards. Stakeholders see it as vital for the transatlantic relationship, but there are concerns about potential fallout if negotiations fail. Critics have raised objections that could pose obstacles to finalizing a draft agreement by the end of 2015. Many European critics have raised objections to the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) due to concerns about provisions for investor-state dispute settlement and potential impacts on regulations, data privacy, and food labeling. The U.S. is considering reauthorizing Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) to set trade negotiating objectives. The Eurozone crisis dominated European politics from 2010 to 2012, raising doubts about the sustainability of the monetary union. Some predicted that the crisis would lead to countries exiting the euro. After prolonged debates and disagreements, EU leaders took unprecedented steps to address the Eurozone crisis by tightening fiscal rules, strengthening the banking sector, and creating sovereign rescue funds. The European Central Bank intervened by purchasing sovereign debt and providing incentives for bank lending. Market confidence has improved since 2013, but analysts remain skeptical about the crisis being definitively over. Analysts question the effectiveness of national austerity efforts and economic reform programs in Europe, with forecasts predicting low economic growth and high unemployment in 2015. The potential stand-off between the EU and the Syriza-led government in Greece over austerity terms raises concerns about market unease and long-term economic stagnation. The ECB announced a massive stimulus program with the purchase of \u20ac1.1 trillion in January 2015. The ECB announced a \u20ac1.1 trillion stimulus program to purchase government and private bonds over a 19-month period starting in March. Concerns about the Eurozone crisis affecting U.S. growth have been mitigated by the U.S. economy moving ahead despite Europe's difficulties. Congress may still have concerns about the impact of European economic conditions on the U.S. and global economies, as well as on U.S. export, banking, and investment interests. Tensions in the transatlantic relationship were heightened by reports of NSA surveillance programs targeting European entities, including the EU offices in Washington, DC and German Chancellor Angela Merkel's cell phone. The leaked documents from Edward Snowden revealed NSA and UK's Government Communications Headquarters operations targeting EU offices in Washington, DC and German Chancellor Angela Merkel's cell phone. This raised concerns about U.S. surveillance, European involvement, and the balance between security and privacy rights. The allegations damaged transatlantic trust and strained U.S.-European ties. European leaders and citizens were dismayed by potential privacy violations. Criticism in Germany over NSA activities, concerns about privacy rights, and civil liberties. Fallout could impact U.S.-European cooperation on counterterrorism and data privacy agreements. European Parliament objections to SWIFT and PNR agreements intensified. MEPs worried about U.S. data protection safeguards and access to European citizens' data. The European Parliament's concerns about U.S. data protection safeguards and access to European citizens' personal data have intensified. Calls for suspension of the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor agreement have been made, with potential impacts on economic relations and negotiations on the proposed TTIP. Some analysts believe tensions are manageable and do not pose a sustained threat to the transatlantic relationship, suggesting that outrage from European leaders may be for domestic consumption. The diminishment of Arctic sea ice has increased human activities in the region, with the Northern Sea Route and Northwest Passage expected to become ice-free, reducing costs for commercial ships. Melting Arctic ice has implications for fisheries, tourism, and scientific research. The United States will take over the two-year rotating chairmanship of the Arctic Council in May 2015. The Arctic Council, created in 1996, is the primary intergovernmental forum for cooperation in the Arctic region, addressing issues such as regional development, emergency response, climate change, and natural resource extraction. Membership consists of the eight countries with sovereign territory within the Arctic Circle. The Arctic Council, consisting of Norway, Denmark (Greenland), Finland, Sweden, and Iceland, does not address security issues but is seen as geopolitically significant. Coastal states are willing to establish military presence in the region. Russia is expanding its Arctic presence, expressing intent to protect its interests. Concerns exist about potential spillover from tensions over Ukraine affecting Arctic cooperation. The Arctic Council, consisting of Norway, Denmark (Greenland), Finland, Sweden, and Iceland, does not address security issues but is seen as geopolitically significant. Russia is expanding its Arctic presence, expressing intent to protect its interests. Concerns exist about potential spillover from tensions over Ukraine affecting Arctic cooperation. Ukraine's situation could have repercussions for Arctic cooperation, with China also showing interest in the region. Various European countries and other nations hold observer status in the Arctic Council. John Kerry appointed Admiral Robert J. Papp, Jr. as the first U.S. Special Representative for the Arctic in 2014. The U.S. chaired the Arctic Council from 2015-2017 with a focus on \"One Arctic, With Shared Opportunities, Challenges, Responsibilities.\" Priorities included stewardship of the Arctic Ocean, climate change, and economic issues through the Arctic Economic Council."
