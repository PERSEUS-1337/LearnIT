    "content": "The \"States as Energy Leaders for the Future Act\" or \"SELF Act\" defines terms like \"eligible entity\" and \"Secretary\" for the Clean Energy Grant Program. The Department of Energy established a program to provide grants to eligible entities for clean energy and carbon reduction measures, including renewable electricity standards, climate action plans, use of alternative vehicles, energy efficiency standards for public buildings, participation in greenhouse gas reduction programs, on-bill financing for energy efficiency improvements, and State tax incentives for manufacturing. The Department of Energy program offers grants for clean energy initiatives such as State tax incentives, financing mechanisms, grid technology improvements, and carbon efficiency standards. Eligible entities must meet requirements set by the Secretary in partnership with private sector and non-governmental organizations. The Secretary will determine grant recipients and amounts based on application information and criteria developed by regulation. Grant funds must be used for eligible purposes specified by the Secretary. Regulations establishing grant criteria will be issued promptly after the Act's enactment. The Secretary will establish criteria for grants, including eligible measures, application criteria, and a point system. Considerations will include regional disparities in energy production and clean energy potential. An explanation of how grants will be objectively evaluated will be published after the Act's enactment. Authorization of $5 billion for fiscal year 2011 to carry out the Act.
