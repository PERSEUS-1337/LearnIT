    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Alien Smuggling and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2007\". Congress finds that alien smuggling is a transnational crime that violates US borders, compromises sovereignty, and poses a risk of terrorist activity. Aggressive enforcement is needed to protect the nation, with recognition for the efforts of border security agencies and law enforcement. The law enforcement community needs stronger statutory tools to address the security threat of alien smuggling.
