    "title": "AB 575",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The state board must adopt basic instructional materials for kindergarten and grades 1 to 8 in subject areas like language arts, spelling, reading, and English language development. At least five materials must be adopted for each grade level in these subjects. The state board must adopt basic instructional materials for various subject areas including Mathematics, Science, Social Science, Bilingual or Bicultural subjects, and any other subject deemed necessary. Procedures for submission of instructional materials must be established by the state board. The state board adopts instructional materials for different subjects every eight years, with restrictions on resubmission of rejected materials without substantive changes. If revisions to instructional material are submitted after the specified timeframe, a fee will be assessed by the department on the publisher or manufacturer. The submitted materials must be adopted or rejected within six months, with a possible extension of up to three months if needed. The review process for instructional materials involves committees with volunteer content experts and teachers from various grade levels and subjects. The adoption rules are transparent and applicable to all formats of materials. The state board uses specific criteria to review and adopt basic instructional materials. The state board reviews instructional materials to ensure they meet quality standards, comply with guidelines, are factually accurate, and aligned with content standards. Instructional materials should not include unnecessary exposure to commercial brand names, products, or logos unless deemed necessary for educational purposes or incidental to the illustration. The state board establishes criteria for instructional materials adoption, with specific reasons required if materials are rejected. The state board may adopt fewer than five basic instructional materials in each subject area for each grade level under certain conditions. If fewer than five materials are submitted or if they do not meet the criteria, the state board can adopt fewer materials. This section does not limit the state board's authority to adopt non-basic instructional materials. The state board shall prescribe procedures for an open and flexible materials submission system to ensure adopted materials meet diverse pupil needs, represent cultural pluralism, and provide a broad spectrum of knowledge and technology-based materials. The state board adopts instructional materials and provides a listing of them, including unit costs, to publishers and schools. The materials remain on the list until a new curriculum framework is adopted. Lists are available by subject and grade level on the department's website. The review committees allow publishers to include their corporate name or logo on instructional materials for basic information, copyright protection, or to identify third-party content sources. The state board may adopt regulations for exceptions, as determined by the board. The Superintendent will develop guidelines for implementation. Section 60227 of the Education Code defines followup adoptions and requires notice before conducting them in a subject area. The notice for followup adoptions specifies fees based on program submissions and grade levels. Fees cover costs and aim to be modest to avoid duplication of work from primary adoptions. The department requires publishers or manufacturers to declare intent to submit programs for followup adoption, specify grade levels, and pay a fee before review for adoption. The Legislature intends for the fee for followup adoption participation to not be prohibitive for small publishers or manufacturers. Small publishers or manufacturers may request a fee reduction. Small publishers and manufacturers are defined as independently owned or operated entities with 100 or fewer employees and average annual gross receipts of $10 million or less. Revenue from fees will be used for adoption and instructional material review costs. The department may recommend to the state board not to conduct a followup adoption if there is little interest from publishers and manufacturers. General fund revenue cannot be used for followup adoption costs. This section will be in effect until January 1, 2024, unless extended or deleted by a later statute."
