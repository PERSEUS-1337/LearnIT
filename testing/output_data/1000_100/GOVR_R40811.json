    "content": "Severe wildfires have been burning more structures and area due to unnaturally high accumulations of biomass. Congress is urged to provide more funding and authority for activities like prescribed burning and thinning to reduce biomass fuels and wildfire severity. Existing authorities for federal agencies to reduce biomass fuel are broad but indirect, with annual appropriations for hazardous fuels treatments and other management activities. Insufficient reporting on hazardous fuel treatment funding and accomplishments hinders Congress's ability to assess progress in reducing biomass fuels. Inadequate information on funding for thinning and other wildfire protection activities makes it difficult to compare benefits and costs. Improved reporting, disaggregated by ecosystem or fire regime, could enhance understanding and aid Congress in allocating funding effectively. In temperate ecosystems, wildfires are inevitable due to dry conditions and ignitions. Wildfires can be low-intensity surface fires or high-intensity crown fires, depending on fuel characteristics and weather conditions. Fire protection efforts focus on altering fuel characteristics to prevent or minimize damages caused by crown fires. Biomass fuels play a crucial role in wildfire behavior and effects. The moisture content, size, distribution, and quantity of fuels are key factors. Moisture content is especially important as it controls flammability, with green foliage fluctuating based on weather conditions. Even biomass with 100% moisture can burn in high winds once ignited. Biomass fuels with varying moisture content can burn, driven by high winds. Wildfire fuels are categorized by time lag fuels, with fine fuels drying out in 1 hour, followed by 10-hour, 100-hour, and 1,000-hour time lag fuels. Fine fuels ignite quickly and spread fires, while larger fuels contribute less to fire intensity and damage. The 1-hour time lag fuels burn quickly and contribute little to fire intensity and damage. The 10-hour time lag fuels also ignite quickly and can be carried by winds to start new fires. Larger fuels like the 1,000-hour time lag fuels burn intensely but do not contribute much to the rate of spread. Fuel distribution is important in determining fire behavior. Fuel distribution plays a crucial role in determining fire behavior, with compactness and continuity being key factors. Compact fuel beds slow down burning by reducing ventilation, while less compact beds allow for more air flow, drying out the fuels and feeding the fire. Continuity of fuels is essential for fire spread, and firelines are used to break this continuity. Factors like fuel size, moisture content, slope, and wind influence the width of breaks needed to control wildfires. Factors such as slope, wind speed, and fuel distribution affect fire behavior. Steep slopes and high winds can make fuels more flammable by reducing moisture content and raising temperatures. Continuous fuels, known as \"fuel ladders,\" can spread fires into the canopy, turning a surface fire into a crown fire. Wind is crucial for sustaining crown fires as green foliage typically has higher moisture content than dead biomass on the surface. The quantity of biomass fuels, known as fuel loads, varies widely and includes dead biomass, undergrowth, and undesirable trees. Fuel loads can range from less than 1 ton to more than 200 tons per acre, excluding live crown biomass in commercially valuable trees. The exclusion of live crown biomass in commercially valuable trees significantly impacts sustaining crown fires. Not all fuel is consumed in a wildfire, with smaller fuels being largely consumed compared to larger fuels. High intensity fires consume 100% of foliage and 75% of understory vegetation, but only 10% of tree branches and 5% of large tree stems, leaving many large-diameter fuels on the site. Fuel characteristics and resulting fires are influenced by ecosystem types. Some ecosystems are adapted to frequent low-intensity surface fires, while others are adapted to periodic high-intensity crown fires. Natural forested frequent-fire ecosystems have fire-resistant trees and open spaces due to frequent fires killing seedlings and shrubs. Grasslands and meadows are also adapted to relatively frequent wildfires. Surface-fire ecosystems in the U.S. historically had fuels of grasses, needles, and shrubs, but heavy grazing and logging led to an increase in fuel loads of small to mid-sized trees. Fire suppression further exacerbated the issue, resulting in higher fuel loads than natural. In the West, ecosystems have high fuel loads compared to historical levels, increasing the risk of catastrophic crown fires. Activities reducing fuel loads have shown to decrease wildfire severity in surface-fire ecosystems. Some ecosystems are adapted to high-intensity crown fires with dense, uniform fuels, like chaparral. Chaparral ecosystems in the Southwest are dominated by large shrubs and small trees, with crown fires occurring infrequently. Lodgepole pine is an example of a species that regenerates after fires. These ecosystems make up 42% of wildlands in the US and have uniform biomass fuels. Human activities have not significantly impacted fuel loads or fire behavior in these ecosystems. There is no evidence that reducing fuel loads and removing fuel ladders would affect the likelihood of catastrophic crown fires in chaparral ecosystems. Fuel treatment ineffectiveness was noted for southern California chaparral, as large fires were not dependent on old age classes of fuels. Catastrophic crown fires do not completely destroy all vegetation, as wildfires respond to minor variations in moisture and fuel characteristics, typically leaving some areas lightly burned or unburned. For example, the Yellowstone fires in 1988 left 30% of the reported burned area unburned and another 15%-20% lightly burned. Only about half of the reported acres burned were severely affected, with some ecosystems consistently burning with mixed-intensity fires. Whitebark pine, a slow-growing species found at high elevations, is an example of a species that survives mixed-intensity fires, allowing for the regeneration of true firs and spruces. Whitebark pine survives mixed-intensity fires, aided by Clark's nutcrackers spreading seeds. Other species in mixed-fire-regime ecosystems include Ponderosa pine and Lodgepole pine. The consequences of fuel reduction activities in these ecosystems are not well understood. The effects of fuel reduction activities in mixed-fire-regime ecosystems are uncertain, particularly regarding the potential for abnormal crown fires. While reducing fuel loads may help suppress wildfires in some ecosystems, it may not be effective for all. Additionally, reducing fuel loads does not necessarily protect structures and communities from wildfires. The Hayman Fire in 2002 highlighted the limitations of protecting infrastructure in the wildland-urban interface. 83% of homes within the fire perimeter survived relatively unscathed, with some surviving despite crown fires nearby. Reducing fuel loads may help in surface-fire ecosystems, but expanding low-intensity surface fires is also necessary to maintain lower fuel loads. Reducing fuel loads and eliminating fuel ladders are essential for the safe use of low-intensity wildfire and prescribed fire in surface-fire ecosystems. Common methods include prescribed burning and thinning, which can alter microclimates and increase surface temperatures. Thinning stands allows solar radiation to reach the forest floor, affecting fire fuel moisture levels. Prescribed burning and thinning are methods used to reduce fuel loads and eliminate fuel ladders in surface-fire ecosystems. Thinning stands allows solar radiation to reach the forest floor, increasing surface temperatures and decreasing fire fuel moisture. Prescribed burning involves the deliberate use of fire in specific areas under prescribed fuel and weather conditions, but it can escape control and cause extensive damage if conditions change. Prescribed burning primarily eliminates fine and small fuels by converting biomass to smoke and ashes. It has limitations as it does not affect large diameter fuels and is not effective in reducing tree density or crown density. Prescribed burning is risky due to potential wildfires, high costs, and health hazards from smoke. Federal land management agencies have policies in place for fire management. Wildland fire use, also known as \"let-burn,\" allows wildfires to burn with monitoring for fuel reduction. Thinning involves cutting and removing trees in a stand for commercial or precommercial use. Thinning alters biomass fuels by removing trees based on different approaches: low thinning removes small and poorly formed trees, crown thinning removes larger trees to open the canopy, and selection thinning removes less desirable trees. Thinning has advantages over prescribed burning as it is controlled, can eliminate ladder fuels, and reduces crown density. Thinning reduces crown density and can eliminate ladder fuels, creating a targeted stand structure. It is effective in reducing vertical fuel continuity that leads to crown fires. However, thinning leaves slash on the ground, increasing fuel load in the short term, which must be treated for fuel reduction. Thinning can reduce crown density and ladder fuels, creating a targeted stand structure. It may leave slash on the ground, increasing short-term fire hazards, but when combined with prescribed treatments, thinning can help reduce the risk of catastrophic crown fires in certain ecosystems. The effectiveness of combining thinning with prescribed burning to reduce the risk of catastrophic crown fires is limited and costly. Other proposed activities to reduce fuel loads include logging, especially salvage logging of stands with dead trees. Commercial logging focuses on removing large standing trees to reduce crown density. Logging for wood products reduces crown density but does little for fuel ladders and leaves slash. Commercial logging focuses on large trees and does not address crown base height, which contributes to the \"ladder effect\" in wildfires. Salvage of standing dead trees may reduce fuels, but standing dead trees with shed needles may contribute less to crown fires than live trees. Pruning trees by removing lower branches can reduce fuel ladders and crown density for wildfire protection. Pruning trees by removing lower branches reduces fuel ladders and crown density for wildfire protection. Five federal agencies are responsible for wildfire protection on federal lands, but none are explicitly authorized to reduce biomass fuels. Instead, they are implicitly authorized to do so within their mandate to preserve and protect the lands and resources under their jurisdiction. The federal agencies responsible for wildfire protection are directed to manage public lands to protect various values, preserve natural conditions, provide habitat for wildlife, and allow for outdoor recreation and human use. The BIA, FWS, and other federal agencies have broad management directions for the conservation and restoration of fish, wildlife, and plant resources. Indian forest land management activities include forest development, protection against wildfires, and biomass fuel reduction activities like prescribed burning and thinning. Agencies have specific funding programs and authority to use general management funds for these activities. The Forest Service has funding accounts for activities like prescribed burning and thinning to reduce biomass fuels. Hazardous Fuels funding increased significantly in FY2001 and continued to rise through FY2008, with a spike in FY2009 due to economic stimulus legislation. The specific use of Hazardous Fuels funding for prescribed burning or other activities, and the ecosystems where these activities occur, are not reported. In FY2009, funding for thinning and related activities decreased from the peak in FY2008. Thinning is funded within the Vegetation and Watershed Management account, which also covers reforestation, rangeland improvements, watershed protection, noxious weed control, and air quality management. Approximately 20% of appropriations in FY2008 went towards thinning, but the specific portion varies annually. The portion of thinning aimed at improving wildfire protection funded through Vegetation Management is unknown. The FS has mandatory spending accounts like Brush Disposal (BD) and Knutson-Vandenberg (K-V) Fund, funded by timber purchasers for activities to reduce biomass fuels and improve the forest. Activities include slash treatments like crushing, manual efforts, and prescribed burning to reduce fire hazards. Funding for thinning and related activities decreased in FY2009, with a portion aimed at improving wildfire protection funded through Vegetation Management. The FS has mandatory spending accounts like Brush Disposal (BD) and Knutson-Vandenberg (K-V) Fund, funded by timber purchasers for activities to reduce biomass fuels and improve the forest. K-V funds can be used for reforestation and forest improvement, similar to Vegetation and Watershed Management Appropriations. Stewardship contracting allows for forest stewardship activities, including thinning for fuel reduction, funded through timber sale contracts generating net receipts. Funding for thinning and wildfire protection improvements is not reported. The DOI agencies receive appropriations for fuel reduction activities, with the majority of funding for prescribed burning coming from the Hazardous Fuels sub-account. Funding for thinning and other fuel reduction activities is provided through general land and resource management accounts. DOI fuel reduction funding has been stable since FY2001. Wildland Fire Management is now funded as a department-wide program. Ecosystems treated by each method and the portion used for prescribed burning are not reported. The DOI agencies receive appropriations for fuel reduction activities from general land and resource management accounts. Funds can be used for activities to reduce biomass fuels and protect natural and cultural resources, thus reducing wildfire threats. The BIA and BLM have funding accounts for activities that reduce wildfire threats on Indian lands and damaged forests. The specific portion of funds used for fuel reduction activities is unknown. Federal authorities for assisting fuel reduction on nonfederal lands are limited. The FS has two assistance programs for wildfire protection, including fuel reduction. Other agencies do not have similar programs for state, local, or private landowners. Funding for fuel reduction activities is available through the State Fire Assistance and Volunteer Fire Assistance programs. The FS provides technical and financial assistance for fire prevention, control, and prescribed burning for rural volunteer fire departments. Funding allocation is at the agency's discretion, with a focus on fuel reduction. The Community Wildfire Protection program aims to expand outreach, education, and establish defensible space around private properties. The FS provides assistance for fire prevention and fuel reduction on private lands with the landowner's consent. No funds have been allocated for this program yet, but State Fire Assistance funding could be used. Other programs offer financial and technical support for forest stewardship, forest health protection, and emergency restoration. The amount of funds that could contribute to wildfire protection through biomass fuel reduction is unknown."
