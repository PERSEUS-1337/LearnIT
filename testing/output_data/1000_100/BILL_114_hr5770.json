The \"Department of Veterans Affairs Dental Insurance Reauthorization Act of 2016\" establishes a dental insurance plan for veterans, survivors, and dependents. This plan covers veterans enrolled in the annual patient enrollment system and survivors or dependents eligible for medical care under specific sections of the title. The Secretary will administer this plan through contracts with dental providers. The Secretary will contract with a dental insurer to administer the dental insurance plan, providing benefits for dental care such as diagnostic, preventative, restorative, surgical, and emergency services. Enrollment in the plan is voluntary for a minimum period set by the Secretary, with premiums determined to cover all associated costs. The Secretary will adjust premiums annually for the dental insurance plan and notify individuals of any changes. Enrollees must pay the full premium and copayments. Voluntary disenrollment is allowed within 30 days of enrollment. The dental insurance plan allows for voluntary disenrollment under certain circumstances prescribed by the Secretary, such as relocation outside the plan's jurisdiction or a serious medical condition preventing benefit use. The Secretary establishes procedures for voluntary disenrollments under the dental insurance plan to ensure timely determinations. Participation in the plan does not affect entitlement to outpatient dental services provided by the Secretary. The dental insurance plan will be administered according to regulations set by the Secretary and will terminate on December 31, 2021. A clerical amendment will be made to the table of sections in chapter 17 of the title. The dental insurance plan for veterans and survivors, along with dependents of veterans, will be established. Section 510 of the Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of 2010 is repealed, and a clerical amendment will be made to the table of contents."
