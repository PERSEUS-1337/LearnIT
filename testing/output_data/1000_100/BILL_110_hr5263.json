The Forest Landscape Restoration Act aims to promote collaborative ecosystem restoration in priority forest landscapes by encouraging sustainability, leveraging local and national resources, reducing wildfire management costs, and demonstrating the effectiveness of ecological restoration techniques and forest restoration byproducts. The Forest Landscape Restoration Act aims to promote collaborative ecosystem restoration in priority forest landscapes by reducing wildfire management costs and demonstrating the effectiveness of ecological restoration techniques and forest restoration byproducts, offsetting treatment costs while benefiting rural economies and improving forest health. The Forest Landscape Restoration Act defines key terms such as \"covered Federal lands,\" \"Fund,\" \"program,\" and \"Secretaries.\" It establishes the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program under the joint authority of the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture. The Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program is established by the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture to select and fund ecological restoration treatments for priority forest landscapes. Activities must comply with the Endangered Species Act and National Environmental Policy Act. Eligibility criteria for proposals include a complete landscape restoration strategy. The Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program prioritizes ecological restoration treatments for large forested landscapes in need of active ecosystem restoration. The program incorporates the best available science and focuses on landscapes accessible by wood-processing infrastructure for utilizing woody biomass. The Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program prioritizes ecological restoration using the best available science and tools, focusing on old-growth maintenance and large-tree retention. The program does not involve establishing permanent roads and is developed through a collaborative process involving diverse interests. The Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program focuses on ecological restoration through various projects like using fire, improving habitat for wildlife, maintaining water quality, controlling invasive species, managing roads, and utilizing woody biomass. The program focuses on using woody biomass and small-diameter trees for landscape restoration, reporting annually on performance, and providing employment and training opportunities in rural communities through various entities and partnerships. The program aims to utilize woody biomass and small-diameter trees for landscape restoration, providing employment and training opportunities in rural communities through partnerships with non-profit youth groups, small businesses, and other entities. It also includes analyzing cost savings from reduced wildfire management costs and estimating annual Federal funding needed for implementation. The collaborative forest landscape restoration proposal must include the amount of new non-Federal investment leveraged by Federal funding and be subject to additional requirements determined by the Secretaries for efficient administration. The nomination process involves submitting the proposal to the Bureau of Land Management Director and Regional Forester, who can then nominate the proposal. Management or a Regional Forester can nominate collaborative forest landscape restoration proposals for selection by the Secretaries. The State Director or Regional Forester making the nomination must include a proposal to use Federal funds for ecological restoration treatments on covered Federal lands. The collaborative forest landscape restoration proposal must include a restoration strategy not covered by Fund transfers. Evidence is required that funds transferred to the Secretaries will be used for ecological restoration treatments in the same fiscal year. Activities on non-jurisdictional land may be included in the proposal. The State Director must provide evidence of the non-covered Federal land owner's intent to participate and fund activities. The Secretaries will select the best collaborative forest landscape restoration proposals meeting eligibility criteria. In selecting collaborative forest landscape restoration proposals, the Secretaries consider ecological case strength, collaborative process, cost reduction potential, wildfire management cost reductions, landscape restoration proposal strength, and non-Federal involvement. The Secretaries may select up to 10 collaborative forest landscape restoration proposals for funding each fiscal year, with a limit of 2 proposals per region. A scientific advisory panel of experts will evaluate and provide recommendations on nominated proposals. The Secretaries may establish a technical advisory panel of experts to evaluate and provide recommendations on collaborative forest landscape restoration proposals based on ecological strength, restoration strategies, and potential cost reductions in wildfire management. The Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Fund is established in the Treasury of the United States to pay up to 50% of the cost of ecological restoration treatments on covered Federal lands for selected proposals. The Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Fund authorizes appropriations of $40,000,000 annually for ecological restoration treatments. The Secretaries can request transfers from the Fund for necessary expenditures. An accounting and reporting system is established for the Fund. Program implementation and monitoring require a work plan within 180 days of a collaborative proposal. The Secretaries will create an implementation work plan and budget for a collaborative forest landscape restoration proposal, focusing on ecological and community economic benefits, cost reductions, infrastructure needs, and sustainability over 10 years. The Secretaries will create an implementation work plan and budget for a collaborative forest landscape restoration proposal, focusing on ecological and community economic benefits, cost reductions, infrastructure needs, and sustainability over 10 years. The proposal includes assessing the sustainability of woody biomass supply, local economic benefits, and documentation of non-Federal investments in the priority landscape. Amounts transferred from the Fund will be used for ecological restoration treatments consistent with the proposal and identified through a collaborative process. The Secretaries will prepare an annual report on the accomplishments of collaborative forest landscape restoration proposals, detailing treated acres, progress evaluation, community benefits, and monitoring results. The Secretaries will use multiparty monitoring to assess the effects of collaborative forest landscape restoration projects for at least 15 years. They will provide a report on the program every 5 years, including costs of treatments and fire management activities. The Secretaries will submit a report on the program's effectiveness to specific Senate and House committees as required by the Act."
