The Congress finds that asthma affects millions of Americans, with a significant impact on children. Allergies, including allergic asthma, also affect a large portion of the population. Asthma is a common respiratory disease in children, leading to school absenteeism and preventable hospitalizations. The prevalence of asthma has increased significantly, especially among preschool children. Women and low-income families are more likely to be affected by asthma. In families with annual incomes below $10,000, 79.2 out of 1,000 individuals under 45 have asthma, compared to 53.6 out of 1,000 in families earning $20,000 to $35,000. In 1997, over 5,000 Americans died from asthma attacks. African Americans had an average of 38.5 deaths per million individuals from asthma, while Caucasians had 15.1 deaths per million. Asthma costs the US over $12 billion annually, with rising prevalence leading to higher future costs. African Americans are five times more likely than other groups to seek asthma care in emergency rooms. The asthma death rate is significantly higher among African American children and adults.
