    "content": "The curr_chunk is a section titled \"TREATMENT OF LIABILITY FOR CERTAIN MULTIPLE EMPLOYER PLANS.\" The curr_chunk discusses the election for an eligible employer to spin off liability for an applicable pension plan. If the employer elects subsection (b), their liability will be determined under that subsection, otherwise, it will be determined under subsection (c). The eligible spunoff plan determines the employer's liability for the pension plan instead of any other liability to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. The ongoing funding liability for an eligible spunoff plan is exempt from certain provisions of the Pension Protection Act of 2006. The employer maintaining the eligible spunoff plan is liable for ongoing contributions on the same terms as under ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code, in lieu of any other liability to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. The employer maintaining the eligible spunoff plan is liable for ongoing contributions on the same terms as under ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code, in lieu of any other liability to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. Interest rates for eligible spunoff plans are determined based on specific sections of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. If an eligible spunoff plan terminates under title IV of ERISA on or before December 31, 2010, the employer's liability resulting from the termination shall be determined according to specific sections of ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code. The employer's liability for a terminated pension plan under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 is determined based on specific assumptions and methods. If an eligible employer does not elect spinoff, they will be liable to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation instead of the applicable pension plan. The employer's liability for a terminated pension plan under ERISA is determined based on specific assumptions and methods. If an eligible employer does not elect spinoff, they will be liable to the PBGC instead of the applicable pension plan. The adjusted unfunded benefit liabilities of a plan as of December 31, 2005, will be calculated for the transfer to an eligible spunoff plan. The text discusses the calculation of employer liability for a terminated pension plan under ERISA and the definition of \"fractional portion\" for contribution to the applicable pension plan. The curr_chunk defines \"applicable pension plan\" as a single employer plan established in Alaska on March 18, 1967, with 2 or more contributing sponsors not under common control. It also defines \"allocable portion\" as the portion of liabilities and assets of the plan related to an eligible employer's share. An eligible employer is defined as a participant in an eligible multiple employer plan after January 1, 2000, who made an election under subsection (b) of the excess of plan liabilities over assets."
