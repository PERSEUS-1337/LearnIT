    "content": "This report analyzes forest management provisions enacted in the 115th Congress through two legislative vehicles: The Stephen Sepp Wildfire Suppression Funding and Forest Management Activities Act and the Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018. These laws address forest management on federal and nonfederal lands, as well as forestry research. This report focuses on forest management provisions enacted in the 115th Congress, specifically related to federal forest lands managed by the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management. It discusses laws such as the National Environmental Policy Act and the Healthy Forests Restoration Act that authorize forest management activities and decision-making processes for these agencies. The report summarizes and analyzes provisions enacted in the 115th Congress that affect how the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management implement forest management activities. It covers project planning, wildland fire management, forest management and restoration programs, and miscellaneous issues. The report discusses changes made in Congress, potential issues for Congress, and includes side-by-side tables comparing forest-related provisions in each law to prior law. Approximately 145 million acres of the 193-million-acre National Forest System consists of forests and woodlands. Congress directed that management of the national forests shall protect watersheds, forests, and provide a continuous timber supply for US citizens. The Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960 added recreation, livestock grazing, energy development, and wildlife protection as official uses of national forests, in addition to timber production. Management of resources is to be coordinated for multiple use, considering the relative values of various resources. The National Forest Management Act of 1976 requires the Forest Service to prepare comprehensive land and resource management plans for each National Forest System unit, developed with public involvement and compliance with various laws including NEPA, ESA, and NHPA. Plans aim to maintain resource outputs without impairing land productivity. The Forest Service prepares forest plans for each NFS unit, outlining desired resource conditions but not specific on-the-ground actions. Projects, such as timber harvests and trail maintenance, must align with the forest plan's objectives and follow FS procedures to ensure compliance with laws like NEPA and ESA. BLM manages 246 million acres of public lands. BLM manages 246 million acres of public lands, including 38 million acres of woodlands and forests. These lands are managed under the principles of multiple use and sustained yield, similar to the NFS. The 2.6 million acres of Oregon and California Railroad Lands in western Oregon are managed for permanent forest production, providing timber, protecting watersheds, offering recreational opportunities, and supporting local economies. BLM is directed by FLPMA to prepare and maintain resource management plans for on-the-ground activities, ensuring compliance with laws like NEPA, ESA, and NHPA. NEPA requires identifying environmental impacts before final decisions, with significant impacts requiring an EIS and uncertain impacts requiring an EA. The NEPA process involves preparing an environmental assessment (EA) to determine if an EIS is needed or if a finding of no significant impact (FONSI) can be issued. Agencies must evaluate impacts and alternatives, including a no-action alternative. Categorical exclusions (CEs) are actions with no significant environmental effects, exempt from EIS or EA requirements. FS and BLM have identified CEs based on past experience, some established by Congress. In implementing NEPA, federal agencies determine actions that require further documentation, such as decision memoranda. Agencies list actions requiring EIS, EA with FONSI, or CEs. FS and BLM regulations identify resource conditions for potential significant environmental effects, triggering EA or EIS analysis. The presence of extraordinary circumstances like flood plains, endangered species habitats, and archaeological sites may require further analysis in an EA or EIS. NEPA serves as a framework to identify environmental impacts and compliance processes for projects. The agency's NEPA process identifies project impacts triggering additional environmental review requirements under ESA and NHPA. Compliance with NEPA waived for certain actions still requires adherence to other federal laws. HFRA aims to expedite planning for hazardous fuel reduction projects on NFS and BLM lands to mitigate wildfire risks by removing biomass fuel sources. HFRA defines specific projects and authorizes an expedited planning process for them. The HFRA authorization allows for projects covering up to 20 million acres of federal land, focusing on reducing hazardous fuels in at-risk communities through methods like prescribed fire and mechanical measures. Fire regimes and condition classes are terms used to describe changes in historical fire patterns compared to current ones, helping prioritize hazardous fuel reduction projects. Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) refers to areas near at-risk communities where HFRA projects can be conducted, including those with significant departure from historical fire regimes. HFRA projects focus on mitigating fire risks in areas affected by various factors like wind, ice, insects, diseases, or endangered species habitats. Projects must align with land management plans and prioritize thinning, prescribed burns, and tree removal to modify fire behavior while preserving large or old-growth trees. An objection process is in place for proposed HFRA projects. The objection process for proposed HFRA projects requires objections to be filed within 30 days of the agency's publication of draft decision documents. Objections are limited to parties that submitted specific comments during the comment periods and may only be on issues raised within those comments. Judicial review in federal court is available if the objector is not satisfied after the administrative review process. The objection process for HFRA projects requires objections to be filed within 30 days of the agency's publication of draft decision documents. Objections are limited to parties that submitted specific comments during the comment periods and may only be on issues raised within those comments. Judicial review in federal court is available if the objector is not satisfied after the administrative review process. Congress directed FS to replace the post-decisional administrative appeals process for non-HFRA projects with the pre-decisional objection process used by HFRA projects. All FS projects now fall under the same pre-decisional objection process, with some differences between HFRA and non-HFRA projects. The Agricultural Act of 2014 added a new Section 602 to HFRA, authorizing the establishment of landscape-scale insect and disease treatment areas within the NFS, by state, as requested by the state governor. The Forest Service has designated approximately 74.5 million acres nationwide for insect and disease treatment areas based on declining forest health and risk of tree mortality. Projects within these designated areas aim to reduce the risk of infestations and increase resilience. The Forest Service has designated 74.5 million acres nationwide for insect and disease treatment areas to reduce infestation risk and increase resilience. Hazardous fuel reduction projects must follow HFRA guidelines, including collaboration with government entities, consideration of best available science, and retention of old-growth trees. Projects in the WUI require analysis of proposed action and one alternative, while projects outside the WUI must consider a no-action alternative. Congress authorized FS to identify eligible NFS areas for designation as I&D. Congress authorized the Forest Service to identify eligible National Forest System areas for designation as Insect and Disease (I&D) areas, prioritize projects, and implement them through an expedited process. As of March 2019, 206 projects across 59 national forests and 18 states have been proposed under these authorities. Some projects are evaluated using different analysis procedures, while others are processed using a Categorical Exclusion (CE). The 2014 farm bill also added a new Section 603 to HFRA, specifying that certain projects to reduce insect or disease infestations within I&D areas would be categorically excluded. The 2018 Farm Bill CE allows hazardous fuels projects to be implemented through a Categorical Exclusion, exempt from pre-decisional administrative review objections. Projects must comply with CFLRP eligibility requirements or consider best available science, retain old-growth trees, and be developed collaboratively. The 2018 Farm Bill CE allows projects within designated areas, with restrictions on roads and size. Projects must be located in specific areas and documented through a decision memorandum. Changes in FS and BLM planning were made in the FY2018 omnibus and the 2018 farm bill. The 2018 Farm Bill and the FY2018 omnibus amended FS and BLM planning requirements, expanding HFRA authorities. The omnibus allowed for fuel and fire breaks as authorized projects, while the farm bill prioritized projects to reduce hazardous fuels in I&D areas. The 2018 Farm Bill and FY2018 omnibus amended planning requirements for FS and BLM, expanding HFRA authorities. Projects to reduce hazardous fuels in I&D areas were prioritized. New statutory CEs were established for wildfire resilience projects and projects related to sage grouse or mule deer habitat. These CEs aim to expedite planning and implementation for specific projects. The new statutory CEs for wildfire resilience projects and projects related to sage grouse or mule deer habitat aim to expedite planning and implementation for specific projects on FS and BLM lands. These CEs allow for larger project sizes and potentially faster environmental review processes, improving agency efficiency. The Forest Service (FS) took 177 days on average to complete CEs in FY2012, compared to 565 days for EAs. FS used CEs less frequently and took longer to complete them from FY2008 to FY2012. Concerns exist about conducting landscape-scale projects without detailed environmental reviews. The Wildfire Resilience CE was established in FY2018 for hazardous fuel reduction projects on NFS lands. The Forest Service (FS) must document the decision to use the Farm Bill CE for projects in designated I&D areas on NFS lands. Eligible projects must comply with CFLRP requirements or focus on retaining old-growth trees for resiliency. New permanent roads are not allowed, and temporary roads must be removed within three years. Projects cannot exceed 3,000 acres and must be developed collaboratively. Maintenance of existing roads is allowed for project implementation. The law prioritizes projects within the Wildland Urban Interface (WUI) but allows projects outside the WUI in high wildfire hazard areas. The Secretary must report annually on projects using the authorized CEs. Seven projects were proposed in FY2018. Projects under the Wildfire Resilience CE have similar location and purpose requirements as those under the 2014 Farm Bill CE. Both require projects to be in designated I&D areas and specified fire regime groups. Maintenance of existing roads is allowed for project implementation. The Wildfire Resilience CE prioritizes projects within the Wildland Urban Interface (WUI) and high wildfire hazard areas, while the Farm Bill CE does not prioritize WUI projects. The Wildfire Resilience CE is only for hazardous fuels reduction projects, while the Farm Bill CE can also address insect and disease infestation. Congress directed the Forest Service to evaluate if extraordinary circumstances are present on project sites under the Wildfire Resilience CE. The 2018 farm bill directs the establishment of a CE for projects to protect sage-grouse and mule-deer habitat. Projects must be consistent with resource management plans and comply with specific requirements. The 2018 farm bill establishes a CE for projects on BLM lands to protect sage-grouse and mule-deer habitat. Projects must comply with DOI Secretarial Order 3336 and specific activities like vegetation removal, targeted grazing, and herbicide use. Projects are restricted from certain areas and size limitations, with requirements for road usage and decommissioning. On NFS lands, projects are limited to designated I&D areas. Each agency must apply extraordinary circumstances procedures when considering the use of the CE. The 2018 farm bill establishes a CE for projects on BLM lands to protect sage-grouse and mule-deer habitat, with specific activities and restrictions. The law directs agencies to consider various factors and develop a monitoring plan before using the CE. The Endangered Species Act aims to conserve endangered species and their ecosystems, primarily administered by FWS and NMFS. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) is administered by the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) to protect terrestrial, freshwater, and marine species. Species can be listed as endangered or threatened, with prohibitions applying once listed. Federal agencies must ensure actions do not harm listed species or their habitats, consulting with FWS or NMFS if needed. A Section 7 consultation is required if a federal action may harm a listed species. The Secretary issues a biological opinion to allow the action to proceed if it won't harm the species. If harm is likely, alternatives must be suggested to avoid it. Most consultations result in \"no jeopardy\" opinions. The FY2018 omnibus enacted changes to Section 7 consultation requirements for land and resource management plans in Oregon. It specifies that listing a species as threatened or endangered does not require consultation to update a forest plan unless it is older than 15 years. This does not affect consultation requirements for projects. The FY2018 omnibus made changes to Section 7 consultation requirements for forest plans in Oregon, allowing flexibility by not requiring consultation for plans older than 15 years due to species listing or critical habitat designation. This controversial decision aims to streamline plan implementation and reduce delays. The law allows for changes in forest plans after a certain time to reflect changes in listed species and critical habitat. Opponents argue that not allowing for consultation could harm species if plans allow harmful activities to continue. Proponents argue that projects still undergo consultation, making plan consultation redundant. Critics argue that plans address projects at a higher level and could impact the cumulative effect of all activities. The federal government's responsibilities for wildland fire management include fuel reduction, preparedness, prevention, detection, response, suppression, and recovery activities. Recent legislation changed how funding is appropriated for wildfire suppression and added requirements for wildfire risk mapping and reporting. Additionally, changes were made to hazardous fuel reduction programs, including expediting priority projects and expanding authorized fuel reduction projects. Congress provides discretionary appropriations for wildland fire management to both FS and DOI through the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill. Funding is allocated to the Office of Wildland Fire and four agencies\u2014BLM, Bureau of Indian Affairs, National Park Service, and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The Suppression Operations program within FS's and DOI's Wildland Fire Management account funds firefighter salaries, equipment, aviation operations, incident support functions, and post-wildfire response programs. If suppression funding is exhausted during a fiscal year, FS and DOI are responsible for managing additional costs. Overall, appropriations for wildland fire management have increased significantly since the 1990s, with a large portion of the increase attributed to rising suppression costs. Despite varying costs annually and difficulty in predicting them, FS and DOI often require more suppression funds than allocated, leading to fire borrowing. Concerns have been raised that increased suppression spending may negatively impact other agency programs, prompting Congress to enact supplemental appropriations to repay transferred funds and replenish wildfire accounts. The 115th Congress established a new mechanism for wildfire suppression funding outside of budgetary controls to address concerns about rising costs and the impact on other agency programs. This mechanism, known as the wildfire funding fix, aims to prevent sequestration of budget authority due to exceeding statutory limits on discretionary spending. The wildfire funding fix established by the 115th Congress aims to prevent sequestration of budget authority by exempting wildfire suppression operations from discretionary spending limits. This adjustment starts in FY2020 and continues through FY2027, covering emergency and unpredictable aspects of wildland firefighting. The new adjustment for wildfire funding exempts wildfire suppression operations from discretionary spending limits starting in FY2020 through FY2027. The adjustment caps at $2.95 billion in FY2027, with any additional funding above the FY2015 baseline not subject to the limits. The wildfire funding fix exempts up to $1.39 billion from discretionary spending limits for FY2020 and FY2021. Congress could appropriate an additional $2.25 billion outside of the limits, totaling $3.64 billion for suppression operations. In FY2019, FS and DOI received $2.05 billion for suppression, and over the past 5 years, they averaged $2.16 billion annually. The wildfire funding fix potentially removes budget process barriers for providing additional wildfire suppression funds for FY2020 and FY2021. The BCA statutory limits for discretionary spending are in effect until FY2021, and if new limits are established for FY2022 through FY2027, the wildfire adjustment would still apply. It is uncertain if Congress will continue to provide fire borrowing authority once the wildfire adjustment takes effect in FY2020. The wildfire funding fix raises concerns for Congress regarding accountability, oversight, and inflationary factors. It is a temporary procedural change for funding suppression operations that requires additional action from Congress to ensure continued federal services in response to wildfires. The funding fix for wildfire suppression operations is a temporary procedural change by Congress. It does not address various concerns related to suppression costs, such as forecasting, effectiveness of methods, and drivers of increasing costs. The Fire Modeling Institute developed a Wildfire Hazard Potential index to aid in strategic planning and fuel management decisions nationally. Approximately 226 million acres in the US are classified with high wildfire potential. Approximately 226 million acres of land in the continental United States are classified as high or very high Wildfire Hazard Potential (WHP). Of these lands, 53% are federal lands, while the remaining 47% are state, tribal, other public, or private lands. The WHP data, when combined with spatial data, can help estimate the relative wildfire risk to resources and assets. The FY2018 omnibus directs the Forest Service to develop web-based wildfire hazard severity maps within two years for community use in consultation with federal and state partners, colleges, and universities. The FY2018 omnibus and the 2018 farm bill require FS and BLM to develop web-based wildfire hazard severity maps for at-risk communities near NFS lands. Reports must be submitted to Congress on specified topics related to wildland fire management, with the first report due by December 30, 2021. The 2018 farm bill mandates the submission of a detailed report on wildfire funding usage, wildland fire management spending, and factors influencing suppression decisions. It also requires an analysis of large fires, including cost drivers, effectiveness of fuel treatments, and preparedness investments. The 2018 farm bill mandates a report on wildfire prevention on federal land, including treatment of acres, fire risk categorization, and wildfire impact analysis. The report must be submitted annually to specific congressional committees. The 2018 farm bill mandates an annual report on wildfire prevention on federal land, including treatment of acres, fire risk categorization, wildfire impact analysis, total timber production, maintenance backlog for roads, trails, and recreational facilities, and measures needed to improve water quality and ecosystem function on federal land through forest restoration activities. These activities aim to establish resilience and resistance to disturbance events like insect infestation, catastrophic wildfire, and windstorms by thinning trees to reduce density. Forest restoration activities, such as thinning trees to reduce density, are conducted by BLM and FS to mitigate insect infestations and wildfires. BLM's authority comes from FLPMA, while FS's authority is derived from various acts to protect national forests and promote multiple use and sustained yield. Congress has also authorized specific forest restoration programs for FS. The 115th Congress established new forest restoration programs for FS and amended existing programs like CFLRP, stewardship contracting authority, and good neighbor authority. These programs allow FS and BLM to partner with stakeholders to address land management concerns at a landscape-scale. Title IV of the Omnibus Public Lands Management Act of 2009 established the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program (CFLRP) to accelerate forest restoration, mitigate insect infestations, reduce wildfire risks, and provide benefits to surrounding communities through collaboration with diverse stakeholders. The Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program (CFLRP) requires proposals for priority forest landscapes to be at least 50,000 acres of NFS lands in need of restoration. Proposals must incorporate the best available science and include projects to maintain old-growth stands and reduce hazardous fuels. No new permanent roads can be established, and any temporary roads must be decommissioned annually. The law authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to select and fund up to 10 proposals annually for forest restoration. FS has funded 23 proposals since FY2010, with each proposal including individual projects to achieve forest restoration goals. A fund pays for up to 50% of project costs, with up to $40 million in annual appropriations available through FY2019. Each proposal can receive up to $4 million per year for up to 10 years. The Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program (CFLRP) can receive up to $4 million per year for project implementation for up to 10 years, with $40 million in annual appropriations from FY2014 through FY2019. The program is seen as successful in achieving land management objectives and boosting local economies. The dedicated funding provides stability for project coordination, but some feel it may divert resources from other areas. While the program offers economic benefits, it falls short in creating new markets for wood products and reducing treatment costs. The Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program (CFLRP) has been reauthorized under the 2018 farm bill with up to $80 million in annual appropriations through FY2023. The program aims to improve relationships with stakeholders and promote collaboration, but some feel that progress has been limited to simpler issues. Additionally, the law allows for a one-time waiver to extend funding for existing projects for up to 10 years, with oversight from the House and Senate Committees on Agriculture. Funding for selected proposals is set to expire soon. The Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program (CFLRP) has been reauthorized under the 2018 farm bill with up to $80 million in annual appropriations through FY2023. The funding commitment for the 23 selected proposals is set to expire at the end of FY2019, but reauthorization and extension of eligibility could allow projects to continue beyond that timeframe. The program allows for good neighbor agreements (GNAs) with state governments for restoration work on NFS and BLM public lands, including treating trees, reducing fuels, and improving land health. The 2018 farm bill reauthorized the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program with up to $80 million in annual appropriations through FY2023. The program allows for good neighbor agreements with state governments for restoration work on NFS and BLM public lands, including treating trees, reducing fuels, and improving land health. The law prohibits treatments in designated wilderness areas and does not include construction or repair of roads. States may perform the work, but FS and BLM retain responsibility for compliance with federal laws. The Good Neighbor Authority (GNA) allows for agreements between states and the Forest Service (FS) or Bureau of Land Management (BLM) for project implementation. FS has executed multiple agreements covering various activities like timber production, wildlife, hazardous fuels management, and others. The GNA is seen as successful in enhancing state-federal relationships and leveraging state resources, although funding and resource capacity vary among states. The FY2018 omnibus and 2018 farm bill made changes to the Good Neighbor Authority (GNA), allowing for forest restoration activities on NFS roads and expanding availability to include tribes and county governments. Funds from timber sales under GNA can be retained by states for additional projects through FY2023. The expansion of Good Neighbor Authority (GNA) to tribes and county governments allows for increased use of the authority, potentially leading to more cross-boundary restoration work and leveraging nonfederal resources. However, this expansion may also increase administrative demands on agencies like FS or BLM. Concerns include the distribution of receipts from timber sales and some may prefer revenue-sharing with county governments. Stewardship end-result contracting was established as a temporary pilot program in 1999. The Good Neighbor Authority (GNA) was established as a pilot program in 1999 and later made permanent in the 2014 farm bill. It allows the Forest Service (FS) and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to enter into multi-year contracts for land management goals, combining timber sale contracts with service contracts to offset costs. This includes activities like restoring water quality through road and trail maintenance. The Good Neighbor Authority (GNA) allows the Forest Service (FS) and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to enter into contracts for land management goals, such as restoring water quality through road and trail maintenance. They can use excess timber sale revenue for other stewardship projects without further appropriation. Contracts are awarded based on best value, considering past performance and proposal quality. Annual reports are required on project development and accomplishments. Stewardship contracting is generally viewed positively by stakeholders, with agencies reporting increased restoration opportunities and improved relationships. Economic benefits include contributions to local economies and market development for woody biomass. Concerns may arise regarding the removal of ecologically important trees to fund service work and the distribution of receipts from contracts. The implementation of stewardship contracting faced initial challenges due to contract integration complexities and poor record-keeping. Despite improvements in contracting systems and increased contract offerings, a 2015 USDA OIG report highlighted issues with FS' contract administration and record-keeping, specifically related to compliance with procurement requirements. The FY2018 omnibus authorized FS and BLM to enter into 20-year stewardship contracts in fire-prone areas, with a procurement preference for innovative forest product use. It also allowed for cancellation ceilings and the use of excess revenues to cover liabilities from cancelled contracts. The use of excess revenues to pay for outstanding liabilities from cancelled contracts requires Congressional notification if the cancellation ceiling exceeds $25 million without proposed funding. This provision allows funds to be obligated in stages, providing flexibility and potential benefits. 20-year stewardship contracts and procurement preference aim to increase market certainty and innovation in forest product industries. It is unclear if there are any drawbacks to the expanded provisions. Forest restoration by-products are a focus of the NFS, with watershed protection being a key goal. In a 2006 assessment, inadequacies in FS's watershed programs were highlighted, including lack of water quality data and inconsistent national prioritization. To address this, FS committed to developing long-term performance measures, improving data quality, and prioritizing watershed management through the Watershed Condition Framework. The Forest Service developed the Watershed Condition Framework (WCF) to classify and prioritize watershed conditions, develop restoration action plans, and implement projects. In 2017, a USDA OIG report identified management inadequacies in the WCF program. The 2018 farm bill codified the WCF program, assigning specific responsibilities and priorities. The Forest Service's Watershed Condition Framework (WCF) allows for the evaluation and classification of watershed conditions on NFS land. It enables the identification of priority watersheds for protection and restoration, with the ability to develop and implement restoration action plans. Additionally, an emergency designation process is authorized for rehabilitating watersheds impacted by wildfires. The Forest Service's Watershed Condition Framework evaluates and classifies watershed conditions on NFS land, identifying priority watersheds for protection and restoration. Post-fire stabilization activities have not fully restored watershed function. Water source protection is an authorized use of the NFS, allowing for cooperative agreements for watershed restoration and enhancement. The 2018 farm bill amended HFRA to authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to establish agreements for improving resources on NFS lands within watersheds. The 2018 farm bill amended HFRA to authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a Water Source Protection program on NFS land. This allows FS to enter into partnerships to protect and restore NFS watersheds serving as municipal water sources. FS can develop a water source management plan with nonfederal partners, conduct forest management activities, and carry out environmental analysis for projects. Cash, donations, and services can be accepted for investments. The 2018 farm bill authorizes FS to accept cash, donations, and services from partners to implement a water source management plan. It establishes a Water Source Protection Fund to match partner donations, with $10 million in annual appropriations authorized through FY2023. Other provisions in the bill relate to federal forest land, including designating NFS lands as part of the National Wilderness Preservation System and various provisions on land acquisition, exchange, and forest management on tribal lands. The 2018 farm bill designated new wilderness areas and expanded existing ones on NFS lands in Tennessee, including the establishment of the Upper Bald River Wilderness on Cherokee National Forest. These areas are to be managed in accordance with the Wilderness Act, prohibiting most commercial activities and motorized access. The 2018 farm bill and FY2018 omnibus enacted provisions changing how FS and BLM acquire, exchange, or dispose of federal land. For example, the farm bill established a program for leasing isolated parcels for administrative sites, while the omnibus reauthorized a program for selling or exchanging BLM lands. Additionally, the farm bill reauthorized the Forest Service Facility Realignment and Enhancement program for conveying administrative sites or undeveloped parcels of NFS land. The 2018 farm bill and FY2018 omnibus enacted provisions for acquiring, exchanging, or disposing of federal land. The farm bill reauthorized programs for leasing isolated parcels and conveying administrative sites or undeveloped NFS land. Additionally, the bill modified eligibility requirements for the Small Tracts Act and authorized rights-of-way for BLM and NFS lands. The 2018 farm bill and FY2018 omnibus enacted provisions for acquiring, exchanging, or disposing of federal land, including authorizing rights-of-way for various types of infrastructure. FS and BLM charge fees for processing applications and monitoring activities on the specified lands. The 2018 farm bill and FY2018 omnibus enacted provisions for acquiring, exchanging, or disposing of federal land, including authorizing rights-of-way for various types of infrastructure. BLM and FS charge fees for processing applications and monitoring activities on the specified lands. The 115th Congress directed FS to update their process and fee schedule for issuing special use authorizations for communication sites and established a pilot process for activities within utility rights-of-way. Some provisions in the 115th Congress aim to improve processes for right-of-way permit holders to conduct maintenance activities to reduce wildfire risks on federal lands within their rights-of-way. Conflicting views exist on the responsibility for vegetation management, with some blaming administrative hurdles and others placing the onus on permit holders. Process improvements could enhance land conditions. Some provisions in the 115th Congress aim to improve processes for right-of-way permit holders to conduct maintenance activities to reduce wildfire risks on federal lands within their rights-of-way. Concerns exist about the balance between project implementation speed and accountability for wildfire suppression costs and liability for damages within rights-of-way. Provisions specify responsibilities and liability caps for permit holders, with some worried about the potential disproportionate cost burden on the federal government. Others believe limiting damages and liability will prompt prompt agency action on maintenance requests and prevent utilities from bearing full wildfire costs. The 2018 farm bill directed the Secretary of Agriculture to revise regulations for special use authorizations on NFS lands, aiming for a streamlined, standardized process with competitive and technology-neutral considerations. The law also specified lease terms of at least 15 years. The law requires lease terms of a minimum of 15 years for special use authorizations on NFS lands. It also establishes a fee structure based on processing costs and creates a new account for fees to be used for managing communication sites. Additionally, the law directs FS and BLM to issue guidance on vegetation management and facility inspection on federal land with electric transmission facilities. The law requires FS and BLM to issue guidance for planning and implementing vegetation management, facility inspections, and operation and maintenance activities within electric transmission and distribution ROWs. Owners must develop and submit plans for approval, with certain circumstances allowing for activities without prior approval. The law directs FS and BLM to identify NEPA categorical exclusions for activities near power lines and develop training programs. It also specifies ROW permit holder liabilities for vegetation management activities, limiting strict liability for damages to $500,000 under certain conditions for ten years after enactment. Section 8630 of the 2018 farm bill established a pilot program for utility right-of-way (ROW) permit holders on National Forest System (NFS) land, allowing them to develop vegetation management plans with FS approval. The pilot program excludes national grasslands and land utilization projects and includes specific requirements for participating permit holders. Participants may also pay for and perform projects on specified NFS lands within their ROWs. Within four years, FS and BLM must report the impacts of liability clauses to Congress. The pilot program established by Section 8630 of the 2018 farm bill allows utility right-of-way permit holders on National Forest System land to develop vegetation management plans with FS approval. Participants may pay for and conduct projects on specified NFS lands within their ROWs, adhering to FS and state regulations. Participants are responsible for project costs, with the possibility of FS contributing funds at the discretion of the Secretary of Agriculture. FS must submit a program status report to Congress every two years, and participants must reimburse FS for wildfire suppression costs and damage caused by their operations under certain conditions. The wildfire in the ROW pilot program on NFS lands is caused by the participant's operations. Reimbursement costs for wildfire suppression are credited or reimbursed by the FS, with a limit of $500,000 in certain cases. The program differs from the FY2018 omnibus for electricity ROWs, as it includes natural gas infrastructure. The 2018 farm bill pilot focuses on wildfire and vegetation management, without addressing liability. The FY2018 omnibus caps liability costs for program participants in wildfire and vegetation management. Counties with NFS, O&C, and CBWR lands receive payments based on prior year revenue. SRS offers optional payment system as an alternative to revenue-sharing. Payments are allocated among three categories for funding education, roads, projects on lands, and county programs. Title II of the law established Resource Advisory Committees (RACs) to improve collaborative relationships and provide advice to agencies. RACs must consist of 15 members representing various interests, and the authorized payment level was set at 95% of the previous year's payment level. SRS payments were extended multiple times through FY2015. The Secure Rural Schools (SRS) payments were extended through FY2015 and the last authorized payment was disbursed in FY2016. Counties received a revenue-sharing payment in FY2017 after the last SRS payments. The FY2018 omnibus reauthorized SRS payments for FY2017 and FY2018, with the FY2017 payment level set at 95% of the last authorized payment. Counties received a full SRS payment for FY2017 in FY2018. The reauthorization of Secure Rural Schools (SRS) payments in FY2018 included changes to payment allocation requirements and expanded uses for Title III funds. The 2018 farm bill also made changes to the SRS statute, establishing a process for modifying RAC membership requirements and a pilot program for appointing RAC members in Montana and Arizona. These changes were in response to concerns about the prohibitive requirements for RACs to consist of 15 members. The Tribal Forest Protection Act (TFPA) allows agreements between federal agencies and tribes for forest projects on tribal or adjacent lands. The act considers unique tribal factors and evaluates requests based on best value. The Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (ISDEAA) authorizes tribes to enter self-determination contracts with the government. The 2018 farm bill authorized federally recognized tribes to enter self-determination contracts with the federal government for specified programs. This includes administrative functions of the TFPA on NFS land, with the Secretary of Agriculture carrying out delegated responsibilities. Congress may consider various issues related to forestry. Congress may consider oversight of forestry provisions enacted by the 115th Congress, including implementation of new laws and addressing concerns with federal forest management. The Forest Service has identified millions of acres of NFS lands at high risk, with a backlog of restoration treatments that could take up to 29 years to eliminate. Hazardous fuels are accumulating faster than treatment rates, highlighting the need for action. The Forest Service has proposed increasing forest management projects to address concerns of fuels accumulating faster than treatment rates. Administrative process barriers, including decision-making processes and implementation of the National Environmental Policy Act, hinder progress towards restoration goals. Stakeholders point to NEPA-related issues causing planning delays. The 115th Congress enacted provisions to improve agency efficiencies in project planning by expanding procedures to expedite the process for projects like hazardous fuel reduction and forest restoration. Some stakeholders believe administrative barriers, such as funding and training, hinder the agency's implementation of project planning requirements. Expanding the use of Healthy Forests Restoration Act authorities and allowing more projects under NEPA Categorical Exclusions could expedite project implementation, but some argue that changes to decision-making processes may alter the legal framework. The establishment of CEs is changing federal forest management, making citizen participation challenging. Stakeholders fear environmental impacts from expanding these authorities. Concerns about forest health and wildfires have been ongoing for decades, with recommendations to invest in reducing hazardous fuels. The National Commission on Wildfire Disasters warned of inevitable disastrous wildfires and costs. A 1995 study suggested increasing hazardous fuel treatments on up to 3 million acres. In 1995, a study recommended increasing hazardous fuel treatments on up to 3 million acres per year by 2005. In 1999, GAO suggested developing a strategy to reduce fuels for forest health and wildfire risk mitigation. OIG raised concerns in 2006 about FS' hazardous fuels reduction program and recommended guidance for project identification, prioritization, implementation, monitoring, and reporting. A 2016 OIG report found ongoing issues with FS prioritizing, tracking, and reporting hazardous fuels reduction projects. Congress also evaluated challenges impeding FS' fuel management projects in 2001. The report highlighted challenges in implementing fuel management projects, with a high percentage of decisions being appealed. Academic studies suggest that complex projects are more likely to face challenges. Despite provisions in the HFRA to expedite projects, the need for treatment in NFS areas has continued to increase. The report highlighted challenges in implementing fuel management projects in NFS areas, with a high percentage of decisions being appealed. Despite efforts to expedite projects, the need for treatment in NFS areas has continued to increase. The comparison tables show forest-related provisions enacted by recent legislation, indicating the need for more streamlined decision-making processes."
