FINDINGS.\" Congress finds that the Middle Rio Grande bosque in Albuquerque, New Mexico is the largest continuous cottonwood forest in the Southwest, an old inhabited area, home to 6 pueblos, and a critical habitat for migratory birds. The area provides water to many in New Mexico and should be maintained to protect endangered species, the river flow, and be more accessible to the public. The Corps of Engineers should prioritize environmental restoration in the Middle Rio Grande bosque to ensure healthy growth of native vegetation and reestablish hydrologic connections. SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines \"critical restoration project\" as a project that will provide immediate ecosystem benefits, \"Middle Rio Grande\" as a specific portion of the Rio Grande in New Mexico, and \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of the Army. The Secretary will implement critical restoration projects in the Middle Rio Grande based on feasibility studies and existing plans. Local entities involved in ecosystem restoration will be consulted for their input and priorities. The Middle Rio Grande Endangered Species Act Collaborative Program and the Bosque Improvement Group of the Middle Rio Grande Bosque Initiative are key initiatives. Before starting any critical restoration project, the Secretary must enter into a cost-sharing agreement with non-Federal interests, requiring them to contribute 25% of the total project costs and provide necessary resources. Non-Federal interests are also responsible for 100% of the project's operation and maintenance costs. The critical restoration project incurs maintenance, repair, replacement, and rehabilitation costs after enactment. The United States is held harmless from any claims or damages, except for negligence. Recreational features are limited to 30% of the total project cost and require non-federal funding. The non-Federal interests are responsible for the full cost of recreational features exceeding 30% of the project cost. They can receive credit for design or construction work done before the project agreement if deemed integral by the Secretary. Authorization of appropriations for this Act includes $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2004 and necessary sums for fiscal years 2005 through 2013."
