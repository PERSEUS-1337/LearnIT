    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Nuclear Non-Proliferation Policy Act of 1998\". The Congress finds that the proliferation of nuclear weapons is a major threat to national security, especially in unstable regions. The United Nations has recognized the threat of weapons of mass destruction and has taken steps to prevent proliferation. The United Nations Special Commission on Iraq was an important precedent in addressing nuclear proliferation. Aside from the 5 declared nuclear weapon states, other nations are also pursuing nuclear weapons capabilities. Regional nuclear arms races increase the likelihood of nuclear weapons use in the future. Concerns have been raised about Russia's ability to secure its nuclear materials and weapons, potentially leading to nuclear proliferation. Belarus and Kazakhstan signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty as non-nuclear weapon states in 1993. Iraq had a clandestine nuclear weapons program aided by dual-use exports from western countries. North Korea signed an agreement with the United States in 1994 to exchange nuclear reactors for modern technology, raising concerns about nuclear proliferation. Brazil, Argentina, and South Africa had nuclear weapons programs but renounced them and accepted IAEA safeguards. The United States supports nuclear weapons free zones to prevent regional conflicts and arms races. The United States signed nuclear free zone treaties in 1996, supports immobilizing plutonium for energy, and faces challenges in storage and disposal of dismantled nuclear warheads. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty aims to prevent further spread of nuclear weapons and strengthen international nonproliferation efforts. The United States is committed to supporting the treaty and enhancing controls over nuclear equipment transfer. The United States should adopt a comprehensive nuclear nonproliferation policy to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons capability and prevent their use worldwide. The United States should adopt a comprehensive nuclear nonproliferation policy to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons capability and their use worldwide. The United States aims to reduce nuclear proliferation by placing fissile materials under international controls, ratifying the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, ending production of new nuclear warheads with Russia, and negotiating to reduce strategic nuclear arsenals. The United States and Russia aim to reduce nuclear arsenals to 2,000-2,500 warheads each, with lower levels for the UK, France, and China. Additional multilateral agreements are sought to continuously reduce nuclear arsenals worldwide. Immediate agreements with Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty states are sought to halt fissile material production and place existing stockpiles under international controls. To strengthen nonproliferation efforts, countries must place nuclear facilities for peaceful purposes under IAEA safeguards, enhance IAEA verification, strengthen export controls, impose sanctions on proliferators, and reduce incentives for nuclear pursuit. To reduce incentives for countries to acquire nuclear weapons, strengthen regional security agreements, and involve the UN Security Council in enforcing nonproliferation agreements. Adopt a \"no first use\" policy with other nuclear weapon states and assist NPT parties if nuclear weapons are used against them. Seek a verifiable agreement with Russia to dismantle tactical nuclear weapons and extend this approach to all nuclear weapon states. To further nuclear nonproliferation efforts, ratify regional nuclear-free zone treaties, monitor North Korea's reactor activities, and negotiate START III with Russia before START II takes effect. The President must report to Congress every year on the actions taken to implement policy objectives, including those related to nuclear nonproliferation and relations with Russia. The reports must also address actions taken by other countries and obstacles encountered. Definitions are provided for clarity. The Act defines key terms related to nuclear nonproliferation, such as fissile materials, highly enriched uranium, IAEA, IAEA safeguards, no first use policy, and Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, START I treaty, START II treaty, and START III treaty are defined in the Act. The START III treaty, discussed between President Clinton and President Yeltsin in March 1997, is defined in the Act."
