    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Water Advanced Technologies for Efficient Resource Use Act of 2015\". It includes a section on WaterSense. The WaterSense program established within the EPA promotes water efficient products, buildings, and landscapes to reduce water use, strain on infrastructure, conserve energy, and preserve water resources for future generations through voluntary labeling. The Administrator of the EPA is responsible for promoting WaterSense labeled products in the marketplace. The WaterSense program promotes water-efficient technologies and services to reduce water use and ensure product performance. It also aims to enhance public awareness, establish performance standards, and emphasize proper installation of WaterSense plumbing products and irrigation systems. The WaterSense program requires regular review and updates of criteria for products, buildings, and landscapes every four years. It also mandates the collection and public availability of data on WaterSense labeled products annually, including water and energy savings estimates. The WaterSense program mandates regular review and updates of criteria for products, buildings, and landscapes, including soliciting comments from the public and providing notice of any changes. The WaterSense program requires regular review and updates of criteria for products, buildings, and landscapes, including implementing voluntary approaches to improve water efficiency and lower water use in various sectors. Authorization of appropriations is also provided. Authorization of appropriations for the WaterSense program includes $7,500,000 for fiscal year 2016, $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2017, $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2018, and $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2019 and beyond, adjusted for inflation. Federal procurement of water efficient products is addressed in Section 3. In this section, definitions are provided for terms such as \"agency,\" \"WaterSense product or service,\" \"WaterSense program,\" \"FEMP designated product,\" and \"product and service.\" These definitions are crucial for understanding the criteria for water efficiency and energy management in federal procurement. The procurement of water-efficient products for agencies must meet specific requirements, such as using WaterSense or FEMP designated products. WaterSense plumbing products should ideally be installed by certified plumbers. Certification guidelines do not exist for WaterSense irrigation systems, but they should be installed, maintained, and audited by a WaterSense-certified professional for optimal performance. Agencies are not required to procure WaterSense products if they are not cost-effective or reasonably available. The head of an agency must include criteria for WaterSense products and FEMP designated products in procurement specifications for water consuming products and systems. Additional measures for reducing water consumption should also be considered, such as water reuse and recycling technologies. The head of an agency must include criteria for WaterSense products and FEMP designated products in procurement specifications for water consuming products and systems. Additional measures for reducing water consumption should also be considered, such as water reuse, recycling technologies, leak detection, repair, and use of waterless products. WaterSense products and FEMP designated products shall be prominently displayed in federal catalogs by the General Services Administration and the Defense Logistics Agency. The Environmental Protection Agency must issue regulations within 180 days of this Act's enactment to ensure that WaterSense and FEMP designated products meet buyer's functional requirements and are cost-effective over their lifespan, considering energy, water, and wastewater cost savings. SEC. 4. EARLY ADOPTER WATER EFFICIENT PRODUCTS INCENTIVE PROGRAMS. The section defines key terms like Administrator, eligible entity, incentive program, and residential water efficient products. Eligible entities include government bodies, utilities, and nonprofits meeting specific requirements. An incentive program offers financial incentives for residential water efficient products and services. The efficient product or service is rated for water efficiency and performance by the WaterSense program or an approved incentive program. Categories include faucets, irrigation technologies, water treatment devices, toilets, and showerheads. Third-party certification is required for a product to be considered a residential water efficient product. The WaterSense program certifies products for water efficiency and performance through accredited third-party certifying bodies. States include various regions within the United States and its territories. Eligible entities can receive certification through the WaterSense program. Entities eligible for receiving an allocation must have an incentive program for water-efficient products, submit an application, and assure that the funds will supplement existing ones. The Administrator determines the amount allocated based on certain criteria. Entities eligible for receiving an allocation must have an incentive program for water-efficient products. Funds allocated can cover up to 50% of program costs. Entities are encouraged to promote fixture recycling. Entities are encouraged to promote fixture recycling programs for older fixtures replaced under the incentive program. Financial incentives may be issued to consumers who meet program requirements, with the option to delegate administration to other organizations. The incentive amount is determined based on various factors, including the entity's allocation and other available incentives. The organization offers financial incentives for purchasing water-efficient products. Authorization of appropriations for the program is set at $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2016, $100,000,000 for fiscal year 2017, $150,000,000 for fiscal year 2018, $100,000,000 for fiscal year 2019, and $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2020. SEC. 139F. EARLY ADOPTER WATER EFFICIENT PRODUCTS INCENTIVE PROGRAMS. This section introduces a program offering financial incentives for purchasing water-efficient products. The Early Adopter Water Efficient Products Incentive Program under section 4 of the Water Advanced Technologies for Efficient Resource Use Act of 2015 provides individuals with income exclusions for participating. Additionally, no double benefits are allowed, and the adjusted basis of property is reduced by the excluded amount. Effective Date: The amendments made by this Act apply to taxable years beginning after the enactment date."
