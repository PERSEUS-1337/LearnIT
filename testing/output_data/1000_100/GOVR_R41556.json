    "content": "The Middle East poses challenges to U.S. foreign policy due to various state and non-state actors aligned against U.S. interests, including Iran, Hezbollah, and Hamas. Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons capability is a major concern, with potential consequences for regional balance of power and proliferation. There are fears of a preemptive strike by Israel against Iran triggering a wider war. Iran's strong ties to Syria further complicate the situation. The Middle East poses challenges to U.S. foreign policy with Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons and strong ties to Syria. Despite some improvement in the U.S. image in the region under the Obama Administration, dissatisfaction with U.S. policy remains. The ongoing war in Afghanistan and failures in the Israeli-Arab peace process have limited U.S. influence in the Middle East. Regional actors like Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Turkey are taking more responsibility. The Middle East faces challenges with Iran's nuclear ambitions and ties to Syria. Regional actors like Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Turkey are taking on more responsibility in resolving disputes. The region also grapples with economic and social issues such as poverty, inequality, and water scarcity. Lack of human rights respect and democracy development are criticized. The U.S. advocates for reform to address these challenges. The 112th Congress faces challenges in responding to Palestinian divisions, Hamas' control of Gaza, Israeli settlements, and obstacles to the peace process. They must consider how to support regional initiatives amidst budget constraints and address the behavior of radical regimes like Iran and Syria. Additionally, policymakers must balance counterterrorism strategies with diplomatic efforts to improve relationships with Arab regimes and protect against terrorist attacks. The 112th Congress may encounter various challenges in the Middle East, including issues like the war in Afghanistan, terrorism, foreign assistance, democracy promotion, human rights concerns, and economic sanctions against Iran. There is a growing international consensus to impose stricter sanctions on Iran to halt its nuclear development. The U.S. and its allies aim to slow Iran's weapons programs and support for militant groups through sanctions targeting Iran's energy sector. Efforts began in 1996 with the Iran Sanctions Act, expanding with the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010 to restrict Iran's gasoline imports. The Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010 (CISADA) aims to restrict Iran's ability to import gasoline and imposes measures on banks conducting transactions with sanctioned Iranian entities. It followed the adoption of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1929, which bans sales of heavy weapons to Iran and sanctions Iranian entities affiliated with its Revolutionary Guard. European Union sanctions also prohibit involvement in Iran's energy sector and restrict trade financing and banking relationships with Iran. The sanctions imposed by major economic powers on Iran, including Japan and South Korea, are having a growing effect on Iran's economy. Many international firms have announced their exit from the Iranian market. However, there is no consensus on whether the sanctions are causing a shift in Iran's commitment to its nuclear program. The 112th Congress may consider additional Iran sanctions legislation and measures to support Iran's domestic opposition. The United States and Israel have strong bilateral relations based on domestic U.S. support for Israel, shared strategic goals in the Middle East, democratic values, and historic ties. U.S. foreign aid has played a significant role in strengthening these ties, despite occasional disagreements over issues like Israeli settlements and arms sales. Critics argue that U.S. foreign aid to Israel exacerbates tensions in the region. Some in the Middle East argue that U.S. foreign aid exacerbates tensions in the region by indirectly causing suffering to Palestinians through support for Israeli arms purchases. Congress and successive administrations have affirmed commitment to strengthening Israel's \"qualitative military edge\" (QME). Assistant Secretary of State Andrew J. Shapiro reaffirmed the Obama Administration's commitment to Israel's QME in 2010, stating it enhances national security and peace efforts. The 112th Congress may focus on preserving Israel's QME through U.S. aid, with a $3 billion request for Foreign Military Assistance in FY2011. In FY2011, the Obama Administration requested $3 billion in Foreign Military Financing (FMF) to Israel to preserve its QME. Congress may also address defense appropriations for co-research and development of missile defense systems. U.S.-Israeli missile defense cooperation has received funding in previous years, including over $202 million in FY2010 and an additional $205 million for Iron Dome in 2010. Wars between Israel and its neighbors have led to active U.S. diplomacy and legislative assistance for Israel since its founding in 1948. Congressional aid appropriations have reinforced Israel's peace treaties with Egypt and Jordan and have helped enable the peace process between Israel and the Palestinians to proceed. President Obama declared Israeli-Palestinian peace a U.S. national security interest due to its impact on U.S. relations in the Middle East. However, his call for a halt to Israeli settlement activity in the West Bank led to limited progress in peace talks. The Obama Administration's efforts to facilitate peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians were hindered by ongoing settlement activity in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Despite offering incentives for a settlement freeze, the Administration ultimately abandoned this approach in December. Final status issues in the negotiations include borders, security, Jerusalem, refugees, and water. Congress remains interested in the Arab-Israeli peace process due to its oversight role. In the 111th Congress, resolutions were introduced regarding Jerusalem as Israel's capital and relocating the U.S. embassy. Congress emphasizes an undivided Jerusalem as Israel's capital, while the Obama Administration maintains it as a final status issue for negotiation. Appropriations legislation also required a new Palestinian state to act peacefully and counter terrorism, with Congress passing resolutions supporting Israel's rights. In the 112th Congress, legislation may address moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, conditions for a new Palestinian state, and reactions to potential violent confrontations between Israeli forces and Palestinian groups. If an Israeli-Palestinian peace accord is reached, the Administration may request additional assistance for Israel and the Palestinians. U.S. aid to the Palestinians aligns with U.S. policy priorities of combating terrorism from Hamas and other groups. U.S. aid policy towards Palestinians in the 111th Congress focused on combating terrorism from Hamas and other militant groups, promoting stability and prosperity in the West Bank, meeting humanitarian needs in Gaza, and preventing destabilization. Annual bilateral assistance to the West Bank and Gaza averaged over $600 million, following the split between the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and Hamas in Gaza. Annual U.S. aid to the West Bank and Gaza has averaged over $600 million, peaking at nearly $1 billion in 2009 after the Gaza conflict. This includes direct budgetary assistance, security aid, and humanitarian assistance for Palestinian refugees. Congressional oversight ensures funds are not diverted to terrorist groups. Other Western donors also contribute, with calls for increased aid from Arab states. The Obama Administration notified Congress of proposed sales of military equipment to Saudi Arabia worth over $60 billion. The sales include fighter aircraft, attack helicopters, and upgrades of existing aircraft. The goal is to sustain long-term relationships and ensure continued U.S. influence. The proposed sales to Saudi Arabia aim to strengthen the country against Iran, sustain long-term relationships, and ensure continued U.S. influence for decades. Concerns about regional security balance, Israel's security, counterterrorism cooperation, human rights, and religious extremism persist. Saudi leaders share U.S. concerns about Iranian policies and regional ambitions but remain wary of embracing Iraq's elected government and engaging Israel beyond a standing Saudi peace proposal. In the 111th Congress, committees reviewed proposed arms sales in classified and unclassified settings. Congressional briefings from Administration officials preceded the formal notification of the proposed sales in October 2010. 198 members of Congress raised concerns and posed strategic questions about the proposed sales in a letter to the Obama Administration. The Obama Administration believes it can strengthen the U.S. military partnership with Saudi Arabia while maintaining Israel's qualitative military edge. The U.S. government is planning to supply Israel with advanced F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft to ensure Israel maintains military superiority in the region. Legislation introduced in 2010 aimed to block arms sales to Saudi Arabia, but Congress may still oversee military cooperation with Saudi Arabia. The U.S. has been involved in training and arming the Saudi military since the 1940s. Training and equipment support programs in the kingdom are key aspects of U.S.-Saudi relations. New U.S. programs for Saudi security forces and critical infrastructure are being implemented. Congress has the option to block or modify arms sales before delivery, subject to presidential veto. Legislation seeking to alter security assistance to Saudi Arabia may be considered by Congress. The 112th Congress may focus on U.S. counterterrorism policy in Yemen due to the threat of Yemen-based terrorists targeting the U.S. homeland. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) has attempted attacks, including the failed bombing of Northwest Airlines Flight 253 in 2009 and the attempted destruction of air cargo flights in 2010. Anwar al Awlaki, a radical ideologue linked to AQAP, has tried to radicalize U.S. citizens for terrorist activities on U.S. soil. The Obama Administration is considering increasing assistance and intelligence cooperation with Yemen to combat Al Qaeda-affiliated terrorists. Reports suggest the CIA may use drones or place military units under JSOC control. Limited U.S. presence in Yemen may hinder intelligence agencies' knowledge of the local terrain. The 112th Congress may consider new appropriations for Yemen, with the United States providing an estimated $290 million in total aid in FY2010. The Defense Department has proposed increasing security assistance to Yemen to $1.2 billion over a five- or six-year period. Lawmakers may demand increased U.S. military involvement in Yemen to counter AQAP and stabilize the country. Yemen's cooperation in apprehending wanted AQAP operatives like Awlaki may also be emphasized. In recent months, Yemeni forces have launched campaigns against suspected AQAP strongholds. U.S.-Yemeni security cooperation sustainability is a key concern for lawmakers. Disagreements may arise over Yemen's policy of releasing alleged terrorists to placate tribal leaders and domestic politicians. Iraq's political system shows peaceful competition and attempts at cross-sectarian alliances, but factional infighting continues. Ethnic and factional infighting in Iraq delayed the agreement on leadership of a new government after the 2010 national elections. With U.S. intervention, major factions reached an agreement on senior positions in the government. However, concerns remain about the government's direction and its alignment with Iran. The political vacuum in Iraq, dominated by parties aligned with Iran, has led to uncertainty and disillusionment among Iraqis. Experts question the country's stability post-U.S. forces departure in 2011, fearing Iraq could become a \"failed state\" without continued U.S. presence. The formation of the Iraqi government will allow U.S. officials to address their goals of securing a long-term strategic partnership with Iraq. However, opposition from some Iraqi parties and their inclusion in key ministries may complicate efforts to secure lasting cooperation. The U.S. is transitioning from military to civilian leadership in Iraq, with the State Department overseeing a large expansion in civilian personnel and associated costs. U.S. economic assistance to Iraq has declined significantly since the 2003-2007 period. The U.S. aims to rebuild war-damaged infrastructure in Iraq, support security forces, and demonstrate the value of a stable government. Economic aid reached $382.5 million in FY2010, with efforts to maintain this level in FY2011. Funding for Iraq in FY2011 is provided under the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011. Future economic and security assistance for Iraq may face resistance in the 112th Congress due to concerns about Iraq's ability and willingness to invest. Iraq's oil revenues are expected to increase, but the country still faces challenges with domestic investment, foreign debts, and financial management. The transition to a civilian-led presence in Iraq presents new oversight opportunities for Congress, including reviewing arms sales for U.S.-Iraqi security cooperation. Turkey, a long-term U.S. NATO ally, has a complex relationship with certain issues drawing congressional attention, particularly from diaspora communities like Greek-Americans and Armenian Americans. They demand changes in Turkey's policies towards the Greek Orthodox Church. Turkey's complex relationship with the U.S. has drawn congressional attention, particularly regarding demands for policy changes towards the Greek Orthodox Church, religious freedom, Cyprus, and the Armenian national \"genocide\" of 1915-1917. Congressional concern increased after Turkey's actions against Iran and Israel, leading to legislation urging respect for the Greek Orthodox Ecumenical Patriarch's rights. The House Foreign Affairs Committee approved H.Res. 252, calling for recognition of the Armenian genocide and allowing training of clergy. H.Res. 1631 was passed by the House to protect Greek Orthodox sites in Turkish-occupied Cyprus. Concerns regarding Turkey's actions may resurface in Congress, including issues related to the Greek Orthodox Church and missile defense funding. The Administration may fund missiles and radar in Turkey as part of a defense system, requiring new appropriations. Congressional interest in potential changes from the 2011 Turkish election could lead to oversight hearings. U.S. policy towards Syria may be of interest to lawmakers as they consider peeling Syria away from Iran. Obama's approach towards Syria differed from the Bush Administration by engaging in diplomatic dialogue for cooperation on various issues. The Obama Administration engaged in diplomatic dialogue with Syria to secure cooperation on various issues, including Iraq, Iran, Lebanon, and the peace process. Despite some gestures towards the Asad government, U.S. sanctions against Syria remained in force. After two years of diplomatic engagement, the Administration is now shifting tactics to apply more pressure on Syria to play a constructive role in stabilizing Lebanon and advancing the Arab-Israeli peace process. This shift coincides with renewed international concern about Lebanon and Hezbollah's threats to destabilize the country. The Obama Administration shifted tactics towards Syria to pressure them to stabilize Lebanon and advance the Arab-Israeli peace process. Congress may consider imposing new sanctions on the Asad regime, while some lawmakers advocate for continued engagement with Syria. Additionally, H.R. 1206 was introduced during the 111th Congress to impose sanctions on those aiding Syria in acquiring weapons of mass destruction and investing in their energy sector. Congress may consider imposing sanctions on those investing $5 million or more in Syria's energy sector and funding democracy programs for opposition members. The nomination of Robert S. Ford as Ambassador-Designate to Syria is on hold, with no confirmation vote scheduled. The lack of a U.S. Ambassador in Damascus since 2005 is seen as detrimental to U.S. interests by supporters. Current U.S. policy towards Lebanon aims to support the unity government led by Prime Minister Saad Hariri and limit Iranian and Syrian influence, while containing Hezbollah. The United States has provided economic and military assistance to Lebanon to strengthen state institutions, particularly in the security sector, since Syria's withdrawal in 2005. The U.S. supports the Special Tribunal for Lebanon with an annual contribution of $10 million. Prime Minister Hariri's government faces challenges due to pending STL indictments causing sectarian tension, with Hezbollah rejecting any potential indictment. The Hariri government's legitimacy depends on the success of the STL, but Hezbollah and the opposition may hinder Hariri's ability to stay in power if the STL proceeds with indictments. Changes in the Lebanese government could impact U.S. policy and assistance to Lebanon, especially if Hezbollah gains more influence. The U.S. Congress may need to consider the Obama Administration's request for foreign assistance to strengthen the Lebanese state and deter non-state actors. The LAF fired on an IDF unit along the Blue Line on August 3, 2010, claiming it had crossed into Lebanese territory. In response to a border incident along the Blue Line, some members of Congress placed a hold on $100 million FMF appropriation for Lebanon. The hold was lifted in December 2010, but raised questions about future U.S. assistance to Lebanon. The 112th Congress may express support for a more democratic government in Egypt amidst a possible leadership transition. Egypt's domestic politics are of interest to U.S. policymakers due to its role in the Arab-Israeli peace process. There are differing views on political liberalization in Egypt, with some believing it could spread across the Middle East, while others prefer a stable, autocratic Egypt at peace with Israel. The ruling National Democratic Party dominated the 2010 parliamentary elections, with minimal success for the Muslim Brotherhood. The ruling National Democratic Party won over 90% of seats in the 2010 parliamentary elections, raising concerns about fairness and transparency due to reported irregularities. The U.S. Administration expressed disappointment over disruptions to opposition campaigns and media access, as well as election-day interference and intimidation by security forces. Congress has provided Egypt with significant military and economic aid in recent years. Funding for democracy promotion in Egypt has been controversial, with the Egyptian government opposing foreign support to independent NGOs working on political reform. Congress directed Economic Support Funds towards USAID programming in democracy and governance, and for the first time in FY2005, activities were not subject to prior approval by the government of Egypt. Overall economic aid to Egypt has decreased, leading to a reduction in U.S. democracy assistance. The Obama Administration may be looking to ease tensions with the Egyptian government by reducing democracy aid. Some argue that U.S. funding has been ineffective and should be redirected to areas with a more immediate impact on Egyptians. Critics suggest conditioning U.S. aid on improvements in Egypt's human rights and religious freedom record. The U.S. has been engaged in a global war against Al Qaeda and its affiliates since the September 11, 2001 attacks. Al Qaeda and its affiliates have been targeted in a global war by U.S. officials, weakening their ability to attack the United States. However, the organization's survival, regional affiliates' strength, and appeal among some Muslims remain challenging. Al Qaeda operatives are determined to attack the U.S. and exploit vulnerabilities, reactions, and policy mistakes. Recent events show increased ideological outreach and promotion of low-cost operations, complicating counterterrorism efforts. In the Middle East, U.S. policy makers face dilemmas in pursuing counterterrorism goals alongside other strategic priorities. The costs, benefits, and limits of military operations targeting Al Qaeda operatives abroad have been demonstrated over ten years of war in Afghanistan and Iraq. Al Qaeda rhetoric continues to criticize U.S. military presence in the region despite ongoing withdrawals from Iraq. Limited operations against Al Qaeda and counterterrorism assistance programs have faced criticism for violating sovereignty and supporting undemocratic regimes. U.S. support for democratic reform risks alienating allies and empowering Islamist parties. Despite increased outreach to Muslims, skepticism and criticism of U.S. policies persist. Some suggest a more direct approach to destroy Al Qaeda, while others propose a containment strategy. The 111th Congress held hearings on U.S. counterterrorism policy, including specific threats, foreign assistance, and financing. Legislative input focused on annual appropriations and authorization legislation. The 112th Congress may evaluate U.S. counterterrorism strategy and engagement with predominantly Muslim countries, focusing on issues such as U.S.-Iraqi counterterrorism partnership, defeating Al Qaeda affiliates, securing counterterrorism cooperation in the Gulf, and peace between Israel and its neighbors. Relevant Congressional Research Service reports on Iran sanctions are also available.
