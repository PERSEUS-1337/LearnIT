    "content": "The Act titled \"Small Business Review Panel Technical Amendments Act of 1999\" is cited as the short title. The Small Business Review Panel Technical Amendments Act of 1999 acknowledges the importance of a thriving small business sector in job creation and aims to reduce regulatory burdens on small businesses by involving them in the rulemaking process. The Small Business Review Panel Technical Amendments Act of 1999 aims to involve small businesses in the Federal regulatory process by clarifying and expanding the Small Business Advocacy Review Panel process. The Small Business Review Panel Technical Amendments Act of 1999 clarifies and expands the Small Business Advocacy Review Panel process to ensure full analysis of potential impacts on small entities of rules proposed by certain agencies. Section 609(b) of title 5, United States Code, is amended to require the head of a covered agency to notify the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration before publishing an initial regulatory flexibility analysis. This includes providing information on the potential impacts of the proposed rule on small entities and identifying affected small entity representatives within 30 days. The covered agency must notify the Small Business Administration's Chief Counsel for Advocacy before publishing a regulatory flexibility analysis, including details on the rule's impact on small entities and identifying relevant representatives. A review panel, comprising federal employees from the agency, the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, and the Chief Counsel, will then assess the prepared material and draft proposed rule. The review panel, consisting of federal employees, will gather advice and recommendations from small entity representatives on specific issues and allow them to make oral presentations. Within 60 days, the panel must report to the agency head on comments received and findings related to certain sections. The head of the covered agency must publish the review panel's report in the Federal Register within 120 days of receiving it or as part of the notice of proposed rulemaking. The agency should make appropriate modifications to the draft proposed rule or the initial regulatory flexibility analysis if necessary. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. Amends Section 609(d) of title 5, United States Code to define 'covered agency' as EPA, OSHA, and IRS, and 'small entity representative' as a small entity or its representative. SEC. 5. EFFECTIVE DATE. The Act will take effect 90 days after enactment."
