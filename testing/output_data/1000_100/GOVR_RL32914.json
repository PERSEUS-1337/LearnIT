    "content": "Rising procurement costs for Navy ships are a concern for Navy officials and Members of Congress. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that funding levels for a 30-year Navy shipbuilding plan may need to be 33% higher than Navy plans. This has led to reduced ship procurement rates and concerns about the future size of the Navy and shipyards. Congress must decide how to address these rising costs, which could impact Navy capabilities and the shipbuilding industry. Options for addressing rising Navy ship procurement costs include increasing funding, changing funding methods, utilizing multiyear procurement, altering acquisition strategies, reducing shipyard overhead costs, improving yard efficiency, building ships without certain equipment, and considering construction in foreign shipyards with lower costs. The report focuses on reducing Navy ship procurement costs by shifting to lower-cost designs for attack submarines, aircraft carriers, larger surface combatants, and smaller surface combatants. It discusses potential advantages and disadvantages of this option and reviews recent legislative activity related to rising Navy ship procurement costs. Several lower-cost Navy ship designs have been proposed in recent reports by the CBO, DOD's Office of Force Transformation (OFT), and the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments (CSBA). These designs include reducing ship size and shifting from nuclear to conventional propulsion, as seen in the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS). Equipping Navy ships with conventional propulsion instead of nuclear can significantly reduce procurement costs. Shifting to commercial-like hulls from military survivability standards can also cut down on expenses. Consideration is being given to using a common hull design for multiple ship classes to further save on costs. The Navy plans to use a common hull design for multiple ship classes to reduce costs and benefit from improved production economies of scale. This strategy can be applied to various types of ships, such as destroyers, cruisers, aircraft carriers, missile-and-rocket ships, amphibious assault ships, and small-craft \"mother\" ships. Lower-cost ship options often utilize this approach, with estimated procurement costs provided when available. The Navy is considering lower-cost ship designs derived from currently planned ship designs, with estimated procurement costs presented when available. These lower-cost designs may be less capable individually but offer potential cost savings. For example, potential lower-cost options for the Virginia (SSN-774) class nuclear-powered submarine include AIP-equipped non-nuclear-powered submarines and reduced-cost \"Tango Bravo\" nuclear-powered submarines. The Navy is currently procuring one Virginia class submarine per year at a cost of about $2.6 billion each. The Navy is considering lower-cost ship designs for attack submarines, including AIP-equipped non-nuclear-powered submarines and reduced-cost \"Tango Bravo\" nuclear-powered submarines. Currently, the Navy procures one Virginia-class submarine per year at a cost of $2.6 billion. Maintaining the fleet of 48 SSNs could involve procuring 35 boats over a 16-year period, averaging 2.2 boats per year. An option for a lower-cost attack submarine is being explored using new technologies. The Navy is considering lower-cost ship designs for attack submarines, including AIP-equipped non-nuclear-powered submarines and reduced-cost \"Tango Bravo\" nuclear-powered submarines. AIP submarines could be procured in tandem with Virginia-class boats, offering extended submerged endurance. The Navy is exploring lower-cost ship designs for attack submarines, including AIP-equipped non-nuclear-powered submarines. The possibility of procuring one Virginia-class boat plus one or more AIP submarines each year is being considered. The OFT report suggested substituting four AIP submarines for one Virginia-class submarine in each carrier strike group, potentially costing the same. The average unit procurement cost for an AIP submarine is estimated to be around $600 million to $750 million. However, a U.S. Navy AIP submarine built to higher capability standards may cost more, possibly reducing the equal-cost ratio of substitution. This could result in the annual cost of procuring one Virginia-class SSN plus one, two, or three AIP submarines being equal. The Navy is exploring lower-cost ship designs for attack submarines, including AIP-equipped non-nuclear-powered submarines. New technologies may allow for a new SSN design equivalent to the Virginia class but cheaper to procure. The Navy and DARPA are developing these technologies under the Tango Bravo program to reduce platform infrastructure and production costs. The collaborative effort between DARPA and the Navy aims to overcome technology barriers to reduce submarine platform infrastructure costs. This includes advancements in shaftless propulsion, external weapons, conformal alternatives to existing arrays, simplifying submarine systems, and automation to reduce crew workload. The goal is to design a new submarine with capabilities similar to the Virginia class but at a lower procurement cost. Design work on a new \"Tango Bravo\" SSN submarine with capabilities similar to the Virginia class but at a lower procurement cost is being considered. This submarine could potentially be procured at a rate of two per year, offering a more cost-effective alternative. The idea is to continue Virginia-class procurement at one per year until the Tango Bravo submarine is ready for procurement, at which point Virginia-class procurement would cease. If design work on the Tango Bravo submarine is initiated promptly, the first submarine could be ready for procurement in a few years. The Navy is considering the procurement of the Tango Bravo submarine in a few years, which could offer a lower-cost alternative to large nuclear-powered carriers. The current design options include a medium-sized conventionally powered carrier and a small carrier based on high-speed surface effect ship design. The George H.W. Bush (CVN-77) is an example of a large nuclear-powered carrier with a full load displacement of about 100,000 tons. The estimated construction cost of the CVN-77 has risen to about $6.1 billion, with a scheduled entry into service in 2008. The Navy plans to procure the next aircraft carrier, CVN-78, in FY2008 as part of the CVN-21 class. The estimated procurement cost is $10.5 billion, with $2.4 billion for design costs and $8.1 billion for construction. Advance funding has been provided since FY2001, and if procured in FY2008, it would enter service in 2015. CVN-79 is planned for procurement in FY2012, entering service around 2019, and CVN-80 is planned for FY2016 procurement. A lower-cost carrier option involves a medium-sized, conventionally powered design. The Navy plans to procure the next aircraft carrier, CVN-78, in FY2008 as part of the CVN-21 class. The estimated procurement cost is $10.5 billion, with $2.4 billion for design costs and $8.1 billion for construction. Advance funding has been provided since FY2001, and if procured in FY2008, it would enter service in 2015. CVN-79 is planned for procurement in FY2012, entering service around 2019, and CVN-80 is planned for FY2016 procurement. A lower-cost carrier option involves a medium-sized, conventionally powered design. The CSBA report recommended procuring CVN-21-class aircraft carriers as needed to maintain a force of 10 large carriers and an additional four medium-sized, conventionally powered aircraft carriers based on the LHA(R) design. The OFT report recommended procuring a medium-sized carrier with a full load displacement of about 57,000 tons, capable of embarking a notional air wing of 36 manned aircraft and 15 unmanned air vehicles. This carrier would be larger than the LHA(R)-based carrier recommended in the CSBA report and similar in size to the UK's new aircraft carrier design. The OFT report recommended replacing two 57,000-ton carriers with the Navy's current large carriers to maintain the same number of manned aircraft at sea. They also suggested acquiring a smaller, high-speed carrier displacing 13,500 tons with a surface effect ship (SES)/catamaran hull, capable of carrying 10 manned aircraft, 8 UAVs, and having a speed of 50 to 60 knots. This carrier would be larger than Thailand's 11,500-ton carrier but smaller than Spain's 17,000-ton carrier. The OFT report recommended replacing two 57,000-ton carriers with a smaller, high-speed carrier displacing 13,500 tons. This new carrier would be faster than existing carriers and could carry the same number of manned aircraft at sea. Other potential designs discussed include a large conventionally powered carrier displacing about 100,000 tons, similar to the Navy's current conventionally powered carriers. The curr_chunk discusses the possibility of a medium-sized nuclear-powered carrier based on the LHA(R) hull design, costing more than $3 billion. This carrier would displace about 40,000 tons and embark two dozen VSTOL JSFs, similar to France's Charles de Gaulle carrier. The Naval War College developed a conceptual design for a very small, high-speed VSTOL carrier with a displacement of about 4,000 tons and a maximum speed of 60 knots. The carrier would embark an air wing of seven VSTOL JSFs and two helicopters. Different ship sizes and propulsion types create a matrix of aircraft carrier options, including large nuclear-powered carriers and potential alternatives. Medium-sized carriers of 40,000 to 70,000 tons could operate VSTOL or CTOL aircraft, while small carriers would likely be limited to VSTOL aircraft. The Navy has procured nuclear-powered cruisers in the past, but combining a nuclear propulsion plant with a commercial-like hull for a small nuclear-powered carrier may be a contradictory design. The current design includes a 14,500-ton DDG-1000 destroyer/CG(X) cruiser, with potential lower-cost options being considered. The Navy plans to procure 14,500-ton DDG-1000 destroyers and CG(X) cruisers, with the CG(X) based on the DDG-1000 design. The first two DDG-1000s will be funded in FY2007 and FY2008, costing about $3.3 billion each. The DDG-1000 will be 50% larger than current Aegis cruisers and destroyers, and larger than any U.S. Navy destroyer or cruiser since the nuclear-powered cruiser Long Beach (CGN-9) in FY1957. The Navy plans to procure DDG-1000 destroyers and CG(X) cruisers, with the first two DDG-1000s costing $3.3 billion each. The Navy originally planned to acquire 16-24 DDG-1000s but now plans to procure a total of 7 as part of its proposed 313-ship fleet. The FY2006-FY2011 FYDP reduced planned DDG-1000 procurement to one per year for FY2007-FY2011. Options for a reduced-cost surface combatant are being considered. The Navy plans to procure a reduced-cost surface combatant, which could include an 11,000-ton cruiser-destroyer, a 6,000-ton frigate, or a lower-cost gunfire support ship. Another option is a new-design ship of about 11,000 tons, intended as a replacement for the DDG-1000 and CG(X) programs, incorporating similar technologies but costing substantially less to procure. The Navy plans to procure a reduced-cost surface combatant, which could include an 11,000-ton cruiser-destroyer, a 6,000-ton frigate, or a lower-cost gunfire support ship. Another option is a new-design ship of about 11,000 tons, intended as a replacement for the DDG-1000 and CG(X) programs, with reduced crew size and operation costs. The ship would carry a smaller payload than the DDG-1000 or CG(X) but larger than current Ticonderoga Aegis cruisers or DDG-51 class Aegis destroyers, with options for land-attack or air- and missile-defense configurations. The CBO estimated that a 6,000-ton FFG(X) ship could cost around $800 million and might not be equipped with the AGS for naval gunfire capability like the DDG-1000. However, it could still perform non-gunfire missions similar to the DDG-1000 and LCS. This ship could potentially replace the Navy's FFG-7 class frigates and DD-963 class destroyers. The CBO and CSBA have suggested a smaller, less expensive new-design ship option based on the San Antonio (LPD-17) amphibious ship, with one or two AGSs on the hull. The initial AGS-armed LPD-17 might cost about $1.9 billion, with subsequent ships costing about $1.5 billion each. This option would be a potential lower-cost alternative to the current 2,500- to 3,000-ton Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) design. The Navy plans to procure 55 Littoral Combat Ships (LCSs) as part of its proposed 313-ship fleet. The LCSs are small, fast surface combatants with modular weapon systems. The Navy aims for a procurement cost of no more than $220 million per LCS sea frame. The average ship procurement cost, including mission modules, is estimated to be around $387 million. The Office of Force Transformation (OFT) report suggested an alternative to procuring 55 Littoral Combat Ships (LCSs) at a total cost of about $22.1 billion. They recommended either a 1,000-ton surface combatant or a 100-ton surface combatant with high speeds and modular mission packages. These ships would be supported by larger vessels and transported to the theater by a \"mother ship.\" The Office of Force Transformation (OFT) proposed using a 57,000-ton hull for a medium-sized aircraft carrier and recommended a 100-ton surface combatant supported by a mother ship and possibly another larger vessel. Lower-cost ship designs are being considered for cost, capability, technical risk, homeporting arrangements, and impact on the shipbuilding industry. The cost implications of these options include development, design, procurement, operation, support, and disposal costs, with billions of dollars required for developing a large Navy ship. If a planned ship has already been developed, stopping the program for a new, lower-cost design could save money in the long run only if the new design is procured in large numbers to offset additional development costs. Stopping an existing ship acquisition program early could lead to cost savings if a lower-cost alternative design reaches the break-even point sooner. Using similar technologies from more expensive ships could reduce the cost of developing a new design. The cost to develop a new ship design could be reduced by building more ships to that design, leading to decreased labor hours. If a lower-cost design can be procured at a greater annual rate than the currently planned design, cost savings could be achieved. If a lower-cost ship design can be procured at a higher annual rate than the current plan, it could benefit from spreading fixed overhead costs and learning curve advantages. Navy ships have long service lives, with operating and support costs often exceeding procurement costs. Reducing a ship's life-cycle costs may involve design features that enhance efficiency. Reducing a ship's life-cycle O&S cost may require incorporating design features that increase procurement cost. This can involve automating functions to reduce crew size, potentially increasing technology costs. Maintenance costs can also be reduced by using more durable materials or increasing space for easier maintenance access. Incorporating design features to reduce a ship's life-cycle O&S cost may increase procurement cost. An alternative ship design with higher O&S costs might not reduce total Navy expenditures as expected. Nuclear-powered ships have the fuel cost included in procurement, unlike conventionally powered ships. For example, a nuclear-powered attack submarine's fuel core in 2004 cost about $158 million and is designed to power the ship for its entire 33-year expected life. The cost of a nuclear-powered submarine or carrier is higher during procurement compared to conventionally powered ones. However, the nuclear-powered vessels do not incur fuel-related O&S costs over their lifetime, unlike conventionally powered ships. This difference in fuel costs results in a smaller overall cost difference between nuclear-powered and conventionally powered vessels when procurement and life-cycle O&S costs are considered together. The cost-effectiveness of nuclear power for ships depends on the price of oil. Higher oil prices make nuclear power more competitive due to lower fuel costs over the ship's lifetime. In theory, if oil prices are high enough, the total ownership cost of a nuclear-powered ship could be less than that of a conventionally powered ship. However, nuclear-powered ships have higher end-of-life disposal costs. Nuclear-powered ships have higher end-of-life disposal costs due to the need to defuel, cut out, and seal up the reactor compartment. This process can cost around $30 million to $35 million for a submarine and roughly $570 million for a carrier. Lower-cost ship designs are generally less capable, but exceptions like the Tango Bravo SSN, which uses advanced technologies, may offer similar capabilities to higher-cost designs. Factors affecting capability include ship payload, detectability, survivability, mobility, and the value of ship numbers. As Navy combat ships decrease in size, their total payload decreases, affecting their capabilities. Factors like ship design and propulsion play a role in this decrease, with smaller ships becoming proportionately less capable. For example, reducing the size of an aircraft carrier results in a decrease in total weight. Reducing the size of an aircraft carrier can significantly impact the total weight of the embarked aircraft. A medium-sized carrier may have a smaller air wing compared to a larger carrier, resulting in fewer sorties per day. Transferring the air wing to a larger carrier can increase sortie generation due to its larger flight deck and fuel capacities. Reducing ship size can limit the equipment that can be installed, leading to higher costs for combat-related equipment at sea. If fleet payload remains constant, shifting to smaller ships to reduce costs can actually increase total procurement costs. If crew size and fuel consumption do not decrease proportionately with ship size, this cost increase can be further exacerbated. The OFT report argues that new technologies can increase payload fraction on smaller surface combatants. Precision-guidance technology allows for smaller weapons to maintain effectiveness. Improvements in sensor technology could also reduce weight and volume. Supporters of larger ships argue that careful design can make them no more detectable by enemy sensors than smaller ships. They also claim that larger ships built to military standards can better withstand hits and continue operations after being attacked, unlike smaller ships or those with commercial-like hulls. Supporters of smaller ships argue that larger ships add to costs and can be sunk or put out of operation. They believe a fleet of smaller ships can overwhelm the enemy's target-tracking capabilities and have superior overall fleet survivability. Some argue that U.S. leaders may avoid using expensive Navy ships in high-threat situations to prevent damage or sinking, reducing their effectiveness. Nuclear propulsion in submarines changes their mobility and operational capabilities significantly. Supporters claim that nuclear power transforms submarines into true submarines, operating primarily underwater, unlike submersibles that surface occasionally. An AIP system, like a fuel-cell or closed-cycle diesel engine, extends the submerged endurance of non-nuclear-powered submarines. It can increase stationary or low-speed submerged endurance to up to two or three weeks. However, it does not significantly improve high-speed submerged endurance, which is limited by battery capacity. In contrast, nuclear-powered submarines have extended submerged endurance at any speed. A nuclear-powered submarine can stay submerged for weeks or months, operating at high speeds as needed. Non-nuclear-powered submarines, even with AIP systems, are not suitable for long, stealthy missions due to limited high-speed submerged endurance. The OFT report suggests transporting AIP submarines to overseas theaters of operation on a transport ship. The OFT report suggests transporting AIP submarines to overseas theaters of operation on a transport ship. A potential force-multiplying attribute of having an SSN in a carrier strike group is the ability to redirect it to a different theater for another mission without alerting others. This allows the SSN to achieve military effects in two theaters simultaneously. The effectiveness of an AIP submarine in a carrier strike group depends on its operational needs. Nuclear-powered carriers can respond quickly to crises without refueling, allowing immediate combat operations. They can store more aircraft fuel and ammunition, sustaining combat operations for longer periods. Advocates of higher-speed ships argue that their increased capability allows for rapid location shifts and makes them harder to track. Skeptics question the benefits of speeds exceeding 30 knots. Advocates of a larger fleet argue that more ships enable better global presence and crisis response. Advocates of a larger fleet argue that having more ships allows for better global presence and crisis response. They believe that a fleet with a larger number of ships offers more flexibility in responding to situations with the appropriate naval capability, without incurring high daily operational costs. Additionally, they argue that increasing the number of ship nodes in a network-centric warfare system will enhance the overall capability of the force. Advocates of a smaller, more highly distributed force design argue that current ship designs already offer flexibility for creating naval formations with appropriate capability for various situations. They believe that deploying a smaller number of more-expensive ships to multiple locations may not be as valuable if those ships lack the necessary capabilities for required missions. Additionally, they point out that the Navy has increased the fraction of the fleet deployed or ready to deploy, mitigating the impact of having a limited total number of ships. Advocates argue that a smaller fleet of more expensive ships, when combined with aircraft, unmanned vehicles, and sensors, can still effectively engage in network-centric warfare. Lower-cost options with technical risks for the Navy include AIP-equipped non-nuclear-powered submarines, Tango Bravo nuclear-powered submarines, 13,500-ton high-speed carriers, and smaller surface combatants with new technologies. Smaller ships offer more homeporting possibilities due to varying berthing space limitations. Homeporting a nuclear-powered carrier or submarine can be more complex than conventional ships due to unique requirements. Forward-homeporting a Navy ship in a foreign country can be politically challenging, especially if it is nuclear-powered. Lower-cost ship designs may impact the shipbuilding industrial base by changing the volume or distribution of Navy shipbuilding work. The impact of shifting to lower-cost ship designs on Navy shipbuilding work depends on the total funding available for procurement. Three scenarios are possible: no change in funding leads to no substantial change in shipbuilding work volume, using lower-cost designs to reduce total costs reduces work volume, and making ships more cost-effective may affect competition. The shift to lower-cost ship designs in Navy shipbuilding work could increase funding for procurement, enabling more shipbuilding work. This could impact the distribution of work among shipyards, particularly for building Tango Bravo nuclear-powered submarines. The potential shift to lower-cost ship designs in Navy shipbuilding work may impact the distribution of work among shipyards, particularly for building Virginia-class submarines. AIP-equipped non-nuclear powered submarines could be designed and built by various shipyards, potentially reducing work for U.S. naval nuclear propulsion component manufacturers. NGNN is the only U.S. yard capable of building large nuclear-powered carriers. A conventionally powered carrier based on different designs could be built by NGNN, Ingalls, or other shipyards with relevant experience. This shift from nuclear to conventional carriers may impact work for U.S. naval nuclear propulsion component manufacturers. The Navy's nuclear submarine and aircraft carrier programs sustain many manufacturers. A carrier nuclear propulsion plant equals five submarine plants in work provided. DDG-1000 destroyers are built at NGSS and GD/BIW. Smaller surface combatants like LCS are built at Marinette Marine, Bollinger Shipyards, and Austal USA. The House Armed Services Committee report on H.R. 5122 highlights concerns about rising costs and production delays in major defense acquisition programs, leading to fewer platforms being fielded at higher costs. Sections 122, 123, and 124 of the bill aim to limit procurement costs for specific classes of ships, while Section 1014 establishes a shipbuilding industrial base improvement program. Shipyards in Louisiana, Texas, and Alabama are potential locations for building surface combatants, with a focus on smaller ships. The House Armed Services Committee report on H.R. 5122 raises concerns about the over-reliance on expensive ''mega'' weapons systems, leading to high costs, production delays, and fewer platforms being fielded. This situation creates a ''high demand, low density'' scenario, impacting operational tempo, military personnel stress, and strategic depth in responding to multiple contingencies. The report also addresses the affordability of the Navy's shipbuilding plan. The committee commends the Chief of Naval Operations for developing the Navy's future force structure and long-term shipbuilding plan. However, there are concerns about unrealistic assumptions and affordability of the plan, which requires a significant increase in shipbuilding funds. The committee is worried about obtaining additional funds during anticipated federal spending reductions and the potential cost growth in ship acquisition programs. The committee is concerned about the affordability of the Navy's long-term shipbuilding plan and the excess capacity in the shipbuilding/ship repair industrial base. They direct the Secretary of the Navy to report on managing capacity to make Navy shipbuilding more affordable. The committee is deeply concerned about the Navy's ship cost estimates, noting inaccuracies and exclusions in prior estimates. They recommend revising the process to ensure all major known elements of ship cost are included. The committee directs the Secretary of the Navy to revalidate cost estimates for specific ship classes and submit them for review by the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics by July 1, 2006. The committee directs the Secretary of the Navy to submit revalidated cost estimates for ship classes by July 1, 2006. The report questions the affordability of the DDG-1000 program and expresses concerns about meeting original requirements due to budget constraints. The committee supports the construction of up to two DD(X) destroyers to demonstrate technologies for future, more affordable surface combatants. The report highlights the importance of the maritime technology program in reducing naval ship construction costs. The committee supports improving efficiency and competitiveness in the U.S. shipbuilding industry by incentivizing cost-saving measures in ship procurement contracts. They propose a shipbuilding industrial base improvement program to award grants and loan guarantees to qualified shipyards for productivity enhancements. The committee recommends awarding grants and loan guarantees to shipyards to improve productivity and cost effectiveness in Navy ship procurement. This will enhance competitiveness and achieve savings in ship construction, including the T-AKE class ships. Additionally, funds are recommended for the maritime technology program and national shipbuilding research program. The committee recommends $20.0 million in PE 78730N for the national shipbuilding research program to improve efficiency in the United States shipbuilding industry. The budget request contained no funds for shipbuilding industrial base improvement grants, which are crucial for sustaining viable and efficient shipbuilding and ship repair industries in the country. The committee recommends providing grants and loan guarantees to U.S. shipyards for the development of innovative technologies and infrastructure to improve efficiency and competitiveness in naval vessel construction. They recommend $50.0 million for shipbuilding industrial base improvement grants and emphasize the national security importance of sustaining viable shipbuilding industries in the United States. The committee recommends $50.0 million in PE 78730N for shipbuilding industrial base improvement loan guarantees, focusing on enhancing efficiency and competitiveness in the U.S. shipbuilding and ship repair industries. Section 121 of S. 2766 authorizes incremental funding for long-lead components for aircraft carriers, while Section 123 increases the cost limit on CVN-77 to $6,057 million. The Senate Armed Services Committee highlights the impact of low shipbuilding rates on driving up costs and emphasizes the need for stable shipbuilding rates. The committee recommends increased funding and flexibility for shipbuilding to reverse the trend of reduced shipbuilding rates. Concerns were raised about cost growth on the CVN-77 program, with recommendations to improve affordability for future aircraft carriers. The shipbuilder proposed savings through a stable procurement plan and economic order quantity material procurement for future carriers. The committee suggests a $50.0 million increase in SCN for shipbuilding. The committee recommends a $50.0 million increase in SCN for CVN-21 class advance procurement to achieve program savings. The Secretary of the Navy is directed to review economic order quantity and long lead time material procurement for the CVN-21 class. None of the funds for advance procurement for CVN-79 and CVN-80 can be obligated before 30 days following the Secretary's report. The procurement cost for CVN-77 is increased to $6.057 billion, the government's maximum contractual liability. The procurement cost for CVN-77 has increased to $6.057 billion, attributed to various factors including escalation impacts, labor hours, overhead rates, and schedule delays. Despite management actions taken to contain costs, the Navy projects CVN-77 costs to exceed the baseline cap by over 30%. The Secretary of the Navy is directed to submit quarterly reports to Congress starting December 1, 2006, regarding the CVN-77 ship construction contract, including contract target cost and program details to improve affordability and visibility into completion cost performance. The report provides information on the CVN-77 ship construction contract, including contract target cost, Program Manager's Estimate at Completion, contractor's Estimate at Completion, contract ceiling price, end of period actual costs, and percent progress. It also discusses the cost risks associated with the construction of lead LCS vessels at two shipyards and emphasizes the importance of cost control through competition, commonality, and learning curves in the procurement of the 55 ship class. The committee supports the Navy's approach to rapidly field the LCS as part of the global war on terror strategy. The committee is concerned about the affordability and cost growth of the LCS program, as well as the lack of a clear acquisition strategy. They are also unsure about the additional costs for training, maintenance, and supply support for the two flight 0 ship classes. The budgeting of costs for procuring the flight 0 LCS vessels in three different appropriations makes it difficult to discern the total costs for the program's start. The committee directs the Secretary of the Navy to submit a report on the LCS program. The committee directs the Secretary of the Navy to submit a report on the LCS program by December 1, 2006. The report should outline the Navy's acquisition strategy, competition plan, flight strategy, and cost containment strategy. It should also include all R&D and procurement costs for the program, as well as assess the added life cycle costs for two dissimilar flight 0 LCS designs. The report also addresses shipyard costs and efficiency, highlighting the lack of funding for maritime technology in the budget request. The National Shipbuilding Research Program-Advanced Shipbuilding Enterprise (NSRP-ASE) is mentioned as a collaborative effort between the Navy and industry to reduce shipbuilding costs. The committee recommends increasing funding by $10.0 million in PE 78730N to support NSRP-ASE efforts, including developing a skilled shipbuilding workforce, establishing a national supply chain to reduce material costs in ship construction, and exploring secondary and commercial opportunities. The committee recommends increasing funding by $10.0 million in PE 78730N to support NSRP-ASE efforts, including developing a skilled shipbuilding workforce, establishing a national supply chain to reduce material costs in ship construction, exploring secondary and commercial markets for private shipbuilders, and developing an industry-wide architecture for computer interoperability. Section 121 of H.R. 5122 authorizes incremental funding for CVN-21 class aircraft carriers CVN-78, CVN-79, and CVN-80, while sections 122, 123, 125, and 126 establish unit procurement cost caps for various types of naval ships. Section 215 authorizes $4 million for implementing or evaluating Navy shipbuilding technology proposals. The Navy is directed to assess naval vessel construction efficiencies and contractor incentives. New procurement cost caps can be adjusted for inflation. The Secretary must report any negative impact of congressional actions on program costs. The conferees acknowledge the uncertainties in completing the design and construction of the CVN-21 class budget, allowing adjustments for non-recurring design and engineering costs to reduce risks. Compliance with this provision will require procurement cost trade-offs to be made. Compliance with the provision for the CVN-21 class may require cost trade-offs that could impact various factors in design and construction. The Secretary must notify Congress before implementing any cost-driven reduction that could affect safety or crew quality of life. (Page 552) The report states that the Secretary must notify Congress of any cost-driven reduction that could impact safety or crew quality of life for the CVN-21 class. The amendment does not give the Secretary authority to adjust limitation amounts for cost increases due to congressional actions affecting the shipbuilding program. However, the conferees direct the Secretary to assess any negative impact of congressional actions on program costs in the annual written notice to Congress. The LHA-6 budget represents the Navy's assessment of costs for the future LHA Replacement ship, but uncertainties remain in design and construction that could impact costs over the next 6 years. The amendment allows adjustment to cost limitations for non-recurring design and engineering to reduce risk in program execution. Trade-offs may be necessary to manage costs, potentially impacting system performance and crew quality of life. The Secretary must notify Congress of any significant cost reductions that could affect safety or crew quality of life for the LHA Replacement ship. The Secretary must notify Congress of any cost-driven reduction that could impact safety, crew quality of life, or hinder the LHA Replacement program. The House Appropriations Committee emphasizes the importance of cost control in the Navy's long-range shipbuilding plan. The Committee urges the Navy to set firm cost targets in shipbuilding programs, develop initiatives for cost control, and sign contracts to prevent cost growth. A report recommended reducing Navy's FY2007 procurement funding by $141.4 million to address cost growth in prior years. Concerns persist over lack of cost control in Navy shipbuilding programs, with ongoing contracts experiencing rising cost growth. The Committee is concerned about cost overruns in Navy shipbuilding programs, including the CVN-77 aircraft carrier and Virginia class attack submarines. The Navy estimates an overrun of $867.9 million in the CVN-77 production effort over the next 3 years. Congressional legislation is needed to raise the cost cap on the program. The fiscal year 2007 budget requests $136 million for cost growth in the U.S.S. Texas (SSN-775). Cost performance on the U.S.S. North Carolina (SSN-777) is below Navy standards. The Committee is concerned about cost overruns in Navy shipbuilding programs, including the CVN-77 aircraft carrier and Virginia class attack submarines. The current cost performance on the Virginia class jeopardizes Navy's ability to meet performance goals and cost targets. The Committee recommends a reduction in funding for Completion of Prior Year Shipbuilding Programs, allocating the reduction to various programs including CVN-77, SSN-777, SSN-776, SSN-775, and the LPD-17 class. Increasing annual ship-procurement funding to an average of roughly $14.4 billion per year in constant FY2007 dollars is one option for addressing rising Navy ship procurement costs. However, this could be challenging due to finite defense funding, potentially requiring cuts to other Navy or DOD priorities. Despite efforts to operate more efficiently and redirect savings to procurement programs, rising costs in areas like personnel expenses have offset these savings. One option to address rising Navy ship procurement costs is to modify the funding for new Navy ships in the budget. Suggestions include incremental funding or advance appropriations. Another option is to utilize multiyear procurement in Navy ship-procurement programs, which could increase the number of ships procured for a given total amount of money. These options may pose challenges related to Congress's oversight and funding responsibilities. Utilizing multiyear procurement in Navy ship-procurement programs could increase the number of ships procured for a given total amount of money. Changing the acquisition strategy for building certain Navy ships, such as having all DDG-1000s built by a single yard, could reduce costs significantly. However, this strategy could lead to the second yard permanently exiting the business of building that kind of ship, leaving the Navy with a single source for construction.

However, this strategy could lead to the second yard permanently exiting the business of building that kind of ship, leaving the Navy with a single source for construction. Making greater use of competition in Navy ship acquisition could involve using competition between shipyards in awarding contracts for building follow-on ships in each class, representing a return to Navy practices in the 1980s. The government's decision on ship procurement must consider high annual rates or yard withdrawal to maintain financial health. Reducing shipyard fixed overhead costs is another option to lower Navy ship procurement costs. The government can lower Navy ship procurement costs by reducing shipyard fixed overhead costs through various options such as increasing other types of work done by the yards, improving operating efficiency, and incorporating advanced design and production processes. Building Navy ships without some planned equipment or using less expensive substitutes could reduce capabilities but defer costs into the future. Adding equipment back later may be more costly than original construction. This strategy could impact long-term efficiency and procurement costs. Building Navy ships without planned equipment or using cheaper substitutes may increase long-term procurement costs. One option is to construct ships in foreign shipyards to lower costs, but this is subject to U.S.C. \u00a7 7309 which allows exceptions for national security interests with notification to Congress. The provision exempts inflatable boats and rigid inflatable boats from the 30-day period beginning on the date the notice is received. Annual DOD appropriations act prohibits funds for Navy shipbuilding in foreign facilities for major components and construction of naval vessels in foreign shipyards. RAND Corporation report discusses reasons for increased Navy ship costs and options for cost reduction. The cost of Navy ships has significantly increased over the years, prompting discussions on ways to reduce these costs."
