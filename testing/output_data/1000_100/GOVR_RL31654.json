    "content": "The Endangered Species Act (ESA) provides legal protection to identified species and their habitats, administered by the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS). Species can be listed as \"endangered\" or \"threatened\" based on extinction risk assessments. Legal tools under the ESA include prohibiting unpermitted \"take\" of endangered species and ensuring actions do not harm listed species. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) aims to protect species and habitats. As of August 24, 2016, there were 2,266 listed species, with 1,593 in the U.S. The ESA was passed in 1973 and has been amended multiple times. Funding authorization expired in 1992, but appropriations continue. The ESA prohibits actions that harm listed species. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) aims to protect species and habitats, regardless of appropriations. It can become a battleground in debates over scarce resources, with economic interests on multiple sides. Declining species are often indicators of resource scarcities and altered ecosystems. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) has become a battleground in debates over resource allocation, with tensions rising over species protection versus economic interests. The global climate change debate has focused on issues like fossil fuels, carbon emissions, and the impact on traditional jobs, with the polar bear symbolizing the effects. Critics argue that the ESA and administrative efforts fall short in balancing species conservation with other needs in a growing economy and human population. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) is a topic of debate, with critics arguing that it doesn't adequately balance species conservation with economic needs. Support for species conservation varies among different demographic groups, with urban and suburban populations showing stronger support compared to rural areas. Native Americans, who rely on natural resources, often support the survival of listed species. Groups opposing strong protections for listed species claim potential job losses, while those in favor argue that jobs will be lost without stringent conservation measures. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) is a topic of debate, with critics arguing that it doesn't adequately balance species conservation with economic needs. The debate often centers on jobs and biology, with some industries seeing the ESA as a problem while others support it. The ESA contains statutory authority for certain activities and a provision authorizing appropriations. Congress has continued to appropriate funding for ESA, but questions are sometimes raised about the act's effectiveness. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) faces questions about funding and authorization. Despite the expiration of the authorization for appropriations in FY1992, the act's prohibitions and authorities remain in effect. The agencies still have the authority to carry out actions and enforce prohibitions, even without appropriated funds. The Endangered Species Act's prohibitions and authorities remain in effect even without appropriated funds. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that the failure to appropriate funds does not end statutory obligations. Citizen suits can still be filed for violations of the act, potentially dissuading parties from prohibited acts. The House and Senate have rules distinguishing between authorizations and appropriations, but these rules do not affect a measure's legal force. Either chamber can choose to waive its rules during the legislative process. House rules prohibit unauthorized appropriations in legislation, amendments, and conference reports. The House and Senate have rules distinguishing between authorizations and appropriations, but these rules do not affect a measure's legal force. House rules prohibit unauthorized appropriations in legislation, amendments, and conference reports. The House Rules Committee can report a special rule to set procedural parameters for appropriations measures, including waiving rules for unauthorized appropriations in floor amendments and conference reports. Senate rules also prohibit unauthorized appropriations in committee and floor amendments, except in specified circumstances. The House and Senate have rules prohibiting unauthorized appropriations in legislation, amendments, and conference reports. Enforcement is through points of order, but waivers can be granted by unanimous consent. A lapse in funding would have mixed effects on existing laws, impacting interagency consultations, species listings, critical habitat designations, and more. A lapse in funding could lead to significant consequences, including potential lawsuits for missed deadlines in critical habitat designations, no issuance of permits for nonfederal actions, reduced inspections for violations of species under CITES, lack of enforcement of prohibitions on taking listed species, and no acquisition of habitat for listed species. The last major effort to end all funding for the ESA occurred in the 104th Congress, but was abandoned due to potential conflicts in conservation projects. The ESA's goal is species recovery to the point where ESA protection is no longer needed, but only 34 species have been delisted due to recovery. Since the Endangered Species Act's goal is species recovery, only 34 species have been delisted due to recovery. Some species have become extinct since listing, while others have been delisted due to scientific reclassification or improved data. Proving the extinction of rare species like the ivory-billed woodpecker and Eskimo curlew is challenging due to their rarity. The Endangered Species Act has been effective in stabilizing or increasing populations of listed species, with 41% showing improvement. Some species like red wolves and California condors may not exist without ESA protection. The status of rare species without the ESA is uncertain, but some, like certain salmon populations, may have faced extinction. The Endangered Species Act has been effective in stabilizing or increasing populations of listed species, with 41% showing improvement. Some species like red wolves and California condors may not exist without ESA protection. Without the ESA, rare species such as certain salmon populations, Florida panthers, California condors, and plants with narrow ranges might have declined further towards extinction. Scientific information and analysis are crucial for ESA actions and enforcement, focusing on causes of extinction, normal extinction rates, and comparing current rates to background levels. The extinction debate has shifted from over-exploitation to a broader risk for the vast majority of species. Habitat loss, caused by factors like removal from the wild and global climate change, is a major threat to many species. Introduction of nonnative invasive species also contributes to population decline through disease transmission, predation, and competition. This leads to the homogenization of the world's flora and fauna. The gradual homogenization of the world's flora and fauna has led to a demise of many species. Many species are threatened by multiple factors, and some decline for no obvious reason. Extinction is a natural process, but the current rate exceeds background rates. Calculating current extinction rates and comparing with the past is challenging due to uncertainty in total species numbers. Scientists use conservative assumptions to estimate extinction rates due to uncertainty in total species numbers. Current extinction rates (e.g., 17,000 species per year) exceed background rates (1 to 10 species per 10 million species per year). The public is generally unaware of the vast number of species in groups like beetles and fish. Current estimates of extinction rates range from 100 to 10,000 times background rates, similar to past extinction events. Critics question these estimates due to uncertainties in calculations, but biologists argue that consistent results from different studies support the findings. Once a species goes extinct, it cannot be brought back, highlighting the importance of addressing high extinction rates. Some scientists estimate that recovery from major extinction events could take up to 25 million years, indicating that the return to pre-historic species numbers would take several million years. The Endangered Species Act defines endangered species as those in danger of extinction and threatened species as likely to become extinct. The Endangered Species Act defines threatened species as those likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range. The ESA provides protection for all species and subspecies of animals, with further protection for distinct population segments within a species. Limited protection is available for plant species, and no protection is afforded for organisms not considered animals or plants. The Endangered Species Act defines threatened species as those likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range. The Act provides protection for all species and subspecies of animals, with further protection for distinct population segments within a species. Limited protection is available for plant species, and no protection is afforded for organisms not considered animals or plants. The term \"take\" under the ESA includes actions such as harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect wildlife. There has been controversy over whether habitat modification may be considered a form of harm under the Act. The Secretary of the Interior manages most listed species through FWS, while marine species and anadromous fish fall under the responsibility of the Secretary of Commerce, acting through NMFS. The Endangered Species Act allows for species to be listed based on scientific information, with economic considerations only factored into critical habitat determinations. The Act prohibits economic considerations in listing decisions to prioritize scientific assessment of a species' continued existence. The Endangered Species Act prioritizes scientific assessment of a species' continued existence, determining if a species is endangered or threatened based on the severity of its decline and threats to survival. The Act allows for flexibility in protection levels for species, subspecies, or distinct population segments. The interpretation of \"all or a significant portion of its range\" varies, with the Department of the Interior having different views in the past. The Department of the Interior (DOI) previously interpreted the phrase \"endangered\" in the Endangered Species Act to mean a species in danger of extinction throughout all of its range. However, this interpretation was found to be in violation of the ESA by multiple courts. In 2014, the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) issued a joint interpretation stating that a portion of a species' range is significant if its contribution to the species' viability is crucial for preventing extinction throughout the entire range. The Endangered Species Act determines listing based on scientific factors and prohibits consideration of economic impacts. Listing decisions are likened to diagnosing a disease, emphasizing a strictly scientific approach. The Endangered Species Act requires listing decisions to be based solely on biological criteria, prohibiting non-biological factors like economic considerations. The addition of the word \"solely\" aims to ensure that decisions regarding species listing or delisting are solely based on scientific and commercial data. Economic factors are deemed irrelevant in determining the status of species. The Endangered Species Act emphasizes that listing decisions must be based solely on biological criteria, excluding economic considerations. The legislation prohibits the use of economic factors in determining whether a species should be listed as endangered, threatened, or not listed at all. While economic factors should not influence the scientific decision-making process, conservation methods can still be chosen to minimize costs to society, industry, or landowners while achieving conservation goals. Petitions often initiate species listings, including petitions to change a species' status or to delist it. The Endangered Species Act requires FWS and NMFS to make a determination within 90 days of receiving a petition, which can be to change a species' status or to delist it. If the petition presents substantial scientific information, the agency has 12 months to decide whether the action is warranted or not. Lawsuits have been filed against agencies for failing to act on petitions. The Endangered Species Act requires FWS and NMFS to make determinations on petitions within specific timeframes. Lawsuits have been filed against agencies for delays in listing determinations. As of August 2016, FWS had received over 160 ESA petitions, with questions arising about federal responsibilities towards proposed species. The Endangered Species Act requires agencies to confer with the appropriate Secretary on actions that may harm proposed species or critical habitat. This conference aims to resolve conflicts early in the planning process and provide advice on minimizing adverse effects. The process for proposed species is different from listed species consultation, allowing for a less formal approach. Agencies may opt for a more formal process to avoid duplication of efforts later on. The Endangered Species Act requires agencies to confer with the appropriate Secretary on actions that may harm proposed species or critical habitat. This conference aims to resolve conflicts early in the planning process and provide advice on minimizing adverse effects. Once a species is listed, an agency will have definite responsibilities and might consider it prudent at the proposed listing stage to avoid harm to a precarious species and possible liability for compensation. The relevant Secretary must monitor candidate species to prevent significant risks to their well-being. As of August 24, 2016, there were 58 candidate species being considered for listing as endangered or threatened species. As of August 24, 2016, there were 58 candidate species for listing under the Endangered Species Act. Federal agencies and nonfederal landowners may enter into conservation agreements to improve the status of a species and avoid listing. If a species is proposed for listing, the Secretary must publish the regulation in the Federal Register and notify state agencies. The Endangered Species Act requires the Secretary to publish proposed regulations in the Federal Register, notify state agencies and counties, invite comments from governments, notify foreign countries, professional societies, publish locally, and hold public hearings. As of August 24, 2016, 73 species were proposed for listing. Federal agencies must confer with the Secretary on actions that may harm candidate species. The Secretary must monitor candidate species and promptly list any in emergency situations. The Endangered Species Act allows for emergency listings to protect species at risk. Special regulations can be implemented for threatened species, such as the northern long-eared bat and polar bear. A distinct population segment (DPS) refers to a genetically distinct and significant portion of a species, with only vertebrates eligible for designation. Criteria for designating a DPS include population discreteness and significance. The criteria for designating a DPS under the Endangered Species Act include population discreteness and significance. Once a DPS is identified, its protection status is determined using the same criteria as for other listings. Special rules may be applied under Section 4(d) of the ESA if the DPS is found to be threatened. The concept of evolutionarily significant units (ESUs) was developed by NMFS to interpret the \"distinct population segment\" language in the ESA. Litigation surrounding DPS designations, such as the gray wolf, has led to courts vacating DPS designations established since 2003. The ESU concept, developed by NMFS, aims to identify important groups of salmon populations along the Pacific coast. As of July 25, 2016, 28 ESUs of salmon and steelhead trout were listed as endangered or threatened under the ESA. The ESU concept was chosen for both policy and scientific reasons to address the impracticality of using stock or species levels. The inclusion of hatchery fish in ESUs has been a controversial issue. Congress added the concept of experimental populations to the ESA in 1982. In 1982, Congress added experimental populations to the ESA to reintroduce species without strict land use restrictions. To qualify, the population must be geographically separate and authorized for release. An experimental population's protected status is determined by its extinction risk, with essential populations being treated differently. Special regulations under Section 4 of the ESA apply to nonessential experimental populations, with rules for taking the species. No Section 7 consultation is needed for agency actions outside of national wildlife refuges or parks. Critical habitat isn't designated for nonessential populations. Delisting, uplisting, and downlisting processes for species are the same. The Secretary of the Interior can initiate status changes, or it can be done through a substantive petition. The Secretary reviews species status based on scientific data without considering economic impacts. Every five years, listed species are reviewed for potential status changes. Critical habitat includes occupied areas and essential conservation areas. Designation of critical habitat is required when a species is listed. As of July 25, 2016, critical habitat had been designated for 758 listed species, or 47.5% of the 1,596 listed domestic animal and plant species. Any area, whether federally owned or not, may be designated as critical habitat, affecting private land only if federal action is involved. Federal agencies must avoid \"destruction or adverse modification\" of critical habitat. The Secretary must designate critical habitat based on scientific data and consider economic impacts. Areas can be excluded if benefits outweigh inclusion, but extinction risk must be considered. Economic factors are not considered in listing species as endangered, but are in critical habitat designation. The designation of critical habitat under the ESA is based on scientific data and may exclude certain areas if benefits outweigh inclusion, but extinction risk must be considered. Restrictions on private land use primarily come from the prohibition on taking listed species, with designated critical habitat playing a minor role. The ESA imposes fewer restrictions on the nonfederal taking of listed plants compared to animals. The Secretary is restricted from designating critical habitat on Defense Department lands with an Integrated Natural Resource Management Plan (INRMP) under the Sikes Act, if the plan benefits the lands. National security must be considered in critical habitat designations. These restrictions have been in place for over 20 years to address concerns about interference with military activities. FWS faces challenges in designating critical habitat due to budget constraints and funding restrictions, leading to frequent lawsuits and losses in court. The FWS believes critical habitat designation offers limited protection and is costly, leading to budget constraints. However, it can provide additional protection for listed species in federal actions. The FWS previously disagreed that designated critical habitat provides extra protection, arguing that jeopardy consideration already offers necessary protection. However, federal courts found the definition of \"destroy or adversely modify\" to be contrary to the ESA as it focused on survival rather than recovery of species. This definition was eventually changed. The definition of \"destroy or adversely modify\" critical habitat was changed in February 2016 to focus on recovery of species, in line with the ESA. The new definition emphasizes alterations that diminish the value of critical habitat for conservation purposes. The Endangered Species Act requires the development of recovery plans for listed species, with a focus on conservation and survival. These plans cover a wide range of species, with over 1,100 plans in place as of August 2016. Land acquisition for conservation purposes can be funded through the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which is primarily derived from offshore oil and gas leases. The Endangered Species Act requires cooperation between federal agencies and states for land acquisition. States may receive federal funds for endangered species programs with a 25% matching amount. The 1988 ESA amendments created a fund for state grants, including land acquisition. Congress appropriated $53.5 million for cooperative activities in FY2016. Federal agencies must complete a biological assessment to determine if formal consultation is needed when their actions could impact listed species. Consultation with FWS or NMFS ensures actions do not harm endangered species or critical habitat, known as Section 7 consultation. This includes any activity authorized, funded, or carried out by a federal agency. The Endangered Species Act requires federal agencies to consult with FWS or NMFS to ensure actions do not harm listed species or critical habitat. If an action is found to not jeopardize species or habitat, a biological opinion is issued with conditions for the action to proceed. If harm is likely, alternatives must be suggested to avoid harm. The BiOp is based on the best available scientific and commercial data. The Endangered Species Act requires federal agencies to consult with FWS or NMFS to ensure actions do not harm listed species or critical habitat. Consultations must be based on the best available scientific and commercial data, with the majority resulting in \"no jeopardy\" opinions or suggesting reasonable alternatives for projects to proceed. Timelines for consultations vary depending on whether the action is wholly federal or involves nonfederal parties. The Endangered Species Act requires federal agencies to consult with FWS or NMFS to ensure actions do not harm listed species or critical habitat. Formal consultation may take a year or more and if no alternatives are feasible, the agency must forego the action, risk penalties, or obtain an exemption. The \"God Squad\" decides on exemptions for specific actions, not species. The \"God Squad\" decides on exemptions for specific actions under the Endangered Species Act, requiring at least five votes to pass. The six federal officials involved include the Secretaries of the Interior, Agriculture, and the Army, the Chair of the Council of Economic Advisors, and the Administrators of NOAA and the EPA. The law outlines rules and deadlines for applying for exemptions, with stringent criteria for approval. The ESC must grant an exemption if deemed necessary for national security by the Secretary of Defense, and the President may also exempt projects in disaster areas. The \"God Squad\" decides on exemptions for specific actions under the Endangered Species Act, requiring at least five votes to pass. To be eligible for an exemption, federal agencies must have carried out consultation processes required under the ESA in good faith and made efforts to develop alternatives that would not harm endangered species or critical habitats. Additionally, agencies must refrain from irreversible commitments of resources. The \"God Squad\" decides on exemptions under the Endangered Species Act, requiring at least five votes. Federal agencies must consult in good faith, develop alternatives, and avoid irreversible commitments of resources. The ESC grants exemptions if no alternatives exist, benefits outweigh risks, and the action is in the public interest. Additional requirements are in relevant regulations. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) allows for exemptions in specific circumstances, such as when the action is of regional or national significance and in the public interest. Special provisions apply in cases involving international treaty obligations, national security, and presidentially declared disasters. The exemption process is complex and can take up to 280 days, with decisions made by the \"God Squad\" requiring at least five votes. The process of obtaining an exemption from the Endangered Species Act (ESA) can be challenging and costly for applicants. The funding obligation for mitigation measures can last indefinitely, and the burden of conservation and recovery may shift to other areas. Exemptions only apply to the specific action, not the species as a whole, which can create obstacles for governors trying to balance various statutory obligations. The consultation process offers federal agencies opportunities to modify actions to avoid jeopardizing species or habitats while still proceeding. Private parties without federal nexus may obtain permits to take listed species. The Secretary may issue permits for \"incidental take\" of species for lawful actions without federal nexus, requiring an applicant to submit a habitat conservation plan. The use of this provision expanded in the 1990s, with streamlined procedures for minimal impact activities. Other provisions include exemptions for raptors, regulations for Alaskan Natives, and rules for trade in endangered species. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) prohibits various acts such as taking endangered species, possessing or selling unlawfully taken species, and violating regulations by FWS or NMFS. Threatened species receive similar protections as endangered species. Prohibited acts apply broadly to individuals under US jurisdiction, with exceptions outlined in sections 9 and 10, including for incidental take. Section 11 of the ESA provides exceptions for incidental take permits and civil penalties for violations, with higher fines for knowing violators. Criminal violations may also apply. Enforcement provisions allow any person to bring a lawsuit in federal court to enjoin violators, including governmental entities. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) allows any person, including governmental entities, to sue in district court to enforce ESA provisions or compel the Secretary to perform duties. Written notice must be given 60 days before suing. The court can award litigation costs and attorneys' fees. Citizen suits have driven efforts to conserve species, with studies showing citizen proposals often focus on species at greater risk than those proposed by the Fish and Wildlife Service. The article presented data supporting the thesis that citizen proposals for listings often involve species in conflict with development. ESA citizen suits challenging listing delays are a significant number of lawsuits against FWS and NMFS. The ESA implements CITES and the Western Hemisphere Convention for the United States, focusing on listing and protecting species. CITES categorizes species based on extinction risk and trade, while the ESA also addresses habitat loss. Violations of CITES are violations of U.S. law under the ESA. The ESA implements CITES and the Western Hemisphere Convention for the United States, focusing on listing and protecting species. The ESA designates the Secretary of the Interior as the Endangered Species Scientific Authority (ESSA) specified under CITES to control international wildlife trade and protect wildlife. The Secretary of the Interior, as the Endangered Species Scientific Authority (ESSA) under CITES, enforces export determinations based on biological information. The Management Authority must ensure legal export and import of specimens, as well as suitable conditions for live specimens. The ESA prohibits importing or exporting listed species, with exceptions granted by the Secretary. The ESA allows exceptions for import/export for scientific purposes or species survival. Importers/exporters of fish/wildlife need permission, records, inspections, and designated ports. The ESC made decisions on exemptions for Grayrocks Dam impacting whooping cranes. FWS assessed Grayrocks Dam's impact on endangered species. The Endangered Species Committee (ESC) granted an exemption for the Grayrocks Dam and Reservoir in Wyoming, despite concerns about its impact on whooping crane habitat. Mitigation measures were imposed, including the maintenance of critical crane habitat on the Platte River and the establishment of a trust fund for these activities. In contrast, the Tellico Dam on the Little Tennessee River faced opposition due to its impact on the endangered snail darter, leading to litigation to halt its construction. The Supreme Court case TVA v. Hill clarified the broad reach of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and its relationship to public works projects. Congress passed P.L. 95-632, creating an ESC process with an automatic exemption for dams if no decision was reached within a specified time. Despite the ESC denying an exemption for the Tellico Dam, Congress directed its completion in P.L. 96-69. Additional snail darters were found, leading to their reclassification as threatened. The Bureau of Land Management sought exemptions for Oregon timber sales in the habitat of the northern spotted owl. In 1992, the ESC granted exemptions for 13 sales, which were later withdrawn in the Clinton Administration. Other exemption applications, such as the Pittston Company Refinery and Consolidated Grain and Barge Company Docking Area, faced challenges related to endangered species. In Mound City, IL, a company sought an exemption for a barge docking area on the Ohio River, habitat for an endangered mussel. The Army Corps of Engineers denied permits, leading to the withdrawal of the application in 1986. Similarly, in Suwanee Sound, Florida, an engineer applied for an exemption to dredge Alligator Pass, a habitat for endangered manatees. The Army Corps of Engineers also denied this permit, and the application was withdrawn in 1986."
