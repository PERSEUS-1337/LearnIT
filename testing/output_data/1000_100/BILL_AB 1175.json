Section 9873 of the Business and Professions Code in California is amended to set fees for electronic and appliance repair industry service dealers. The initial registration fee is $205 for each place of business for electronic and appliance repair dealers, and $95 for service contractors. The initial registration fees for electronic and appliance repair industry service dealers in California vary based on the type of business. For those engaging in both industries, the fee is $500 per place of business. Service contractors pay $300 for either electronic or appliance repair, and $405 for both. Service dealers or contractors in the electronic or appliance repair industry operating in California, even without a physical location in the state, must pay registration fees as if they had a place of business there.

The annual renewal fee for service dealers in California who engage in both electronic and appliance repair industries is $400 per place of business. For service dealers who are also service contractors, the fee is $475 per place of business. Service dealers or contractors without a physical location in the state must pay registration fees as if they had a place of business in California. The delinquency fee is 50 percent of the renewal fee for a license, with exceptions. This section is in effect until January 1, 2019, unless extended. The director cannot increase any fee before January 1, 2017. Fees in the Business and Professions Code are set by the director according to a schedule.
