    "content": "In recent years, there has been interest in increasing financial support for non-degree instructional and work-based learning programs for individuals beyond high school age. These programs include apprenticeships, college certificate programs, and courses leading to professional certificates or licensure. There is a demand for workers in jobs that do not require a college degree but need training or postsecondary education, such as skilled electrical work and health care support services. There is a growing demand for workers in jobs that do not require a college degree but need training or postsecondary education. Despite the availability of over $100 billion in federal financial aid for postsecondary education, a significant proportion of individuals pursuing non-degree programs do not have access to these funds. Some colleges are exploring creative approaches to increase enrollment, including offering short programs for quick reentry into the workforce. Congress may need to consider providing direct federal support to students pursuing postsecondary non-degree credentials. Congress may consider providing direct federal support to students pursuing non-degree programs, with proposals to increase Pell Grants for short-term education. The College Affordability Act aims to expand Pell Grant eligibility for non-degree programs. The President's Council of Economic Advisers suggested options to reskill individuals for the changing economy and boost economic growth. The President's FY2021 budget proposed expanding Pell Grants to short-term programs not currently eligible, supported by education and business organizations. Concerns exist about promoting non-degree programs and their impact on employment and earnings compared to high school completion. Some concerns about expanding Pell Grants to non-degree programs include ensuring program quality, high federal costs, need for student supports, business coordination, and potential perpetuation of income inequalities. Questions also arise about diminishing labor market returns for some non-degree programs and employer preferences for degree holders. Non-degree credential holders may face challenges in securing employment due to the preference for degree holders. Federal programs support individuals in non-degree training and education programs. Employer demand for non-degree program completers is discussed in the report. The report discusses employer demand for non-degree program completers and describes federal programs and tax benefits that provide financial support for individuals pursuing non-degree training and education programs. Key details include program descriptions, limitations, eligibility requirements, and federal oversight. The report highlights the importance of non-degree programs in meeting employer needs and boosting economic growth. Data shows that 6.2% of jobs in the national economy require a non-degree postsecondary credential. This section provides insight into the market for non-degree credentials but does not cover all labor market returns and social impacts. Statistics (BLS) assigns typical entry-level education requirements for tracked occupations, with mean annual wages varying across education categories. Research shows earnings premiums for individuals with long-term certificates, technical certificates, health certificates, field-specific certificates, and community college certificates. Postsecondary non-degree programs offer valuable training and education. Postsecondary non-degree programs provide specialized training for individuals beyond typical secondary education age, preparing them for specific occupations. These programs combine postsecondary courses to fulfill educational or professional goals without earning a degree upon completion. Non-degree instructional programs offer specialized training for various jobs and general employment. Individuals receive a postsecondary educational certificate upon completion, which signifies the successful finish of the program. These programs are pursued for reasons such as expanding knowledge and skills, preparing for further education, employment, or promotion. Transfer programs, which do not lead to certificates or degrees but provide education for at least two academic years, are excluded from non-degree instructional programs. Non-degree instructional programs offer specialized training for various jobs and general employment. These programs are not to be confused with certifications and licenses, which are occupational credentials awarded by entities that assess competency. Non-degree instructional programs are offered by a variety of entities, including traditional postsecondary educational institutions, trade schools, and businesses. In fall 2018, almost 3,000 institutions of higher education enrolled nearly 1.9 million non-degree seeking undergraduate students. Non-degree instructional programs are offered by various entities such as businesses, organizations, and governments. These programs vary in length, ranging from a few days to over two years, depending on curriculum requirements and industry expectations. Program duration may also be influenced by federal, state, and private entities that set minimum educational hours for employment eligibility or certification. Additionally, programs may be designed in stackable units for flexibility. The overall program duration can be divided into stackable units for flexibility. Programs can be offered in various formats and students are responsible for funding the program costs. The average cost for tuition and fees varies depending on the type of college. Non-degree instructional programs can be credit-based or structured as noncredit courses. Credit courses can be transferred for further education, while noncredit courses do not offer this option. Credit programs have stricter requirements and lead to various vocations. Noncredit programs may offer vocational certificates but do not provide a pathway to credit programs. Noncredit programs offer a more affordable and flexible option for students, covering a wide range of topics and catering to industry and student needs. These programs can satisfy career entry requirements, provide adult basic education, ESL instruction, personal enrichment, and customized training. Enrollment data from nine colleges showed that 38% of enrollments were in noncredit courses, including vocational, ABE, ESL, and GED programs. National data on non-degree programs is incomplete due to some states and the federal government not collecting data on noncredit programs. The 2016 nationwide survey found that 8% of adults aged 16-65 had a postsecondary certificate. HEA Title IV institutions awarded almost 1 million for-credit non-degree undergraduate credentials and 3 million undergraduate degrees in AY2017-2018. Work-based learning imparts workplace skills through training at an employer's worksite or simulated location. Work-based learning encompasses various forms such as OJT, apprenticeships, internships, and earn and learn programs, with RA programs being a unique form overseen by the DOL. These programs must meet federal regulations and include a work process schedule outlining occupation competencies. Work-based learning programs must meet federal regulations and have a process schedule outlining occupation competencies. The registration agency reviews programs every five years for compliance, and deregisters if there is persistent failure. Various entities can offer work-based learning experiences, including employers, labor unions, training providers, educational institutions, or partnerships. Work-based learning programs are structured to meet the needs of employers, potential employers, or trainees. Summer internships can provide informal or formal training opportunities. Registered Apprenticeship (RA) programs require at least 2,000 hours of supervised on-the-job training and typically last four years. Programs can be time-based or competency-based, or a hybrid of both approaches. All RA program designs must include specific skill attainment verification. The costs of work-based learning programs are primarily borne by the provider, with trainees potentially covering living costs. Program costs may include fees for trainers, trainee wages, and lost work time. Trainees may need to pay for related instruction or other expenses. Data on work-based or employer-provided training are limited and vary in methodology and purpose. The data on employer-provided training is limited and varies in methodology and purpose. Surveys show that while most establishments offer some form of training, the percentage of workers receiving training ranges from 16% to 70%. A 2016 survey found that 21% of adults aged 16-65 had completed work-based learning programs, with healthcare and teaching being the most common fields. The Department of Labor reported approximately 633,000 active apprentices in about 25,000 programs in FY2019. In FY2019, there were approximately 633,000 active apprentices in 25,000 programs, with 81,000 completing a program. The construction industry has the largest share of apprenticeships, but they are also available in manufacturing and transportation. Federal programs provide financial support for training and education, though none focus solely on non-degree programs. The federal programs and benefits, such as WIOA Title I, federal student aid programs, federal tax benefits, and veterans educational assistance, differ in the design and monitoring of non-degree programs. WIOA Title I, administered by the Department of Labor, supports workforce development by subsidizing training costs. Federal student aid programs, under the Higher Education Act, provide grants and loans for postsecondary education. The IRS administers tax benefits under the Internal Revenue Code. The IRS administers tax benefits under the Internal Revenue Code, providing financial support for post-education. The Department of Veterans Affairs offers programs like the Post-9/11 GI Bill and VET TEC for educational and training support. Other programs like SNAP E&T and TANF provide education and training opportunities for individuals in need. The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, administered by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), allows states to use funds for workforce training and education. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) is the primary federal legislation for workforce development, aiming to coordinate federal programs. Services under WIOA focus on increasing employment and retention. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) aims to increase employment, retention, and earnings of participants, improve workforce quality, reduce welfare dependency, and meet employer skill requirements. The Adult and Dislocated Worker Employment and Training Activities program provides formula grants to states for local Workforce Development Boards to establish One-Stop delivery systems, provide career and training services, build relationships with employers, and develop industry partnerships. The WIOA program offers consumer choice to participants through career services and training. Career services include basic and individualized assistance, while training can be pursued at eligible training providers listed on the ETPL. ETPs include institutions offering programs leading to recognized credentials. The WIOA program allows participants to choose from various training programs offered by eligible training providers. These programs lead to recognized postsecondary credentials and include non-degree and degree instructional programs, work-based learning opportunities like OJT and customized training. Training must be for in-demand occupations in the local area or region, or areas with high growth potential. Training services provided by ETPs lead to industry-recognized certificates, licenses, or associate degrees. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) allows individuals to access career services without needing to meet specific qualifications. Training programs offered by eligible providers lead to recognized credentials and include work-based learning opportunities. Up to 20% of funds can be reserved for incumbent worker training. Individualized career services are provided to help individuals obtain and retain employment. Eligibility for training is based on the inability to secure or maintain employment. To access training services under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), individuals must demonstrate the need for economic self-sufficiency, possess the necessary skills for training, choose a program linked to local job opportunities, and not be eligible for other grant assistance. One-Stop operators evaluate and assess individuals to determine eligibility for training services provided by designated organizations. Under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), priority for career and training services is given to recipients of public assistance, low-income individuals, and those with basic skills deficiencies. Local Workforce Development Boards, in consultation with the state governor, determine how to allocate funds among these groups. Training can be provided through Individual Training Accounts (ITAs) or contracts for services, with funds also allowed for supportive services like child care and transportation. Eligibility for training services is determined by One-Stop operators. Under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), individuals can choose training services from the ETPL through an Individual Training Account (ITA) established by the One-Stop operator. Local Workforce Development Boards can set limits on training type, duration, and ITA amounts based on individual circumstances. ITA funds can be used for non-degree programs, degree programs, and related instruction. Supportive services like transportation, child care, housing, and needs-related payments can also be provided to enable participation in training. Training can be provided through the ITA model or contracts for services by local WDBs. Under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), individuals can choose training services through an Individual Training Account (ITA) established by the One-Stop operator. Local Workforce Development Boards can provide training through contracts for services, including work-based learning. The contract is an agreement between the local WDB and an employer or RA sponsor for occupational training for a WIOA participant in exchange for reimbursement. Various types of training services can be contracted, such as OJT, RA, customized training, incumbent worker training, or transitional employment, based on specific criteria determined by the local WDB. Under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), training services can be provided through contracts for services, such as OJT or RA, with reimbursement rates up to 50% or 75% in limited circumstances. State and local Workforce Development Boards (WDBs) may also contract with RA sponsors to reimburse up to 75% of an apprentice's wages. Quality assurance of training providers is ensured through eligibility processes established by the governor and state WDB. Administrative structures and procedures for training programs vary by state. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) establishes criteria and procedures for eligible training providers to receive funding in local workforce investment areas. RA programs are automatically eligible, while non-RA providers must apply for initial eligibility. Existing providers must follow procedures to maintain eligibility, with local WDBs having discretion on specific factors like the duration of OJT contracts. The WIOA requires local WDBs to determine the length of OJT contracts and consider individual characteristics for employer eligibility. ETPs and states must report program participation and outcomes, while RA programs are exempt from ETP performance reporting. Providers must submit performance and cost information every two years for continued eligibility under WIOA Title I. The WIOA requires states to publish annual ETP performance reports, including data on program participants' earnings, credential attainment, cost of attendance, and completion rates. Governors may request additional performance information as needed. States must disaggregate the data by program type. The WIOA requires states to publish annual ETP performance reports with data on program participants' training services, including total number of participants, exits, average cost per participant, and number of participants with barriers to employment. Data must be disaggregated by program type, entity providing training, and demographics. The first report is pending, but some participation data is available, showing 955,094 adult participants and 469,572 in work-based learning in 2017. The most recent data (2017) shows 955,094 adult participants and 469,572 dislocated worker participants in WIOA programs. The majority are age 30 and over, unemployed, and have no postsecondary education. 22% of adults and 34% of dislocated workers have a degree. Fewer than 20% engage in work-based learning, while over 66% pursue skills training or upgrading through non-degree programs with ITAs. Popular occupations pursued include healthcare, transportation, and production. The WIOA Title I program supports adult entry or reentry into the workforce by providing career services and short-term training. Popular occupations pursued by dislocated workers include transportation, computer, office support, and management. Recommendations to enhance support for non-degree training include increasing access to training, dedicating additional funding for wage reimbursement, relaxing limits on incumbent training, and removing restrictions on obtaining other grant assistance. The curr_chunk discusses the potential elimination of restrictions on recipients of training services obtaining other grant assistance, such as Pell Grants, to allow programs to supplement each other. It also mentions the varying quality of non-degree programs due to state and local flexibility in developing the ETPL. Title IV of the Higher Education Act authorizes financial assistance programs for students at certain institutions, administered by the Department of Education, including Pell Grants and federal student loans. These programs aim to promote access, affordability, and completion of higher education. The Pell Grant and Direct Loan programs provide portable aid to eligible individuals, regardless of congressional appropriations. The Direct Loan program is a mandatory entitlement program, while the Pell Grant program is considered a quasi-entitlement. Both programs can be used to pursue Title IV-eligible education. Title IV-eligible programs, offered by participating institutions, include non-degree and degree programs. These programs must meet quality assurance criteria. Non-degree programs must lead to a recognized credential. Title IV aid is not available for noncredit programs. Non-degree programs must lead to a recognized credential. Title IV aid is generally not available for noncredit programs or programs without a defined number of credit or clock hours. For work-based learning programs measured in clock hours, the OJT portion must be supervised by an IHE. Non-degree programs have specific durational requirements, including weeks of instructional time and credit or clock hours. Pell Grants for non-degree programs require at least 15 weeks of instructional time and 600 clock hours, 16 semester hours, or 24 quarter hours. Non-degree programs at public and private nonprofit institutions must meet specific durational requirements, including instructional time and clock hours. For the Direct Loan program, non-degree programs must be at least 10 weeks long with 300-599 clock hours. Students must be enrolled at least half-time to borrow through this program. Non-degree programs leading to a certificate are eligible for Pell Grants and Direct Loans regardless of durational requirements. To be eligible for Title IV funds for higher education, students must be enrolled in a Title IV-eligible program and meet citizenship and education criteria. Pell Grants require undergraduate enrollment, not having completed a bachelor's degree, and demonstrating financial need. The Direct Loan program offers loans to students based on specific criteria, including enrollment on at least a half-time basis. There are different types of loans available, such as Direct Subsidized Loans for undergraduates with financial need, Direct Unsubsidized Loans for any student, and PLUS Loans for parents or graduate students. New borrowers after July 1, 2013, have restrictions on the amount they can borrow. The Direct Loan program offers various types of loans based on specific criteria, including enrollment on at least a half-time basis. New borrowers after July 1, 2013, have restrictions on the amount they can borrow, with Direct Subsidized Loans for undergraduates with financial need. Title IV aid eligibility is guided by statutory award rules, with aid typically not exceeding a student's cost of attendance (COA). Pell Grant awards are determined without considering other financial assistance a student may receive. For the award year 2020-2021, the maximum Pell Grant award for a full-time student is $6,345, which may be adjusted based on various factors. Pell Grants used for non-degree programs are subject to income taxation, while those for degree programs are taxed only if not used for tuition and fees. Direct Loan program rules vary by loan type, and other factors can impact aid eligibility and amount. The Direct Loan program has specific rules and limits for awarding loans based on dependency status and class level. For example, dependent undergraduate students can borrow up to $5,500 in loans for the first year, while independent undergraduates can borrow up to $9,500. The maximum loan amount is prorated for shorter academic programs. The Office of Federal Student Aid administers Title IV aid programs. The Office of Federal Student Aid administers Title IV aid programs, with FSA handling high-level functions and IHEs managing day-to-day tasks like awarding and disbursing aid to students. IHEs verify eligibility, calculate aid amounts, disburse funds, and manage program funds. ED provides funds to IHEs for disbursement and pays an administrative cost allowance under the Pell Grant program. Under the Pell Grant program, ED pays IHEs an administrative cost allowance. HEA provisions ensure quality of Title IV-eligible programs and IHEs. The program integrity triad - state authorization, accreditation, and ED certification - balances Title IV eligibility requirements. State authorization provides consumer protection, accreditation ensures quality, and ED certification oversees compliance. Non-degree programs may need to meet gainful employment requirements. State approval and licensure requirements for Title IV-eligible programs vary among states, with some states approving individual educational programs while others only require approval of the institution as a whole. States evaluate program curricula, objectives, enrollment projections, student outcomes, and program need differently. Some states also require programmatic accreditation or separate approval by another state. To participate in Title IV programs, an IHE must be accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by ED. Accrediting agencies review educational institutions and programs, evaluating criteria such as faculty, curricula, facilities, and student support services. Regional or national accreditation is typically sufficient for Title IV eligibility. Accrediting agencies evaluate an IHE's performance based on criteria like curricula, facilities, and student support services. Programmatic accreditation is not necessary for Title IV eligibility but can be sought for employer and licensure requirements. When seeking Title IV participation, an IHE must apply for certification from ED to ensure compliance. When applying for Title IV eligibility, an IHE must seek certification from ED to meet participation requirements. ED evaluates each program to ensure it meets eligibility criteria, such as completion and placement rates. Non-degree programs must prepare students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation as per HEA regulations. The 2014 GE regulations, which defined gainful employment in a recognized occupation, were rescinded in 2019. These regulations aimed to measure program quality by setting debt-to-earnings rates for programs. Programs failing to meet standards may lose Title IV eligibility. No program has lost eligibility yet. Programs subject to GE rules must also meet third-party standards like accreditation. The Higher Education Act (HEA) requires Title IV participating institutions to meet certain criteria, such as accreditation, state recognition, and meeting educational prerequisites for licensure. The HEA does not define performance measures for Title IV programs but mandates reporting on enrollment, degrees awarded, student charges, and other relevant information. Additionally, the Department of Education collects data on non-degree instructional for-credit programs annually. In AY2017-2018, 4,618 Title IV-participating IHEs offered non-degree for-credit programs, with public IHEs awarding over two-thirds of the credentials. In AY2015-2016, 765,000 Pell Grant recipients pursued non-degree credit programs, receiving $2.7 billion in Pell Grant awards. Approximately 10% of undergraduates with Direct Loans were pursuing certificate programs. Title IV aid supports individuals in credit programs of specified duration. Support for work-based learning in non-degree programs at Title IV-participating IHEs is limited to programs leading to a certificate or degree. Some students, such as those without a high school diploma or enrolled less than half-time, may not be eligible. Quality assessment of non-degree programs is primarily done through state authorizers and accreditors, with flexibility in criteria application. Few reports have examined state authorization requirements. Few reports have examined state authorization requirements, noting the variation among states as a complicating factor. Researchers have identified potential weaknesses in some states' authorization requirements, such as oversight issues and conflicts of interest. The accreditation system has strengths and weaknesses related to program quality. Institutional accreditors tailor peer reviews based on school type and mission, while programmatic accreditation is aligned with specific fields. Special interests and input requirements may hinder innovative education models, and state authorization processes can be delayed due to complex regulations or lack of resources. Conflicts in state laws arise when institutions offer programs in multiple states, and few states base authorization renewal decisions on student outcomes. Programmatic accreditation is aligned with specific fields, but potential weaknesses include conflicting interests, insufficient resources, and difficulty in assessing innovative education models. Education tax benefits, administered by the IRS, offset some higher education costs for eligible taxpayers, mainly benefiting upper middle-income taxpayers when they file their federal income tax return. Education tax benefits are claimed by taxpayers when filing their federal income tax return, providing a tax benefit after paying for education expenses. These benefits are available to individuals in degree programs and some non-degree programs, reducing federal revenues rather than increasing outlays. They are considered a form of \"spending through the tax code\" and are not subject to annual appropriations, available to those who meet the eligibility requirements. Education tax benefits, such as the Lifetime Learning Credit and 529 accounts, provide financial assistance for education expenses. Taxpayers in non-degree programs can benefit from these incentives, including employer-provided educational assistance. These benefits aim to support families in saving for future educational expenses at Title IV-eligible institutions. Expenses for non-degree programs at Title IV-eligible IHEs may be eligible for employer-provided educational assistance. Qualified education expenses for the Lifetime Learning Credit include tuition, books, supplies, and equipment required for enrollment. These expenses must be reduced by any tax-free educational assistance used. The LLC covers courses for post-secondary degrees or job skill improvement. Employer-provided educational assistance can be used for non-degree programs to acquire or improve job skills. The assistance covers tuition, fees, books, supplies, and equipment for any form of instruction. Payments can be made for courses that are not work-related or part of a degree program, up to $5,250 without being included in the employee's wage income. Tax-free withdrawals from 529 accounts are allowed for qualified expenses, including tuition, fees, room and board, books, supplies, and equipment at a Title IV-eligible institution. To qualify for tax benefits related to educational expenses, participants must file a federal income tax return or be claimed as a dependent or spouse. Taxpayers can claim the credit for education expenses paid for themselves, spouses, or dependent children. Certain eligibility criteria apply, such as income thresholds and filing status. Employers must offer an educational assistance program for participants to utilize this tax benefit. Beneficiaries of a 529 account are designated at the time of establishment. Individuals can apply for the LLC when filing their federal income tax return after incurring qualified educational expenses. The LLC is calculated as 20% of the first $10,000 of qualified education expenses, with a maximum credit of $2,000 per taxpayer. The credit phases out for taxpayers with income between $58,000 and $68,000 ($116,000 and $136,000 for married joint filers) in 2019. The credit is nonrefundable and cannot exceed the taxpayer's federal income tax liability. Taxpayers with low federal income tax liability may not benefit from non-refundable tax credits like the LLC. Employers can offer up to $5,250 in tax-free tuition assistance per year. Withdrawals from 529 accounts for education expenses are tax-free, with restrictions. Taxpayers can transfer funds between 529 accounts of certain relatives tax-free. The IRS relies on taxpayers, employers, and states for compliance. Taxpayers can apply for the Lifetime Learning Credit (LLC) by filing their federal income tax return and Form 8863. Employers must have a written plan to offer tax-free tuition assistance. The IRS does not require funding or approval for employer educational assistance programs. Under IRC Section 601.201, employers can request IRS determination on qualified programs. 529 plans are sponsored by states, allowing individuals to establish accounts for beneficiaries. Withdrawals from 529 plans result in a Form 1099-Q detailing total amount withdrawn and investment breakdown. Eligible employees must receive notice of program terms. Taxpayers who withdraw funds from 529 plans must be aware that using the withdrawal for non-eligible expenses may result in a portion being subject to federal income tax. Documentation of how the withdrawal is spent is not required unless audited. The IRS does not have specific rules regarding the quality of training and education programs for tax benefits. Limited IRS data shows that in 2015, approximately 2.5 million taxpayers claimed around $2.1 billion of the LLC tax credit. Approximately half of all LLC dollars were claimed by taxpayers with adjusted gross income between $50,000 and $200,000, with an average credit of $830 per taxpayer. Taxpayers with AGI below $15,000 or over $200,000 generally did not claim the LLC due to nonrefundability and phase-out. No studies have evaluated the impact of the LLC on enrollment in non-degree programs or its effectiveness in improving job skills. Data on employer provided educational assistance and 529 plans are unavailable for analysis. Survey data analyzed by GAO shows that few families establish 529 plans, with those who do having higher assets and income. Limited studies have evaluated the impact of 529 plans on non-degree program enrollment or job skill improvement. Education tax benefits, including 529 plans, may have limitations in assisting students with upfront costs and may be confusing due to various benefits available. Veterans education programs like GI Bills aim to help former servicemembers transition to civilian life by providing various benefits. These benefits have evolved over time to address different needs such as compulsory service, voluntary service, veteran unemployment, equitable benefits for all who served, and military retention. VET TEC is an alternative approach to incentivize training providers for program completion and employment, separate from the GI Bill. Both programs provide financial assistance to students enrolled in approved education programs based on qualifying service. The Post-9/11 GI Bill and VET TEC are primarily administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs, with the Post-9/11 GI Bill representing the majority of participation and spending. The Post-9/11 GI Bill represents the majority of GI Bill participation and spending since FY2013. Benefits support education through degree pursuit, training, and non-degree programs at various institutions. VET TEC benefits are available for training programs. VET TEC benefits are available for non-degree high-technology programs at contracted training providers. Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits are for eligible servicemembers and veterans, not based on family income levels. Eligibility requires meeting active duty service requirements. To be eligible for VET TEC, an individual must be a GI Bill-eligible veteran enrolled full-time in a VET TEC-eligible program. VET TEC participants may or may not be recipients of GI Bill benefits. Both the Post-9/11 GI Bill and VET TEC provide living stipend payments directly to participants and payments to providers for direct program costs. Eligible individuals may also apply for personalized counseling to help guide their career paths and achieve their goals. The Post-9/11 GI Bill provides educational assistance payments over 36 months, with benefits based on qualifying active duty service. Different payment amounts and eligibility criteria apply based on benefit level, type of program, enrollment rate, charges, location, and mode of education delivery. Transfer of benefits requires sharing entitlement. The Post-9/11 GI Bill provides educational assistance payments for tuition, fees, housing, books, and supplies to eligible individuals enrolled in education or training programs. Veterans may receive up to $24,476.79 for tuition and fees, monthly housing allowances ranging from $800 to $4,300, and up to $1,000 for books and supplies. Those in OJT or apprenticeship programs receive a decreasing housing allowance to offset wage increases. Under VET TEC, veterans receive payments for training from the VA. They get a monthly housing allowance while enrolled full-time, similar to the Post-9/11 GI Bill. The VA reimburses training providers for tuition and fees, paying 25% upon enrollment, 25% upon completion, and 50% upon employment in a suitable field. Participants apply to the VA for eligibility and can enroll in approved programs without paying tuition directly. The VA oversees enrollment and payments for approved training programs. Program quality is monitored by state approving agencies for GI Bill programs and participant employment outcomes for VET TEC programs. The VA and SAAs share oversight responsibilities. The VA and state approving agencies oversee program quality and approval for GI Bill programs. Standards are in place to ensure the quality of education and proper administration of benefits, including program objectives, independent study restrictions, the 85-15 rule, and contractual arrangement restrictions. Under the 85-15 rule, no more than 85% of students in a program can have tuition covered by institutional aid or GI Bill. Additional requirements vary based on program type, such as non-degree programs needing adequate facilities and qualified instructors. Programs for state licensure must meet specific instructional standards. The VA sets standards for education programs to be eligible for VET TEC, including faculty qualifications and curriculum requirements. Payment structure ensures program quality and value by reimbursing providers upon completion. The VET TEC program reimburses training providers for veterans who find meaningful employment within 180 days of program completion. Quality requirements include licensing, the 85-15 rule, and non-self-paced programs. The VA reports annually on the qualifications earned by Post-9/11 GI Bill participants to assess program effectiveness. Performance measures include program admittance rate and job placement for completers. In addition to program admittance rate and job placement for completers, other performance measures for Post-9/11 GI Bill participants include job retention rates, median annual salary, transfer rates, and types of programs pursued. GI Bill participants mostly pursue degree programs, with a small percentage pursuing educational certificates or on-the-job training. Flight schools are among the approved training establishments for GI Bill purposes. Based on data from December 2019, over 18,000 school locations, almost 500 flight school locations, and over 9,000 OJT/apprenticeship locations approved for GI Bill purposes did not award degrees. The most popular certificates completed by Post-9/11 GI Bill participants in AY2018-2019 were in welding, information technology, HVAC, healthcare, and gunsmithing. Program eligibility is limited to uniformed services members and their families, with concerns raised about program quality oversight. The 2018 GAO and VA OIG reports highlighted limitations in oversight of SAA funding and SNAP program administration. SNAP provides benefits for eligible low-income households to purchase food, with additional funding for employment and education services. States receive SNAP Employment & Training funding for non-degree programs. SNAP E&T, established in 1987, aims to help SNAP participants gain skills for employment. States can choose to make their E&T programs mandatory or voluntary. Each state administering SNAP is required to implement an E&T program. SNAP E&T programs can be mandatory or voluntary. Most state agencies operate voluntary programs, offering components like job search, training, workfare, education, and more. Funding includes $124 million without a state match and federal matching for administrative expenses. Total funding varies yearly based on state usage. The USDA-FNS, in partnership with Seattle Jobs Initiative, has been operating SNAP to Skills since October 2015. This project aims to provide technical assistance and resources to build effective SNAP E&T programs. It requires integration between the WIOA Title I program and SNAP E&T, with services delivered through the statewide workforce development system. Recipients can access services through WIOA One-Stop centers, but SNAP staff are experienced in addressing the unique challenges of E&T recipients. Staff have experience addressing the unique challenges of E&T recipients, such as low basic skills, housing instability, and mental health issues. SNAP E&T programs can provide certain education activities to improve employability, including high school or equivalent educational programs, remedial education programs, and instructional programs in English as a second language. Only educational components that directly enhance employability are allowable, with a direct link between education and job-readiness required for approval. SNAP E&T education activities must be directly linked to employment to be approved. States may fund non-degree programs for SNAP participants. Common education activities include vocational training and basic education. SNAP E&T may offer work experience, apprenticeships, subsidized employment, and unpaid internships. Eligibility for SNAP includes income and nonfinancial requirements. To be financially eligible for SNAP, household income must be at or below 130% of the federal poverty level. Work requirements are in place for non-disabled adults, who must register for work and not reduce their work below 30 hours per week. States may design SNAP E&T programs to focus on a subset of the work registrant population and make participation mandatory. The process of assigning individuals to E&T programs varies, with USDA guidance requiring state agencies to assess participants for effective components. The 2018 farm bill mandates states to provide case management services. E&T funds cannot be used for TANF recipients, and some IHE students may be ineligible for SNAP unless enrolled through specified programs like WIOA Title I. SNAP E&T funds cover education costs, including dependent care and transportation. States often partner with third parties like community colleges to administer the program and draw down federal funds. The E&T program allows for federal funds to reimburse partners for program expenses, with funding varying based on the source. Pell Grants must be the primary payer for college expenses, with E&T covering remaining costs. Expenses must be reasonable, and other funding sources should be explored before using E&T funds for tuition. Workforce partnerships were added to the program in 2018, including private employers, nonprofits, and training providers. The SNAP E&T program is designed by states within federal rules and approved by USDA-FNS. State programs vary in capacity and services offered. Changes made by the 2018 farm bill require consultation with state workforce development boards or private employers. Participants learn about programs through SNAP state agencies or partner referrals. States monitor provider and program quality. The 2014 farm bill required USDA to establish performance indicators reporting for SNAP E&T participants. The national reporting measures include unsubsidized employment, median quarterly wages, completion of educational components, and more. USDA has not yet published a compilation of the reports. According to USDA-FNS FY2016 data, 38 of 53 SNAP state agencies provided education in their E&T program, serving almost 70,000 participants. Some states served fewer than 100 participants, while others served nearly 100,000. Less than 10% of SNAP E&T participants receive education, with no information available on program quality. An evaluation on the 2014 farm bill pilot projects may provide future guidance. The 2014 farm bill pilot projects may inform future guidance and policymaking. Wages earned through SNAP E&T may increase household income, potentially reducing eligibility for SNAP and SNAP E&T. The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families block grant aims to provide assistance to needy families with children, promote work, reduce out-of-wedlock pregnancies, and support two-parent families. States have flexibility in using TANF funds to achieve its statutory purpose. TANF is administered by HHS and is a mandatory spending program. TANF is a broad-purpose block grant program administered by HHS that provides monthly assistance to needy families with children. It allows states to use funds for various benefits and services, including subsidized employment and education programs like career pathways. One state program uses TANF funds to pay coordinators at a community college who serve as case managers for students, providing access to support services and work-study jobs. TANF allows states to decide on eligible vocational education programs for low-income families with children. Financial eligibility rules vary by state. TANF funds state assistance programs for needy families with children, with eligibility and benefit amounts determined by states. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 requires funds to be spent as determined by state legislatures. Adult recipients may be required to participate in activities, but there is no federal requirement for different benefit amounts based on training and education status. TANF provides funding for benefits and support services, including cash assistance, training, education, career planning, and employment services. States determine eligibility and services for participants, with some referring recipients to WIOA One Stop Centers for education or employment. States have the option to run employment and training services for TANF recipients separately from the WIOA system. Federal rules do not govern the quality of training and education programs, leaving it up to states to establish such rules. The minimum work participation rate (WPR) is the sole performance measure for TANF, requiring each state to meet a standard that a minimum percentage of its assistance caseload must be working or engaged in activities. Rules limit training and education, with vocational training capped at 12 months in a lifetime. States can also reduce the cash assistance caseload to meet the minimum work participation rate. Data on TANF participation is limited. The TANF cash assistance caseload faces limitations in education and training opportunities, with a focus on single mothers with young children. States can use TANF funds for child care assistance, but there are restrictions on vocational training duration and income eligibility for certain programs. The quality of training and education programs available to TANF recipients is also uncertain."
