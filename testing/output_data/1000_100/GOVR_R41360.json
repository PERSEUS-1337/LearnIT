    "content": "One of the most controversial issues in U.S. foreign assistance is restrictions on funding for abortion and family planning activities abroad. The debate revolves around whether recipients of U.S. aid perform abortions or coercive sterilization with U.S. funds, and the impact of withholding funds on population growth and reproductive health services in developing countries. Congressional debates on these issues have been ongoing since the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling. The Constitution protects a woman's right to choose abortion, leading to ongoing debates in Congress on prohibiting abortion and restricting federal funding for it. The controversy has extended to U.S. foreign assistance, resulting in restrictions on abortion and family planning activities abroad. President Reagan issued policies on international abortion restrictions in 1984. In 1984, President Reagan implemented the \"Mexico City policy,\" requiring foreign NGOs receiving USAID family planning assistance to certify no promotion of abortion. The policy has been rescinded and reinstated by different Administrations, most recently by President Trump in 2017. Congress continues to debate abortion and family planning restrictions in foreign operations legislation. The report examines legislative and executive branch policies on U.S. funding of abortion and family planning activities abroad, including the Mexico City policy. Congressional interest in these issues is expected to continue in the next session. Legislation authorizing foreign aid, such as the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, covers various types of assistance like development, military aid, and debt reduction. Some provisions are named after lawmakers or address specific issues like involuntary sterilization. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 has been routinely amended by Congress since its inception, but comprehensive reauthorization has not occurred since 1985. Authorization bills have faced challenges due to debates on controversial issues, tight legislative schedules, and foreign policy disputes. In the absence of regular reauthorizations, Congress annually considers appropriations measures that influence how U.S. foreign aid is distributed, often including restrictions on family planning and abortion. The complex links among various family planning and abortion-related restrictions and requirements in U.S. legislation are detailed. Amendments like the Helms and Biden provisions are added for emphasis, while others clarify existing restrictions. The Leahy amendment defines terms, and the Livingston amendment clarifies prohibitions. This section outlines legislative restrictions on U.S. funding of abortion. The Helms amendment, enacted in 1973, prohibits the use of U.S. foreign assistance funds for abortions or to coerce individuals to have abortions. It applies to all foreign assistance activities authorized by the FAA. The Helms amendment, enacted in 1973, prohibits the use of U.S. foreign assistance funds for abortions or coercion. It applies to all foreign assistance activities authorized by the FAA, including development assistance. The FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act includes the Helms amendment in two sections, ensuring that foreign assistance activities are not used for involuntary sterilizations or coercion. The FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act includes a provision prohibiting the use of funds for involuntary sterilizations or coercion in foreign assistance activities. This restriction has been in place since FY1979 to prevent Peace Corps funding from being used for abortions. The FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act prohibits the use of funds for abortions for Peace Corps volunteers, except in cases of rape, incest, or endangerment to the mother's life. Medical evacuation costs for abortions are covered by the Peace Corps. Additionally, the United States is restricted from providing foreign assistance for biomedical research related to abortion or involuntary sterilization. The Biden amendment prohibits the use of funds for biomedical research related to abortion or involuntary sterilization in foreign assistance activities. Representative Mark Siljander introduced an amendment in 1981 to prevent the use of U.S. funds for lobbying for abortion. The Siljander amendment, included in annual foreign operations appropriations acts, prohibits the use of U.S. funds to lobby for or against abortion. Congress enacted a provision in 1985 specifying that U.S. funding for family planning projects must offer a range of services. The DeConcini amendment, enacted in response to a Reagan Administration policy, requires that U.S. funding for family planning projects offer a broad range of services to reduce reliance on abortion in developing nations. This provision has been included in annual foreign operations appropriations legislation since 1985, most recently in the FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act. The Programs Appropriations Act prohibits funds under part I of the FAA from being used in any country or organization if the President certifies that the funds would violate the Helms, Biden, or involuntary sterilization amendments. This provision is included in the FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act. The Kemp-Kasten amendment, introduced in 1985, prohibits funds from being used for organizations supporting coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization. This measure was included in the FY1985 Supplemental Appropriations Act due to concerns about the UNFPA's program in China. The Kemp-Kasten amendment, introduced in 1985, prohibits funds for organizations supporting coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization. It has been included in annual foreign operations appropriations legislation since FY1985. A determination has only been made regarding UNFPA. The provision is included in the FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act, stating any determination must be made within 6 months. The United States has not contributed to UNFPA in 16 of the past 34 years due to violations in China. The Obama Administration supported U.S. funding for UNFPA, highlighting the President's commitment to international family planning and women's health. Currently, the U.S. is not providing funding to UNFPA under Kemp-Kasten due to concerns about coercive practices in China. Congress has enacted conditions for U.S. funding of UNFPA, with recent legislation transferring funds to the Global Health Programs account if not allocated to UNFPA. The act imposed conditions on U.S. funding for UNFPA, including restrictions on funding for a country program in China, segregation of funds, and a prohibition on funding abortions. The Secretary of State must report on funds withheld and budgeting for China programs. The Livingston amendment introduced in 1986 prohibits discrimination based on religious beliefs in awarding grants for natural family planning under the Foreign Assistance Act. It is related to the DeConcini amendment, which mandates that family planning projects funded by the United States offer a range of services. The DeConcini amendment mandates that US-funded family planning projects offer a range of services, without discrimination against natural family planning methods. The Leahy amendment clarifies language in the Helms amendment regarding the use of funds for family planning services. The Leahy provision clarifies that funds cannot be used for abortions as a method of family planning or to coerce individuals. It ensures that providing information or counseling about all pregnancy options is not prohibited by the Helms amendment. The Tiahrt amendment, enacted in FY1999, directs voluntary family planning projects to comply with specific requirements, including no quotas or numerical targets. It has been included in foreign operations appropriations annually since then. The project must not have quotas or numerical targets for the total number of births or family planning acceptors. Incentives or financial rewards cannot be given for accepting family planning services, and individuals cannot be denied benefits for choosing not to accept these services. The project must provide family planning acceptors with information on health benefits and risks of chosen methods, ensure experimental contraceptives are only used in scientific studies, and report violations to the Committees on International Development. In response to reports of forced sterilizations in Peru, Representative Tiahrt introduced an amendment to prevent U.S. foreign assistance from supporting such practices. USAID issued guidance on implementing the amendment's requirements for voluntary family planning projects in April 1999. The Tiahrt amendment was enacted to prevent violations in Peru, Guatemala, and the Philippines. A 2007 audit found no further violations. The amendment was included in the FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act, applying to family planning assistance. Executive branch policies include the Mexico City policy and USAID Policy Determination 3 on voluntary sterilization. The Mexico City policy, implemented through executive branch actions, restricts U.S. family planning assistance to foreign NGOs involved in voluntary abortion activities. Republicans generally support the policy, while Democrats oppose it. The Trump Administration recently expanded the policy to include all global health assistance. The policy was first issued by President Reagan in 1984 and has remained a controversial issue in U.S. foreign assistance. In 1984, the Helms amendment and other restrictions prohibited the use of U.S. funds for abortion as a family planning method. Foreign NGOs receiving USAID grants could use their own funds for abortion-related activities if legal, but had to keep separate accounts for U.S. money to show compliance. This policy, initiated by President Reagan, required written certification from foreign NGOs that they would not perform or promote abortion. The Mexico City policy, initiated by President Reagan, prohibited the use of U.S. funds for abortion as a family planning method. President George H. W. Bush maintained the policy, President Clinton rescinded it in 1993, and President George W. Bush reinstated and expanded it in 2001. President Obama revoked the policy in 2009, citing overly broad conditions on grants. In January 2017, President Trump reinstated the Mexico City policy, expanding it to include global health assistance. The policy directs that U.S. taxpayer dollars should not fund organizations supporting coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization. The Trump Administration's expanded policy, \"Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance\" (PLGHA), was approved in May 2017. It applies to $8.8 billion in funding for international health programs, excluding assistance to governments and humanitarian activities. Exemptions include rape, incest, and certain conditions. The Trump Administration's expanded policy, \"Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance\" (PLGHA), approved in May 2017, includes exemptions for rape, incest, and conditions threatening the mother's life. A six-month review in May 2018 highlighted challenges and the need for better understanding and compliance with the policy among recipients. The Trump Administration's expanded policy, \"Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance\" (PLGHA), includes exemptions for certain cases. Many organizations seek clarification on terms related to PLGHA. USAID issued Policy Determination 3 (PD-3) on voluntary sterilization in 1982 to ensure protection of individuals' needs and rights. PD-3 outlines requirements for USAID-funded voluntary sterilization services, including informed consent. A further review of implementation is planned by December 15, 2018. PD-3 outlines requirements for USAID-funded voluntary sterilization services, ensuring informed consent and no incentive payments for acceptors. Financial structures should not create incentives for sterilization over other methods. Payment guidelines for service acceptors, providers, and referral agents are also provided. Incentives for voluntary sterilization services must be \"reasonable\" based on country- and program-specific circumstances. VS acceptors can receive compensation for extra expenses, VS service providers can receive per-case payment and compensation for related items, and VS service referral agents can receive per-case payment for informing or referring clients. PD-3 applies to family planning assistance funded by USAID, covering U.S. NGOs, foreign NGOs, public international organizations, and governments."
