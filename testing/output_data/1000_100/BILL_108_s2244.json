    "content": "The bill is titled the \"Freedom to Fish Act\" and includes findings related to fishing rights. Congress finds that recreational fishing is a popular outdoor sport with over 50 million participants nationwide, contributing $116 billion annually to the economy and supporting over 1.2 million jobs. Recreational anglers also play a vital role in conservation efforts. Recreational anglers contribute over $500 million annually to State fisheries conservation programs. Federal policy allows public access to public lands for recreational purposes while maintaining fishery resources through various management measures. A clear policy is needed to manage recreational fishing effectively, including implementing measures such as take limits, minimum size requirements, and closed seasons. Additionally, a comprehensive policy on marine protected areas is necessary to balance recreational fishing with sustaining fishery resources. The United States policy aims to conserve fishery resources by ensuring access for recreational anglers, involving them in regulatory procedures, and imposing limitations only when scientifically necessary. Amendments to the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act are also proposed. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act is amended to limit closures of geographic areas for recreational fishing unless it is proven to be causing a specific conservation issue in the fishery. Alternative conservation measures must be considered before implementing a closure, and specific criteria for assessing the benefits of the prohibition must be included in the management plan. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act requires periodic reviews to assess the need for area closures in recreational fishing. The best available scientific information must support the closure, and it should be terminated once the conservation issue no longer exists. Technical amendments are made to ensure clarity in the text. SEC. 5. NATIONAL MARINE SANCTUARIES ACT AMENDMENT. Section 304(a)(5) of the National Marine Sanctuaries Act is amended to allow Regional Fishery Management Councils to draft fishing regulations within the exclusive economic zone, in accordance with the Magnuson Act, even within state boundaries. The Secretary may regulate a fishery in a State if the Governor approves or if the State's actions will adversely affect the goals of the Act. Notification and a hearing are required. The Secretary can regulate a fishery in a State if the Governor approves or if the State's actions will adversely affect the Act's goals. Notification and a hearing are required for the Secretary to regulate a fishery within the State's boundaries. The Secretary can regulate a fishery in a State if the Governor approves or if the State's actions will adversely affect the Act's goals. The State involved can apply to the Secretary for reinstatement of its authority over the fishery if the Secretary assumes responsibility for regulation. If the reasons for assuming regulation no longer prevail, the Secretary shall promptly terminate such regulation."
