    "content": "P.L. 106-554, signed in December 2000, enacted H.R. 5658 for Treasury and General Government Appropriations in 2001. Funding was provided for various accounts, including the General Services Administration and the Executive Residence. P.L. 106-346 (H.R. 4475) partially funded select accounts from the primary funding measure. In FY2001, various measures were enacted to fund affected accounts, including H.R. 4871, S. 2900, H.R. 4516, H.R. 4985, P.L. 106-346, P.L. 106-275, P.L. 106-426, P.L. 106-520, and P.L. 106-554. These measures provided funding for the Treasury and General Government, with specific provisions for the presidential transition and White House moving expenses. In FY2001, funding for various accounts including Treasury and General Government was provided through measures like H.R. 4871, S. 2900, and P.L. 106-554. The President submits the Budget of the United States Government annually to Congress, with budgetary levels set by a concurrent resolution. Congress then allocates discretionary funding levels to subcommittees. Appropriations for the Department of the Treasury fund law enforcement organizations like the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, Customs Service, Secret Service, and others. The U.S. Postal Service is mostly self-supporting, with limited federal contributions for specific services. Treasury appropriations also cover agencies like the Internal Revenue Service and the Bureau of the Public Debt. Appropriations for the Executive Office of the President fund various agencies including the Council of Economic Advisers, National Security Council, and Office of National Drug Control Policy. Independent agencies like the Federal Election Commission and General Services Administration are also funded through this appropriation. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2001 includes general titles with governmentwide restrictions and authorities for defined actions, such as prohibiting the use of funds for non-U.S. citizens, maintaining drug-free workplaces, and authorizing travel expenses for federal employees' immediate family members. New provisions in titles V and VI are presented in the act. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2001, P.L. 106-554, includes a 0.22% across-the-board rescission of FY2001 discretionary budget authority and obligation limitations funds affecting all accounts in the Treasury and General Government appropriations. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) must report on the implementation of the rescission when the FY2002 budget is submitted. The rescission applies to all net positive discretionary budget authority and obligation limitations, including advance appropriations for FY 2001 provided in FY 2000 or earlier years. Discretionary emergency appropriations are also subject to the rescission. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2001 includes a 0.22% across-the-board rescission of FY2001 discretionary budget authority and obligation limitations funds affecting all accounts. Programs, projects, and activities subject to the rescission must be reduced by 0.22% equally. Agencies will receive their rescission amounts by account from OMB and must allocate the reduction pro-rata to every program, project, and activity. The FY2000 Consolidated Appropriations Act mandated a 0.38% across-the-board rescission of discretionary budget authority. OMB reported specific reductions in accounts, allowing departments flexibility to protect high-priority programs as long as the 0.38% reduction target was met. The FY2000 Consolidated Appropriations Act required a 0.38% across-the-board rescission of discretionary budget authority. Certain conditions were met to achieve this figure. The FY2001 rescission provisions exempt specific programs but are universally applied otherwise. The FY2001 Military Construction Appropriations Act includes provisions for FY2000 Supplemental funding. Some accounts covered by the Treasury/Postal Service measure are affected. The term \"net\" in this report refers to FY2000 appropriated levels reduced by the rescinded amount and supplemental funding. Table 4 summarizes FY2000 enacted funding and House and Senate reported or passed funding for FY2001 enacted. The FY2000 enacted funding levels reflect rescissions and supplemental funding. Legislative measures were introduced for FY2001 appropriations, including H.R. 4871 passing the House and S. 2900 being reported by the Senate Committee on Appropriations. H.R. 4985 was included in the Legislative Branch appropriations conference agreement, which was vetoed. P.L. 106-346 partially funded selected Treasury and General Government accounts. Title V of H.R. 4475 and P.L. 106-554 (H.R. 4577) funded Treasury and General Government accounts. The House passed H.R. 4871 on July 20, 2000, by a vote of 216-202. The Senate held hearings on S. 2900 for FY2001 appropriations. The government held hearings in February, March, and April.

Most accounts were funded at FY2000 levels through continuing resolutions, with new FY2001 accounts receiving no funding until November 3, 2000. The White House was authorized to use funds for preparations involved in the transfer of families during the transition through the 16th continuing funding resolution, P.L. 106-520. The Transportation FY2001 appropriation, H.R. 4475, was agreed upon by the conference committee on October 5.

The Department of the Treasury carries out financial and law enforcement functions through various agencies. The Department of Treasury includes agencies like the Secret Service, ATF, and IRS, with the IRS receiving the largest funding. The FY2001 budget request includes a potential reduction of $30 million. The FY2001 budget request for the Department of Treasury includes a reduction of approximately $30 million. The request aims to double funding for department-wide systems and capital investments, increase funding for the Money Laundering Strategy, interagency crime and drug enforcement, and Secret Service, ATF, and Customs Service. The IRS would see a 10% increase in funding. The House Appropriations committee reported H.R. 4871 providing $13.225 billion for the department. The House passed H.R. 4871, providing $13.225 billion for the Department of Treasury. The bill includes funding reductions for the Office of the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration and the IRS Processing Assistance and Management Account. Additionally, the Senate's S. 2900 proposed $13.161 billion for the department, while a vetoed Legislative Branch conference agreement would have funded the Department at $13.598 billion. The IRS would receive $8.639 billion, or 63% of the total departmental funding. Additional funding for some Department of Treasury accounts was provided through the Department of Transportation funding bill (P.L. 106-346). The Department of Transportation funding bill (P.L. 106-346) allocates funds for various accounts, including establishing a new interagency National Terrorist Asset Tracking Center, increasing staff in the Office of Foreign Assets Control, and implementing a centralized vehicle acquisition program. Additional funding is provided for Department-wide systems and capital investments programs, Expanded Access to Financial Services, and Federal Law Enforcement initiatives such as a metropolitan area law enforcement training center. The Department of Transportation funding bill includes $25 million for the design and construction of a metropolitan area law enforcement training center. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) regulates alcohol, tobacco, firearms, and explosives, with a focus on reducing crime, collecting revenue, and protecting the public. In FY1999, ATF collected $12.1 billion in taxes, penalties, and fines. In FY1999, ATF collected $12.1 billion in taxes, penalties, and fines. Congress increased ATF's direct appropriations from $336 million to $604 million from FY1992 to FY2000. For FY2001, Congress appropriated $772 million for ATF, including funding for salaries, expenses, and counter-terrorism. The Legislative Branch conference agreement would have provided $768 million for ATF. The House bill (H.R. 4871) allocated $731,325,000 to ATF, while the Senate version (S. 2900) allocated $724,937,000. The administration's FY2001 request included $105,298,000 for program budget increases, such as the Integrated Violence Reduction Strategy, Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative, gun tracing, ballistic imaging, tobacco compliance, and ATF headquarters relocation. Congress provided an additional $41,322,000 to expand the Integrated Violence Reduction Strategy, funding 224 agents, 112 inspectors, and 59 support staff. Total funding for IVRS will be $62,200,000. ATF's FY2001 budget submission outlined plans to intensify local firearm initiatives, review FBI referrals for prohibited persons obtaining firearms, investigate multiple attempts by prohibited persons to purchase firearms, review federal firearm licensees' records, and expand the Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative to 12 additional cities with $19,078,000 in funding from Congress. In FY2001, Congress allocated $19,078,000 to ATF for the Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative (YCGII), expanding it to 50 cities with 72 agents and 98 inspectors. Additionally, $16 million was provided for the Gang Resistance Education and Training (GREAT) program, and $9,990,000 for the Comprehensive Crime Gun Tracing Initiative. Total funding for these initiatives reached $25,000,000. Total funding for the Expanded Ballistics Identification Initiative has been increased to $26,400,000 with an additional $23,361,000 allocated by Congress. The ATF and FBI signed a memorandum of understanding to further develop the Integrated Ballistics Identification System (IBIS) for comparing images of ballistic evidence. Funding was also provided for the national laboratory transition and relocation of the ATF headquarters. The ATF requested funding for the Tobacco Compliance/Diversion initiative and additional positions, but it was not granted by Congress. The increase in funding was needed to monitor new permit and revenue requirements for importers of tobacco products. The regulation and enforcement of laws related to firearms commerce and possession have been controversial, with language in bills prohibiting preferences for manufacturers or vendors who enter agreements with federal departments. The Smith & Wesson Corporation entered into an agreement with HUD for firearms regulation, but the language was not included in the enacted legislation. The U.S. Customs Service regulates the movement of goods and people between the U.S. and other countries. In FY1999, Customs collected $22.4 billion in trade-related duties, taxes, and fees. Congress increased direct appropriations for the U.S. Customs Service from $1.45 billion to $1.93 billion from FY1992 to FY2000. In FY2001, Congress appropriated $2.28 billion for Customs, an 18% increase over FY2000. Additional funding was provided for counter-terrorism.

Congress also allocated $258,400,000 for the modernization of Customs' automated systems, which is $80,000,000 less than the Administration's projected fee receipts. Additionally, $3,000,000 in offsetting fee receipts were provided for the harbor maintenance fee account. The vetoed Legislative Branch appropriations conference agreement would have provided Customs with $1,863,725,000. The conference agreement for Customs funding in FY2001 would have provided $1,863,725,000, with specific allocations for air and marine interdiction. The Administration's budget request included enhancements for drug investigations, illicit proceeds strategy, forced child labor, and airborne support for the Secret Service. The remaining $119,188,000 in increased funding for Customs was requested for various budget adjustments to maintain current service levels. Earmarks included $13,700,000 for the Southwest border, $10,000,000 for northern border security, $11,000,000 for vehicle replacement, $3,700,000 for money laundering, $9,500,000 for drug investigations, and $5,000,000 for forced child labor initiative. The House bill earmarked $9,500,000 for drug investigations and $2,000,000 for forced child labor. Customs' Automated Commercial System (ACS) has been inadequate and suffered from \"brownouts\" hindering international commerce. Congress has provided funding for Customs to upgrade ACS and develop its replacement, the Automated Commercial Environment (ACE). However, Customs has struggled with ACS upkeep and ACE development. Congress directed Customs to provide a revised blueprint, schedule, and budget for ACE in FY2000, but the report was delivered late. The Administration's FY2001 request included funding for Customs. The Administration's FY2001 request included a new Customs budget account for automation modernization, with a request for $338 million. Congress rejected a fee proposal and provided over $258 million in direct appropriations for the development of the Automated Commercial Environment (ACE). The total cost of ACE development, operation, and maintenance over 7 years is estimated to be between $1.4 and $1.8 billion. Customs will begin taking bids to develop the new ACE system in FY2001, with estimated costs between $1.4 and $1.8 billion over 7 years. GAO has noted Customs' efforts to implement recommendations, cautioning that ACE development is complex and high-risk but crucial for revenue collection. Customs also generates receipts from user fee programs established by COBRA and the Tax Reform Act. Customs generates receipts from user fee programs established by COBRA and the Tax Reform Act, with COBRA fee receipts increasing significantly from FY1992 to FY2000. These receipts are not appropriated by Congress and fund a substantial portion of Customs' yearly expenditures, with limitations on their use. Surplus revenues are carried over to fund recurring costs, such as overtime for inspectors and canine enforcement officers. Customs relies on COBRA fee receipts to fund inspector positions and information technology costs. However, there has been a recent drop-off in air passenger processing fee receipts, which may lead to funding issues for Customs officers' overtime. Additionally, the authorization for COBRA fees expires at the end of FY2003. The IRS FY2001 request was $8,986,084,000, representing a 9.36% increase over FY2000 funding. The IRS budget request in the consolidated funding act is 12.78% higher than the net funding for FY2000. The focus is on maintaining current operations and modernization, including additional staffing for enforcement and customer service. H.R. 4871 would fund IRS programs at $8.453 billion, with a net increase of $236.5 million. Amendments were adopted to reduce funding for certain accounts to offset funding for the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas program. The Senate Appropriations Committee increased funding for the IRS by $950,000 to create a pilot project for checking radioactive materials in imported scrap metal. IRS funding would total $8.535 billion, with higher levels for most accounts compared to the House. The vetoed conference agreement maintained the final version, with FY2001 IRS funding being a major point of objection. The FY2001 IRS funding was a major point of objection during the consideration of the Legislative Branch Appropriations. Despite partial funding in P.L. 106-346, the President vetoed the bill on October 30. The IRS supplemental provisions included delaying the implementation of an Internet tax filing service and allocating $7.974 million for Tax Law Enforcement. The IRS funding for FY2001 raised concerns in Congress, with allocations for Tax Law Enforcement and Information Technology Investments. A new account of $141 million was proposed for Staff Tax Administration for Balance and Equity, with a staffing plan required for approval. The STABLE initiative aims to improve taxpayer service and statutory mandates, with a significant increase in staffing for Tax Law Enforcement. The STABLE initiative aims to increase full-time equivalent staffing by 158 (41.6%) for auditing, enforcement, and customer relations at the IRS. H.R. 4985 does not provide funding for this initiative, but the Tax Law Enforcement account will be fully funded to maintain current service levels. The President requested $829.5 million for the Secret Service in FY2001, with $824.5 million for salaries and expenses and $5 million for acquisition and construction costs. In FY2000, the Secret Service received $691.5 million in net funding.

L. 106-58 provided $93.4 million for revenue foregone in FY2000, with $29 million available during that year. The FY2000 appropriation was reduced by .38% to $93.1 million due to a mandated across-the-board cut. P.L. 106-554 provided $29 million for FY2001 with an advance appropriation of $67.1 million for FY2002. The rescission of .22% only applies to FY2001 funding, affecting funds appropriated in FY2000 for use in FY2001.

H.R. 4871 would have allocated $10,286,470 for operating expenses but denied funding for additional FTEs and some repair projects. The House Appropriation Committee recommended denying funds for renovation and replacement of the concrete raceway due to concerns over project costs. S. 2900 and H.R. 4516/H.R. 4985 would have funded accounts at requested levels, with limitations on repair and restoration funding. This includes funds for design and replacement of the concrete raceway serving the East Wing and Executive Residence. The FY2001 funding resolution authorizes expenditures for transition and moving expenses at the White House. Maintenance and repair costs for the White House are funded by the National Park Service, while entertainment costs for state functions are funded by the Department of State. Political events in the Executive Residence are reimbursable. The Department of State requires advance payment for reimbursable political events in the Executive Residence. The President's political party must deposit $25,000 for expenses related to such events. Reimbursements must be separately accounted for and sponsoring organizations billed.

H.R. 4475 conference report was approved by the House and Senate, signed into law as P.L. 106-346. P.L. 106-275 funds government programs at FY2000 levels for those not funded through regular FY2001 appropriations. Subsequent to the passage of P.L. 106-275, there were 20 additional continuing funding resolutions for FY2001, most of which amend P.L. 106-275 to provide daily continuations. One account funded specifically in the November 3 CR (P.L. 106-426) is for the General Services Administration to administer the presidential transition. Congress agreed to H.J.Res. 123 on November 2, which included $7.1 million from the vetoed legislation. The resolution was agreed to by a vote of 310 to 7, and the Senate agreed by unanimous consent. P.L. 106-520 (H.J.Res. 125) extends funding and authorizes expenditures for the Executive Residence at the White House. The Executive Residence at the White House was authorized to make expenditures for the transition and moving expenses following the 2000 election. The inclusion of funding provisions in the legislative branch appropriations caught many by surprise, with no minority signatures on the conference report. The debate in the House seemed to focus more on protocol than on the substance of the provisions. The House passed H.R. 4871 and the Senate began debate on that measure, along with their own version, S. 2900. H.R. 4985 had no committee or floor action. The House debated and agreed to a conference report on September 14, 2000, while the Senate rejected it on September 20 due to objections over funding levels for IRS accounts and courthouse construction. There were concerns about including provisions of a bill in the report introduced the day before, with spending levels exceeding those of the House and Senate versions. The funding levels in H.R. 4985, as introduced and in the conference report, differ from the House and Senate versions. The conference version would fund accounts at $30,309.5 million, lower than the FY2001 request of $31,208.4 million. Some accounts exceed the President's request and both House and Senate versions. The conference version of the funding levels in H.R. 4985 differs from the House and Senate versions. There are accounts that would exceed the President's request and both House and Senate versions, while others would match the President's request or be below it. In total, there are 17 accounts that would exceed both House and Senate versions, and 26 accounts where the conference version would exceed the funding level proposed by either the House or Senate. The conference funding levels in H.R. 4985 differ from the House and Senate versions. There are accounts where the funding level matches the President's request and others where it exceeds or falls below. In total, there are 17 accounts exceeding both House and Senate versions, and 26 accounts where the conference version surpasses either the House or Senate funding levels. Additionally, Section 515 of the Treasury and General Government provisions mandates guidelines to ensure the quality and integrity of information disseminated by federal agencies. The curr_chunk discusses guidelines for federal agencies to ensure the quality and integrity of information they disseminate, including statistical information. It also mentions the requirement for agencies to establish mechanisms for correcting inaccurate information and report complaints to the OMB director. Additionally, it notes that the repeal of the telephone excise tax is not part of the Treasury and General Government text. President Clinton vetoed H.R. 4516 on October 30, 2000, sending FY2001 funding for the legislative branch and Treasury and general government back to Congress. He cited unfinished business and prioritizing funding for classrooms, schools, and workers. The House discussed the veto the next day and referred it to the Committee on Appropriations. Press reports indicated the veto was related to a congressional pay raise, although the President's statement did not mention this issue. H.R. 4516 does not include a provision for a pay raise for federal white collar employees under the General Schedule. The pay adjustment is based on changes in private sector salaries reflected in the Employment Cost Index, with a base pay adjustment of 2.7% for January 2001. There are no legislative proposals to change this rate, and since the President did not submit an alternative plan, the base pay adjustment will remain at 2.7%. The basepay adjustment will be 2.7% by the end of August, with a budget recommendation for 3.7%. Locality-based payments are calculated based on surveys of occupations in specific localities within the United States. President Clinton sent an alternative plan to Congress for locality payments equal to 1% of payroll. The Federal Wage System compensates federal blue-collar workers at prevailing local wage rates. The Federal Wage System adjusts wage rates in over 130 areas based on labor costs in the private sector. Congress limits adjustments to prevent FWS wages from exceeding General Schedule salaries in high-cost areas. Pay adjustments for federal officials are also tied to ECI calculations. The ECI calculations dictate a 3% pay adjustment in January 2001 for federal officials, limited to the General Schedule base pay adjustment rate of 2.7%. Despite reports of a veto, a pay raise for Members of Congress would still go into effect automatically unless specifically denied in legislation. The pay increase for federal officials in January 2001 is authorized in the Commerce, State, Justice and Judiciary appropriation. The incoming President will receive a salary of $400,000 per annum. Section 630 of H.R. 5658 requires health insurance plans to cover prescription contraceptives. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) now includes coverage of prescription contraceptives under the prescription drug benefit, with exemptions for certain health maintenance organizations for religious reasons. The provision also prohibits discrimination against individuals who refuse to provide contraceptives based on religious beliefs or moral convictions. This requirement was first included in the FY1999 appropriations legislation and is similar to provisions in subsequent acts. Section 509 of H.R. 5658 prohibits funds from being used for abortions or administrative expenses in connection with health plans under FEHB, except in cases where the mother's health is endangered or in cases of rape. Section 513 exempts contracts under FEHBP from cost accounting standards. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 mandated a temporary increase in employee contributions to retirement plans, phased in over 3 years. Employee contributions to retirement plans increased by 0.25% on January 1, 1999, by 0.15% on January 1, 2000, and were set to rise by another 0.1% on January 1, 2001. Contributions reverted to previous levels on January 1, 2003. The higher contributions did not affect benefit accruals for federal employees. Legislation was proposed to repeal the increase in contributions, and eventually, the higher rates were repealed for all federal employees except Members of Congress. Law Enforcement members of the Washington Area Airport Authority were designated as eligible for benefits under CSRS or FERS. Law enforcement officers designated as eligible for retirement benefits under CSRS or FERS can receive an immediate, unreduced annuity at age 50 with 20 years of service. They must retire at age 57 or after 20 years of service. Contributions to the Thrift Savings Plan increased, with law enforcement officers contributing an additional 0.5% of pay. Under the FERS Act, federal employees can contribute up to 10% of pay to the Thrift Savings Plan, with annual increases allowed. Contributions for CSRS employees are limited to 5% of pay. The maximum employee contribution will increase annually for five years, with percentage-of-pay limitations eventually being eliminated. Employee contributions remain subject to IRS limits. Starting in May 2001, FERS employees can contribute up to 11 percent of pay. Starting May 15, 2001, FERS employees can contribute up to 11 percent of pay to the TSP, while CSRS employees can contribute up to 6 percent. Contribution limits will increase annually until reaching 15 percent for FERS and 10 percent for CSRS in fiscal year 2005. In fiscal 2006, the limits on TSP contributions will be abolished, and employees will be subject to IRC \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd 402(g) limits. Additionally, new provisions require criminal background checks for employees at federally-provided day care facilities. H.R. 4871, passed by the House in July 2000, allows executive branch agencies to use agency funds for child care services for civilian employees. Funds are used to make child care more affordable for lower-income federal employees. Payments to child care providers are made in advance for agreed-upon periods. The House passed H.R. 4871 in July 2000, allowing executive branch agencies to use funds for child care services for civilian employees to improve affordability. The bill included provisions for advance payments to child care providers and required criminal background checks for workers in federal child care centers. The Senate's bill, S. 2900, had similar language on affordability but did not include the timing of payments or background check requirements. The Branch Appropriations conference report included federal child care provisions identical to those in H.R. 4871, focusing on improving affordability and requiring background checks for child care workers. However, advance payment of salaries to providers was not included in the conference version. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees approved allocations for budget authority and outlays, with slight variations between the two chambers. The congressional numbers for budget authority and outlays are consistently lower than the requested funding. H.R. 5658, funded the Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government accounts at $30.31 billion. Mandatory accounts received $14.68 billion and discretionary accounts received $15.63 billion. Supplementary funding of $348 million was provided by P.L. 106-346. The total funding requested, before CBO scorekeeping, was $30.8 billion, while CBO calculated it at $31.2 billion. The Executive Office of the President, General Government, and Treasury appropriations for FY1996 to FY2000 were in billions of current dollars. The figures include CBO adjustments for budget authorities, rescissions, and supplementals. The appropriations for FY2001 were detailed in a table without CBO scorekeeping. The Conference Report on H.R. 4516 and H.R. 4577, along with funding information for H.R. 4475, are detailed in the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 2001 and the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Act, 2001. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2001 enacts the Treasury and General Government Appropriation (H.R. 5658) by reference. Funding details and accounts are provided in charts and tables. The curr_chunk provides detailed accounts of the Treasury and General Government appropriations, including funding information for H.R. 4475 and reductions pursuant to a rescission. Sources include the Conference Report on H.R. 4516 and H.R. 5658, as enacted through P.L. 106-554. Charts and tables display the funding details for these accounts. The curr_chunk discusses reductions in appropriated sums due to a rescission, with agencies having discretion on how to apply the reductions. It also mentions partial funding for selected accounts under the Department of Transportation Appropriation, 2001, and a continuing funding resolution authorizing funds for moving families to and from the White House, estimated at around $200,000. Key terms from the \"Glossary of Budgetary Terms\" are also included. Budget Authority is provided by law for obligations resulting in outlays. Forms include appropriations, borrowing authority, and contract authority. A Budget Resolution is a concurrent resolution setting forth the congressional budget for at least the next five fiscal years. The Budget Resolution outlines budget totals and allocations for at least five fiscal years. It may include reconciliation instructions for House or Senate committees. A Continuing Resolution provides temporary budget authority for programs without enacted appropriations. Direct Spending refers to budget authority provided in laws other than annual appropriations acts. Mandatory spending, also known as direct spending, is distinguished by the Budget Enforcement Act and subject to PAGO rules. It includes obligations and outlays, which are payments made to fulfill obligations. Federal funds encompass all government monies except trust funds. The Budget Enforcement Act established PAGO to prevent deficit increases or surplus reductions from revenue and direct spending legislation. PAGO requires offsets for any deficit increase or surplus reduction. The reconciliation process aligns tax and spending levels with budget resolutions. Revolving funds use income for operations without fiscal year limits. Scorekeeping tracks congressional budget status. Scorekeeping involves tracking and reporting on congressional budget actions affecting budget authority, receipts, outlays, surplus/deficit, and public debt limit. Supplemental Appropriation provides additional budget authority beyond regular appropriations. Trust Funds are designated accounts for specific purposes. User Fees are charges for government-provided goods/services.
