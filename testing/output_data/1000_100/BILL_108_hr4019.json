Congress finds that good health and access to high-quality health information and services are crucial for public health. Participation in international health cooperation is important due to the potential spread of infectious diseases like HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria. Taiwan, with a population of 23.5 million, has substantial achievements in the health field. Taiwan has achieved high life expectancy levels and low maternal and infant mortality rates comparable to western countries. They have eradicated infectious diseases like cholera, smallpox, the plague, and polio, and provide hepatitis B vaccinations to children. Taiwan collaborates closely with the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on public health issues and is willing to assist in international health activities supported by the WHO. On January 14, 2001, Taiwan sent rescue teams and relief aid to El Salvador after an earthquake. The World Health Assembly allows observers from various organizations to participate in its activities. The United States declared support for Taiwan's participation in international organizations in 1994. Public Law 106-137 mandated a report to Congress on supporting Taiwan's involvement in international organizations, specifically the WHO. President Bush advocated for Taiwan's voice to be heard in these organizations for contributions, even without full membership. Taiwan's participation in the WHO is seen as beneficial for global health. The US government supports Taiwan's efforts to gain observership status at the World Health Assembly, emphasizing the importance of public health for the people of Taiwan. The Government of Taiwan responds to appeals from the United Nations and the United States regarding its involvement in international organizations like the WHO. In response to appeals from the United Nations and the United States, Taiwan donated $1,000,000 to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria in December 2002. The outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 caused 84 deaths in Taiwan. Avian influenza, or bird flu, has reemerged in Asia, with strains reported by multiple countries. These outbreaks highlight the importance of global cooperation in addressing infectious diseases. The Secretary of State is authorized to endorse and obtain observer status for Taiwan at the World Health Assembly in Geneva, Switzerland, and introduce a resolution in support of Taiwan's observer status. The Secretary of State is required to submit a report to Congress detailing efforts to endorse Taiwan for observer status at the World Health Assembly in Geneva, Switzerland. This includes steps taken to promote Taiwan's bid and obtain observer status. The Secretary of State will take steps to endorse and obtain observer status for Taiwan at the next World Health Assembly in Geneva, Switzerland. The House of Representatives passed the bill on April 21, 2004."
