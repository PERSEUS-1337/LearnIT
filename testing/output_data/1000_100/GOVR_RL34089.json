    "content": "Both chambers of Congress passed legislation to reauthorize FDA programs and expand its authority for medical product safety. The bills, S. 1082 and H.R. 2900, are the most comprehensive FDA legislation since 1997. The primary focus is renewing FDA's authority for key user fee programs set to expire in FY2007. FDA urged Congress to complete reauthorization efforts before August 1, 2007. The FDA faced funding uncertainty leading to a hiring freeze and potential layoffs due to the expiration of key user fee programs. The bills also reauthorize other authorities related to pediatric pharmaceuticals and address various concerns of Congress and the public. The FDA, an agency under the Department of Health and Human Services, regulates the safety of human foods, animal feeds, cosmetics, drugs, biologics, medical devices, and animal drugs. Products must be reviewed and approved by the FDA before being placed in commerce. The agency has the authority to withdraw unsafe products from the market. The FDA's oversight of food safety, drugs, and medical devices has prompted congressional scrutiny of the agency's performance and funding. The 110th Congress is focused on balancing the need for timely market approval with product safety. Key issues include ensuring product safety, responding to health threats, and collecting user fees to expedite market access. Congress has passed measures authorizing FDA to collect user fees from manufacturers, with some questioning the agency's reliance on these fees. Efforts to reauthorize PDUFA and MDUFMA are underway, which generate a significant portion of FDA's revenue. PDUFA was enacted in 1992 and has been reauthorized twice. The FDA is authorized to collect fees from drug and biological product companies through PDUFA and medical device manufacturers through MDUFMA. These fees are used for the review of new product applications and to meet performance goals for reducing premarket review times. MDUFMA also introduced third-party inspections and new regulatory requirements for reprocessed single-use devices. The expiring authorities within MDUFMA are related to user fees and performance goals. In 1997, Congress gave FDA a tool, in BPCA, to encourage pediatric drug research\u2014extended marketing exclusivity in exchange for trials investigating a drug's effect on pediatric populations. FDA's attempts to require assessments of how new drugs would affect pediatric populations were stopped by the courts until Congress codified that requirement in PREA in 2003. BPCA and PREA provide marketing exclusivity incentives and requirements for studying pediatric use of both on - and off-label drugs. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 include provisions to incentivize manufacturers to develop pediatric medical devices and authorize the FDA to mandate postmarket studies for approved devices to ensure safety and efficacy. Developing medical devices for children is challenging due to lower demand and unique physical attributes, activities, and environmental factors compared to adults. There is a critical need for pediatric medical devices to diagnose and treat diseases in children. The provisions in S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to strengthen the FDA's system for monitoring adverse effects of medical products on the market. This includes collecting data, identifying situations requiring FDA action, and giving the FDA new authorities to enforce manufacturer actions. In 2004, concerns were raised about the safety and effectiveness of FDA-approved biomedical products with undisclosed negative trial results. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 include provisions for public registration and posting of clinical trial results to address this issue. FDA uses advisory committees for independent expert advice on related issues. Advisory committees provide independent advice to the FDA on drugs, devices, and food. Concerns about conflicts of interest among committee members have been raised. Legislation aims to address conflicts of interest. In 2004, there were concerns about undisclosed negative trial results for FDA-approved products. Legislation includes provisions for public registration of clinical trial results. The FDA investigated the decline in new drug submissions, calling for modernization of scientific tools and bioinformation utilization. Legislation proposes the creation of a nonprofit corporation to support FDA in these tasks. High prescription drug costs in the US have led some consumers to seek medications from foreign sources. Some lawmakers are trying to allow access to lower-priced medications by enabling individuals or commercial importers to purchase drugs from foreign sources while ensuring safety. S. 1082 includes a title that regulates importation of prescription drugs, but an amendment requiring the Secretary of HHS to certify safety and cost-effectiveness may nullify the detailed importation language. The FDA has had responsibility for regulating food safety since 1906, with evolving authority to address issues like foodborne illness outbreaks. Recent concerns have focused on both domestic and imported food products. S. 1082 addresses some food safety reform issues, but not all, in a comprehensive manner. The remaining sections of this report describe key FDA programs addressed in the bills, including prescription drug user fees, medical device user fees, pediatric drugs and devices, drug safety, clinical trials databases, conflicts of interest, importation of prescription drugs, and more. FDA's authority to collect user fees under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act will expire on October 1, 2007, unless Congress reauthorizes the program. PDUFA was established to shorten the time for FDA to approve new products by restricting funds to new product review and setting performance goals for review times. Reauthorizations in 1997 and 2002 allowed FDA to use some fees for postmarket drug safety activities. Discussions for a 2007 reauthorization focused on increasing postmarket drug safety. The 2007 PDUFA IV reauthorization focuses on postmarket drug safety, with both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 including the Prescription Drug User Fee Amendments of 2007. The bills would reauthorize the assessment, collection, and use of application, establishment, and product fees for prescription and nonprescription drugs. They would also increase requirements for adverse event reporting to the HHS Secretary and the public, with fee revenues set at $393 million annually. The House bills propose establishing fee revenues of $393 million annually with adjustments for inflation, workload, and rent costs. They would exempt orphan drugs marketed by small companies from certain fees and authorize fees for drug advertisement reviews. Manufacturer requests for advertisement reviews would be voluntary, with fees assessed only to those who request them. The Senate bill would codify these provisions. The Senate bill proposes codifying core elements of the prescription drug user fee program, including requiring annual reports to Congress and consultation with various stakeholders for PDUFA reauthorization. It also mandates a public hearing and review of performance goals set through negotiations with the industry. The House bill, like the Senate bill, proposes reauthorization and reporting requirements for user fees in the medical device review process. It also requires the Secretary to make negotiation minutes public before presenting recommendations to Congress. The FDA's authority to collect user fees for premarket reviews of medical devices is set to expire on October 1, 2007, unless reauthorized by Congress. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 propose reauthorization through FY2012. These bills also include other provisions related to the regulation of medical devices. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 propose reauthorization of FDA user fees for medical devices through FY2012. The bills include provisions to lower fee amounts for FY2008, with an 8.5% annual increase through FY2012, and introduce new types of fees. Government entities would be exempt from establishment fees, with H.R. 2900 extending this waiver to Indian tribes. The Secretary could increase the establishment fee in FY2010 by an additional 8.5% if fewer than 12,250 establishments paid the fee in FY2009. Both bills would require a certain amount of medical device-related direct appropriations for the Secretary to assess fees and meet performance goals. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 propose reauthorization of FDA user fees for medical devices through FY2012. The bills include provisions to lower fee amounts for FY2008, with an 8.5% annual increase through FY2012. H.R. 2900 would authorize specific sums for postmarket safety information review on medical devices. Both bills would eliminate the provision allowing the Secretary to adjust premarket notification fees annually to reach a target amount. Refunds or reductions in fees would be further reduced under both bills. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to reauthorize FDA user fees for medical devices through FY2012. They propose lower fees for small businesses, remove asset considerations for qualification, allow foreign firms to qualify, and establish a refund policy for withdrawn applications. The Secretary would have sole authority for refunds, annual reports are required, and H.R. 2900 includes postmarket safety activity information. S. 1082 mandates public reports on previous medical device application cohorts and integrates report requirements into the FFDCA. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to reauthorize FDA user fees for medical devices through FY2012. The bills require consultation with various groups, public comment periods, and public meetings. S. 1082 specifies revisions based on public comments, transmittal to Congress, and consultation requirements in the FFDCA. Effective dates differ between the bills, with H.R. 2900 taking effect upon enactment and S. 1082 on October 1, 2007. Other amendments related to medical device regulation are also included in both bills. The bills S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to reauthorize FDA user fees for medical devices through FY2012. They contain provisions for third-party review of premarket notifications and revisions to inspection requirements by accredited third parties. H.R. 2900 also includes a study on nosocomial infections related to medical devices. Both bills address required registration and compliance with international quality systems standards. Both bills, S. 1082 and H.R. 2900, aim to reauthorize FDA user fees for medical devices through FY2012. They include provisions for third-party review of premarket notifications, revisions to inspection requirements by accredited third parties, and a study on nosocomial infections related to medical devices. The bills would restrict the period for device producers to register with the Secretary to between October 1 and December 31 of each year, and amend electronic registration regulations to require electronic filing as a default. FDA has approved many products for adult use without testing in children, leading clinicians to prescribe them for younger patients based on adult safety and effectiveness data. The Better Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) incentivizes drug manufacturers to conduct pediatric studies by adding six months to market exclusivity for patented products. Off-label prescribing for children can lead to ineffective or harmful outcomes due to unique side effects and variations in drug metabolism based on age and development. The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) requires pediatric studies for off-patent drugs and authorizes NIH funding for these studies. It also reauthorized exclusivity provisions for on-patent drugs and mandated pediatric testing data submission for new drug applications. The Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003 (PREA) gave FDA authority to require pediatric assessments for drugs and biological products. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to reauthorize the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) for another five years, with provisions for research on off-patent products and reporting adverse events. The bills differ on the period of exclusivity, with H.R. 2900 maintaining the current six-month provision and S. 1082 proposing a reduction. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to reauthorize the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) and the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA). S. 1082 proposes reducing the exclusivity period for drugs with over $1 billion in annual sales, while H.R. 2900 maintains the current six-month provision. The bills also differ on the connection between PREA's authorities and BPCA authorization. Additionally, both bills include provisions to encourage medical device manufacturers to develop pediatric products. The Pediatric Medical Device Safety and Improvement Act of 2007 aims to amend the humanitarian device exemption (HDE) under the FFDCA to encourage manufacturers to develop medical devices for small patient populations without having to prove effectiveness. This exemption helps patients with rare diseases by waiving certain fees and allowing manufacturers to sell devices above production costs. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to extend the new exemption for pediatric medical devices. They both require the NIH Director to designate a contact point for funding and the FDA Commissioner to submit a plan for expanding pediatric device research. Additionally, both bills mandate the Secretary to establish a demonstration project to promote pediatric device development. Grant funds will be used to connect innovators with manufacturers, manage device development, connect innovators to federal resources, and provide business assistance. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to expand pediatric device research and development by requiring coordination with NIH and FDA, reporting effectiveness annually, and authorizing $6 million for demonstration grants. They also amend BPCA to include pediatric medical devices, require postmarket surveillance measures, and empower the Secretary to mandate postmarket studies. H.R. 2900 expands the Secretary's authority for postmarket studies on pediatric medical devices, including devices indicated for pediatric populations and those expected to have significant use in pediatric populations. It allows studies to exceed the general 36-month limitation if needed to assess the impact on pediatric growth and development. The bill also includes a dispute resolution provision for manufacturers requesting a review, during which the device may not be deemed misbranded except to protect public health. The FDA cannot guarantee the complete safety of any drug, as rare adverse effects may not be detected until a large number of people have taken it. The focus remains on premarket review to ensure drugs are safe enough for their intended use. Recent research has shown that some widely used drugs may be more dangerous than previously thought. The FDA faced challenges with drug safety, leading to questions about industry transparency and FDA's ability to address postmarket safety concerns. In response, the Institute of Medicine conducted a 2006 report on FDA's organizational culture, science, regulation, communication, and resources. Legislation such as S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aimed to enhance FDA's authority in identifying and correcting postmarket drug safety issues. The Senate and House bills propose establishing public-private partnerships to develop a postmarket risk identification system using electronic databases. They aim to strengthen FDA's authority in conducting postmarket safety activities through a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS). The House and Senate bills propose establishing a REMS for drug and biologic applications to evaluate and mitigate serious risks. The House bill focuses on pre-approval criteria, while the Senate bill emphasizes signals of serious risks post-approval. The House and Senate bills propose establishing a REMS for drug and biologic applications to evaluate and mitigate serious risks. Both bills call for all REMS to include certain core elements, including timeframes, instructions to patients and clinicians, and restrictions on distribution or use. The Senate bill would create a mechanism to assure access to a drug with a REMS for off-label use for a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. The bills S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 propose adding authority for structured follow-through, dispute resolution, and enforcement for REMS. They require reviews of approved REMS at specified times and establish a Drug Safety Oversight Board to resolve disputes. The bills also authorize the Secretary to require postapproval studies or clinical trials. Both bills propose adding authority for postapproval studies or clinical trials, with differences in criteria for determining their necessity. The Senate bill requires the Secretary to assess serious risks and unexpected risks, while the House bill authorizes studies based on scientific information to assess known risks or signals of serious risk. Additionally, the Senate bill mandates communication between the sponsor and Secretary regarding new safety information for drug labeling. The House bill proposes a multi-level process for changing drug labeling, involving meetings, dispute review, and recommendations by the Drug Safety Oversight Board. If the sponsor disagrees with the Secretary's request for a labeling change, the Secretary may deem the drug misbranded. Both bills include time limits for sponsor and Secretary, as well as a dispute resolution procedure for labeling changes. Additionally, both bills authorize the Secretary to require submission of certain advertisements for review before dissemination. Both the House and Senate bills propose regulations for drug advertising, with the Secretary having the authority to recommend changes. Both bills require clear presentation of side effects and contraindications in advertisements. Civil monetary penalties can be imposed for violations, with fines up to $250,000 per violation. The House bill includes additional penalties for ongoing violations, while the Senate bill sets a minimum fine of $15,000. The House and Senate bills propose regulations for drug advertising, with fines for violations up to $1 million per day for ongoing violations that pose a public health threat. Both bills allow the Secretary to consider non-compliant drugs as misbranded. The House bill prohibits marketing products with REMS if not in compliance. Separate civil penalty authority is established for false DTC ads, with fines up to $250,000 for first violation in the House bill and up to $150,000 in the Senate bill. Both bills authorize increased appropriations for drug safety provisions. The Senate and House bills propose regulations for drug safety provisions, including using PDUFA fees for surveillance and assessment activities. The Senate bill would increase revenue for drug safety activities by $225 million over FYs 2008 through 2012, while the House bill would authorize $125 million in appropriations over the same period. Additionally, the House bill mandates guidance for clinical trials of antibiotic drugs, a public meeting on orphan antibiotic products, and funding for orphan drug development. The Senate bill considers antibiotics as orphan products and authorizes $35 million annually for them. The Senate bill includes provisions for antibiotic access and innovation, such as incentives for developing certain antibiotics and requiring standardized packaging for prescription drugs. The House bill focuses on securing the distribution system against counterfeit or substandard drugs. Both bills have drug safety provisions, with the House bill requiring DTC ads to include certain information. The Senate bill includes provisions for drug safety, requiring an Advisory Committee on Risk Communication and extensive drug safety information on a website. It also mandates FDA regulation for state-legalized medical marijuana and neglected/tropical disease products. The Senate bill includes provisions for drug safety, requiring an Advisory Committee on Risk Communication and FDA regulation for state-legalized medical marijuana and neglected/tropical disease products. It would also establish a priority review voucher system for neglected disease products and set up procedures to prevent delays in agency decisions. Federal registration requirements for clinical trials were created by the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997. The current registry at clinicaltrials.gov contains proposals in S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 to expand types of trials and information, requiring registration of most clinical trials involving drugs, devices, and biologics, including international trials seeking FDA approval. H.R. 2900 delays public release of medical device information until FDA approval, while S. 1082 exempts pediatric postmarket surveillance trials from registry requirements. The bills H.R. 2900 and S. 1082 propose changes to postmarket surveillance clinical trials and registry requirements. H.R. 2900 links completion date to data collection, requires the responsible party to comply with provisions, and mandates that a principal investigator have control over data to serve as RP. Both bills expand the type of information in the registry, make it searchable, and require no item to be hidden. The bills H.R. 2900 and S. 1082 propose changes to postmarket surveillance clinical trials and registry requirements. H.R. 2900 requires disclosure of agreements restricting non-employees from discussing trial results and updates to be submitted every six months. S. 1082 specifies additional criteria for the registry's searchability, including age groups studied in trials. The bills H.R. 2900 and S. 1082 propose changes to postmarket surveillance clinical trials and registry requirements. H.R. 2900 specifies instructions for creating a public database of clinical trial results, including searchable categories and timing of submissions. S. 1082, on the other hand, requires the Secretary to establish a database based on NIH Director recommendations. A requirement for non-promotional results summaries was replaced with a study by the Comptroller General on the information in the database. H.R. 2900 mandates the Comptroller General to study if clinical trial information in the results database is promotional. It also requires public posting of pre-approval study results within 30 days of certain events, including the issuance of a not substantially equivalent (NSE) letter by the Secretary. This could lead to premature disclosure of clinical trial data for devices still under FDA review. A similar provision for studies on new uses of existing drugs or devices allows for a posting delay of up to two years with manufacturer certification to the Secretary. Both H.R. 2900 and S. 1082 include provisions for coordination, compliance, and enforcement related to registry and results database requirements. H.R. 2900's compliance provisions cover both registry and results database requirements, while S. 1082's provisions only apply to registry requirements. H.R. 2900 also addresses enforcement of results database requirements and coordination between registry and results database, prohibiting noncompliant trials from FDA approval. S. 1082 requires FDA applications to certify registry requirement compliance. One controversial provision in H.R. 2900, not present in S. 1082, would have allowed causes of action for damages under state law. Both H.R. 2900 and S. 1082 propose penalties for noncompliance with FDA requirements. H.R. 2900 allows penalties of $10,000 per day, capping at $15,000 for individuals and nonprofits, while S. 1082 allows $10,000 for a first violation and up to $20,000 for subsequent violations. Both bills address conflicts of interest in FDA advisory committees. The law generally requires committee members to be free from conflicts of interest, with exceptions under specific circumstances. FDA's current approach mandates disclosure of conflicts, refraining from voting, and possible exclusion from committees. The law is outlined in the Federal Advisory Committee Act, FDA advisory committee policy, and Acts Affecting Personal Financial Interest. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 propose changes to the recruitment process and circumstances for advisory committee members. The new provisions in S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 propose changes to advisory committee membership requirements, including expanding the scope of committees affected and defining financial interests. The definition of financial interest covers employment, trusteeship, and directorship, but not stock ownership or past employment. Alternative definitions may require disclosure of a broader range of activities. The new provisions in S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 would expand advisory committee membership requirements to include experts from academia, medical research institutions, and public interest groups. Financial conflict waivers would be discouraged, and full financial disclosure would be required before meetings. Non-voting guest experts with financial interests could participate if deemed necessary by the Secretary. Voting by members with conflicts of interest would be limited unless exempted by the Office. The bills S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to restrict voting by members with conflicts of interest, allowing waivers only if essential expertise is needed. Public disclosures and annual reports on conflict-of-interest determinations are required. Both bills mandate the review and update of FDA conflict-of-interest guidance every five years. Additionally, they propose establishing a nonprofit corporation to support FDA's mission in product development, innovation, and safety, with the initial Board of Directors selecting appointed members. The bills S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to establish a nonprofit corporation to support FDA's mission in product development, innovation, and safety. The appointed members would be selected from a National Academy of Sciences-provided candidate list, and the ongoing board would include representatives from various organizations. The Foundation would establish goals and priorities relating to unmet needs and coordinate with federal programs to advance those goals. The House and Senate bills would direct the Commissioner to transfer funds to the Foundation and require the Secretary to establish an Office of the Chief Scientist within the FDA Office of the Commissioner. The Senate bill S. 1082 includes provisions for allowing importation of prescription drugs, with detailed procedures to ensure safety and effectiveness. The bill also requires certification from the HHS Secretary to ensure no additional risk to public health and safety before implementation. The addition of the second-degree amendment in S. 1082 nullified the language of the title, focusing on food safety regulations for pet food and establishing an early warning system for adulteration and disease outbreaks. The Secretary would be required to collect and aggregate information on recalls of human or pet food, alert the public through communication networks, and establish a registry for reportable adulterated food under Title VI of S. 1082. The bill requires the Secretary to collect information on food recalls, issue alerts to the public, and establish a registry for reportable adulterated food. Responsible parties must maintain records and report to the FDA if adulteration is determined. Deliberate adulteration cases must be reported to the Department of Homeland Security. Regulations and standards for reporting suspected adulteration cases must be established. Annual reports to Congress on food imports and inspectors are also mandated. The bill mandates annual reports to Congress on food imports, inspectors, violations, and enforcement actions. Certain provisions require reports on various food issues such as pesticide residue monitoring and environmental risks of genetically engineered seafood products. The bill includes provisions for enhancing FDA inspection regime for aquaculture and seafood, prohibiting imports from foreign food facilities denying access to U.S. inspectors, and enabling the sale of pet turtles with specific requirements. It also requires reports on genetic test safety, tanning device labeling, and skin cancer risks. The bill includes provisions for enhancing FDA inspection regime for aquaculture and seafood, prohibiting imports from foreign food facilities denying access to U.S. inspectors, enabling the sale of pet turtles with specific requirements, and addressing the link between tanning device use and skin cancer. S. 1082 includes provisions expressing the Senate's sense on FDA regulation flexibility for follow-on biologics and addressing violations of intellectual property rights. The House bill includes a provision for public-private partnerships to implement the FDA Critical Path Initiative. The bill authorizes tax-exempt organizations to implement the FDA Critical Path Initiative by developing collaborative projects in research, education, and outreach to foster medical product innovation, accelerate development, and enhance safety. $5 million is appropriated for FY2008, with additional funding for FYs 2009 through 2012."
