    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Prevention of Frivolous Ethanol Lawsuits Act of 2010\". It includes findings related to ethanol lawsuits. The Congress finds that ethanol is widely used in gasoline for vehicles but increasing the blending limit raises concerns about emission control device failure and engine performance. The Federal Trade Commission is proposing labeling requirements for fuels with ethanol levels exceeding the current limit in gasoline to warn consumers of potential harm to vehicles. Federal testing is ongoing to assess the impact of higher ethanol blending limits on motor vehicle engines. The executive branch has the authority to increase the blending limit of ethanol in gasoline for older vehicles and nonroad engines. Congress should address potential negative impacts on interstate commerce from this decision. Targeted liability protections are proposed for claims related to damages caused by the inclusion of ethanol in certain fuel. Liability protections are proposed for covered entities using renewable fuel with ethanol concentrations over 10% in internal combustion engines, granting immunity from suit and liability for resulting losses. Losses include death, injury, illness, disability, and fear of harm. Liability protections are proposed for entities using renewable fuel with ethanol concentrations over 10% in internal combustion engines, granting immunity from suit and liability for losses including physical, mental, or emotional harm, property damage, and business interruption. The immunity applies to any loss causally related to the use of such renewable fuel. The combustion engine's immunity from suit and liability for using renewable fuel is subject to an exception for death or serious injury caused by willful misconduct. An action for wrongful death or serious physical injury can be brought under federal jurisdiction in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The governing law for such cases is based on the state where the misconduct occurred, unless inconsistent with federal law. In an action under subsection (b), the complaint must plead each element of the plaintiff's claim with particularity, including acts or omissions of willful misconduct, facts proving causation of injury, and facts showing death or serious physical injury. The complaint must also include a verification by affidavit of the plaintiff under oath. The plaintiff in an action under subsection (b) must prove willful misconduct by each covered person sued with clear and convincing evidence. In actions under subsection (b), a three-judge court initially considers motions and jurisdiction. Civil discovery is not allowed in such actions. Discovery in actions under subsection (b) is permitted before a covered person files a motion to dismiss, before the court rules on such motion, or before a Court of Appeals rules on an interlocutory appeal. The court will only allow discovery on matters directly related to contested issues in the action and will compel responses to discovery requests under rule 37 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Under rule 37 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, discovery in actions under subsection (b) is permitted if the court finds the information necessary to prove or defend a material issue. In such cases, the benefits of the response should outweigh the burden on the responding party. Additionally, in actions under subsection (b), the amount of damages awarded to a plaintiff may be reduced by collateral source benefits, and noneconomic damages are awarded based on the defendant's percentage of responsibility for the harm to the plaintiff. In actions under subsection (b), noneconomic damages are awarded based on the defendant's percentage of responsibility for harm to the plaintiff. Rule 11 sanctions may be imposed by a district court for violations in civil procedure, including ordering payment of expenses to the other party. Rule 11 sanctions may include payment of reasonable expenses, such as attorney's fees, to deter repeat conduct and compensate injured parties. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has jurisdiction over interlocutory appeals within 30 days of an order denying immunity from suit or exclusion for regulated activity. If a manufacturer or distributor's act or omission related to a covered countermeasure is regulated by the Clean Air Act and alleged as willful misconduct, it will not be considered as such under certain conditions. These conditions include no enforcement action initiated by the EPA or Attorney General, or if an enforcement action has been resolved without a covered remedy. Any action under this provision will be paused during an ongoing enforcement action. In the context of enforcement actions related to covered countermeasures under the Clean Air Act, the provision ensures that the United States retains all rights, remedies, and defenses available under other laws. A \"covered entity\" is defined as an entity involved in the production, sale, or distribution of renewable fuel products. The term \"enforcement action\" is clarified within this section. The term \"enforcement action\" encompasses various legal actions such as criminal prosecutions, injunctions, seizures, civil monetary proceedings, mandatory recalls, and debarment proceedings. A \"covered remedy\" refers to outcomes like criminal convictions, injunctions, civil monetary payments, and debarment resulting from a final court or agency decision. Final terms refer to court determinations or agency actions that are not subject to further review within the agency and have not been nullified by a final court decision. Willful misconduct is not considered for subsection (b) purposes. The term \"willful misconduct\" for subsection (b) purposes excludes acts or omissions done intentionally for wrongful purposes, knowingly without legal or factual justification, and in disregard of a known or obvious risk with harm outweighing the benefit."
