    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Shared Responsibility in Preserving America's Future Act\" and includes a surtax on millionaires contingent on the passage of a balanced budget amendment or spending limit amendment. This surtax is added as a new part to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"Shared Responsibility in Preserving America's Future Act\" imposes a 5% tax on taxpayers with modified adjusted gross income exceeding $1,000,000 for taxable years between 2012 and 2023. The threshold amount is subject to inflation adjustments annually. The threshold amount for the tax is determined annually based on the calendar year, with rounding rules applied. For married individuals filing separately, the threshold amount is halved. Modified adjusted gross income is used for calculation purposes. The term 'modified adjusted gross income' is defined as adjusted gross income minus gross income from a trade or business not considered a passive activity, with wages paid to at least 1 full-time equivalent employee, minus deductions properly allocable to such income. Regulations will be prescribed by the Secretary. The Secretary will prescribe regulations similar to section 469(l) for determining the income taken into account. Special rules apply for nonresident alien individuals and citizens/residents living abroad, adjusting the dollar amount based on exclusions and deductions under section 911. The tax imposed under this section shall not be treated as tax imposed by this chapter for certain purposes, such as determining credits or under section 55. Application of this section is contingent on a Balanced Budget or Spending Limit Amendment. The President must certify the submission of a proposed amendment to the Constitution for ratification by the States before September 30, 2012, regarding a balanced budget or spending limit. If not done, this section does not apply. The section does not apply after December 31, 2017, unless the amendment is ratified by that date. The text chunk states that a proposed amendment to the Constitution must be certified by the President for ratification by the States. It also includes a clerical amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The amendment on the surtax for millionaires will not change the tax rate according to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The effective date for these amendments is for taxable years starting after December 31, 2012."
