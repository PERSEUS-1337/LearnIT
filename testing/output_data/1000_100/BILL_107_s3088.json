The \"Reservists and Guardsmen Pay Protection Act of 2002\" guarantees that federal employees serving in the uniformed services or National Guard will not have their pay reduced during active duty. The \"Reservists and Guardsmen Pay Protection Act of 2002\" ensures that federal employees in the uniformed services or National Guard receive their full pay during active duty, as long as certain conditions are met. This includes payment for each pay period when reemployment rights are in effect and the employee is not receiving other forms of basic pay. The Reservists and Guardsmen Pay Protection Act of 2002 guarantees reemployment rights for employees in the uniformed services or National Guard, with payment made by the employing agency from the appropriate fund. The Office of Personnel Management oversees the implementation of these rights. The Office of Personnel Management, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, will prescribe regulations to implement reemployment rights for employees in the uniformed services. Agency heads and the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration will establish procedures to ensure these rights apply to their employees. Key terms have the same meanings as defined in section 4303 of title 38. The term 'employing agency' refers to the government entity where an employee has reemployment rights under title 38. 'Basic pay' includes all payments under section 5304. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections for chapter 55 of title 5. SEC. 3. READY RESERVE-NATIONAL GUARD EMPLOYEE CREDIT ADDED TO GENERAL BUSINESS CREDIT. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to add a new section for Ready Reserve-National Guard Employee Credit. Effective date applies to pay periods starting on or after September 11, 2001. The Ready Reserve-National Guard employee credit is 50% of the actual compensation amount for the taxable year. The actual compensation amount is the pay for days of qualified active duty. The credit is limited to 12 months and does not apply to days other than work days. For purposes of this section, \"qualified active duty\" refers to active duty that entitles an employee to reemployment rights and benefits under specific codes, excluding training duties. The curr_chunk provides definitions for terms related to military service, such as compensation, Ready Reserve-National Guard employee, National Guard, and Ready Reserve. These definitions are outlined in chapter 43 of title 38, United States Code.
