    "content": "Knowledge distillation is a model compression technique where a smaller model mimics a larger pretrained model. To deploy these compact models effectively, reducing performance gap and enhancing robustness to perturbations is crucial. Noise plays a significant role in improving neural networks training by addressing generalization and robustness goals. The introduction of noise at input or supervision levels can enhance model generalization and robustness. Techniques like \"Fickle Teacher\" and \"Soft Randomization\" show significant improvements in generalization by introducing variability through noise. Adding Gaussian noise to the student model's output from the teacher on the original image improves adversarial robustness significantly. Random label corruption also has a surprising effect on model robustness. This study emphasizes the benefits of incorporating noise in knowledge distillation and the importance of designing compact Deep Neural Networks for real-world deployment considering memory, computational requirements, performance, reliability, and security. In the constantly changing deployment environment, model performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data is crucial for reliability. Techniques like model quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation are used for high performance in compressed models. Knowledge distillation involves training a smaller student network under the supervision of a larger teacher network, mimicking the teacher's output to improve student performance. This interactive learning method is essential for robustness against malicious attacks. The performance of the student model improves with teacher assistance, but there is still a significant gap between the two models. Capturing knowledge from a larger network and transferring it to a smaller model remains a challenge. Incorporating methods to improve the student model's robustness is crucial for real-world deployment. Inspiration is drawn from neuroscience on how humans learn, emphasizing neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity is essential for learning, as connections between neurons constantly change. Learning in children occurs through collaboration and interaction with the environment. Cognitive biases and trial-to-trial response variation play a significant role in decision-making and encoding valuable information about stimuli in the brain. Introducing constructive noise in student-teacher collaborative learning can deter cognitive bias and improve learning by mimicking trial-to-trial response variation in humans. Noise is crucial for achieving accurate and robust models, as shown in a study on the effects of noise on model generalization and robustness. The study explores how noise can enhance generalization and robustness in a teacher-student collaborative learning framework. Two novel approaches, \"Fickle Teacher\" and \"Soft Randomization,\" utilize noise to improve student model performance. Additionally, random label corruption is shown to reduce cognitive bias and enhance adversarial robustness with minimal impact on generalization. The presence of noise in the nervous system affects its function and can improve generalization in deep neural networks. Various noise techniques like Dropout and gradient noise injection have been shown to be crucial for optimization. Randomization techniques injecting noise during training and inference are effective against adversarial attacks. Randomized smoothing and label smoothing are effective against adversarial attacks and improve neural network performance. However, label smoothing may impair knowledge distillation. Adding constructive noise to the knowledge distillation framework could lead to lightweight models with improved robustness. CIFAR-10 dataset was chosen for empirical analysis due to its relevance in knowledge distillation and robustness research. In the study, noise addition in knowledge distillation was explored using the Hinton method. Experiments were conducted on Wide Residual Networks (WRN) and ImageNet images from the CINIC dataset were used for out of distribution generalization evaluation. Adversarial robustness was assessed using the Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) attack. In the study, noise addition in knowledge distillation was explored using the Hinton method. Experiments were conducted on Wide Residual Networks (WRN) and ImageNet images from the CINIC dataset were used for out of distribution generalization evaluation. Adversarial robustness was assessed using the Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) attack. The robustness of models to common corruptions and perturbations in CIFAR-C was also tested. In this section, different types of noise were injected into the student-teacher learning framework to analyze their impact on model generalization and robustness. Signal-dependent noise was added to the output logits of the teacher model, with zero-mean Gaussian noise proportional to the output logits in each sample. The effect of noise levels ranging from 0 to 0.5 at intervals of 0.1 was studied. Our method improves the distillation process by adding noise to the student model's softened logits, inspired by trial-to-trial variability in the brain. This approach differs from M\u00fcller et al.'s method, where noise was added to the teacher model during training. The study found that for noise levels up to 0.1, signal-dependent noise enhanced generalization to CIFAR-10 but marginally reduced out-of-distribution generalization to CINIC-ImageNet. Additionally, there was a slight increase in adversarial and natural robustness of the models. Using dropout in the teacher model adds variability to the supervision signal. This method differs from others by using dropout for uncertainty encoding noise in distilling knowledge to a compact student model. Instead of averaging Monte Carlo simulations, the logits returned by the teacher model are utilized. Training the student model with dropout using the teacher's logits and activating dropout helps improve generalization on unseen and out-of-distribution data, as well as robustness to attacks. Comparing dropout rates from 0 to 0.5, the proposed method shows significant enhancements in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution generalization over traditional methods. Even when the teacher model's performance decreases after a dropout rate of 0.2, the student model's performance continues to improve. The student model's performance improves up to a dropout rate of 0.4, even though the teacher model's performance decreases after a dropout rate of 0.2. Adding trial-to-trial variability enhances PGD Robustness and natural robustness, supporting the hypothesis that noise injection aids in distilling knowledge. A novel method of adding Gaussian noise during knowledge distillation is proposed to improve adversarial robustness while balancing generalization. Our method involves training the student model with random Gaussian noise using the teacher model trained on clean images to improve adversarial robustness and generalization. By minimizing a specific loss function in the knowledge distillation framework, we observed significant gains in robustness and a decrease in generalization. Our approach outperforms training with Gaussian noise alone, showing improvements in both generalization and robustness. Our method enhances adversarial robustness and generalization by training the student model with random Gaussian noise from the teacher model. It significantly improves robustness to common corruptions, such as noise and blurring, while maintaining low generalization loss. The method allows for increased robustness at lower noise intensities compared to other training methods. Based on the previous paragraphs, a regularization technique is proposed to improve adversarial robustness and generalization in deep neural networks. By randomly changing target labels with noise during training, the model is encouraged to avoid overconfidence and memorization, leading to better performance in handling common corruptions. The study explores the impact of random label corruption on model generalization, focusing on various types of noise and levels of corruption in both teacher and student models during knowledge distillation. During knowledge distillation, using label corruption improves generalization, especially for high corruption levels. Training with random labels significantly increases adversarial robustness, with a peak at 40% corruption. Further research is needed to understand this phenomenon. Incorporating variability in knowledge distillation framework through noise at input or supervision levels enhances generalization and robustness. Fickle teacher and soft randomization techniques show significant improvements in both in-distribution and out of distribution generalization, as well as adversarial robustness. Random label corruption boosts adversarial robustness and generalization remarkably. Injecting noises to increase trial-to-trial variability in knowledge distillation framework shows promising results for training compact models with good generalization and robustness. Hinton et al. proposed using final softmax function with raised temperature and smooth logits of teacher model as soft targets for student model, minimizing Kullback-Leibler divergence between output probabilities. In real-world scenarios, models often face domain shift, impacting their generalization performance. Test set performance alone is not sufficient for evaluating model generalization. To measure out-of-distribution performance, ImageNet images from the CINIC dataset are used. This dataset contains 2100 images randomly selected for each CIFAR-10 category, serving as an approximation for a model's out-of-distribution performance. Deep Neural Networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, posing a threat to their real-world deployment. Research focuses on evaluating and defending against these attacks using methods like Projected Gradient Descent. The original image is perturbed by random noise within an epsilon bound. The model needs to be robust to both adversarial attacks and naturally occurring perturbations. Deep Neural Networks are vulnerable to common real-world perturbations. In a study on model robustness, researchers found that classifiers are vulnerable to real-world perturbations, leading to significant accuracy degradation. They also discovered that state-of-the-art classifiers are brittle to minute transformations in video frames. The study used synthetic color distortions as a proxy for natural robustness and emphasized the trade-off between generalization and adversarial robustness. Recent studies have shown the impact of adversarially trained models on natural robustness, highlighting a trade-off between adversarial robustness and generalization. Adversarial training improves robustness to mid and high frequency perturbations but at the expense of low frequency perturbations common in the real world. There is a need to rigorously test the effects of norm bounded perturbations on model generalization and robustness to distribution shifts. Recent studies have shown a trade-off between adversarial robustness and generalization. A proposed method involves random swapping of softmax logits to improve in-distribution generalization but negatively impacts out-of-distribution generalization. This method does not significantly affect model robustness. Training the student model with dropout requires more epochs to capture the teacher model's uncertainty. Different dropout rates require varying numbers of epochs and learning rate reductions. Adversarial robustness can be improved by swapping logits, but it may not enhance generalization to out-of-distribution data. The accuracy of student on unseen data may not generalize to out-of-distribution data due to various types of noise and blurring effects."
