The Congress finds that free trade agreements boost income and prosperity by enhancing competition, reducing costs, and promoting economic growth. APEC's 21 member economies aim for \"free and open trade\" by 2020 for developing countries and 2010 for developed countries, representing over half of world production and global trade. The financial crisis in Asia has disrupted US export growth in the Pacific Rim region. Free trade agreement negotiations are crucial in the current global economic climate to counter protectionist policies and open up markets for US goods and services. Countries like New Zealand, Australia, and Singapore, long-time allies of the United States, are involved in these negotiations. The United States allies with Australia and Singapore to increase economic growth through trade liberalization in the Asia-Pacific region. Bilateral trade agreement negotiations are crucial for influencing multilateral and regional trade talks. Trade negotiations between the United States and Pacific Rim countries aim to resolve trade and investment disputes effectively through mutually agreed-upon disciplines and dispute settlement mechanisms. Free trade agreements will enhance cooperation and ensure mutually beneficial economic and political relations as economies become more complementary and interdependent. Free trade agreements aim to enhance market access and understanding for US firms in Pacific Rim markets, stabilizing bilateral trade balances. SEC. 2. United States trade policy with eligible Pacific Rim countries aims to enhance market access for US firms and stabilize bilateral trade balances. The United States aims to eliminate tariff and nontariff barriers through bilateral free trade agreements with Pacific Rim countries. Nontariff barriers include regulatory obstacles, denial of national treatment for services and foreign investment, inadequate protection for intellectual property, and arbitrary standards. The United States aims to address unfair trade practices such as pricing restrictions and market access limitations for US products, as well as activities of State trading enterprises and administrative mechanisms. SEC. 3. PRENEGOTIATION CONSULTATIONS. Within 60 days of enacting the Act, the President will consult with eligible Pacific Rim countries. If feasible, a ministerial meeting will be requested within 60 days to discuss a free trade agreement. The US International Trade Commission will provide advice within 6 months after each ministerial meeting. The United States International Trade Commission will advise the President on the economic effects of providing duty-free treatment for products from a Pacific Rim country on US industries and consumers. SEC. 4. MINISTERIAL MEETING RECOMMENDATIONS. The President recommends establishing a council of public and private sector officials to review trade practices, customs laws, economic data, and disputes for a free trade agreement. The council must issue a report on the bilateral relationship within 6 months of its establishment. The report will assess the potential benefits and drawbacks of a free trade agreement, as well as propose appropriate dispute settlement mechanisms for resolving trade issues. SEC. 5. Presidential determination on negotiating free trade agreements with eligible countries. The President must make a determination on the feasibility and desirability of starting formal negotiations for a free trade agreement with a Pacific Rim country or countries within 6 months of receiving a report from a bilateral council. This determination will be based on advice from the Advisory Committee for Trade Policy Negotiations and the International Trade Commission, and a report will be submitted to the Senate and House committees. Factors considered include the policy set forth in section 2 and the advice of the International Trade Commission. The President will assess the eligibility of a country for a free trade area with the US based on WTO membership, interest in bilateral trade agreement, trade liberalization efforts, alignment with US trade policies, and participation in WTO activities. The World Trade Organization conference in the United States from November 30 to December 3, 1999, shows commitment to US objectives for trade negotiations. It aims to eliminate export and local content requirements, harmonize domestic and international standards, increase economic opportunities for small- and medium-sized businesses, remove barriers to trade in services, and provide national treatment for foreign direct investment. The curr_chunk states that a country should provide national treatment for foreign direct investment, accommodate US market access objectives, resolve trade disputes with the US, benefit from improved dispute settlement mechanisms, and enhance the market for US products by eliminating trade barriers. The President must consult with specific congressional committees regarding the implementation of the Act. The Act defines eligible Pacific Rim countries as those that are WTO members and members of APEC."
