    "content": "The \"Small Business Meat Producer and Marketer Protection Act of 1993\" amends the Small Business Act by adding conditions for credit and reasonable rates. It also addresses the issue of loan programs not granting loans to qualified applicants in the livestock and meat industry. Congress recognizes the need to maintain a free and fair market in these industries. The Act aims to address marketing conditions that harm the competitive environment, hinder the free flow of commerce, and interfere with fair marketing practices. Congress seeks to regulate commerce to eliminate these detrimental conditions swiftly. The Act defines key terms such as \"Commerce,\" \"Livestock,\" \"Meat food products,\" \"Meatpacker,\" and \"Meat marketer\" to regulate industries without hindering production or distribution. The Act defines key terms such as \"Meat marketer\" as any person dealing in meats or meat food products, and \"Person\" as individuals or entities engaged in commerce. The Act prohibits meatpackers from slaughtering more than a specified number of animals per week if they have a certain level of sales. The Act prohibits meatpackers from owning or controlling more than 5% of a meatpacker's stock, voting power, or control. It is also unlawful for meatpackers to offer for sale or purchase more than a specified number of live cattle, swine, or sheep per week if they were owned for more than twenty days prior to the sale. It is unlawful for a meatpacker or meat marketer to own or control more than 5% of another meatpacker's stock, voting power, or control. They are also prohibited from selling or purchasing livestock that have been owned for more than twenty days prior to the sale. The Futures Trading Commission prohibits meatpackers and meat marketers from selecting the delivery date of livestock in forward contracts unless it falls within a 20-day period. Violators of this rule may face fines up to $50,000 or a specified amount per head of slaughtered livestock. Sec. 6 of the Act states that violations occurring over multiple weeks will be considered separate violations for each week. Sec. 7 clarifies that if any provision of the Act is deemed invalid, it will not affect the validity of the rest of the Act. This Act is considered an antitrust law under existing legislation."
