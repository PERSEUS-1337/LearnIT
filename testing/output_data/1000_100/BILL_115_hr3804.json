    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Safe Communities Act of 2017\" and includes findings. The \"Safe Communities Act of 2017\" acknowledges the lack of financial resources for incorporating disaster threats into land use planning, leading to costly relief programs and security measures. It emphasizes the need for federal and state support in integrating disaster mitigation and emergency preparedness into urban development. Disaster response and relief efforts are costly to taxpayers, with a focus on post-disaster recovery rather than mitigation. Planning should incorporate mitigation strategies from various professional fields to prevent property damage and human casualties. Traditional bias towards efficient response and recovery in disaster planning may hinder other planning goals. Comprehensive planning can effectively reduce risks from natural disasters and terrorist acts. Efforts are being made at the Federal and State levels to support comprehensive planning for safe communities, including updating land use statutes. Coordination between State and local plans is necessary for mitigating risks posed by natural disasters and terrorist acts. Urban planning should consider various infrastructure elements to promote safety and economic viability. Safe housing is crucial for community development and should be integrated into comprehensive planning efforts. Prevailing land use patterns can put people and the environment at risk, especially in poorly regulated rural communities and small towns on the outskirts of cities. It is important to incorporate modern planning techniques to ensure a broad range of safe housing options are available to all community members. The Federal Government and State governments should support Tribal governments and Native Hawaiian organizations in implementing land use planning and community development to improve housing safety and socioeconomic conditions for Indian Tribes and Native Hawaiians. SEC. 3. SAFE COMMUNITIES PLANNING GRANTS. The Secretary of Homeland Security will establish a grant program to assist States and local governments in developing or revising land use planning statutes and comprehensive planning documents to mitigate hazards, including acts of terror. The grant program aims to assist States and local governments in developing or revising land use planning statutes to mitigate hazards. Eligibility requires demonstrating consistency with guidelines including citizen engagement in the planning process. The grant program aims to assist States and local governments in developing or revising land use planning statutes to mitigate hazards through multi-jurisdictional cooperation and multi-agency coordination. Land use plans include implementation elements with defined roles and responsibilities. The comprehensive planning process involves incorporating risk assessment and mitigation into land use plans, urban design guidelines, building codes, and transportation plans to guide infrastructure development decisions. Grant funds received by a State or local government must be used for developing comprehensive land use plans, integrating natural hazard mitigation and security plan elements, and assessing critical public infrastructure for land use and community development policies. The grant funds received by a State or local government must be used for developing geographical information systems, scenario planning technology, updating building codes and zoning regulations, implementing CPTED initiatives, assessing risk and vulnerability related to land use, and incorporating security elements in transportation and land use plans. The grant funds received by a State or local government must be used for developing geographical information systems, scenario planning technology, updating building codes and zoning regulations, implementing CPTED initiatives, assessing risk and vulnerability related to land use, and incorporating security elements in transportation or land use plans. Encouraging interagency cooperation between first-responders and planning agencies, identifying natural hazard areas, and integrating them into comprehensive plans, regulations, zoning, and building codes. Grants under subsection (a) shall not exceed $1,125,000 with a Federal share not exceeding 90 percent, except for Tribal governments or Native Hawaiian organizations. The Secretary encourages coordination between Federal land management agencies and State or local planning directors. The Inspector General conducts audits to ensure grant funds are used as specified. The term \"land use planning legislation\" refers to actions taken by a State or local government to guide land use. A \"comprehensive plan\" is a planning document for regulating land use and development practices. The curr_chunk discusses resources, development practices, and infrastructure investments related to future land use and urban development. It defines the term \"State\" and \"State planning director\" in the context of land use planning legislation. The responsibility of the State planning director is to draft and update State guide plans that regulate land use on a statewide basis. The term \"local planning director\" refers to a local official responsible for drafting and updating local comprehensive plans for land use within the jurisdiction of the local government. \"Tribal government\" is defined as the government of an Indian Tribe. SEC. 4. SAFE COMMUNITIES PLANNING RESEARCH. The Secretary of Homeland Security, along with various partners, will conduct research on land use and community planning to mitigate natural hazards and terrorism threats. This includes integrating federal facility security with local plans, assessing the impact of security strategies on communities, and using mapping tools for risk assessment. A report to Congress is due within 2 years. The Secretary will report to Congress on best practices in community security and safety planning, evaluating land use codes, software tools for safe development, design standards for residential areas, and safety integration into infrastructure planning. The Secretary will evaluate best practices for infrastructure such as wastewater, storm water, transportation, and electricity facilities, considering regional differences in risk reduction and cost. Authorization of Appropriations: $57,250,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2019 through 2023. $56,250,000 for grants under section 3 and $300,000 for section 4."
