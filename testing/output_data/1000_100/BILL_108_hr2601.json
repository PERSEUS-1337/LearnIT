    "content": "The \"Public Domain Enhancement Act\" may be cited as the short title of this legislation. The Congress finds that the copyright clause in the United States Constitution grants Congress the power to promote the progress of science and useful arts by securing exclusive rights to authors for limited times. This serves two purposes: providing economic incentives for authors to create new works and promoting society's interest in the free flow of ideas, information, and commerce. The copyright term is limited to prevent permanent deprivation of the fruits of an artist's labor. Both commercial and noncommercial creators rely on a healthy public domain for various purposes such as publishing titles at reduced prices, creating new productions, and producing educational materials. Under current law, copyright protection is granted to works published as early as 1923, but the majority of older works are no longer commercially available. Only 2 percent of works between 55 and 75 years old retain commercial value. This prevents abandoned works from entering the public domain for many years, limiting access for commercial and noncommercial entities. The existing copyright system hinders the entry of abandoned works into the public domain, contrary to the original intent of the Constitution and the Copyright Act. A mechanism is needed to allow abandoned American copyrights to enter the public domain. SEC. 3. MAINTENANCE FEE FOR PUBLISHED UNITED STATES WORKS.
