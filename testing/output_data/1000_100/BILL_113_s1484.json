    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Sabine National Forest Land Exchange Act of 2013\" and includes definitions for various terms. The Act defines \"Authority\" as the Sabine River Authority of Texas and \"Federal land\" as National Forest System land within Sabine National Forest and Toledo Bend Project boundary, including certain additional Federal land occupied by Forest Service campgrounds. The term \"non-Federal land\" refers to private land adjacent to Sabine National Forest, owned or to be acquired by the Sabine River Authority of Texas and mutually agreed upon by the Secretary of Agriculture. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Agriculture, and the term \"Toledo Bend Project\" refers to a specific Federal Energy Regulatory Commission project. The Indian Mounds Wilderness Area in Sabine National Forest is defined as a wilderness area by the Texas Wilderness Act of 1984. Wilderness candidate land refers to adjacent land owned or to be acquired by the Sabine River Authority of Texas for mutual agreement with the Secretary. SEC. 3. LAND EXCHANGE, SABINE NATIONAL FOREST. In exchange for non-Federal land, wilderness candidate land, and any cash payment, the Secretary will convey all US interests in Federal land to the Authority, subject to existing rights. Within 180 days of enactment, an appraisal of surface estates will be completed following specific standards. The Secretary will determine the value of Federal land considering restrictions imposed by a covenant. Surveys will be used to identify and describe the land to be conveyed. The land exchange between the Authority and the Secretary will be conducted on an equal value basis, with costs shared equally. Cash equalization payments can be used to equalize the values of exchanged land, exceeding statutory limits. Any cash payments received by the Secretary will be used as specified. The payment received by the Secretary will be deposited into the fund established under Public Law 90-171 (Sisk Act) and can be used for land acquisition for the National Forest System. Title to the non-Federal land conveyed must be acceptable to the Secretary and conform to the Attorney General's title approval standards. The deed conveying Federal land to the Authority reserves the subsurface mineral estate owned by the United States, including oil, gas, rock, sand, and gravel. The deed also includes a covenant that the land must be used in a manner consistent with adjacent National Forest System or wilderness area land, remain unsubdivided, and not be used for commercial, residential, or industrial development. The Authority can operate Forest Service campgrounds and maintain them as per Federal Energy Regulatory Commission authorization. Congress intends for the land exchange to be completed within a year of the Act's enactment. The restrictive covenant on the conveyed land does not create any property interest for the United States. SEC. 4. BOUNDARY ADJUSTMENT, INDIAN MOUNDS WILDERNESS AREA, SABINE NATIONAL FOREST. SEC. 4. Boundary Adjustment for Indian Mounds Wilderness Area in Sabine National Forest includes modifying boundaries to exclude land within Toledo Bend Project and include acquired wilderness candidate land. Legal description and map required after completion of land exchange. After completing the land exchange, the Secretary must submit a map and legal description of the wilderness area boundary changes to the House and Senate committees. The filed documents will have the same legal effect as if included in the Act and will be available for public inspection at Forest Service offices."
