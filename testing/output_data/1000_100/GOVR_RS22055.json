    "content": "The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) authorizes federal funding for children with disabilities, requiring a free appropriate public education (FAPE) and detailed due process provisions. Attorneys' fees provisions were added in 1986 and amended in 1997 under P.L. 105-17, allowing fee reduction for lack of timely information. The 2004 IDEA reauthorization addressed attorneys' fees for IEP meetings, with the House and Senate bills having different approaches. The final version aligned more with the Senate bill, allowing attorneys' fees for SEA or LEA against parents or their attorneys. The 2004 IDEA reauthorization allows for attorneys' fees to be awarded in certain situations, including when a complaint is filed by a parent or local educational agency (LEA). This includes disputes related to identification, evaluation, placement, and provision of education for children with disabilities. Attorneys' fees may also be awarded against a parent's attorney in specific circumstances. The 2004 IDEA reauthorization allows for attorneys' fees to be awarded in specific situations, such as when a complaint is frivolous or continues after becoming frivolous. P.L. 108-446 also permits attorneys' fees against a parent's attorney if the complaint was for an improper purpose. Senator Grassley emphasized that the amendment does not discourage legitimate complaints against school districts. Senator Gregg emphasized the need for the attorneys' fee amendment, citing the high standard for prevailing defendants to recover fees when a plaintiff's actions are frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation. This amendment aims to prevent abuses of due process rights in IDEA and ensure taxpayer dollars are used for educating children, not for enriching trial lawyers. The attorneys' fee provision in IDEA sets a high standard for prevailing defendants to recover fees, considering the financial resources of the plaintiff. Fees are based on community rates with specific prohibitions and reductions. Senator Gregg highlighted the objective reasonableness standard from Rule 11 in interpreting the provision. The attorneys' fee provision in IDEA sets strict conditions for awarding fees, including a written offer of settlement to parents and limitations on when fees can be awarded for IEP meetings. The 2004 reauthorization added a \"resolution session\" requirement before a due process hearing. The IDEA sets strict conditions for awarding attorneys' fees, including a written settlement offer to parents. P.L. 108-446 allows attorneys' fees for prevailing parents if justified, but fees may be reduced if the resolution process is unreasonably prolonged or excessive. The IDEA sets conditions for awarding attorneys' fees, including a written settlement offer to parents. P.L. 108-446 allows fees for prevailing parents but may be reduced if the resolution process is unreasonably prolonged or excessive. The school district must provide specific information in the due process complaint, and final regulations were issued in 2006. The Department of Education declined to provide further guidance on the statutory language. The Department of Education declined to address whether non-attorney advocates could receive fees at due process hearings, citing that lay advocates are not entitled to compensation as attorneys. The Supreme Court's decision in Arlington Central School District Board of Education v. Murphy was considered controlling on the issue of experts' fees recovery for prevailing parents under the IDEA. The Department of Education declined to regulate non-attorney experts' fees in IDEA reauthorization, citing the Supreme Court's decision as controlling on the issue."
