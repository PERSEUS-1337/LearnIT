National security exceptions are also outlined. The \"Import Control and Safe Handling of Spent Nuclear Fuel Act of 1995\" prohibits the import of spent nuclear fuel into the United States unless specific conditions are met, including approval by Congress, licensing by federal agencies, and operational repositories. The prohibition does not apply to imports from countries suspected of producing or developing nuclear weapons, with notification to Congress required in advance. Samples for testing and evaluation for national security purposes are also exempt from the prohibition. SEC. 4. GUIDELINES BY PORT AUTHORITIES TO ENSURE SAFE SHIPMENT OF CERTAIN MATERIAL. Port authorities can establish guidelines for the safe handling of spent nuclear fuel at ports, including worker training and response plans for emergencies. Before spent nuclear fuel can enter the port, fuel containment measures must be in place, including fire and spill response. Local communities must be informed of the fuel's unloading, transfer, or shipment, with guidelines for storage and transport vehicles. Prohibitions may be in place for movement during certain conditions. The guidelines for the unloading, transfer, or shipment of spent nuclear fuel at ports must ensure public safety by limiting radiation exposure levels for workers and being more protective than other applicable laws. The existence of other requirements under federal, state, or local law does not prevent the enforcement of these guidelines. The Act does not impact the port's liability in handling nuclear materials. Definitions are provided in the Act. The Act defines \"atomic energy defense activity\" as functions carried out by the Secretary of Energy, including naval reactors development and defense research. \"Port authority\" is defined as any local, regional, State, or interstate authority. The term \"port authority\" refers to a local, regional, State, or interstate authority with jurisdiction over port operations in the United States. The terms \"repository\" and \"spent nuclear fuel\" are defined in the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982."
