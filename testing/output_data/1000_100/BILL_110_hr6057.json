Congress finds that Americans value healthy oceans and wildlife, especially in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas of Alaska, which are home to various endangered species and are crucial for the survival of Alaska Native cultures. Scientists widely agree on the importance of these ecosystems. The Arctic is experiencing significant changes due to climate change, impacting sea ice habitat for polar bears, walrus, and seals. The polar bear was proposed as a threatened species in 2007 due to its reliance on sea ice for hunting seals. However, the Department of the Interior missed the deadline in 2008 to decide on providing protections under the Endangered Species Act. The Department of the Interior faced a deadline in 2008 to decide on listing the polar bear under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as projections showed potential loss of polar bear habitat due to changes in sea ice conditions. The Department of the Interior had to decide on listing polar bears under the Endangered Species Act in 2008 due to projected habitat loss from sea ice changes. It is estimated that 2/3 of the world's polar bear population could be lost by the middle of the 21st century, with potential extirpation in Alaska. Global warming is the main threat, but oil and gas development in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas also pose risks to polar bears and marine life. Recovering spilled oil in these harsh environments is currently ineffective. The Minerals Management Service's leasing plan includes offering millions of acres in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas for oil exploration, posing risks to polar bears and other marine mammals in the event of a large oil spill, especially during periods of broken ice. The agency acknowledges a lack of information on marine mammal ecology and habitat use. Onshore industrial development for offshore oil and gas activities can harm important habitats and disturb denning polar bears and other wildlife. Tribal governments oppose offshore oil and gas development in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas due to threats to subsistence resources, public health, and cultural survival. PROHIBITION ON LEASING IN BEAUFORT AND CHUKCHI SEA PLANNING AREAS. Section 8 of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act is amended to prohibit leasing, preleasing, or any related activity in the Beaufort and Chukchi Sea planning areas until missing information on marine resources is identified by the National Research Council. The amendment to Section 8 of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act prohibits activities in the Beaufort and Chukchi Sea areas until missing information on marine resources is identified by the National Research Council. This includes assessing the impacts of oil and gas activities on plant and animal species, marine environments, and Alaskan Native communities. The Alaska environmental studies program of the Minerals Management Service conducts cultural studies to provide information on missing information, evaluates ongoing and completed studies, and makes recommendations for additional research to address identified gaps. The Secretary must perform an oil spill response gap analysis for proposed and existing arctic oil operations, involving consultation with various stakeholders to set a standard. The Secretary sets a standard for lessees to recover 85 percent of spilled oil within 30 days in any ice condition. Recovery must be demonstrated before issuing leases or approving exploration and production plans. Oil spill response gap analysis ensures 85 percent recovery for each lease. The Secretary requires lessees to recover 85 percent of spilled oil within 30 days in any ice condition. Response gap analysis ensures recovery for each lease by implementing closure procedures and safety requirements for oil spill prevention systems. Oil and gas exploration in the Beaufort and Chukchi Sea Planning Areas can be done without harming wildlife or habitat if mitigation measures are in place. A response gap is a period where the oil spill recovery standard cannot be met. The term 'response gap analysis' involves calculating operating limits of spill response systems for various environmental factors and assessing local response capabilities and oil spill contingency plans. The response gap analysis involves calculating operating limits of spill response systems based on environmental factors and assessing local response capabilities and oil spill contingency plans. This includes assessing the frequency, duration, and timing of limiting factors that may prevent achieving the oil spill recovery standard. The response gap analysis involves assessing local conditions that exceed spill response system limits to achieve the oil spill recovery standard."
