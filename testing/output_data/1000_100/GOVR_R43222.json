Harbor maintenance plays a critical role in facilitating U.S. foreign trade and reducing trade costs. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is responsible for maintaining federal navigation channels, and the Water Resources Development Act is the main legislative tool for altering the Corps' Civil Works Program. In 1986, Congress established harbor maintenance policy, with merchandise trade accounting for 14% of GDP. Now at 25%, decisions on harbor maintenance have a greater impact on the U.S. economy. The harbor maintenance tax (HMT) is 0.125% of cargo value, mostly collected from imported waterborne cargo, funding the harbor maintenance trust fund (HMTF) for dredging and maintenance. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) is funded by the harbor maintenance tax (HMT), which is collected from imported waterborne cargo. The HMTF can only be accessed with an appropriation by Congress and is used for dredging, maintaining jetties, breakwaters, and operating locks. A surplus of HMT receipts over expenditures reduces the federal budget deficit. The trust fund balance was $8.5 billion in July 2013, with an expected income of $2.05 billion in FY2014. The Administration's budget requests $923 million for harbor maintenance. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) is funded by the harbor maintenance tax (HMT) collected from imported waterborne cargo. The trust fund balance was $8.5 billion in July 2013, with an expected income of $2.05 billion in FY2014. The Administration's budget requests $923 million for harbor maintenance. Bills in the 113th Congress aim to increase annual spending on harbor maintenance, with H.R. 3080 proposing that 80% of the HMT collected the prior fiscal year be spent on harbor maintenance by FY2020. This increased spending may impact funding for other Corps activities. Congress established the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) in 1986 to pay for eligible operations and maintenance costs of commercial navigation in harbors and inland harbors. The fund is funded by the harbor maintenance tax (HMT) collected from imported waterborne cargo. This increased funding may impact other Corps activities. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) was established by Congress in 1986 to cover maintenance costs of commercial navigation in harbors and inland waters. The definitions of \"inland harbors\" and \"commercial cargo\" have remained unchanged since 1986. The Corps interprets \"commercial navigation\" as any project authorized by Congress with commercial navigation as a purpose. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) covers maintenance costs for commercial navigation projects authorized by Congress. High-use ports, handling over 10 million tons of freight per year, account for 90% of maritime commerce and receive two-thirds of HMTF spending. Operations and maintenance activities are scheduled for almost all high-use ports. In FY2013, \"moderate use\" ports received a disproportionate amount of HMTF spending compared to their cargo handling, with 50% having O&M projects planned. Similarly, in FY2012, a similar pattern was observed. This allocation of funds has sparked debate on how HMTF funds should be distributed between high-use and low-use ports. The allocation of Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) spending has sparked debate on the distribution of funds between high-use and low-use ports. H.R. 3080 and S. 601 address the issue, with concerns raised about the disproportionate funding going to harbors with little commercial traffic. Data shows that a significant number of waterways eligible for HMTF spending have minimal cargo activity, raising questions about the allocation of funds. Almost 75% of eligible waterways handle little to no cargo, with budget requests favoring high-use harbors based on cargo volume rather than value. A shift to a value-based metric could allocate more funds to ports handling container ships, concentrating funding on major container ports like Los Angeles, Long Beach, New York/New Jersey, Savannah, and Oakland. In 2012, Long Beach, New York/New Jersey, Savannah, and Oakland handled 56% of U.S. maritime container shipments. High-use ports received only half of the O&M funds requested in FY2011, while moderate-use ports received 30% and low-use harbors received 10%. Low-use harbors requested $766 million, close to the $922 million requested by the busiest harbors. This funding shortfall is problematic for both small and economically significant ports. The Corps faces financial stresses in allocating funds for infrastructure maintenance, leading to partial investments across many facilities. Harbor traffic is concentrated, with 90% of ship traffic occurring at the top 35 ports. If national economic benefit were the main criterion, the Corps might concentrate O&M funds on high-use harbors. The Corps may concentrate O&M funds on high-use harbors, potentially hindering moderate-use ports from developing. The Corps maintains over 900 coastal channels and harbors, with maintenance work done on 400 to 500 annually. They are authorized to maintain 1,400 coastal navigation projects but actively maintain only 360. The Corps maintains over 900 coastal channels and harbors, with maintenance work done on 400 to 500 annually. They are authorized to maintain 1,400 coastal navigation projects but actively maintain only 360. A 2001 letter from two Members of Congress prompted a Corps study in 2003, highlighting the lack of systematic reevaluation of economic justification for continued federal investment in harbor projects. This passive stewardship has led to a lack of proactive management of vital resources. The Corps' current policies and management tools are inadequate for identifying inefficient harbor projects and ensuring their economic viability. Many harbor projects were authorized decades ago, before alternative transportation methods were available. The 2003 Corps study emphasized the need for explicit requirements and procedures to reevaluate the economic viability of harbor projects. The Corps maintains small harbors for pleasure boats using funds from a cargo tax. Congress allowed the Corps to divest some inland waterways projects. The Corps prioritizes harbor maintenance based on commercial importance and developed a tool for allocating funds objectively. The Corps prioritizes harbor maintenance based on commercial importance and uses metrics like tonnage and cost per ton to allocate funds. Other criteria include support for commercial fishing, public safety, infrastructure condition, and legal requirements. The 2003 Corps study raised concerns about the criteria for prioritizing harbor navigation projects, with a large number of criteria making it unclear how many projects would qualify for priority funding. The Government Accountability Office recommended creating an advisory committee to provide input on national harbor maintenance projects, but no such committee has been established. Congress is worried that the Corps' project prioritization criteria are not transparent and may not yield the highest return on investment, as highlighted in a 2010 GAO report. The Corps' budget process focuses more on anticipated rather than demonstrated project performance, although the O&M budget does reflect actual performance for completed projects. The Corps' budget process focuses on anticipated project performance rather than demonstrated performance. Opportunity cost is a significant metric for distributing O&M funds efficiently to harbors, but it is not specifically mentioned in the budget guidance. Former Secretary of the Army emphasized the importance of defining problems within a national framework for optimal solutions. The Corps' budget process focuses on anticipated project performance within a national framework for optimal solutions. CRS calculations show varying costs of O&M activities funded by the HMTF at different ports. Data on O&M expenses and waterway usage have not been jointly analyzed, hindering Congress' access to comprehensive information. The HMTF covers 100% of federal costs for maintaining harbors up to 45 feet deep. S. 601 proposes changing the non-federal cost share requirement for O&M, with local cost-sharing only for channels deeper than 50 feet. New construction costs are not covered by the HMTF and are paid from general government revenues. Federal share of construction costs varies based on harbor depth. General fund expenditures for construction at coastal harbors offset HMT collections. S. 601 proposes allowing ports with excess revenue from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund to use the funds for dredging, removing contaminated sediments, or potentially returning funds to shippers. This could benefit deep ports like Los Angeles and Long Beach, potentially reducing funds allocated to other ports. H.R. 3080 also expands the use of the HMTF. H.R. 3080 expands the use of the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) for dredging and contaminated sediments. There is wide variation in HMT generated at harbors, with top 15 harbors collecting over 75% of total revenue. Disparity in revenue and O&M costs raises concerns about equity and efficiency. Corps maintains harbors for public safety, including \"harbors of refuge\" for small craft. The Corps prioritizes funding for critical harbors of refuge, subsistence harbors, and channels used by passenger ferries. In FY2011-FY2014, 30 harbors were identified for O&M funding. Additional funding above the President's request was provided by the House and Senate Appropriations Committees in FY2012-FY2014. The Committees allocated an extra $30 million for the maintenance of small, remote, or subsistence harbors, urging the Corps to revise criteria for funding navigation projects. The criteria should consider economic impact, national defense, and public safety importance. Federal maintenance of recreational harbors has been a contentious issue. President Clinton proposed a two-year phase-out. President Clinton proposed a two-year phase-out of federal funding for harbors that did not contribute to the HMTF, identifying 501 such harbor projects totaling about $63 million in annual expenditures. The Clinton Administration suggested that state and local governments take over responsibility for maintaining these harbors, while refocusing the Corps' role on water projects of national significance. President Reagan had previously proposed terminating funding for harbors with federal maintenance costs exceeding $1 per ton of cargo, estimating a savings of about $150 million in annual federal harbor maintenance expenditures. During the Reagan Administration, Congress rejected a proposal to allow local port authorities to charge fees for harbor maintenance. The debate on maintaining harbors with little commercial cargo dates back to the 1950s, with a focus on the need for analysis on the continued maintenance of specific waterways and harbors. In 1956, a GAO audit found that the Corps was maintaining waterways mainly used by recreational boaters or a single shipper, contrary to policy. GAO recommended Congress establish specific criteria for federal navigation projects. 11 coastal projects were deemed of questionable value, receiving $12 million in O&M spending in 2011. Only two projects still carry cargo, with one being the Okeechobee Waterway in Florida. GAO suggested reclassifying it as a flood-control project. The GAO recommended reclassifying the cross-Florida waterway as a flood-control project due to minimal navigation benefits, making it ineligible for HMTF expenditures. Despite not being reclassified, it received $30 million from FY1999 to FY2008. In contrast, the Anahuac Channel and Trinity River project in Texas received $17 million from FY1999 to FY2008 but has seen no recent cargo movement. Recent budget requests have focused on O&M expenses for flood risk mitigation over navigation, highlighting the economic impact of recreational harbors. Boaters on the Great Lakes spend $2.4 billion annually on trips and $1.4 billion on vessels and supplies, supporting 60,000 jobs. Recreational boating in Oregon creates 1,700 jobs. Recreational boaters pay federal fuel taxes for fish habitat restoration and boating safety programs. Some in the industry support using motorboat fuel taxes for harbor dredging. The Corps is exploring local financing for waterways on the Atlantic Coast. The Corps is exploring local financing for waterways on the Atlantic Coast, but certain information needed to assess the need for increased spending on harbor maintenance is not publicly available. This includes current HMTF expenditure reports and data comparing harbor usage with O&M expense. The Corps tracks O&M expenditures for its channels and waterways since 1977, but there is a discrepancy in facility nomenclature between tonnage and expenditure databases. They do not compare channel dimensions to authorized sizes or estimate economic losses from deficiencies. The Corps has a program called NETS to develop economic tools for navigation improvement evaluation. The NETS program by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers focuses on economic analysis of construction dredging projects. Congress requested estimates on the availability of authorized dimensions for maintained channels and the annual amount needed from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund. The Federal Maritime Commission estimated the average HMT payment for a 40-foot shipping container at $109, which is small compared to cargo value but significant against typical freight charges. Shipping a 40-foot container from Asia to the U.S. Midwest costs around $4,000, with an average value of $117,606. This results in an HMT assessment of $147, increasing shipping costs by about 4%. Ports near the Canadian and Mexican borders claim that the HMT diverts inbound cargo, especially containerized cargo. The HMT diverts inbound cargo, particularly containerized cargo bound for the Midwest, to ports across the border due to no similar tax in Canada or Mexico. A 2012 FMC study found that factors like risk mitigation and rail rate disparities also influence shippers to use ports in Canada or Mexico. If U.S. importers were relieved of paying the HMT, shippers could divert 59,000 to 72,500 containers per year from Canadian to U.S. ports. Senators Murray and Cantwell have addressed this issue. The FMC concluded that Senators Murray and Cantwell plan to introduce legislation to replace the HMT with a maritime goods movement user fee. The HMT may hinder transshipment of cargo by sea, especially for coastal feeder service. The HMT poses challenges for transshipment of containers at U.S. ports, with up to $500 million in uncollected taxes from domestic waterborne shippers. Unlike import duties, the HMT is not refundable, impacting the price competitiveness of some U.S. exports. Exporters do not pay the HMT for port use when exporting a product, but they do pay the HMT on materials and inputs transported through ports for production of exported goods. This issue is part of the ongoing debate over WRDA. The debate over WRDA is happening in the context of industrial supply chain cost-effectiveness. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations are concerned about insufficient budget requests for Corps O&M, directing the Corps to use additional funds for harbors to promote international competitiveness. The Competitive Supply Chain Initiative aims to enhance the nation's marine transportation system for improved national competitiveness. The Department of Commerce emphasizes the importance of supply chain competitiveness in determining product costs and global prices. Policymakers and industry leaders must align supply chain management with strategic priorities. In 2012, the Corps and the U.S. Department of Transportation signed a memorandum to capitalize on opportunities for improvement. The Department of Transportation and the U.S. Department of Commerce signed a memorandum of understanding to improve transportation infrastructure investments by aligning criteria for project prioritization and infrastructure investment with national priorities. President Obama announced an initiative in 2012 to expedite federal permitting for construction projects at five harbors in anticipation of the Panama Canal expansion. Additionally, a Task Force on Ports was established in response to calls for a more strategic framework for federal investments in ports."
