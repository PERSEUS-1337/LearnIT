The \"SCHIP Expansion for Kids in Need Act of 2009\" prioritizes SCHIP coverage for children in families with income under 200 percent of the federal poverty level. Section 2108 of the Social Security Act is amended to include income-related data in annual reports on the success of states in providing health insurance coverage for children at various income levels. Regulations will be established for data collection and reporting standards by September 30, 2009. The \"SCHIP Expansion for Kids in Need Act of 2009\" requires states to develop a plan for coverage of low-income children to be approved under section 2106. The plan must ensure coverage for all qualified low-income children based on gross income relative to percentages of the poverty line. The \"SCHIP Expansion for Kids in Need Act of 2009\" mandates states to create a plan for covering low-income children, approved under section 2106. The plan must guarantee coverage for all eligible low-income children, approved by the Secretary based on specific criteria. The plan for covering low-income children must meet specific criteria and may be resubmitted if disapproved by the Secretary. Qualified low-income children are defined as those with family incomes not exceeding 200 percent of the poverty line. The amendment limits the use of SCHIP funds based on increases in income eligibility levels for low-income children. Payment will not be made for individuals whose family income exceeds the specified level. The amendment restricts SCHIP funds for individuals with family income above the eligibility level, unless the State proves that less than 10% of low-income children are not covered. Payment limitations do not apply to qualified low-income children or those meeting State plan eligibility standards.
