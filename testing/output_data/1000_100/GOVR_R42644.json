    "content": "The Administration requested $39.510 billion for DHS in FY2013, a slight decrease from the previous year. The Senate Committee on Appropriations approved a net discretionary appropriation of $39.514 billion for DHS for FY2013. The Senate-reported bill for DHS in FY2013 provided $39,514 million, excluding funds for overseas contingency operations and disaster relief. The House passed H.R. 5855 with amendments, resulting in a net discretionary appropriation of $39,114 million for DHS. Funding for certain activities was 27% below the requested level. The President signed H.J.Res. 117 into law as P.L. 112-175 on September 28, 2012, a continuing resolution allowing federal government operations through March 27, 2013. It passed the House 329-91 on September 13, 2012, and the Senate 62-30 on September 22, 2012. On March 26, 2013, the President signed H.R. 933 into law as P.L. 113-6, the FY2013 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, including $39.646 billion for the Department of Homeland Security. The Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2013 allocated $39.646 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority for DHS. Two across-the-board cuts reduced the discretionary budget authority by $52.4 million. After the impact of sequestration, $38.348 billion was available for DHS to use. Data for FY2012 amounts are from President's Budget Documents and congressional reports. Information on the FY2013 request is from various budget justifications. The FY2013 DHS budget information is sourced from various documents including the President's Budget, Congressional Budget Justifications, and Budget in Brief. Details on the House-passed and Senate-reported versions of the DHS Appropriations bill, as well as the continuing resolution and final resolution of FY2013 appropriations, are also included. Post-sequester funding levels are from the DHS Fiscal Year 2013 Post-Sequestration Operating Plan. Historical funding data is from the Analytical Perspectives volume of the FY2006-FY2014 President's Budget request documents. All amounts in the report are in budget authority and rounded. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred functions, funding, and personnel to the Department of Homeland Security. Appropriations for DHS are organized into five titles, including offices like OSEM, USM, CBP, ICE, TSA, USCG, and Secret Service. Title III of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 includes appropriations for various agencies within the Department of Homeland Security, such as NPPD, OHA, and FEMA. Title IV covers USCIS, S&T, and FLETC. Title V contains general provisions for congressional direction. Additional titles may be added for special issues, like the FY2012 House mark-up adding a sixth title for a $1 billion emergency appropriation for the DRF. The Senate version typically does not include additional titles beyond those mentioned. The FY2013 appropriations bills had parallel structures with some differences in subcomponents and accounts. Congress determines budget authority through a two-stage process, with overall spending totals set in the annual concurrent resolution on the budget. These amounts are then allocated among appropriations committees, known as 302(a) allocations, for enactment in annual appropriations bills. The appropriations process involves subcommittees developing bills, with appropriations committees allocating 302(a) discretionary funds to subcommittees in the form of 302(b) allocations. These allocations must not exceed the 302(a) allocation to enforce budget discipline. Adjustments to 302(b) allocations can be made throughout the year. The FY2012 appropriations bills were impacted by the Budget Control Act, which set spending caps for FY2012 and FY2013. The Budget Control Act (BCA) set spending caps for FY2012 and FY2013, including a separate cap of $686 billion for security spending. All other spending was capped at $361 billion out of the total $1.047 trillion. The BCA allows for adjustments to cover funding for overseas contingency operations, emergency spending, disaster relief, and health care fraud and abuse. These levels became the basis for enforcement in the absence of a budget resolution for FY2013. The Budget Control Act set spending caps for FY2012 and FY2013, with separate caps for security and other spending. The absence of a budget resolution for FY2013 led to enforcement based on these levels. An automatic spending reduction process was triggered due to the failure to enact deficit reduction legislation by January 15, 2012, resulting in sequestration and lower discretionary spending caps. The Office of Management and Budget was required to implement across-the-board spending cuts to achieve equal budget reductions. The Budget Control Act of 2011 set spending caps for FY2012 and FY2013, with separate caps for security and other spending. An automatic spending reduction process was triggered due to the failure to enact deficit reduction legislation, resulting in sequestration and lower discretionary spending caps. The Act required across-the-board spending cuts to achieve equal budget reductions from both defense and nondefense funding. The American Taxpayer Relief Act made changes to the procedures, delaying the joint committee sequester and reducing the dollar amount by $24 billion. President Obama ordered the joint committee sequester to be implemented on March 1, 2013, resulting in budget authority cancellations at the program level. Sequestration was applied while a temporary continuing resolution was in force, leading to reductions calculated on an annualized basis. The post-sequestration numbers in the report are based on the FY2013 DHS operating plan, excluding resources from the FY2013 supplemental appropriation for disaster relief. Section 3001 of P.L. 113-6 aims to reduce the new budget authority to comply with FY2013 discretionary spending limits. DHS faces a 0.1% across-the-board cut in the \"security\" category to align with these limits. The Office of Management and Budget has the final say on the matter. Section 3004 of P.L. 113-6 includes across-the-board rescissions for nonsecurity and security budget authority to avoid exceeding spending limits. OMB determines if additional rescissions are needed, with cuts of 0.032% for security and 0.2% for nonsecurity budget authority. These cuts aim to reduce discretionary budget authority, excluding funding for Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terror and disaster relief. The Budget Control Act exempts funding for Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terror and disaster relief from across-the-board cuts. DHS's initial allocations for FY2013 are outlined in Table 2, with adjustments made for emergency spending and disaster relief. Adjustments for disaster relief are limited under the BCA. The Budget Control Act limits adjustments for disaster relief funding. For FY2013, OMB determined the allowable adjustment to be $11,779 million, fully exercised including $6,400 million from the FEMA Disaster Relief Fund in P.L. 113-6. Funding details for FY2012 and FY2013 appropriations are summarized in Table 3. The final DHS appropriations legislation included in Division D of P.L. 113-6 prior to sequestration. The Administration proposed a 0.5% pay increase for civilian federal employees, but the House rejected it, resulting in a slight reduction in appropriations for civilian salaries. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding the pay raise, but neither the part-year continuing resolution nor P.L. 113-6 provides resources for it. Breaking down the DHS bill by title does not offer transparency into where the appropriated resources are allocated. The DHS appropriations legislation in P.L. 113-6 did not include a proposed pay raise for civilian federal employees. Table 4 and Figure 1 break down DHS's budget authority for FY 2013 by component, showing the allocation of resources. Figure 1 includes adjustments for disaster relief and overseas contingency operations, while Table 4 reflects rescissions of prior-year budget authority. The DHS budget for FY 2013, as outlined in P.L. 113-6, includes adjustments for disaster relief and overseas contingency operations. However, Figure 1 does not fully capture the resources available to individual DHS components, as much of the budget is not derived from discretionary appropriations. Components like TSA and CIS rely heavily on fee income to support their activities. Less than 4% of CIS's budget comes from direct appropriations. Figure 2 illustrates the extent to which the DHS budget is not funded through appropriations. The DHS budget for FY 2013 includes adjustments for disaster relief and overseas contingency operations. Components like TSA and CIS rely on fee income, with less than 4% of CIS's budget coming from direct appropriations. Figure 2 highlights the portion of the DHS budget not funded through discretionary appropriations, showing a comparison of the Administration's budget request and enacted budget for FY 2013. Table 5 presents DHS appropriations for FY 2003 through FY 2013. Table 5 shows DHS appropriations for FY2003 through FY2013 in current dollars, not adjusted for inflation or sequestration. The House and Senate marked up bills early in 2012, with P.L. 113-6 being enacted later than usual. The DHS appropriations bill, P.L. 113-6, was enacted later than usual. Title I of the bill provides funding for management activities, A&O account, and OIG. The Administration requested $1,279 million for these accounts in FY2013. The House-passed bill proposed $1,020 million, while the Senate-reported bill suggested $1,102 million. After across-the-board cuts, the final act allocated $1,086 million for Title I. The DHS appropriations bill, P.L. 113-6, provides $1,086 million for Title I, a decrease from the requested level and FY2012. Sequestration reduced this to $1,026 million. The departmental management accounts cover general administrative expenses of DHS, including the Office of the Secretary and Executive Management. The DHS appropriations bill, P.L. 113-6, provides $1,086 million for Title I, a decrease from the requested level and FY2012. Sequestration reduced this to $1,026 million. The departmental management accounts cover general administrative expenses of DHS, including the Office of the Secretary and 12 entities that report directly to the Secretary; the Under Secretary for Management (USM) and its components\u2014the offices of the Chief Administrative Officer (OCAO), Chief Human Capital Officer (OCHCO), Chief Procurement Officer (OCPO), and Chief Security Officer (OCSO); the Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO); and the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO). The Administration has usually requested funding for the consolidation of its headquarters here as well. In this section and in each section hereafter, a graphic follows that provides a numeric and graphic representation of the discretionary appropriation provided to each element of DHS described in the report. This graphic provides a quick reference to the relative size of the component to others in DHS as well as to the previous year's enacted level, the FY2013 request, the enacted level in P.L. 113-6, and DHS-reported post-sequester level for FY2013. The FY2013 request compared to the... The FY2013 request for departmental management activities in Title I was $724 million, excluding $89 million for the consolidation of DHS headquarters. The Administration requested $134 million for OSEM, with increases for OCFO and OCIO. Program changes were proposed for the Office of International Affairs, the Office of State and Local Law Enforcement, and the Private Sector Office. The Administration requested $222 million for the USM and 902 full-time employee equivalents (FTEs). Program changes funded through this request include training programs for law enforcement personnel and policy advice related to ICE Secure Communities and 287(g) programs. Several program changes were proposed under this appropriation, including increases for the Immediate Office of the Under Secretary for Management and the Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer. The Administration requested $55 million for the OCFO, with $6.7 million allocated for Financial Systems Modernization. $313 million was requested for the OCIO, with $122 million for Infrastructure and Security Activities, including $65 million for data center migration for CBP, TSA, and USCIS. The House Appropriations committee recommended $627 million for management activities, including $65 million for data center migration for CBP, TSA, and USCIS. This represents a decrease of $97 million, or 13.4%, from the President's request. The House Appropriations committee recommended $627 million for management activities, including $65 million for data center migration for CBP, TSA, and USCIS. This represents a decrease of $97 million, or 13.4%, from the President's request. The reductions were justified by the committee due to the need to cover the lack of revenue from unrealized funding proposals and failure to comply with statutory requirements. During floor consideration of the bill, amendments were offered to further reduce the budget for management by almost $33 million. The House Appropriations committee recommended reducing funds for the Office of the Under Secretary for Management by $97 million, with amendments further reducing the budget by almost $33 million. Amendments were passed to shift funds to Federal Emergency Management Agency State and Local Programs, U.S. Customs and Border Protection Security Fencing, and Firefighter Assistance Grants, leaving the USM with $180 million, $41 million less than requested. The House Appropriations committee recommended reducing funds for the Office of the Under Secretary for Management by $97 million, with amendments further reducing the budget by almost $33 million. Representative Flake proposed reallocating $17,000 from reception and representation expenses for international programs to increase U.S. Customs and Border Protection Salaries and Expenses by $43,000. The amendment was agreed to in the House on June 6, 2012. Additionally, provisions withheld $71 million from obligation until all required reports for the FY2014 budget request were submitted. Section 549 proposed barring the use of Coast Guard-operated fixed wing aircraft by certain officials. The House Appropriations Committee recommended withholding funds and reducing budgets for various departments within the DHS until required reports were submitted. This included withholding $5 million for the Office of General Counsel and more than $124 million under the USM appropriation. Additionally, $7 million was recommended to be reduced from the OCPO budget for failure to comply with reporting requirements. Over $29 million would have been withheld under the OCFO account. The House Appropriations Committee recommended withholding over $29 million from the OCFO account until all required reports and plans were submitted directly by relevant components. The Committee expressed that appropriations liaisons in OCFO were not intended to serve as intermediaries between the committees and department components. The House-recommended appropriation of $242 million for the Office of the Chief Information Officer would be allocated to salaries and expenses as well as development and acquisition of information technology equipment. The House recommended appropriations for Information Technology Services and Security Activities, but did not support the proposed $65 million for migration to consolidated data centers due to budget shortfalls. The Senate-reported bill would provide slightly less funding for departmental management compared to the President's request. The Senate-reported bill proposed $655 million for departmental management, a $69 million decrease from the President's request. The bill included a programmatic increase for the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties to ensure compliance with civil rights statutes. Funding for the DHS historian was discontinued. The committee report recommended funding cuts for reception and representation expenses in recognition of budget constraints. It also proposed funding for oversight of major acquisitions, workforce development, and security measures to protect DHS personnel and facilities. Funding reductions for individual offices were attributed to limited resources and a focus on critical operational missions. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended a $35 million appropriation for the OCHCO, $1 million below the request, with a reduction in the Salaries and Expenses account. For the OCIO, a recommended appropriation of $248 million included $121 million for salaries and expenses and $127 million for technology investments through FY2015. This includes $57 million for IT equipment, software, services, and $65 million for data center migration. The committee noted that data center consolidation investment is expected to result in savings. The report highlighted that investment in data center consolidation is projected to save nearly $3 billion by 2030. The law allocated funding for various departments, with a total of $643 million for departmental management, a decrease of $170 million from the President's request. Only the OCIO faced a funding reduction due to sequestration. The P.L. 113-6 directive included a multi-year investment plan for IT projects funded by DHS, a report on travel costs, and a contingency plan for budget gaps. See Table 7 for funding details. The directive from P.L. 113-6 includes submitting a contingency plan to address budget gaps in user fee collections, a Comprehensive Acquisition Status Report (CASR) with the President's FY2014 budget proposal, a report on the balanced workforce strategy implementation, and CFO briefings on financial systems modernization efforts. The Department of Homeland Security is required to provide semiannual briefings on its financial systems modernization efforts. Funding levels for management accounts under P.L. 113-6 show spending cuts compared to FY2012 enacted amounts, but do not include the impact of sequestration. The department's assessment of budgetary resources available after sequestration was applied is outlined in the \"DHS Plan\" column. House and Senate Appropriations committees have identified issues such as new revenue assumptions and chronic lateness in budget submissions. The Administration's budget proposed separate line items for three offices\u2014the Office of International Affairs (OIA), the Office of State and Local Law Enforcement (SLLE), and the Private Sector Office (PSO)\u2014currently funded under the Office of Policy. The proposal to have each office report directly to the OSEM was rejected during the legislative process, with concerns raised about lack of Senate-confirmed leadership and inconsistency with streamlining goals. The House committee report directs the Department to consider establishing an external affairs office to consolidate functions of various existing offices. The Senate committee questions the need for standalone entities and suggests these functions can be adequately performed within the Office of Policy. The Administration's budget includes proposals to increase budgetary resources through various fee increases and authorizations. The House rejected proposals for aviation security fee, customs fee revenues, and CBP reimbursement agreements, while the Senate included them. The House committee criticized unrealistic budget assumptions and highlighted a $115 million shortfall in the DHS budget due to new legislative authority dependencies. This approach requires drastic measures to offset the unnecessary gap. The Committee rejects budgetary legerdemain and emphasizes the need for drastic measures to address the gap. Consequences include additional reductions to Department requests. The Committee will consider proposals enacted into law when drafting legislation, but until then, they will not be relevant to appropriations work. P.L. 113-6 allowed CBP to initiate pilot projects for reimbursable agreements for customs services. The House committee report expressed concern about late submission of required plans and reports to Congress, withholding funding as a result. The Department has been late in responding to Congressional direction and failing to submit required reports on time, leading to withheld funding from departmental management accounts. The Committee emphasizes the importance of investment plans, expenditure plans, and reports for oversight work to help DHS better protect the American people. The Committee expects the Department to comply with statutory requirements for submitting expenditure reports on time. The Senate-reported bill proposed withholding 59% of budgets for OSEM, USM, and CFO until all required reports are submitted. The House floor action reduced the USM budget significantly, with 70% of the budget being withheld if the provisions were to become law for FY2013. Section 562 of P.L. 113-6 withholds 20% of the budgets of OSEM, USM, and CFO until all required reports and plans are submitted by May 1. The House committee report highlights the need for better oversight of expenditures, requiring the Office of Inspector General to report on compliance with federal laws and regulations on travel, conferences, and employee awards programs within 30 days of the act's enactment. New provisions related to conference spending were also included in the House and Senate. New provisions in the House and Senate bills require quarterly reports to the DHS OIG on events costing over $20,000. The Senate restricts grants or contracts for unrelated conferences and mandates compliance with OMB Memorandum M-12-12. P.L. 113-6 mandates government-wide reporting on conference costs to inspectors general or ethics officials. The House and Senate bills include provisions limiting the number of employees attending overseas conferences for DHS. The House limits attendance to 50 employees unless it's a law enforcement conference, while the Senate caps attendance at 50 employees per DHS component unless it's deemed important for national interest. The Department of Homeland Security's headquarters occupies over 7 million square feet in 45 locations in the DC area. The Department of Homeland Security is looking to unify its headquarters functions in the greater Washington, DC area by creating a new DHS headquarters on the grounds of St Elizabeths in Anacostia. A $3.4 billion master plan has been approved for this project, with $1.4 billion funded through the DHS budget and $2 billion through the General Services Administration. This project is said to be the largest federal office construction since the Pentagon was built during World War II. The DHS headquarters project at St. Elizabeths in Anacostia is funded with $1.4 billion from DHS and $2 billion from GSA. $1,366 million has been invested so far, with Phase 1A nearing completion. The Administration seeks funding for consolidation of offices to save on lease costs, including $89 million for related activities in the budget. The Administration requested $24.5 million for moving the Coast Guard to its new facility in FY2013. No other funding requests for the DHS headquarters project were included in the budget submission to Congress. The House Appropriations Committee recommended no funding for the highway interchange or any part of the St. Elizabeths project through the management accounts. The bill would have provided funding for the Coast Guard to move to a new facility, with an additional $10 million allocated for the project. The Committee recommended no new construction funding for the Departmental Headquarters Consolidation expansion, which is $89 million below the request. Funding is included in the Coast Guard appropriation to cover the costs of moving the headquarters to St. Elizabeths, along with additional funding for site access improvements and planning adjustments. The Committee is exploring options to modify current leases for the headquarters construction site, with $10 million allocated for Phase 1 of construction. They are encouraged to continue efforts and provide progress updates within 90 days. The ranking members of the subcommittee and full committee expressed concerns about the lack of funding for necessary road and interchange improvements for DHS personnel to access the new headquarters. The project has faced delays and increased costs, with only the Coast Guard expected to occupy the facility for the next 3-5 years. Phase 2 construction for DHS central headquarters and FEMA is not funded, and no amendments were considered for consolidation. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $89 million for the highway interchange. The committee recommended $89 million for the highway interchange, funded through the Under Secretary for Management's office. Full funding was also recommended for the Coast Guard's move under operating expenses. An attempt to use the $89 million as an offset for an unrelated amendment failed, and the funding remained in the reported version of the legislation. The Under Secretary will submit an expenditure plan within 90 days detailing funds allocation for headquarters consolidation. Quarterly briefings are required on consolidation activities, with an updated plan being developed for completion by summer 2012. The plan should identify construction segments and associated resource requirements. The Under Secretary will submit an expenditure plan within 90 days detailing funds allocation for headquarters consolidation. $29 million is provided for necessary expenses to plan, acquire, design, construct, renovate, and equip buildings for the department headquarters project. The funds support the Office of Intelligence and Analysis and the Office of Operations Coordination and Planning. The Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I&A) is responsible for collecting, analyzing, and sharing intelligence information within DHS and with homeland security partners. It is part of the intelligence community and receives funding from the National Intelligence Program. The Office of Operations Coordination and Planning (OPS) develops and coordinates departmental and interagency operations plans, managing the National Operations Center for incident management and coordination. The FY2013 budget request for Analysis and Operations was $322 million, with a decrease of $16 million from the previous year. H.R. 5855 proposed $317 million for the Analysis and Operations account, $4.5 million below the President's FY2013 request. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended denying certain increases and decreases in funding. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $324 million, a decrease from FY2012 but an increase from the President's request. The Senate Committee on Appropriations required DHS's Chief Intelligence Officer to submit an expenditure plan for FY2013 within 60 days of the appropriations bill enactment. The plan should focus on I&A's unique expertise and continue semi-annual briefings on the State and Local Fusion Centers program. P.L. 113-6 allocated $322 million for the Analysis and Operations account, falling between the amounts proposed in H.R. 5855 and S. 3216. This figure matches the President's FY2013 request and is 4.7% lower than FY2012. The FY2013 budget request for DHS was 4.7% lower than FY2012. The House rejected increases for executive service salaries and the Air Domain Intelligence Integration Element. The Senate directed an expenditure plan and semi-annual briefing on fusion centers. Sequestration reduced DHS's operating plan to $306 million, with concerns raised by some Members of Congress about I&A's mission focus. The House of Representatives Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Subcommittee on Terrorism, Human Intelligence, Analysis, and Counterintelligence discussed DHS's intelligence mission based on a report by the Aspen Institute. The report recommended that DHS focus on specific homeward-focused areas where it has unique strengths and value, avoiding duplication of efforts by other agencies. The House Subcommittee on Terrorism discussed DHS's intelligence mission based on a report by the Aspen Institute, recommending a focus on unique strengths and value in areas not served by other agencies. Concerns were raised about potential duplication of intelligence efforts by other federal agencies, leading to a call for DHS to provide an expenditure plan centered around I&A's functions. The DHS Office of the Inspector General (OIG) conducts audits and investigations to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse, reporting to Congress and the Secretary of Homeland Security. The DHS Office of the Inspector General (OIG) requested $144 million in funding, including $2.6 million for audits of states receiving FEMA grant funds for disaster preparedness. The House-passed bill allocated $109 million, with a $10 million reduction due to dissatisfaction with communication on border corruption investigations. The committee reduced the OIG appropriation by $10 million and funded $24 million through a transfer from FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund for disaster-related audits and investigations. The Senate-reported bill included $123 million for the DHS OIG, with an additional $3 million increase for investigating corruption and criminal conduct at CBP and ICE. The OIG budget for FY2013 saw an increase of $4 million from the previous year's appropriation but a decrease of $23 million from the President's request. Sequestration further reduced the OIG budget authority by roughly $7 million. The legislation included a $24 million transfer from the Disaster Relief Fund to align the gross budgetary resources with the request. The DHS FY2013 expenditure plan projected a $138 million budget for the OIG, $3 million less than FY2012. The OIG was required to conduct reviews and provide reports on various matters, including DHS expenditures on special events and non-competitive contract awards. The House directed the OIG to report on compliance with federal laws and regulations on travel, conferences, and employee awards programs. The OIG was directed to conduct \"red team\" inspections of TSA screening, brief the Committee on adjudication fraud detection reforms by USCIS, and review delays in FEMA's public assistance programs. The Senate did not include these provisions but directed a review of FEMA's application of rules for awarding public assistance funds. This direction was reiterated in Section 565 of Division D of P.L. 113-6. The explanatory statement emphasized compliance with House and Senate reports unless specifically negated. The Senate directed a review of FEMA's application of rules for awarding public assistance funds in P.L. 113-6. The OIG's organizational structure and reporting functions are under review by GAO due to concerns about independence and timeliness. Many senior positions in the OIG are filled by officials in acting roles, potentially hindering its duties. The DHS appropriations bill includes funding for various agencies like CBP, ICE, TSA, USCG, and USSS. The requested budget for these accounts in FY2013 was $30,759 million, with slight variations in the House-passed and Senate-reported bills. After across-the-board cuts, the final appropriations for Title II amounted to $31,267 million, representing a 1.7% increase from the requested level. The DHS appropriations bill for FY2013 allocated $31,267 million for Title II, a 1.7% increase from the requested level. Sequestration reduced this to $30,184 million, impacting various components like CBP responsible for border security. CBP officers and Border Patrol agents enforce laws at the border to prevent illegal entries. CBP's major programs include Border Security Inspections, Trade Facilitation, Border Security and Control, Air and Marine Interdiction, Automation Modernization, Border Security Fencing, and Facilities Management. Funding details for CBP appropriations can be found in Table 9. The funding for CBP for FY2012-FY2013 reflected spending cuts compared to FY2012 enacted amounts, but did not include additional cuts from sequestration. The Administration requested $10,345 million for CBP in FY2013, an increase of $190 million from FY2012. The total request was $11,971 million, a 2.8% increase. The FY2013 budget request for CBP was $11,971 million, a $320 million increase from FY2012. Program changes included transferring US-VISIT to CBP, increased funding for ATS, Office of Intelligence, Container Security Initiative, and intellectual property. The FY2013 budget request for CBP was $11,971 million, a $320 million increase from FY2012. Program changes included transferring US-VISIT to CBP, increased funding for ATS, Office of Intelligence, Container Security Initiative, and intellectual property. Decreases in funding include $68.2 million for the Office of Air and Marine Interdictions, $7.1 million for Air and Marine salaries, $52.3 million in management and administration staffing, $41.2 million in fleet acquisition and management, and $36.8 million in various areas. The FY2013 budget for CBP saw decreases in various areas, including non-mission critical vehicles, information technology infrastructure, nonintrusive inspection operations, officer overtime expenses, training expenses, and transportation program costs. The House approved a net budget authority of $10,172 for CBP, representing a $17 million increase from the previous year. The House-approved FY2013 budget for CBP saw a $17 million increase to $10,172 in net budget authority. Amendments included funding for staffing models, communications infrastructure, and cuts to environmental mitigation. The Senate Appropriations Committee proposed a $299 million increase in net budget authority for CBP for FY2013. The Senate-reported bill included a $319 million increase in gross budget authority. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2013 provided a $201 million increase in net budget authority. The FY2013 budget for CBP saw a slight decrease from the previous year's appropriation but an increase over the President's request. Sequestration further reduced CBP budget authority by $575 million. Various policy issues were discussed during the appropriations cycle, including US-VISIT program, CBP staffing, customs user fees, border surveillance technology, and cargo security. Congress mandated an automated entry and exit data system for aliens. The entry-exit system, mandated by Congress, tracks foreign visitors' entry and exit from the United States using biographic and biometric data stored in DHS databases. This information is shared with various government agencies to identify potential risks. The system has been operational at U.S. ports of entry since December 2006. Regulations issued in January 2009 require non-citizens entering the US to provide biometric data, but no data is collected from those exiting. The President's FY2013 budget did not include funding for a biometric exit system, focusing instead on an enhanced biographic exit program and a US-Canadian entry-exit system. The U.S. entry-exit system utilizes biometric records from Canada to track third country nationals entering through land ports. Congress has urged DHS to implement a comprehensive biometric exit system. The system's organizational structure has undergone multiple changes since its creation. The U.S. Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator Technology (US-VISIT) Program was created in 2003 under DHS. It underwent organizational changes, including being transferred to the National Protection and Programs Directorate in FY2008. In FY2013, there was a proposal to divide US-VISIT's work between CBP and ICE for operational and cost efficiencies. In FY2013, the US-VISIT Program was replaced by the Office of Biometric Identity Management (OBIM) within NPPD. The proposed move aimed to identify operational and cost efficiencies in mission support functions. The House-passed bill transferred $73 million to CBP and ICE for entry-exit policy, while the Senate-reported bill recommended US-VISIT be transferred as a stand-alone appropriation within CBP. The President's FY2013 budget requested funding for CBP officers and U.S. Border Patrol agents. Both chambers' budget proposals supported the staffing levels but raised questions about how DHS sets them. The Senate report warned of adverse consequences if DHS maintains high staffing levels during budget tightening. The House report encouraged CBP to consider changes to reduce staffing requirements at POEs. The House and Senate reports proposed measures to enhance border security, including expanding trusted trade programs and utilizing technology for officer efficiency. There were calls for specific staffing plans for border patrol agents and officers at Northern Border ports of entry. Some members expressed concerns about reducing CBP staffing despite significant increases in border patrol agents since FY2005. Additionally, efforts were made to refine the model for forecasting user fee revenues to ensure adequate funding for CBP officer salaries. Increased enforcement between ports of entry has led to concerns that illegal migrants and drug smugglers are entering through ports of entry. Supporters of increased staffing for Customs and Border Protection argue that officers enhance security and facilitate legal admissions more effectively than automated systems. Sequestration in 2013 resulted in potential furloughs for CBP personnel and reduced hiring, equivalent to cuts in Border Patrol agents and CBP officers. DHS plans to minimize sequester impact on Border Patrol and CBP operations by cutting employee awards, contracts, and administrative expenses. Reductions in overtime and hiring freezes will be used to avoid employee furloughs, but frontline staffing may still face reduced hours and furloughs due to budget constraints. The administration aims to use public-private partnerships to enhance services at ports of entry, despite restrictions on CBP providing services for a fee. Section 560 of P.L. 113-6 allows CBP to enter into up to five partnerships in FY2013 for additional services at POEs, new facilities, and land ports of entry. User fees are collected from passengers, cargo carriers, and importers. The COBRA fees, established under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986, include fees paid by passengers, cargo carriers, and importers for customs services. These fees reimburse CBP for various functions, with a portion being mandatory spending and another portion being discretionary appropriations. Certain COBRA passenger fees have been collected and deposited in the Customs User Fee Account without a corresponding appropriation to pay for customs functions. Two recent examples of this have drawn Congressional interest, resulting in significant increases in fees collected from passengers entering the United States. The COBRA passenger fees collected without appropriation have raised concerns among Members of Congress. The House Appropriations Committee directed CBP to report on the disposition of $639 million identified by GAO. CBP's budget justification for FY2013 included these fees for CBP officer salaries and expenses. The House Appropriations Committee directed CBP to report on the disposition of COBRA passenger fees collected without appropriation. Justification for FY2013 included these fees in the budget for CBP officer salaries, resulting in a shortfall. P.L. 113-6 appropriates an additional $110 million to make up for the budget shortfall in CBP salaries. DHS' strategy for controlling the Southwest Border includes the use of technology to monitor and detect illegal entries. Since 1998, DHS has tried to develop a network of border cameras, radar, and sensors for surveillance along key stretches of the border. Previous initiatives like America's Shield Initiative and SBI net faced criticism for contracting practices and cost overruns. The Obama Administration replaced SBI net with the Arizona Border Technology Plan, which includes fixed and mobile video surveillance systems. The House and Senate appropriations reports criticized DHS for its implementation of the new border surveillance plan, particularly for the delay in procuring and implementing new surveillance equipment. Despite recommending full funding for the BSFIT account to support the border surveillance mission, both chambers also suggested rescinding unobligated balances from the account. The House and Senate called for rescissions in the BSFIT account, with differing amounts. The President's FY2013 budget included funding for 277 aircraft for drug interdiction and border surveillance. CBP operated 10 unmanned aerial systems in various border regions. The use of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) for border surveillance is supported by some Members of Congress, but remains controversial due to privacy concerns and questions about cost effectiveness. A DHS Inspector General report criticized CBP's UAS program for lacking adequate support resources. Both House and Senate appropriations committees recommended increases to the OAM budget over the President's request. The House and Senate recommended an increase of $70,997,000 for upgrading the OAM fleet, increasing flight hours, and supporting UAS operations. P.L. 113-6 appropriated about $799 million for Air and Marine Operations, with a shift of $284 million from CBP's Salaries and Expenses account. CBP is responsible for screening cargo at U.S. ports of entry for contraband and dangerous materials, as mandated by the SAFE Port Act of 2006. The 9/11 Act established a deadline for DHS to begin excluding cargo that has not been scanned, with Secretary Napolitano extending the deadline in 2012. The 100% scanning requirement has raised questions about balancing security benefits with costs, including paperwork, technology maintenance, and longer wait times for importers. Arguments have been made to focus scanning on high-risk cargo and a random sample of lower-risk cargo to cut costs. The FY2013 budget request included a $13 million increase to the Container Security Initiative (CSI) and a total of $78 million in proposed increases to screening programs for security threats. House and Senate Appropriations Committee reports supported these programs, acknowledging concerns about the costs of implementing a 100% scanning program at foreign ports. ICE focuses on enforcing immigration and customs laws in the United States, developing intelligence to reduce illegal entry and investigating violations such as alien smuggling. They are also responsible for locating and removing aliens who have overstayed visas or entered illegally. ICE combats terrorist financing, money laundering, and enforces export laws. Funding details can be found in Table 8 for all agencies in Title II, and Table 10 for ICE sub-account level details for FY2012 and FY2013. The funding for ICE in FY2013 reflects spending cuts compared to FY2012, with a decrease in net budget authority and gross budget authority. The budget request includes increases for the Alternatives to Detention program and ICE operations. The FY2013 budget for ICE includes increases for the Alternatives to Detention program, video conferencing expansion, and transferring the US-VISIT Program. There are reductions in funding for the 287(g) program, Office of Principle Legal Advisor, detention beds, and Secure Communities. The House-passed H.R. 5855 would have provided $5,474 million in net budget authority for FY2013, representing a decrease of $77 million from FY2012. The FY2013 budget for ICE includes increases for the Alternatives to Detention program and video conferencing expansion. House-passed H.R. 5855 would have provided ICE with total funding authority of $5,786 million, a decrease of $77 million from FY2012. Senate-Reported S. 3216 recommended $5,330 million in net budget authority for ICE, a decrease from the Administration's request. The FY2013 budget for ICE saw a decrease in funding from the FY2012 enacted level, with a net budget authority of $5,426 million. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2013 provided $5,738 million in gross budget authority. Sequestration further reduced ICE budget authority by roughly $200 million. Issues for Congress include the wide range of activities ICE is responsible for. ICE's responsibilities cover a wide range of civil and criminal violations, leading to ongoing debates on resource allocation. Part of their mission involves locating and removing deportable aliens, with a capacity to remove 400,000 aliens annually. The FY2013 appropriations process included discussions on ICE's role in immigration enforcement and the involvement of state and local law enforcement agencies. ICE has the capacity to remove 400,000 aliens annually. There is ongoing debate on how ICE should prioritize removal of removable aliens. H.R. 5855 directed ICE to prioritize removal of aliens convicted of a crime. ERO manages custody of aliens in removal proceedings and ensures their departure from the US. ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) is responsible for ensuring the departure of aliens ordered removed from the United States. Concerns have been raised about insufficient detention space leading to decisions on release based on space availability rather than individual case merits. Some policymakers advocate for alternatives to detention for noncriminal alien detainees as a cost-effective and proportional treatment. The number of detention beds maintained by ICE has been a contentious issue, with a reduction in bed space requested in the President's FY2013 budget. In 2013, ICE released 2,228 detainees. In early 2013, ICE released 2,228 detainees due to budget constraints and sequestration. Critics viewed the release as a political move to pressure Congress. ICE was required to maintain 34,000 detention beds for FY2013, leading to interest in alternative detention options for certain non-criminal aliens. ICE's Alternatives to Detention (ATD) program offers less restrictive monitoring options, such as electronic devices and home visits, for aliens awaiting hearings or appeals. The Administration proposed reducing detention bed space while increasing ATD funding. H.R. 5855 maintained bed space and added $20 million to ATD, while S. 3216 cut 600 beds and allocated $24 million to ATD. P.L. 113-6 funds 34,000 beds and boosts ATD funding by $19 million. The Administration's request included $139 million for Secure Communities, an information sharing program between DHS and the Department of Justice. ICE has deployed Secure Communities to 89% of all jurisdictions nationally and is seeking resources to expand the system nationwide by the end of FY2013. This expansion would help identify more removable aliens, including Level 1 offenders. House and Senate appropriators support the continued expansion of Secure Communities. The Administration requested $51 million for 287(g) agreements, a decrease of $17 million from the FY2012 enacted level. Debate surrounds the enforcement of immigration laws by state and local law enforcement agents, with concerns over training, resources, civil rights violations, and community impact. Some argue that federal resources are limited, and state and local entities should be utilized. The Administration requested $51 million for 287(g) agreements, a decrease of $17 million from the FY2012 enacted level. ICE plans to discontinue less productive 287(g) task force agreements in jurisdictions where Secure Communities is active. Senate-reported S. 3216 and H.R. 5855 had different funding proposals for the 287(g) program. P.L. 113-6 funds the 287(g) program at the FY2012 level of $68 million. ICE Public Advocate Office was created in 2012 to address concerns about ICE operations and policies. Some argue it is not productive and a misuse of resources. P.L. 113-6 prohibits funding for the Public Advocate position within ICE. TSA, established in 2001, is responsible for protecting transportation systems in the US. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) was established in 2001 under the Homeland Security Act to protect the aviation system and other modes of transportation from terrorist threats. TSA's responsibilities include deploying screeners, detection systems, and security technologies, assessing risks, issuing regulations, and serving as a liaison for transportation security. The TSA budget is a complex component of the DHS Appropriations bill. The TSA's budget is a complex component of the DHS Appropriations bill, with various sources of funding including airline security fees and other fees to offset costs. The President's request included a net direct discretionary appropriation of $5,130 million for TSA, representing a 2.5% decrease from the gross funding provided. The TSA's budget request for FY2013 was $5,130 million, a 2.5% decrease from the previous year. The request included $5,099 million for aviation security and $124 million for Surface Transportation Security, with planned reductions in procurement and maintenance costs. The TSA's budget request for FY2013 included increases in funding for transportation threat assessment and credentialing, as well as decreases in funding for Transportation Security Support and the Federal Air Marshals Service. Total budget request was $5,130 million, a 2.5% decrease from the previous year. The House-passed bill for TSA budget activities included a net direct discretionary appropriation of $5,098 million, representing a decrease from the administration's request. The bill specified $5,041 million for aviation security, rejecting proposed increases in passenger security fees. Additional cuts were recommended for screening operations, including reductions in screener workforce costs and checked baggage explosives detection equipment procurement. The House-passed bill for TSA budget activities included reductions in checked baggage explosives detection equipment procurement and transportation security support. The bill specified $193 million in direct appropriations and $80 million in fee collections for TTAC, in line with the request. However, there were reductions in transportation security support and FAMS funding. The House committee noted that these reductions were made to offset a budget shortfall due to the administration's reliance on passenger security fee increases that have not been enacted. The Senate accepted the Administration's proposed increases in offsetting passenger security fees, resulting in a $211 million reduction in net appropriations for TSA. This included cuts to checkpoint equipment and explosives detection systems procurement, citing unobligated prior-year balances. The Appropriations Committee report cited unobligated prior-year balances for reductions in funding, including a $8 million cut to screener staffing. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding levels for various security programs, with a total budget authority of $7,551 million provided to TSA in P.L. 113-6. Sequestration further reduced TSA's budget authority by $339 million, leading to a projected total spending of $7,212 million in FY2013. Table 12 shows funding levels for TSA program functions under the DHS Plan, assessing resources post-sequester from P.L. 113-6. Passenger security fees under ATSA are set at $2.50 per flight segment, not exceeding $5.00 per one-way trip. Concerns have been raised about the fee structure not accurately reflecting passenger usage. Airlines oppose fee increases, citing potential impacts on air travel. The Administration proposed a flat fee structure in the FY2013 budget submission. The Administration proposed changing the fee structure to a flat fee of $5.00 per one-way trip, doubling the fee on direct flights. This change is estimated to increase revenue collections by $317 million, with $117 million going towards aviation security costs and $200 million towards deficit reduction. Past administrations have also proposed fee increases, but the current proposal has gained support from the Senate Appropriations Committee. The Senate committee approved using all passenger security fees for aviation security in FY2013, but lacked jurisdiction for a permanent fee increase. The House Appropriations Committee did not include the proposal, citing jurisdictional issues. P.L. 113-6 did not change passenger security fees, with TSA identifying over $100 million in savings from improved management efficiencies. The FY2013 budget includes funding for aviation security, surface transportation, TTAC, and FAMS. Management efficiencies have led to savings through reductions in travel, conferences, purchasing, support contracts, and overtime pay. Questions have been raised about why inefficiencies were not corrected sooner and about procedures to meet efficiency goals. Efficiency improvements are crucial for addressing budget sequestration impacts at TSA, which has implemented risk-based screening initiatives like PreCheck and modified procedures for children. The FY2013 budget includes funding for aviation security, surface transportation, TTAC, and FAMS. TSA has implemented modified screening procedures for children 12 and under, trial programs for screening flight crew members, and elderly passengers. The PreCheck program is a cornerstone of TSA's risk-based initiatives, modeled after CBP programs like Global Entry. Expansion of the PreCheck program is planned for FY2013. The House and Senate committees supported TSA's PreCheck program in FY2013, citing it as a rational risk-based approach to screening to increase efficiency and reduce workforce requirements. They directed TSA to report on expansion plans for PreCheck, including statistics on eligible population, passenger satisfaction, public awareness efforts, time savings, and security measures for low-risk verification. The Senate committee also pushed for expanding the known crew member pilot program to include flight attendants. The House committee report criticized TSA's proposal to increase Behavior Detection Officers (BDOs) without clear evidence of their effectiveness in aviation security. They called for a cost-benefit analysis and a risk-based strategy for BDO deployment. TSA was required to provide semiannual briefings on trusted traveler approaches and budgetary constraints. A $13 million reduction in funds for the Federal Flight Deck was specified in the budget justification. The House Appropriations Committee recommended keeping the Federal Flight Deck Officer (FFDO) program at the FY2012 level. They also passed an amendment to increase FFDO funding by an additional $10 million to $36 million, offset by reductions in other areas. The House directed the TSA to revisit the use of FFDOs and other federal law enforcement assets on commercial aircraft for better coordination with air marshals. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $24 million for the Federal Flight Deck Officer (FFDO) program and crew member training, disagreeing with a request to reduce funding. The Coast Guard is the lead agency for maritime homeland security, responsible for U.S. port security and other missions like search and rescue. The Coast Guard, responsible for maritime security, was transferred to DHS in 2003. The President requested $8,377 million in appropriations, with the House and Senate recommending more funding for capital acquisitions. The Coast Guard was transferred to DHS in 2003. The President requested $8,377 million in appropriations, with the House and Senate recommending more funding for capital acquisitions. P.L. 113-6 provided USCG with $10,400 million in total gross budget authority, $68 million more than FY2012. Sequestration reduced USCG budget authority by $268 million, with projected spending in FY2013 at $10,132 million. Funding levels for USCG operating expenses and acquisition functions are outlined in Table 13. The assessment of budgetary resources available through P.L. 113-6 after sequestration was applied as of April 26, 2013. The largest differences in FY2013 funding recommendations between the President's request and House and Senate bills concerned vessel and aircraft acquisition. The President requested $139 million for two new fast response cutters, while the House and Senate bills funded more vessels and aircraft. The President requested $64 million for long-range aircraft in the DOD's budget, with no funds for MH-60 helicopters. The Senate did not request funds for these aircraft under the Coast Guard's appropriation. P.L. 113-6 requires a capital investment plan for FY2014-FY2018. DHS's sequestration plan allocates $1,030 million for vessel acquisitions, including $646 million for a national security cutter, $319 million for fast response cutters, and $8 million for a new icebreaker. For aircraft, the plan reduces funding from $191 million to $181 million, with $86 million for long-range aircraft. The Coast Guard's effort to replace or modernize its fleet of vessels has been a major issue for Congress. The House bill provided $56 million for Coast Guard housing and aids to navigation, including $31 million for shore facilities backlog and $10 million for the new headquarters building. P.L. 113-6 allocated $30 million for housing and aids to navigation, reduced to $29 million due to DHS's sequestration plan. The House Appropriations Committee Report called for implementing card readers at ports. The Coast Guard is urged to implement card readers for TWIC at ports and vessels. The Senate Committee requested a briefing on Interagency Operations Centers. The U.S. Secret Service has missions in criminal investigations and protection. The U.S. Secret Service is responsible for criminal investigation activities such as financial crimes, identity theft, and computer fraud. They also have a protection mission covering the President, Vice President, their families, and other designated individuals. Additionally, they provide security at National Special Security Events. The U.S. Secret Service, designated by the President, has authority to coordinate security for events in the United States. The Administration requested $1,601 million for FY2013, with $988 million for protection, $324 million for investigation, and 7,061 personnel. The House-passed DHS appropriations bill recommended $1,613 million, a decrease from FY2012 but more than the Administration's request. The Senate-reported version of the DHS appropriations bill for FY2013 recommended an appropriation of $1,613 million for the U.S. Secret Service, reflecting a decrease from FY2012 but $12 million above the Administration's request. This amount included funding restoration for specific programs and an increase for Electronic Crimes Special Agent Program and Electronic Crimes Task Forces. The Senate-approved DHS appropriations bill for FY2013 allocated $1.611 billion for the U.S. Secret Service, which was $56 million less than the previous year. Following the sequester, the Service planned to spend $1.527 billion, with a reduction in funding primarily for protection and investigation missions. The Senate also approved the Director's actions in addressing improper behavior by Secret Service agents in Colombia. Table 14 details the Secret Service funding levels for FY2013, showing budgetary resources available after sequestration. Congress faces the challenge of balancing the Service's investigative and protective missions, with a focus on the protection mission receiving more resources and congressional attention due to recent agent misconduct. The Secret Service's funding levels for FY2013 are detailed in Table 14, with a focus on balancing its investigative and protective missions. Congressional attention has primarily addressed the Service's protection mission, which has seen an increase in resources due to recent agent misconduct. The Administration requested $5,911 million for accounts in FY2013, with the House-passed bill proposing $5,930 million. The need for protection activities has increased due to potential terrorist attacks and threats to the President. The House-passed bill and Senate-reported bill for FY2013 proposed funding levels slightly above the requested amount, with provisions for disaster relief offset by adjustments under the Budget Control Act. The enacted amount after cuts but before sequestration was $5,920 million, with additional funding of $6,400 million for disaster relief. The National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD) was established in response to the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006. It includes the Office of the Under Secretary for NPPD, Office of Infrastructure Protection, and Office of Cybersecurity and Communications. The Administration plans to relocate the US-VISIT program from NPPD to other areas within the Department. The House proposes relocating some functions of the US-VISIT program within the Department. The FY2013 budget request for NPPD activities is $1,217 million, $29 million less than FY2012. The Management and Administration budget request is $50 million, similar to FY2012. The FY2013 budget request for IPIS is $1,167 million, a $278 million increase from FY2012. The increase is mainly for securing federal information systems, with a $202 million initiative for Federal Network Security and a $116 million increase for Network Security Deployment. The Network Security Deployment project aims to support the deployment of the National Cybersecurity Protection System (NCPS) and expand the 3.0 version for active defenses. Additional funding includes $15 million for US-CERT to analyze data from NCPS and $5 million for MS-ISAC to assist state and local governments in cybersecurity efforts. The FY2013 budget request for NPPD decreased funding in infrastructure protection and communications activities. Infrastructure protection funding was reduced by $40 million (13.7%), mainly due to a $19 million (20.1%) reduction in the Infrastructure Security Compliance project budget. This reduction was considered a baseline adjustment, with $16 million attributed to NPPD's ability to obligated funds. Another $8 million reduction was associated with the elimination of contract support for incident planning exercises. The House proposed $1,347 million for NPPD, with $45 million for Management and Administration, $1,110 million for IPIS, and $191 million for OBIM. They allocated $5 million less for Management and Administration due to concerns about TSA fee increases and CBP fee revenues. The reduction in IPIS funding was due to problems with the Security Compliance project and unobligated funds. The House proposed reductions in funding for various projects within NPPD, including $17 million for the deployment of the NCPS and $3 million for the Global Cybersecurity Management project. They also directed NPPD to collaborate with the Coast Guard and consider alternative security programs. Additionally, the House cut $7 million from the Programs to Study and Enhance Telecommunications project but provided the full $202 million increase for the Federal Network Security project initiative. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $1,220 million for NPPD, with specific allocations for Management and Administration and IPIS. Additional funding was provided for bombing prevention, vulnerability assessments, and the Security Compliance project. The Committee acknowledged unobligated funds for the project and stated that extra funds would be needed for future implementation plans later in the fiscal year. The Committee recommended funding adjustments for the Federal Network Security project, withholding $120 million until an expenditure plan is produced. They also suggested clarifying the new centralized structure and allocated additional funds for cybersecurity education and critical infrastructure projects. The Committee recommended funding adjustments for cybersecurity projects, including the Infrastructure Cybersecurity and Awareness project. They also highlighted the importance of the National Cyber Security Review and recommended increases for emergency communication projects. P.L. 113-6 provides $1,439 million for NPPD/IPIS and OBIM, with specific allocations for Management and Administration, the IPIS program, and Biometric Identity. According to the FY2013 operating plan, NPPD/IPIS and OBIM would receive $1,337 million post-sequestration. The FY2014 operating plan indicates $48 million for Management and Administration, $1,065 million for IPIS, and $224 million for Biometric Identity Management. Specific allocations for IPIS include funding for the Office of Bombing Prevention, vulnerability assessments, cybersecurity education, and CFATS. $16.9 million allocated for cybersecurity education, $77.9 million for CFATS, with $20.0 million on hold pending an expenditure plan from Congress. $202 million from the Federal Network Security program to assist federal agencies in acquiring monitoring equipment. GAO and Coast Guard to monitor DHS progress on CFATS program development and inspections. NPPD to provide semiannual reports on compliance program. NPPD was directed to provide semiannual reports on compliance program and briefing on security programs. Agencies instructed to submit expenditure plans for cybersecurity improvement efforts. OMB to receive quarterly reports on plan execution and provide annual summary to Congress. Table outlines FY2012 and FY2013 funding levels for IPIS program. DHS Plan column shows post-sequester resources assessment. The Department of Homeland Security is likely to make transfers and reprogramming to address sequestration impacts. An internal review identified issues with CFATS compliance program. Congress is interested in oversight of cybersecurity, focusing on various bills related to information sharing and protecting federal systems. The Federal Protective Service (FPS), under the National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD), is responsible for securing federal property and buildings, focusing on reducing vulnerability to criminal and terrorist threats through risk assessments and countermeasures. The Federal Protective Service (FPS) is responsible for securing federal property and buildings by implementing countermeasures like vehicle barriers and cameras, assisting federal agencies, and providing safety education programs. FPS is the lead agency for the National Infrastructure Protection Plan and employs around 1,225 law enforcement officers and administrative personnel. The President's FY2013 budget request included $1,302 million for FPS, a $40 million increase from FY2012, funded by security fees charged to GSA building tenants. The Federal Protective Service (FPS) budget is funded by security fees charged to GSA building tenants. The FY2013 budget request includes $272 million for basic security operations, $509 million for building-specific security operations, and $521 million for Security Work Authorizations. The House-passed H.R. 5855 and Senate Appropriations Committee made no specific changes to the FPS budget but required briefings on management and budget improvement efforts. No specific changes to the FPS budget were recommended in P.L. 113-6. FPS was directed to brief appropriations committees on their progress in implementing recommendations from a GAO report. Congress is concerned about aspects of FPS mission and funding, including improving training for contract guards, federalizing contract guards, developing standards for checkpoint detection technologies, and coordinating with the Interagency Security Committee. Legislation has been introduced to address these issues. In the 112th and 113th Congress, legislation was introduced to enhance federal building security and FPS capabilities. H.R. 735 aims to improve FPS staffing and pilot federal employee use over contract guards. The Office of Health Affairs oversees various programs, including BioWatch and NBIC, and coordinates DHS programs with public health components. The Office of Health Affairs (OHA) received $167 million in FY2012 appropriations, with a requested $166 million for FY2013. The proposed allocation includes funding for the BioWatch program, NBIC, Chemical Defense Program, Planning and Coordination, and Salaries and Expenses. The House-passed bill would have provided $132 million for FY2013, reflecting a decrease in funding for the BioWatch program. The Senate-reported bill for FY2013 allocated $168 million for the Office of Health Affairs, with small increases for Planning and Coordination and Salaries and Expenses. After across-the-board cuts, P.L. 113-6 provided $132 million for OHA, $35 million less than FY2012. The enacted funding amounts for OHA components for FY2013 reflect decreased funding for BioWatch due to sequestration. The DHS Plan column shows post-sequester resources provided by P.L. 113-6 as of April 26, 2013, with potential transfers and reprogramming to mitigate sequestration impact. The House Appropriations Committee highlighted the separation of DHS activities to monitor threats posed by weapons of mass destruction in its report on FY2013 funding recommendations. The House Appropriations Committee highlighted the separation of DHS activities to monitor threats posed by weapons of mass destruction (WMD), specifically the consolidation plan to merge DNDO and OHA into an Office of Weapons of Mass Destruction Defense for FY2014. The Senate directed the Secretary to submit a comprehensive review of WMD operations, including possible performance improvements and cost savings from an OHA/DNDO merger, by September 1, 2013. The BioWatch program, which detects bioterrorism pathogens in U.S. cities, is a major part of OHA's budget. There have been challenges with deploying more advanced sensors, known as \"Gen-3,\" due to technical and management issues. The estimated cost for Gen-3 is $5.8 billion, raising questions about its justification. Members of Congress have been monitoring BioWatch's performance closely. The BioWatch program's performance has drawn attention from Members of Congress, who have sought to limit funding and called for program reviews. The decreased funding for FY2013 hinders the development of Gen-3 capability. FEMA's primary mission is to reduce loss of life and property and protect the nation from hazards through various activities. FEMA's funding for FY2013 includes a total discretionary appropriation of $4,528 million, with an additional $5,481 million for the Disaster Relief Fund. The requested amount is a 6.1% increase from FY2012. House-passed H.R. 5855 proposed a slightly lower appropriation of $4,451 million for FEMA. The House and Senate proposed different funding amounts for FEMA in FY2013. The House suggested $4,451 million, while the Senate recommended $4,582 million. Ultimately, P.L. 113-6 allocated $4,351 million for FEMA, which was $84 million more than FY2012 but $177 million less than the President's request. The bill allocates $6,400 for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) under the Stafford Act, funded by the disaster relief cap adjustment. FEMA is expected to receive $4,150 million from Title III provisions and $6,076 million from the BCA adjustment post-sequestration. The full range of FEMA's resources is not reflected in these numbers, as additional funding was provided by P.L. 113-2. State and local governments have primary responsibility for domestic public safety functions. State and local governments may reduce resources for public safety and homeland security preparedness due to fiscal constraints. President Obama issued a directive for a national preparedness goal in coordination with various government levels. The national preparedness goal, informed by specific threats and vulnerabilities, includes measurable objectives to mitigate risks. It defines core capabilities needed to prepare for incidents posing the greatest risk to the nation's security, superseding a previous directive after 9/11. The National Preparedness Goal (NPG) was developed under PPD 8 to identify core capabilities and targets for a secure and resilient nation. Before 9/11, only three federal grant programs existed for homeland security. Since then, additional grant programs have been added to enhance preparedness. Several homeland security grant programs were added to ensure state and local preparedness, including SHSGP, CCP, UASI, REAL ID, Stonegarden, RCPG, Transit Grants, Port Security, Over-the-Road, BZPP, IECGP, and EOC. Federal assistance for preparedness activities is only a small percentage of overall state and local spending for public safety. The total expenditures for all state and local governments for public safety amount to $218 billion annually, including costs for police protection, fire protection, correction, and inspections. Federal grant programs for state and local preparedness make up less than one percent of public safety expenditures. The President requested $1.8 billion in federal grants for homeland security preparedness in FY2013, with plans to establish a National Preparedness Grant Program consolidating various state and local preparedness grant programs. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees expressed concerns about the Administration's proposal to consolidate state and local preparedness grant programs under a National Preparedness Grant Program in FY2013. The House recommended $1.7 billion for State and Local Programs, an increase of $300 million from FY2012. The House Appropriations Committee rejected the consolidation proposal for state and local programs in FY2013, recommending continued funding through various grant programs under the discretion of the Secretary of Homeland Security. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended funding for various homeland security programs in FY2013. The House provided $1.7 billion, with allocations for Operation Stonegarden, high-risk areas, and education/training. The Senate recommended $1.6 billion, with funding for State Homeland Security Grant Program, Urban Area Security Initiative, Public Transportation Security, Port Security Grants, and education/training. In FY2013, $234 million was allocated for education, training, and exercises. Despite cuts, P.L. 113-6 provided $1,467 million for state and local programs, a 20.3% decrease from the requested level. Sequestration further reduced FEMA's state and local grants program budget by $77 million. The DHS FY2013 expenditure plan projected $1,400 million for state and local programs. P.L. 113-6 removed a transfer from grant programs, increasing actual funding available for grants by $132 million compared to FY2012. Table 18 outlines funding levels for FEMA state and local programs. The \"DHS Plan\" column assesses post-sequester resources from P.L. 113-6 as of April 26, 2013. The Administration's FY2013 budget proposed $670 million for firefighter assistance, with $335 million each for AFG and SAFER grants. Grant administration would shift to the SLP Management and Administration office starting in FY2013. The Administration requested legislative language for SAFER grants to maintain firefighter staffing levels. The House-passed bill funded firefighter assistance at $675 million, denying the request to shift AFG and SAFER grants. The Senate-reported bill proposed the same funding amount for firefighter assistance. The Senate Committee denied the Administration's request to shift AFG and SAFER grants into the State and Local Programs account. Post-sequestration, P.L. 113-6 funds firefighter assistance at $642 million. Administrative costs are derived from the FEMA Salaries and Expense account. DHS has the requested SAFER waiver authority for FY2013. The DRF is the main account used to fund emergency and disaster assistance programs. The Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) provides various forms of emergency and disaster assistance to states, local governments, nonprofits, and individuals affected by disasters. The DRF is funded annually through regular appropriations but often runs out of funds before the end of the fiscal year due to high demand for assistance. This reliance on supplemental funding has been attributed to underfunding the DRF, with average monthly expenditures exceeding the regular appropriations. In FY2013, the Administration requested $6,088 million for the DRF, a decrease of $1,011 million from previous years. The FY2013 request for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) was $6,088 million, a decrease of $1,011 million from previous years. The request included $608 million for non-disaster related activities and $5,481 million for disaster relief costs for major disasters under the Stafford Act. This structure reflects the impact of the Budget Control Act, allowing these costs to be paid through an \"allowable adjustment\" to discretionary spending caps. The FY2013 request for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) was $6,088 million, including funding for past declared catastrophic events and a reserve to prevent shortfalls. Both the House-passed and Senate-reported bills matched the Administration's funding request. Additionally, $24 million was transferred from the DRF to the DHS Office of Inspector General for audits and investigations on disaster-related spending. After cuts, P.L. 113-6 funded the DRF at $7,007 million. P.L. 113-6 funds the DRF at $7,007 million, with $24 million allocated for audits by the DHS Office of Inspector General. Despite a 5% reduction due to sequestration, the funding exceeds the Administration's initial request by $918 million. The Budget Control Act allows for adjustments to provide additional budget authority for disaster relief costs incurred under the Stafford Act. The Budget Control Act allows adjustments to the discretionary budget caps for federal costs incurred by major disasters declared under the Stafford Act. Funding for \"disaster relief\" under the BCA is different from the Disaster Relief Fund, which receives funding from various federal accounts. During Hurricane Sandy in 2012, the DRF had access to $7.3 billion from a continuing resolution. The Disaster Relief Fund received $7.3 billion in funding from a continuing resolution due to Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Additional resources totaling $11,485 million were approved through the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013 to meet high demand. Congress provided emergency funding for disaster assistance. In FY2013, the Disaster Relief Fund received full funding under the Budget Control Act for disaster relief. The Administration proposed eliminating the Pre-Disaster Mitigation program, suggesting it duplicated other mitigation programs. The PDM program awarded funds before disasters, unlike the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program. The Administration proposed phasing out the Pre-Disaster Mitigation program, which focuses on flood hazards, while the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program covers all hazards. There were concerns about the slow pace of awards and large unobligated balances, with the House and Senate bills allocating small amounts for the program. Additionally, both chambers planned to rescind funding from unobligated balances, particularly congressionally directed funds that local communities have not utilized. The DHS operating plan for FY2013 allocated just under $25 million for the PDM program, presenting challenges due to reduced funding levels. FEMA may use existing, unfunded applications to continue the program cycle. The EFS program saw reduced funding requests in FY2013, with Congress funding it at $120 million in FY2012. In FY2012, Congress funded the EFS program at $120 million, $20 million over the requested level. For FY2013, the Senate suggested raising the funding to $150 million, but the post-sequester funding level is just under $114 million, the lowest since FY2000. Concerns also arise from delayed distribution of funds in FY2012, taking nine months to begin distributing assistance. The Administration requested $1,561 million for FLETC, S&T, and the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office in FY2013, with the House-passed bill providing $1,510 million and the Senate-reported bill providing $1,535 million. P.L. 113-6 ultimately allocated $1,520 million for these accounts, a decrease of 0.5% from the requested level and 2.2% above FY2012. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) receives direct appropriations for adjudicating immigration petitions, naturalization petitions, and refugee/asylum claims. Fee income is not included in the appropriations but funds processing and adjudication of various benefits. USCIS funds its operations through revenues from the Examinations Fee Account, receiving direct appropriations for specific projects like reducing backlogs and the E-Verify program. Most revenue comes from adjudication fees, with a requested budget authority of $3,005 million for FY2013, including $143 million from direct appropriations. The FY2013 budget request includes $11 million for the Immigrant Integration Initiative and $20 million for the SAVE Program. The remaining $2,862 million in budget authority is expected to be funded by fee collections, with $2,391 million for adjudication services, $89 million for information and customer services, and $382 million for administration expenses. The House-passed H.R. 5855 proposed a gross budget authority of $3,004 million for USCIS in FY2013, with $112 million from direct appropriations and $2,892 million from fee collections. This amount was $31 million less than the requested amount but $9.5 million above the FY2012 funding level. The House Appropriations Committee recommended a budget level for USCIS in FY2013 that did not include funds for a requested pay increase. They directed USCIS to use fee revenues for all costs except E-Verify, which was funded as requested. The Committee emphasized the importance of monitoring USCIS' fee revenues and recommended allocating $20 million for the SAVE program and $29 million for digital conversion of immigration records. They did not provide funding for military naturalizations, suggesting it should be funded by the Department of Defense and directed USCIS to codify this in a memorandum of understanding. The House Committee expressed concerns about USCIS adjudication procedures and fraud detection, directing USCIS to provide a progress report on corrective actions. The Senate-reported budget proposal for USCIS in FY2013 included $2,999 million in gross budget authority, with $117 million from direct appropriations and $2,882 million from fee collections. The Committee recommended allocating $20 million for the SAVE program and $112 million for the E-Verify program. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $112 million for the E-Verify program. They also directed that no appropriations be used to operate the Office of Citizenship Services and that its operations continue to be fee-funded. Additionally, they expressed concerns about the costs of administering the Immigrant Integration grant program and limited the use of grant funding for administration to no more than 5%. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2013 provided $114 million for these programs, a decrease of $29 million from the requested amount. The DHS FY2013 operating plan indicates sequestration would reduce USCIS funding to $109 million, with potential issues for Congress including fee-generated funding concerns and the USCIS Transformation program. The USCIS Transformation program aims to convert the immigration application process to an online system. USCIS must monitor fee revenues to avoid backlogs. Congress is debating how to fund immigrant integration grants. The House and Senate Committees allocated $7.5 million from fee revenue for immigrant integration grants in FY2013. An additional $2.5 million was appropriated for the grants. The House Committee expressed disappointment with the lack of progress on the USCIS Transformation program. They questioned the justification of continued investment in the current contract. The House and Senate Committees allocated funds for immigrant integration grants in FY2013. The House Committee expressed disappointment with the lack of progress on the USCIS Transformation program and questioned the justification of continued investment in the current contract. Congress is concerned about the operability of the E-Verify program and directed USCIS to provide updates on its efforts. The House bill extended the authorization of E-Verify for one year and directed USCIS to create a review process for final non-confirmations. The Senate Committee requested a report on the cost of expanding E-Verify and recommendations for its use in the agricultural industry. The House Committee supports efforts to increase efficiency in the agricultural industry by converting immigration records to digital format through the Enterprise Document Management System (EDMS). They also directed USCIS to eliminate the paper version of USCIS Form I-94. The Committee expressed concerns about the loss of personal documentation and urged USCIS to continue efforts to reduce the need for paper files. The House Committee expressed concerns about coordinating security and non-security clearance procedures for vulnerable individuals in need of resettlement to the United States. They urged DHS to review refugee processing to streamline procedures while maintaining security vetting. The Senate Committee encouraged DHS to use parole authority for urgent humanitarian needs, such as family unity and medical emergencies after natural disasters like the Haitian earthquake in 2010. They also urged the Secretary to allocate resources for similar responsiveness in the future. The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) provides law enforcement instruction to various entities, promoting consistency and collaboration. It has four training sites across the US, employs around 1,100 personnel, and offers online and on-site training. The Administration proposed a budget of $258 million for FLETC, a reduction from previous funding levels. The Administration proposed a budget of $258 million for FLETC, a reduction of $13 million (4.8%) from FY2012's appropriation. The budget includes Salaries and Expenses at $229 million and Acquisition, Construction, Improvements, and Related Expenses at $29 million. Reductions were made in basic training and construction work was deferred. House-passed H.R. 5855 included $256 million for FLETC, $16 million below last year's level. The House Appropriations Committee report cited the Administration's reliance on unauthorized fee increases as the reason for reducing the acquisition budget. Senate-reported S. 3216 included $258 million for FLETC, matching the President's request. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2013 provided $257 million for FLETC, a $1 million decrease from the requested level. Sequestration would further reduce funding to $245 million. The operating plan indicates sequestration would reduce funding to $245 million for the Directorate of Science and Technology (S&T) in FY2013, which was 25% more than the FY2012 appropriation. The S&T Directorate is the primary DHS organization for research and development, conducting R&D in its own laboratories and funding R&D in DOE national laboratories, industry, and universities. The Administration requested $831 million for the S&T Directorate in FY2013, with a significant increase in Research, Development, and Innovation (RDI) funding. The FY2013 budget for the Research, Development, and Innovation (RDI) saw a significant increase of $212 million, with the largest increase in funding for disaster resilience R&D. There was a reduction of $50 million in the request for Laboratory Facilities due to the lack of construction funding for the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF). The House-passed bill would have provided $826 million for the S&T Directorate, slightly less than the Administration's request. The House Appropriations Committee directed DHS to determine how to allocate a $6 million reduction in funding for the S&T Directorate, with $72 million less than the request for RDI. The bill included $75 million more for Laboratory Facilities, to be spent on NBAF construction. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding levels matching the Administration's request, with separate amounts specified for each of the six thrust areas within RDI. No funding was recommended for NBAF construction, citing a total cost estimate of $1.138 billion. P.L. 113-6 provides $834 million for the S&T Directorate after rescissions, $28 million less than the request. P.L. 113-6 provides $834 million for the S&T Directorate, with $28 million less than the request for RDI. The act also allocates $37 million more for Laboratory Facilities, specifically for NBAF construction. The post-sequester total for the S&T Directorate is reported at $801 million. The Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) is responsible for DHS nuclear detection research and development to combat nuclear threats. The DNDO is responsible for DHS nuclear detection research and development. The Administration requested $328 million for DNDO for FY2013, with increases in Transformational R&D funding. The House-passed bill would have provided $316 million for DNDO. The House-passed bill proposed $316 million for DNDO, $12 million less than requested. Reductions would mainly affect the Transformational R&D program. The bill directed DHS to provide an updated implementation plan for its responsibilities under the global nuclear detection architecture. The House Appropriations Committee suggested merging DNDO with the DHS Office of Health Affairs for cost savings and better coordination in efforts against weapons of mass destruction. They directed DHS to submit a plan for merging DNDO and OHA into an Office of Weapons of Mass Destruction Defense for FY2014. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding levels for DNDO that matched the Administration's request. They also directed DHS to provide an updated implementation plan for its responsibilities under the global nuclear detection architecture. The Senate report did not mention the potential consolidation of DNDO and OHA. P.L. 113-6 provided $318 million for DNDO after rescissions, $9 million less than requested for Transformational R&D. The act also instructed DHS to submit an updated implementation plan for its domestic responsibilities. The explanatory statement directs DHS to review its WMD programs and evaluate the potential advantages of consolidation, including merging DNDO and OHA. The post-sequester total appropriation for DNDO is $303 million, with funding levels outlined for existing program functions. The \"DHS Plan\" column provides the department's assessment of post-sequester resources as of April 26, 2013. The DHS appropriations bill includes general provisions for transfers and reprogramming to address sequestration impacts. The Administration proposed not carrying forward 35 general provisions from the previous year's bill. The Administration proposed not carrying forward 35 general provisions from the previous year's bill, including rescissions and one-time provisions. They suggested adding five new general provisions, such as extending the termination deadline for E-Verify and allowing FEMA to use earmarked grant funds. The House-passed H.R. 5855 includes $292 million in rescissions in Title V, reducing the net scoring of the bill. The House concurred with dropping 22 general provisions but did not agree on 13 others. The House Appropriations Committee added a provision to extend the termination deadline for certain programs. The House added 13 general provisions to the bill during floor action, including prohibiting funds for certain activities like racial profiling, enforcing a proposed ICE rule, paying for a Public Advocate within ICE, enforcing a section of the Energy Independence and Security Act, and implementing other restrictions. The House added 13 general provisions to the bill, including restrictions on funds for activities like racial profiling, enforcing ICE rules, and purchasing armed unmanned aerial vehicles. The Senate-reported S. 3216 includes provisions such as restrictions on funds for racial profiling, enforcing ICE rules, purchasing armed unmanned aerial vehicles, and terminating agreements allowing local officials to act as immigration officers. It also includes $192 million in rescissions in Title V and other provisions impacting the scoring of the bill. The Senate bill provisions in Title V and other sections offset costs by $68 million. The Senate concurred with dropping 15 general provisions but disagreed on 17 others. Three provisions for DHS funding were modified for FY2013. The Senate Appropriations Committee added one of the five general provisions requested. The Senate Appropriations Committee added a provision allowing CBP to enter into reimbursable fee agreements for providing services. The enacted bill included $307 million in rescissions and several provisions impacting the scoring of the bill. Overall, these provisions offset the cost of the act by $202 million. Additionally, funding for DHS initiatives such as immigrant integration grants and reimbursement of security costs to state and local governments for National Special Security Events were included. The Senate-reported bill funded reimbursement of security costs for National Special Security Events, migration and consolidation of DHS data centers, and DHS headquarters consolidation. Federal government spending involves budget authority, obligations, and outlays determined by appropriations acts or direct spending legislation. The Antideficiency Act prohibits agencies from obligating more funds than the budget allows. The Antideficiency Act restricts federal agencies from exceeding budget authority enacted by Congress. Budget authority can be one-year, multi-year, or no-year, dictating when funds can be spent. Obligations are incurred when agencies engage in transactions, while outlays are the actual funds spent during the fiscal year. Budget authority allows federal agencies to incur obligations and authorize payments to be made from the Treasury. It consists of discretionary and mandatory spending, with discretionary spending appropriated yearly by Congress through appropriations acts. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 defines discretionary appropriations as budget authority provided in annual appropriation acts, excluding entitlements. Mandatory spending, known as direct spending, consists of budget authority provided in laws other than appropriation acts. Some mandatory entitlement programs must be appropriated each year. Within DHS, Coast Guard retirement pay is an example of appropriated mandatory spending. Offsetting funds are collected by the federal government as part of business-type transactions and are counted as negative outlays. The DHS net discretionary budget authority is composed of discretionary spending minus any fee or fund collections that offset discretionary spending. Some collections offset an agency's discretionary budget authority, while others offset mandatory spending. The DHS budget includes two mandatory entitlement programs: the Secret Service and the Coast Guard retired pay accounts. Secret Service retirement pay is funded by permanent appropriations. The DHS budget includes offsetting Trust and Public Enterprise Funds, which are not appropriated by Congress but are used to calculate the gross budget authority. Since 9/11, there has been a growing interest in homeland security funding, with the Office of Management and Budget reporting on combating terrorism annually. In the June 24, 2002 edition of the report, homeland security funding analysis has become more refined over the years, with distinctions between homeland and non-homeland security activities becoming more precise. While Table B-1 allows for year-to-year comparisons, the increasing specificity of the analysis may affect strict comparability. DHS funding does not encompass all federal spending on homeland security, with DHS budget for FY2012 accounting for 52% of total federal funding, followed by the Department of Defense at nearly 26%. The top five agencies in federal spending on homeland security collectively accounted for approximately 93% of the total budget authority. Not all DHS funding is classified as homeland security-related, with legacy agencies also conducting other activities. The total budget authority for DHS was $52.5 billion, with inconsistencies in reporting between different sources. Inconsistencies in reporting exist between homeland security budget authority and total budget authority for various agencies listed in the table. The Administration's budget lacks authoritative data for FY2013 due to the absence of estimates accounting for P.L. 113-6 or sequestration impact."
