    "content": "The \"Citizen Empowerment Act\" may be cited as the official title. Part III of title 5, United States Code, is amended by adding a new chapter 79A for services to members of the public. The \"Citizen Empowerment Act\" establishes procedures for in-person and telephonic interactions conducted by executive branch employees regarding possible violations of federal statutes or regulations. The \"Citizen Empowerment Act\" defines terms such as individual, State, and telephonic. It also allows individuals to record interactions with executive agency employees at their own expense. Employees can also record interactions if they follow certain guidelines. Employees of Executive agencies must inform individuals before recording interactions and provide a transcript upon request, with reimbursement. Additionally, employees must explain individuals' rights before or at the start of interactions. Employees of Executive agencies must inform individuals before recording interactions and provide a transcript upon request, with reimbursement. Any person representing an individual before an Executive agency can make an audio recording of a covered interaction and receive a transcript as if they were the individual. The individual must be notified and given rights to audio recordings and transcripts. The individual owns any recordings made or provided to them. There is no private right of action created by this section. Exceptions apply for classified information, public safety, and criminal investigations. Exceptions to the investigation section include discussions involving classified material, information endangering public safety, or ongoing criminal investigations by federal law enforcement officers. Employees must provide written notification if an exception applies to a covered interaction. The determination of covered interactions must be notified in writing to individuals allowed to make audio recordings. This section supersedes previous laws related to recording covered interactions and mandates disciplinary action for violations by Executive agency employees. The section 79A mandates services to members of the public."
