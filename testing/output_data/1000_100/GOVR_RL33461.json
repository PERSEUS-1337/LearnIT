    "content": "President Trump proposes to resume development of the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository in Nevada, with a budget request of $120 million for the Department of Energy and $47.7 million for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in FY2019. The House passed an appropriations bill that includes $100 million more than the Administration's request. The House passed an appropriations bill (H.R. 5895) on June 8, 2018, with $100 million more than the Administration's request for Yucca Mountain funding. The Senate version of the bill, passed on June 25, 2018, does not include funding for Yucca Mountain. Despite the Obama Administration's halt in funding for the project after FY2010, Yucca Mountain remains the sole candidate site for a national high-level radioactive waste repository under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982. The Obama Administration terminated the Yucca Mountain repository project and established the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future to develop a new nuclear waste policy. The commission recommended creating a new organization for developing nuclear waste repositories and storage facilities through a consent-based process. The Department of Energy issued a Strategy for the Management and Disposal of Used Nuclear Waste in response to the commission's report. The DOE issued a Strategy for the Management and Disposal of Used Nuclear Fuel and High-Level Waste in 2013, calling for a new nuclear waste management entity to develop consent-based storage and disposal sites. The strategy included plans for a pilot interim spent fuel storage facility by 2021, a larger-scale storage facility by 2025, and a geologic disposal facility by 2048. In 2017, a draft consent-based siting process was issued, and in 2018, a bill was approved to withdraw the Yucca Mountain site for nuclear waste storage. The NRC completed the Safety Evaluation Report for the Yucca Mountain repository, stating that the design would meet safety and environmental standards. However, construction authorization is pending until all land and water rights requirements are met and a supplement to the environmental impact statement is completed. The NRC completed the Safety Evaluation Report for the Yucca Mountain repository, stating that the design would meet safety and environmental standards. A supplement to the DOE's environmental impact statement was completed, and NRC made its licensing documents publicly available. The Trump Administration is requesting funds for NRC licensing activities and DOE to defend its license application for the repository. The Obama Administration issued a draft plan for a separate underground repository for high-level radioactive waste. The effort to develop a defense-only repository for high-level radioactive waste and spent fuel generated by nuclear defense activities could potentially be easier to site, license, and construct than a combined defense-civilian repository. DOE concluded in a 2014 report that a defense-only nuclear waste repository could proceed outside the framework of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. According to a DOE report, a defense-only repository would need to be licensed by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and comply with NWPA requirements. The GAO criticized DOE's analysis for excluding major costs and having an optimistic schedule. Republican leaders criticized the plan as a way to avoid progress on the Yucca repository. Legislation introduced in 2017 and 2018 aims to block a defense-only nuclear waste repository and prioritize the development of consent-based pilot interim storage facilities for spent nuclear fuel. The DOE would need the governor's consent to select a site for a pilot storage facility. The DOE would need consent from the governor, localities, and Indian tribes to select a site for a pilot storage facility. Congress would require reports on compensation and incentives for host jurisdictions, as well as a mechanism to ensure waste is moved to a permanent repository in a reasonable time. Consent-based siting provisions for interim storage facilities are included in a nuclear waste bill. The House passed a nuclear waste bill (H.R. 3053) authorizing DOE to store spent nuclear fuel at interim storage facilities with consent from the governor, local government, and Indian tribes. Legislation (S. 854) in the 114th Congress aimed to implement BRC recommendations for nuclear waste storage but was not enacted. Holtec International filed an NRC license application for a spent fuel storage facility in New Mexico in 2017. Holtec International filed an NRC license application for a spent fuel storage facility in New Mexico on March 30, 2017. The facility is planned to hold 10,000 canisters of spent fuel in below-grade concrete silos on a 1,000-acre site near the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant. The project will be developed in 20 phases over 20 years, with each phase containing 500 canisters holding up to 8,680 metric tons of spent fuel. Total storage capacity is expected to be around 120,000 metric tons. WCS formed a joint venture with Orano USA called Waste Control Partners to submit a renewed license application for a spent fuel storage facility in Texas. The proposed facility would be built on a 14,000-acre site near Andrews, TX, with construction potentially completed by 2022. Under the proposal, DOE would take title to spent fuel from nuclear plants, ship it to the Texas site, and pay WCS for storage for up to 40 years. Funding would come from the Nuclear Waste Fund. The House passed legislation (H.R. 3053) authorizing DOE to contract with non-federal interim storage facilities for spent fuel. A related bill (H.R. 474) introduced by Representative Issa is similar to previous bills but not enacted. DOE could take title to all spent nuclear fuel from commercial reactors delivered to private storage facilities using interest earned by the Nuclear Waste Fund. The Nuclear Waste Fund, estimated at $1.5 billion in FY2017, could be used by DOE without further congressional appropriation to pay for private interim storage. The Trump Administration's FY2018 budget request would have provided new Yucca Mountain funding, but it was not approved by Congress. For FY2019, the Administration is seeking funding for Yucca Mountain: DOE would receive $110 million for an NRC license, NRC would receive $47.7 million to consider DOE's application, and $10 million for interim nuclear waste storage facilities. Total funding for DOE in FY2019 would be $120 million from two appropriations accounts. The DOE funding for Yucca Mountain in FY2019 has been combined with other appropriations bills. The House passed a bill with $100 million more than requested for Yucca Mountain, while the Senate version included no funding for it. DOE stopped collecting nuclear waste fees in 2014 due to a court ruling, leading to uncertainty about the future of the nuclear waste program. The District of Columbia Circuit ordered DOE to stop collecting fees for nuclear waste disposal, totaling about $750 million per year. The court ruled that DOE's waste plans were too vague for accurate cost estimates, with an uncertainty range of nearly $7 trillion. The Trump Administration planned to restart the Yucca Mountain program and conduct a new cost assessment for determining the nuclear waste fee. The NRC approved a final rule on continued storage of spent nuclear fuel, replacing the earlier \"waste confidence\" rule struck down by the U.S. Court of Appeals. The court ruled that NRC should have conducted an environmental review before issuing waste confidence findings in December 2010. The NRC approved a final rule on continued storage of spent nuclear fuel in August 2014, ending the suspension of final licensing decisions for new reactors and spent fuel storage facilities. A consolidated lawsuit challenging the rule was rejected by the U.S. Court of Appeals in June 2016. NRC also proposed modifications to its low-level waste disposal regulations in March 2015. The NRC staff submitted final regulations for commission approval on September 15, 2016, with further revisions issued on September 8, 2017. These regulations aim to establish time periods for technical analyses of low-level waste sites to protect the general population. Nuclear waste, including highly radioactive spent fuel, remains a significant challenge for the industry. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act addresses this issue. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act focuses on Yucca Mountain, NV, as a repository for nuclear waste. Nevada opposes the site due to safety concerns. DOE submitted a license application for the repository in 2008, projecting waste acceptance by 2020. The Obama Administration halted funding for the Yucca Mountain repository in FY2011, shutting down the project and transferring functions to the Office of Nuclear Energy. President Trump plans to restart the licensing process, requesting $120 million in his FY2019 budget for Yucca Mountain and interim waste storage. President Trump requested $120 million for Yucca Mountain and interim waste storage in his FY2019 budget submission to Congress. The Department of Energy (DOE) would receive $110 million to seek an NRC license for the repository, while NRC would receive $47.7 million to consider the application. Additionally, $10 million would be allocated to develop interim nuclear waste storage facilities. DOE had previously filed a motion to withdraw the Yucca Mountain license application under the Obama Administration, but this was met with opposition from states with defense-related and civilian radioactive waste. The ASLB denied DOE's license withdrawal motion for Yucca Mountain on June 29, 2010, citing NWPA regulations. NRC commissioners upheld this decision on September 9, 2011, but halted further consideration due to budget constraints. Lawsuits challenging the license withdrawal were filed, leading to a ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals on August 13, 2013. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled on August 13, 2013, that the NRC must continue work on the Yucca Mountain license application as long as funding is available. NRC directed its staff to complete the Yucca Mountain safety evaluation report (SER) in response, concluding that the proposed repository design would comply with safety and environmental standards for 1 million years. The final volumes of the SER were issued on January 29, 2015, with a recommendation not to authorize construction until all land and water rights requirements were met. The NRC completed a supplemental EIS for the Yucca Mountain project in May 2016, making licensing documents publicly available. An additional $330 million in appropriations was needed to complete the licensing process, including adjudicatory hearings on 300 issues raised by Nevada. The Obama Administration halted the project in 2010 and established the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future to develop alternative waste disposal strategies. The BRC recommended a new organization to promptly begin developing nuclear waste disposal solutions. The DOE issued a Strategy for the Management and Disposal of Nuclear Waste in response to the BRC report, calling for a new organization to develop consent-based storage and disposal sites. The strategy included plans for a pilot interim spent fuel storage facility by 2021, a larger-scale storage facility by 2025, and a geologic disposal facility by 2048. The DOE invited public comment on a consent-based siting process for a geologic disposal facility to open by 2048. The process includes community outreach, legislation for waste management agency funding, and grants for interested communities. The DOE's consent-based siting process involves providing grants to communities for site assessments and negotiations for hosting storage or disposal facilities. The process includes phases for preliminary and detailed site assessments, agreement negotiations, and licensing, construction, operation, and closure of the facility. The Trump Administration's proposal aims to restart the Yucca Mountain project, with estimated construction timelines of up to 5 years for an interim storage facility and 15 years for a repository. Funding would support a Yucca Mountain program office, legal and technical support for the license application, and management of documents. The request includes $10 million for interim storage planning, transportation, and waste shipment preparations. The nuclear power industry supports completing NRC's licensing review of Yucca Mountain and pursuing alternative storage options. The target date for opening a repository should be within 20 years. The industry policy statement suggests that the opening of Yucca Mountain or an alternative repository site should be within 20 years of a consolidated storage site opening. Geologic disposal of nuclear waste relies on the characteristics of rock formations, with worldwide consensus on geologic isolation as the safest long-term option. However, the Yucca Mountain controversy highlights challenges in applying scientific confidence to specific disposal sites. Geologic disposal of nuclear waste has faced challenges due to site-specific flaws like water intrusion and earthquake vulnerability. Predicting waste site performance for 1 million years is uncertain, leading to public controversy over waste transportation routes. President Obama's budgets included research on technologies to reduce waste volume and toxicity. The Bush Administration proposed large-scale facilities for reprocessing and recycling spent nuclear fuel. The Obama Administration focused on fundamental science for nuclear waste research, moving away from reprocessing facilities. The Trump Administration's FY2019 budget reduced funding for spent fuel reprocessing but emphasized a long-term, science-based approach. President Bush recommended Yucca Mountain for a repository site, facing opposition from Nevada Governor Guinn's state veto. The state veto by Nevada Governor Guinn would have blocked further development at Yucca Mountain if Congress did not pass a resolution approving the site within 90 days. President Bush signed an approval resolution in 2002. Low-level radioactive waste from various sources is currently disposed of in South Carolina, Texas, and Washington. Utah accepts the lowest-concentration class of low-level waste. In 2008, a Utah commercial disposal facility accepted class A low-level radioactive waste from across the United States. Threats to close disposal facilities led to the authorization of regional compacts for waste disposal in 1985. The first new disposal site under this system opened in Texas in 2011. The Texas Legislature allowed states outside the Texas Compact to use up to 30% of the facility's capacity. The NWPA Section 302 authorized DOE to enter into contracts with generators of spent nuclear fuel for disposal. The NWPA required DOE to dispose of nuclear waste by January 31, 1998. After missing the deadline, nuclear utilities sued DOE for additional storage costs. DOE settled with PECO Energy Company in 2000, allowing them to keep $80 million in waste fee revenues. Other utilities challenged the settlement, arguing that fees should only be used for waste programs, not as compensation for missed deadlines. The U.S. Court of Appeals ruled in favor of the utilities in 2002. The U.S. Court of Appeals ruled in 2002 that nuclear waste compensation to utilities must come from sources other than the waste fund. Payments are now made from the U.S. Treasury's Judgment Fund, totaling $6.9 billion by FY2017 from settlements and court judgments. Utilities submit annual reimbursement claims to DOE for delay-related nuclear waste storage costs. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is facing potential liabilities of up to $34.1 billion for nuclear waste program delays. Utilities continue to seek compensation for delay-related costs through settlements and court judgments. The U.S. Court of Federal Claims can only award damages that have already been incurred, requiring utilities to file claims for additional costs as they arise. Delays in waste disposal could result in future environmental enforcement actions over high-level waste and spent fuel. The DOE faces potential liabilities for nuclear waste program delays, with waste currently stored in noncompliance with environmental laws. DOE must charge a fee on nuclear power generation for waste disposal, but fee collections were suspended in 2014 after halting the Yucca Mountain project. Legal actions were taken to end the nuclear waste fee collection. The Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) and Utility Commissioners (NARUC) filed suits to stop the collection of $750 million per year in fees for nuclear waste disposal. DOE argued that the fees must continue for future disposal costs. Energy Secretary Steven Chu's determination in 2010 was challenged in court, leading to a ruling in 2012 that ordered a reevaluation of the fee collection. The court ordered a reevaluation of the waste fee, criticizing the Secretary's reliance on costs projected for the Yucca Mountain site, which was terminated by the Obama Administration. DOE conducted a new fee adequacy assessment in 2013, finding varying results that did not clearly indicate whether the fee should be raised or lowered immediately. The Circuit Court ordered DOE to stop collecting nuclear waste fees due to vague waste plans and unreliable cost estimates. The Trump Administration plans to restart the Yucca Mountain program and conduct a new fee adequacy assessment based on previous cost estimates. DOE filed a motion to withdraw the Yucca Mountain license application \"with prejudice\" citing the Secretary of Energy's decision that it is not a viable option for nuclear waste disposal. The withdrawal was not based on scientific findings but on the Obama Administration's policy change to seek a waste solution with greater public acceptance. The ASLB was urged to grant the withdrawal to provide finality to the project. The ASLB denied DOE's license withdrawal motion, ruling that NWPA prohibits DOE from withdrawing the Yucca Mountain license application until NRC determines its acceptability. DOE argued that the Secretary of Energy has the authority to discontinue the project, but the board disagreed, stating that Congress did not intend for DOE to unilaterally terminate the review process. The NRC commissioners sustained the licensing board's denial of the Yucca Mountain license withdrawal on a tie vote due to budgetary limitations. The Court of Appeals ruled that NRC must continue work on the license application as long as funding was available, with at least $11.1 million in previously appropriated funds for that purpose. The NRC completed its Safety Evaluation Report for Yucca Mountain in January 2015 and used remaining funds for a supplemental EIS. Additional funding of about $330 million is needed for NRC to complete the licensing review, with DOE estimating costs of $1.9 billion as the license applicant. The Trump Administration proposes to resume consideration of the NRC license pending before the ASLB. DOE's FY2018 budget includes $110 million for a Yucca Mountain program office and $30 million for NRC to restart ASLB adjudicatory proceedings. The NRC issued a Waste Confidence Decision in 1984, stating nuclear waste could be safely stored for 30 years after plant closure. Updates in 1990 and 2010 addressed delays in opening a permanent repository, with the latest rule stating a repository would be available \"when necessary.\" The 2010 waste confidence rule stated that a repository would be available \"when necessary\" and waste could be stored at reactor sites for at least 60 years after shutdown. Lawsuits were filed to overturn the rule due to concerns about environmental risks. The U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that the NRC must conduct an environmental review of the decision under NEPA, citing flaws in the rulemaking process. The NRC failed to properly examine future dangers and consequences in allowing spent fuel storage on site for sixty years after a plant's license expires. Final licensing of new facilities producing nuclear waste was delayed for over two years while NRC addressed a court ruling. A new rule on continued storage of spent nuclear fuel was approved in August 2014, focusing on environmental effects of waste storage based on a generic environmental impact statement. The GEIS analyzed the environmental effects of three potential time periods of storage before a permanent repository would become available: \"short-term timeframe,\" \"long-term timeframe,\" and an \"indefinite timeframe.\" The environmental impact of all three time frames was judged to be minimal. A consolidated lawsuit to overturn NRC's continued storage rule was rejected by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in 2016. The Obama Administration's termination of work on the Yucca Mountain repository sparked congressional controversy. President Trump's proposal to restart the licensing process has shifted the debate on nuclear waste, especially with the retirement of Senator Reid. The 115th Congress has not allocated new funding for Yucca Mountain, with the House approving funds for FY2018 but the Senate not doing so. In FY2019, the House included $100 million above the Administration's funding request for Yucca Mountain. The House allocated $100 million above the Administration's Yucca Mountain funding request, while the Senate did not provide any funds. Concerns about nuclear waste were raised during the confirmation hearing for former Texas Governor Rick Perry, with Senator Catherine Cortez Masto expressing opposition to Yucca Mountain becoming a dumping ground for nuclear waste. The Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2017 (H.R. 3053) passed by the House on May 10, 2018, aims to withdraw the Yucca Mountain repository site from public lands laws and place it under DOE's control. It also allows DOE to store spent fuel at an NRC-licensed interim storage facility. The bill increases the capacity limit of the Yucca Mountain repository to 110,000 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel. The House-passed bill made significant changes from the Energy and Commerce Committee's version, including the removal of mandatory funding provisions. The House-passed bill, H.R. 3053, includes provisions for Monitored Retrievable Storage (MRS) facilities for interim storage of spent nuclear fuel. It authorizes DOE to site, construct, and operate MRS facilities, allowing for the transfer of ownership of spent fuel to the Secretary of Energy. The House-passed bill, H.R. 3053, authorizes DOE to site, construct, and operate Monitored Retrievable Storage (MRS) facilities for interim storage of spent nuclear fuel. DOE could store spent fuel at MRS facilities developed by nonfederal entities with which it had reached an agreement, subject to NRC licensing and state approvals. Priority would be given to nonfederal MRS facilities unless a federal MRS could be built more quickly and less expensively. The House-passed bill authorizes DOE to construct Monitored Retrievable Storage (MRS) facilities for interim storage of spent nuclear fuel. Priority for shipment to an MRS would be given to spent fuel stored at closed reactors. Appropriations for an MRS would come from the general fund, not the Nuclear Waste Fund. Construction of an MRS facility would be contingent on NRC approval for the Yucca Mountain repository. The proposed Yucca Mountain repository on federal land would be permanently withdrawn for nuclear waste storage, transferring jurisdiction to the Secretary of Energy. This withdrawal is necessary for the Department of Energy to obtain a repository license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Waste at the repository would not be subject to certain hazardous waste requirements. The Yucca Mountain repository would require NRC's final decision on construction authorization within 30 months. DOE could conduct infrastructure activities before the decision, with a limit increase on the amount of nuclear fuel disposed. Planning a separate repository for defense-related waste is prohibited until NRC's decision. The Secretary of Energy cannot resume nuclear waste fee collection until NRC's final decision on the Yucca Mountain repository. The Yucca Mountain repository would have limitations on nuclear waste fees collected, with any uncollected fees potentially required to be paid later. Fees collected would offset appropriations to the nuclear waste program, ensuring zero net appropriations up to the amount of fees available. The existing balance of the Nuclear Waste Fund would remain available for appropriation without offsets, and the bill specifies that net direct spending would not be affected. The Secretary of Energy would be authorized to enter into a benefits agreement with the State of Nevada, providing increased annual payments and a lump sum upon the first spent fuel receipt at Yucca Mountain. Nevada and local governments could also receive payments, subject to congressional appropriation from the Nuclear Waste Fund. The Nuclear Waste Informed Consent Act introduced by Senator Heller and Representative Titus would require the Secretary of Energy to obtain consent from affected State and local governments before implementing nuclear waste management functions. The Director of the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM) would oversee these functions and report directly to the Secretary of Energy, serving up to two five-year terms. The Nuclear Waste Informed Consent Act introduced by Senator Heller and Representative Titus requires the Secretary of Energy to obtain consent from State and local governments before using funds from the Nuclear Waste Fund for a nuclear waste repository. Representative Joe Wilson also introduced the Sensible Nuclear Waste Disposition Act, which would delay the development of a repository for defense nuclear waste until a final decision is made on the Yucca Mountain repository. Private-sector interim storage facilities in Texas and New Mexico have garnered congressional interest. The Interim Consolidated Storage Act of 2017, introduced by Representative Issa, aims to authorize DOE to enter contracts with privately owned spent fuel storage facilities. This bill is similar to previous legislation but has not been enacted yet. It would allow DOE to take title to spent nuclear fuel from commercial reactors and use interest from the Nuclear Waste Fund to pay for private interim storage. Additionally, Representative Lowey introduced the Removing Nuclear Waste from our Communities Act of 2017 to authorize DOE to store spent fuel. The Communities Act of 2017 (H.R. 4442) authorizes DOE to store spent fuel from nuclear plants at privately owned consolidated storage facilities. Legislation introduced by Senator Duckworth and Representative Schneider (S. 1903 and H.R. 3970) provides assistance to communities with stored spent fuel at closed reactor sites, offering financial incentives and tax credits to eligible communities. The bill aims to simplify the process for communities seeking government assistance with stranded nuclear waste. It also requires the DOE to explore alternative options for storing decommissioned nuclear waste and to study potential economic uses for closed reactor sites and spent fuel storage. Concerns about the risks of spent fuel storage pools have led to proposed legislation, such as the Dry Cask Storage Act of 2018, which would mandate the transfer of spent fuel to dry storage facilities within seven years. The bill H.R. 4891 aims to expand emergency planning zones around reactors not complying with spent fuel transfer plans. It authorizes the use of interest from the Nuclear Waste Fund for grants to transfer spent fuel to dry storage. Similar legislation was introduced in previous Congresses. The bill S. 854 proposed establishing an independent Nuclear Waste Administration to develop nuclear waste storage and disposal facilities, with the requirement of consent from affected state, local, and tribal governments for siting. It aimed to open a pilot storage facility by 2021 for priority waste and a permanent repository by 2048. Nonpriority waste storage facilities could be selected after 10 years if funds were allocated for a permanent repository. The Nuclear Waste Administration was authorized to offer financial compensation and incentives for hosting nuclear waste storage facilities. Sites with storage facilities and a repository would receive preference. President Obama authorized the pursuit of a defense-only repository in 2015. Nuclear waste fees collected would be held in a Working Capital Fund for the Administration to draw from as needed. The Nuclear Waste Administration could access funds from a Working Capital Fund for S. 854. The disposal limit under NWPA would be repealed. A Senate hearing on S. 1240 took place in 2013, with positive feedback from Energy Secretary Moniz and NARUC Chairman Boyd. NRDC attorney Fettus opposed the bill for allowing temporary waste storage facilities. Fettus opposed S. 854, citing concerns about opening temporary waste storage facilities without progress on a permanent repository and inadequate state authority to regulate safety. The bill required actions on a permanent repository before siting a storage facility for nonpriority waste. The Senate approved funding for DOE to develop a consent-based waste storage pilot facility. The debate over nuclear waste policy was influenced by the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident in Japan in 2011, which raised concerns about fuel damage and radioactive releases. Authorization for waste storage facilities has been included in various energy and water bills, but corresponding House bills have not included this authorization. The debate over nuclear waste policy was influenced by the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident in Japan in 2011, potentially leading to fuel damage and radioactive releases into the atmosphere. A bill introduced by Senator Barbara Boxer in 2015 would require NRC to maintain safety and security requirements at closed reactors until spent fuel is moved to dry storage. NRC released a study in 2013 stating that expedited transfer of spent fuel to dry cask storage would provide limited safety benefits. Radioactive waste varies in radioactivity levels, with some being safe to handle in unshielded containers while others are intensely hot. Radioactive waste can vary in levels of radioactivity, with some decaying to safe levels in days or weeks while others remain dangerous for thousands of years. Spent nuclear fuel, the most radioactive type of civilian nuclear waste, contains fission products and long-lived radionuclides like plutonium. It is hot and remains dangerously radioactive for tens of thousands of years. High-level waste is highly radioactive residue created by spent fuel reprocessing, containing radioactive fission products that require isolation for 10,000 years or more. Transuranic waste is low-activity waste with long-lived elements heavier than uranium, primarily plutonium, requiring radiation shielding for handling. The United States generates transuranic waste mainly from nuclear weapons production processes, necessitating long-term isolation due to the presence of plutonium. The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) in Carlsbad, NM, resumed underground waste emplacement in 2017 after a radioactive release. Low-level waste disposal facilities cannot accept waste with high concentrations of radioactivity. Uranium mill tailings are sand-like residues from processing uranium ore with low radioactivity but large volumes that can pose hazards like radon emissions and groundwater contamination. Mixed waste includes chemically hazardous waste with radioactive material, regulated by DOE or NRC for radioactive parts and EPA for nonradioactive elements. Spent nuclear fuel is removed from reactors after years of power production. After years of power production, spent nuclear fuel is removed from reactors. The fuel assemblies contain highly radioactive fission products and plutonium. The assemblies are stored in deep pools of water to prevent overheating and protect workers from radiation. The spent fuel from U.S. commercial nuclear reactors is stored in dry canisters at various sites, including operating and shutdown plant sites, and the Idaho National Laboratory. The NRC requires the fuel to cool for 7-10 years before transfer. An estimated 80,000 metric tons of spent fuel was stored in the U.S. at the end of 2017, with about 30,000 metric tons in dry casks. The total amount of existing nuclear waste, including 30,000 metric tons in dry casks, exceeds the 70,000-metric-ton limit for Yucca Mountain. DOE estimates that eventually 105,000 to 130,000 metric tons of spent fuel from U.S. reactors will need disposal. New storage capacity will be needed if waste cannot be accepted into the disposal system. The need for new dry storage capacity at reactor sites due to concerns about the vulnerability of stored spent fuel, especially after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Reports from NRC and NAS highlighted the risk of overheating spent fuel leading to fires and the possibility of successful terrorist attacks on spent fuel pools. Recommendations have been made to reduce the likelihood of such incidents. The NAS study recommended measures to reduce the risk of spent fuel cladding fires, including interspersing hotter and cooler fuel assemblies in pools, installing spray systems, and transferring fuel to dry cask storage. The nuclear industry argues that there is ample time to cool fuel before it catches fire. NRC's 2013 report found minor safety benefits in expedited transfers to dry casks. An NRC task force identified lessons from Fukushima for U.S. nuclear plant regulation, recommending power sources and water spray systems for spent fuel pools. NRC approved an order in 2012 for U.S. reactors to enhance safety measures. The NRC approved an order in 2012 for U.S. reactors to install improved water-level monitoring equipment at spent fuel pools. About 5.1 million cubic feet of low-level waste with 57,179 curies of radioactivity was shipped to disposal sites in 2017. Low-level radioactive waste is categorized into Class A, B, and C for handling and disposal. The Obama Administration halted development of the Yucca Mountain repository for civilian highly radioactive waste disposal after FY2010. The Trump Administration is proposing to revive the program in FY2019, requesting funding for Yucca Mountain and interim nuclear waste storage at DOE and NRC. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 established a system for selecting a geologic repository for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste. DOE's Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM) was created to carry out the program, funded by the Nuclear Waste Fund. The Obama Administration had a waste management strategy that required new legislation, but it was not enacted. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 established a system for selecting a geologic repository for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste. The act allowed the Secretary of Energy to adjust costs based on program projections. The Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1987 modified the original act, designating Yucca Mountain, Nevada as the only candidate site for a high-level waste repository. If Yucca Mountain is not licensed, DOE must seek further instructions from Congress. The amendments also authorized the construction of a monitored retrievable storage facility for spent fuel. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 established a system for selecting a geologic repository for nuclear waste. The law prohibits DOE from selecting a site for a Monitored Retrievable Storage (MRS) until recommending a permanent repository. The Obama Administration halted funding for the Yucca Mountain project and transferred waste management functions to DOE's Office of Nuclear Energy. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future developed a new waste management strategy, excluding specific site evaluations. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future recommended a new, consent-based approach to siting nuclear waste facilities, moving away from the existing policy with Yucca Mountain as the sole candidate site. This approach would involve extensive negotiations with affected states, tribes, and local governments to establish legally binding agreements on project parameters. The commission expressed confidence in the success of this process, citing the example of the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico. The Blue Ribbon Commission recommended a new approach to siting nuclear waste facilities, emphasizing consent-based agreements with states and tribes. They highlighted the U.S. experience with the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico, which began receiving waste in 1999 after controversy. The commission suggested establishing a federal corporation for waste management, with access to funds and congressional oversight. The Blue Ribbon Commission recommended a new approach to siting nuclear waste facilities, emphasizing consent-based agreements with states and tribes. They called for prompt efforts to develop a permanent underground nuclear waste repository and interim central storage facilities. The DOE issued a Strategy for the Management and Disposal of Used Nuclear Fuel and High-Level Waste in response to the BRC report, outlining plans for pilot and larger-scale interim storage facilities by 2021. The DOE strategy aims to establish a larger-scale interim storage facility by 2025 with a capacity of 20,000 metric tons or more. It also plans for a geologic disposal facility to open by 2048, with a site to be selected by 2016. The strategy emphasizes the need for a permanent repository and recommends not overly restricting progress on storage facilities. The DOE strategy aims to establish an interim storage facility by 2025 and a geologic disposal facility by 2048. The site for the disposal facility is to be selected by 2016. The strategy includes a \"consent based\" process for site selection, but lacks details on implementation. The Obama Administration proposed a new nuclear waste management entity, but did not specify its nature. Senator Alexander's proposal in the 114th Congress aimed to modify the waste program in line with the Obama Administration's strategy. Privatization of waste management services has also been suggested. A 2014 DOE report recommended testing a consent-based approach for siting a repository solely for defense and research waste, separate from civilian waste. This would reverse the long-standing policy of a single repository for both types of waste. The report recommended developing a separate underground repository for high-level radioactive waste from nuclear defense activities. President Obama authorized planning for this in 2015, but GAO criticized the analysis in 2017. Bills have been introduced to delay the plan, and Obama blocked the preferred rail route to Yucca Mountain in 2015. Waste Control Specialists is involved in waste management. Waste Control Specialists (WCS) applied for an NRC license to build a spent nuclear fuel storage facility in Texas. WCS later partnered with Orano USA to submit a renewed application for the facility near Andrews, TX. The proposed facility would consist of dry casks on concrete pads and be constructed in eight phases, each capable of holding 5,000 metric tons of spent fuel. The proposed spent fuel storage facility in Texas by Waste Control Specialists (WCS) would consist of eight phases, each capable of holding 5,000 metric tons of spent fuel, totaling 40,000 metric tons. The Department of Energy (DOE) would take title to the spent fuel at nuclear plant sites, transport it to the Texas site, and pay WCS for storage for up to 40 years with possible extensions. WCS argues that a privately developed facility would not be bound by NWPA restrictions like the Yucca Mountain project. Another NRC license application for a spent fuel storage facility in New Mexico was filed by Holtec International near the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant. The Eddy-Lea Energy Alliance (ELEA) is supported by local officials near the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico. New Mexico Governor Susana Martinez expressed support for ELEA's efforts, but the state's U.S. senators oppose an interim storage facility without a plan for permanent disposal. A radioactive release from WIPP in February 2014 led to its suspension. The February 2014 radioactive release from WIPP led to the suspension of disposal operations, potentially impacting public support for expanded waste activities. Interest in hosting nuclear waste sites has been expressed in Mississippi and Loving County, Texas. Legislation has been introduced to authorize DOE to enter contracts with privately owned spent fuel storage facilities. The Nuclear Waste Fund's annual interest could be used by DOE to pay for private interim storage without further congressional approval. A bill with 33 cosponsors, including 14 from Texas, includes provisions for a private-sector MRS facility. Previous efforts for private spent fuel storage included a consortium developing a storage facility on tribal land in Utah, receiving a 20-year license in 2006. On February 21, 2006, NRC approved the storage of spent fuel in dry casks, but Interior Department approval was also needed. On September 7, 2006, Interior Department rejected the PFS project due to risks of waste remaining indefinitely. A federal lawsuit was filed on July 17, 2007, challenging the Interior decisions, leading to a court order on July 26, 2010, for reconsideration. The Obama Administration attempted to redirect the nuclear waste program, but current law still focuses on Yucca Mountain for civilian waste. NWPA mandates that high-level waste repositories meet EPA and NRC standards. Transportation of waste is regulated by NRC and DOT, requiring compliance with NRC-certified casks and DOT regulations. The NRC's licensing requirements for Yucca Mountain mandate compliance with EPA standards and establish procedures for DOE to follow in seeking a repository license. This includes a mandatory performance confirmation program to ensure systems are functioning as intended. Specific standards for Yucca Mountain were created due to concerns about meeting EPA's general standards. The Yucca Mountain standards, based on a study by the National Academy of Sciences, aim to limit radiation exposure to individuals near the repository. The EPA proposed radiation protection standards in 1999, setting annual radiation dose limits at 15 millirems. The EPA proposed radiation protection standards in 1999 for Yucca Mountain, limiting annual radiation doses for the maximally exposed individual to 15 millirems overall and 4 millirems from groundwater exposure for the first 10,000 years of operation. Despite criticism from the nuclear industry and environmental groups, EPA issued its final standards on June 6, 2001, maintaining the proposed limits. The DOE's site evaluation found Yucca Mountain could meet EPA standards, but a court struck down the 10,000-year compliance period. EPA proposed new standards in 2005. The EPA proposed new Yucca Mountain standards in 2005, which were criticized by Nevada state officials as too lenient. The final rule in 2008 reduced the annual dose limit from 350 to 100 millirems for the period of 10,000 through 1 million years. Compliance with the post-10,000-year standard will be based on the arithmetic mean of projected doses. The NRC revised its repository licensing regulations to align with new EPA standards in 2009. DOE estimated in 2008 that the maximum mean annual individual dose after 10,000 years would be 2 millirems, significantly lower than previous estimates. The reduction was attributed to changes in modeling and assumptions. The DOE's Fuel Cycle Research and Development Program conducts research on technologies for managing spent nuclear fuel, including the Obama Administration's waste strategy. The Trump Administration's budget proposals for FY2018 and FY2019 allocated funds for nuclear waste processing but eliminated funding for integrated waste management. The program focuses on technology for reprocessing and waste disposal R&D. The Fuel Cycle R&D program focuses on reprocessing spent fuel to convert long-lived radionuclides into faster-decaying fission products. Nuclear utilities paid fees to the Nuclear Waste Fund for disposal costs until halted in 2014. The fund balance was $37.2 billion in FY2017. $7.41 billion had been disbursed for the Yucca Mountain project before it was halted in FY2010. DOE's Analysis of the Total System Life Cycle Cost was last updated in 2008. The Cycle Cost of the Civilian Radioactive Waste Management Program was estimated to be $96.2 billion in 2007 dollars from 1983 to 2133. States are authorized to select disposal sites for low-level radioactive waste under the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act. Most states have joined interstate compacts for disposal. By 1992, commercial low-level waste disposal facilities could refuse waste from outside their compacts. One site in Beatty, NV, closed, leaving two sites in Barnwell, SC, and Hanford, WA. The remaining low-level waste disposal sites in Barnwell, SC, and Hanford, WA, have the authority to prohibit waste from outside their regional compacts. A new disposal facility near Andrews, TX, opened in 2012 to alleviate storage issues for Class A, B, and C waste. The facility can also accept waste from other states, with the first shipment received from Vermont in 2012. Legislation for the Texas compact was signed in 1998. The disposal facility in Andrews County, TX, was authorized in 2003 and construction was approved in 2011. The facility in Barnwell, SC, is currently accepting low-level waste from the Atlantic Compact. South Carolina joined the Atlantic Compact in 2000, limiting waste acceptance to compact members. A state law phased out noncompact waste acceptance by 2008. The Barnwell facility stopped accepting waste from outside the Southeast Compact in 1994. South Carolina's proposal to open the site to non-Southeast waste was rejected in 1995, leading to the state's withdrawal from the Southeast Compact. North Carolina also withdrew from the compact. The Barnwell facility in South Carolina accepts waste from all states except North Carolina. North Carolina withdrew from the Southeast Compact in 1999 without facing sanctions. Hanford, WA is the only other facility accepting all classes of low-level waste. Licensing for low-level waste facilities is regulated by NRC or agreement states under the Atomic Energy Act. Transportation of low-level waste is jointly regulated by NRC and the Department of Transportation. NRC proposed modifications to its regulations for low-level waste licenses. The NRC proposed significant modifications to its low-level waste disposal regulations, with final revisions issued by the commission in 2017. The regulations would establish time periods for technical analyses of waste sites to ensure public protection for up to 10,000 years, with additional requirements for certain cases and protection against inadvertent intruders. The NRC proposed revisions to low-level waste disposal regulations in 2017 to ensure public protection for up to 10,000 years. Concerns about spent fuel storage safety have increased since the Fukushima Daiichi disaster in 2011. President Obama terminated the Yucca Mountain project and initiated a new waste strategy through the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future. The Trump Administration's proposal to restart Yucca Mountain licensing and the retirement of Senator Reid may impact legislative action on nuclear waste in the 115th Congress. The administration requested $120 million in FY2018 for Yucca Mountain licensing and spent fuel storage to fulfill federal obligations, enhance national security, and reduce taxpayer burden. The Trump Administration has requested funding for Yucca Mountain to address nuclear waste, enhance national security, and reduce taxpayer burden. Delays in waste disposal could lead to significant financial liabilities for the federal government and the nuclear industry. The lack of a nuclear waste disposal system could impact the licensing of new nuclear plants and compliance deadlines for defense waste disposal. The Blue Ribbon Commission recommended options such as centralized interim storage and development of alternative repository sites. A congressionally chartered corporation was suggested to oversee the siting of new waste storage facilities. However, due to ongoing delays in the nuclear waste program, longer on-site storage is likely under any option. The \"consent based\" nuclear waste siting process recommended by the Blue Ribbon Commission has attracted serious interest from localities in New Mexico and Texas. Cooperation of states is crucial for the success of any renewed siting effort.
