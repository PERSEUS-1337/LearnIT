The text chunk discusses an amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 regarding certification requirements for countries cooperating with the United States to combat illicit drug trafficking. The text chunk discusses amendments to the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 related to certification requirements for countries combating illicit drug trafficking. Amendments include progress towards meeting plans and programs identified in the President's report and conforming amendments to subsections. The text chunk discusses additional requirements relating to qualified certification under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. Amendments include changes to subsections (b) and (f) to align with certification criteria for countries combating illicit drug trafficking. The text chunk outlines the requirements for a high-level contact group in the event of a certification under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. Key officials from the United States and the country in question must convene to address drug trafficking issues. The Commissioner of Customs is responsible for establishing achievable benchmarks for countries with inadequate progress in drug trafficking programs. These benchmarks allow for objective verification of a country's progress under the program. The Commissioner of Customs sets specific goals and deadlines for drug trafficking programs in countries. A high-level contact group must complete its activities within 60 days of certification. Additionally, a benchmark report is required by September 1 each year. The President must submit a report to Congress by September 1 each year, detailing benchmarks set for countries, progress made, and consultations with the Attorney General. The President must report to Congress on country benchmarks annually, consulting the Attorney General. For countries with established benchmarks, emphasis is placed on progress for certification the following year. Congress suggests a high-level contact group for Mexico in 1998. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, section 490, includes provisions for the activities of a contact group and the certification of Mexico in 1999."
