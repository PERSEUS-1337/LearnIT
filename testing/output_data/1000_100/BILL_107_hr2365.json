    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Electricity and Environmental Technology Research and Development Act.\" Congress finds that reliable, affordable, increasingly clean electricity is crucial for the growing US economy. The use of electrotechnologies, environmental concerns, competitive electricity market, and rising energy prices highlight the importance of clean electricity. Coal, accounting for over half of US electricity generation, is the most abundant fossil energy resource, with enough supply to last 250 years at current rates. Investments in emissions control technology have reduced coal-based generating facilities' pollutants by 21% in the past 30 years. Continuous efficiency improvements in electricity generation facilities can allow for continued coal use and preserve other energy resources. New technologies can eliminate health-threatening emissions and improve efficiency by up to 50%. Initial commercial deployment of these technologies is crucial. The commercial deployment of new coal generation technologies poses risks in a competitive market, while continued research for near-zero emissions in coal-based generation is important. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The term \"cost and performance goals\" refers to the goals established under section 4. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Energy. The Secretary will assess technologies for coal use in electricity generation, chemical feedstocks, and transportation fuel in 2007, 2015, and 2020. Consultation with various industry representatives is required to establish cost and performance goals. The Secretary will establish draft cost and performance goals for public comment within 120 days of the Act's enactment, and submit final goals to Congress within 180 days, in order to further environmental protection and promote advanced coal technologies. SEC. 5. STUDY. The Secretary, in cooperation with other agencies, must report to Congress every 2 years on technologies and costs for achieving goals. Recommendations for technology development programs will be included. The Department of Energy, in collaboration with industry, will develop and demonstrate technologies to meet cost and performance goals. Recommendations for additional authorities needed will be provided. The Secretary will consider expert advice from representatives of relevant entities. The Secretary will conduct a technology research and development program for coal-based technologies under various Acts to achieve cost and performance goals. Authorization of appropriations is also provided. Authorization of $100,000,000 annually from 2002 to 2012 for sections 4, 5, and 6. This is in addition to existing authorizations and does not limit Department of Energy funding for fossil energy research. Additionally, the Clean Coal Power Commercial Applications Initiative is established. The Secretary will establish a clean coal power commercial applications initiative to demonstrate advanced coal-based technologies for power plants. The technologies must advance efficiency, environmental performance, and cost competitiveness beyond current standards and may include new technologies not previously considered for commercial use. Within 120 days of enactment, a plan must be submitted to Congress outlining the initiative. The plan must include program elements, technical milestones for advanced coal-based technologies, and demonstration activities at facilities serving coal-based electric generation units to improve design efficiency by at least 3 percent. The plan must include program elements, technical milestones for advanced coal-based technologies, and demonstration activities at facilities serving coal-based electric generation units to improve design efficiency by at least 3 percent. The plan should also focus on significant improvements in environmental performance related to sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, or mercury control, recycling or reusing coal combustion wastes, and capturing and reusing carbon dioxide. The plan should focus on improving design efficiency by at least 3 percent and enhancing environmental performance related to sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, mercury control, coal combustion waste recycling, and carbon dioxide capture. It should aim to dispose of carbon dioxide at a lower cost than current technologies. SEC. 9. FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. The Secretary must solicit proposals for projects at new or existing facilities to achieve specified performance levels within 180 days of transmitting the plan to Congress. Projects may demonstrate efficiency improvements and emission reductions without increasing pollutants. In the case of sulfur dioxide emissions from coal combustion, the percentage of allowable emissions varies based on the potential concentration of sulfur in the fuel. For coal with higher sulfur content, 5 percent of potential emissions are allowed, while for coal with lower sulfur content, 15 percent is permitted. In the case of emissions from a boiler, the allowable levels are 0.1 pound per million British thermal units for non-cyclone-fired boilers, 15 percent of uncontrolled nitrogen oxide emissions for cyclone-fired boilers, and 0.02 pound per million British thermal units for particulate matter. Alternatively, emission levels can also comply with the Clean Air Act standards at the time of construction, installation, or retrofitting of advanced coal-based technology. Financial assistance will be provided by the Secretary for projects that demonstrate cost reductions in coal utilization for energy generation and improve coal competitiveness among various energy sources in the US. Financial assistance will be provided by the Secretary for projects that aim to meet electricity generation requirements, achieve cost-effective criteria, and demonstrate applicable technologies for coal-based electricity facilities. The Federal share of project costs shall not exceed 50%, with $100,000,000 authorized annually for fiscal years 2002 through 2012. Alternative funding sources may also be utilized by the Secretary for this purpose. The Secretary can use unobligated funds for fossil energy programs and funds from clean coal technology projects that are not used. Appropriations for a fiscal year will be reduced by the amount of funds used in this manner."
