    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Gulf Security and Iran Sanctions Enforcement Act\" and includes a restriction on participation in offshore oil and gas leasing. The \"Gulf Security and Iran Sanctions Enforcement Act\" mandates that leases for drilling on the Outer Continental Shelf require annual certification from the lessee to confirm compliance with Iran sanctions. Failure to certify or providing false information may result in lease cancellation. The Secretary of the Interior will cancel the lease if the lessee fails to make or provides false certification required under the Act. Additionally, each lease for drilling on the Outer Continental Shelf must include a provision for disclosing any involvement in energy-related ventures outside Iran. Persons or entities whose property is blocked under specific Executive Orders or listed on the Iranian Transactions Regulations are prohibited from transacting with others. The Secretary has the authority to cancel a lease if a person fails to disclose required information or provides false information. The Secretary may waive this requirement on a case-by-case basis if it is in the national interest. The Secretary of the Interior must report waivers granted under the Act to congressional committees every 120 days and report lease cancellations promptly with explanations. Appropriate congressional committees include specific House and Senate committees. The term \"person\" is defined in section 14(14) of the Iran Sanctions Act of 1996. The Act will end 30 days after the President certifies to Congress that Iran has stopped supporting terrorism, pursuing weapons of mass destruction, and no longer poses a threat to US national security or allies."
