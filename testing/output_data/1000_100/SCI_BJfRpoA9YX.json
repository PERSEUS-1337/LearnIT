    "content": "We propose a generative model architecture to learn image representations that separate object identity from attributes. This allows for manipulation of image attributes without changing the object's identity. Our model achieves competitive scores on facial attribute classification tasks using latent space generative models like GANs and VAEs. The latent space learned by these models is often organized linearly, with certain directions corresponding to changes in attribute intensity, such as smiling in faces. This allows for image attribute manipulation without altering object identity. Latent space generative models can be used for image synthesis, editing, and avatar synthesis by manipulating the latent space. Research has focused on class conditional image synthesis, including fine-grained categories like different dog breeds or celebrities' faces. The text discusses the challenge of image attribute manipulation in synthesizing similar faces with only one attribute changed, requiring a latent space representation that separates object category from attributes. A new model is proposed to learn a factored representation for faces. The text introduces a new model that learns a factored representation for faces, separating attribute information from the rest of the facial representation. The model is applied to the CelebA BID21 dataset of faces, controlling several facial attributes. Key contributions include a novel cost function for training a VAE encoder to learn a latent representation that factorizes binary facial attribute information from a continuous identity representation, extensive quantitative analysis of loss components, competitive classification scores, and qualitative results showing successful editing of the 'Smiling' attribute in over 90% of test cases. Latent space generative models like Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) allow synthesis of novel data samples from latent encodings. VAE consists of an encoder and decoder, trained to maximize the evidence lower bound (ELBO) on log p(x). Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) use the evidence lower bound (ELBO) to maximize log p(x). The encoder predicts \u00b5 \u03c6 (x) and \u03c3 \u03c6 (x), drawing a latent sample \u1e91 from q \u03c6 (z|x). By choosing a multivariate Gaussian prior, the KL-divergence can be calculated analytically. VAEs offer a generative model p \u03b8 (x|z) and an encoding model q \u03c6 (z|x) for image editing in the latent space. Samples from VAEs are often blurred. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) offer a sharper alternative to VAEs for image synthesis. GANs consist of a generator and discriminator trained using convolutional neural networks in a mini-max game. The generator aims to confuse the discriminator by synthesizing samples indistinguishable from real ones. The objective function involves the distribution of synthesized samples and a chosen sampling method. The vanilla GAN model lacks a simple way to map data samples to latent space. While some GAN variants involve learning an encoder model, only one approach allows faithful reconstruction of data samples. This approach requires adversarial training on high-dimensional distributions, which remains challenging despite proposed improvements. Instead of adding a decoder to a GAN, a latent generative model combining a VAE with a GAN is considered. The VAE learns an encoding and decoding process, with a discriminator ensuring higher quality data samples. Combining VAEs and GANs has been explored with different structures and loss functions, but none specifically for attribute editing. Vanilla VAEs and GANs generate samples based on latent variables, while conditional VAEs and GANs allow for class-specific data synthesis. Autoencoders are also mentioned in the context of synthesizing samples from particular categories. Autoencoders can be augmented for category-conditional image synthesis by appending a one-hot label vector to inputs. A more interesting approach involves the encoder outputting a latent vector and an attribute vector for conditional autoencoders. Incorporating attribute information in this way has drawbacks. Incorporating attribute information in conditional VAEs can lead to unpredictable changes in synthesized data samples. The label information in the attribute vector may be partially contained in the latent vector, causing issues in editing specific attributes. This problem is similar to issues observed in GAN literature, where label information is often ignored during sample synthesis. The independence of the latent vector and attribute vector may not always hold true when editing attributes. The proposed process 'Adversarial Information Factorization' aims to separate information about attributes from a latent vector using a mini-max optimization involving an encoder and an auxiliary network. By ensuring that the latent vector contains no information about the attributes, the process allows for accurate prediction of attributes from the latent vector. The proposed method involves training an auxiliary network to predict attributes accurately from a latent vector while updating the VAE encoder to output values that prevent this prediction. This approach aims to separate attribute information from the latent vector, integrating it into a VAE-GAN model to improve image quality. The architecture includes an auxiliary network for factorizing label information from the latent encoding. The encoder also functions as a classifier, outputting attribute and latent vectors. Parameters of the decoder are updated using a loss function, and the encoder parameters are updated to synthesize images from a desired category. The curr_chunk discusses the proposal of an additional network and cost function for training an encoder used for attribute manipulation. It introduces a model with a VAE core and information factorization, along with the incorporation of a GAN architecture. The prev_chunk describes the architecture including an auxiliary network for factorizing label information from the latent encoding. The curr_chunk introduces an auxiliary network, A \u03c8, to factor label information out of the latent encoding \u1e91. The encoder, E \u03c6, is updated to prevent A \u03c8 from making correct predictions, encouraging attribute information not to be placed in \u1e91. Training is complete when A \u03c8 is maximally confused and cannot predict the true label y from \u1e91 = E z,\u03c6(x). The encoder loss is determined by this confusion, resulting in a conditional VAE-GAN model. The encoder loss is determined by the confusion of the auxiliary network A \u03c8, resulting in a conditional VAE-GAN model called Information Factorization cVAE-GAN (IFcVAE-GAN). Attribute manipulation is achieved by encoding the image, appending the desired attribute label, and passing it through the decoder. Quantitative and qualitative results are presented to evaluate the model. Following an ablation study, facial attribute classification was performed using a DCGAN architecture. Residual layers were incorporated to improve classification results. The model was qualitatively evaluated for image attribute editing. Two types of cVAE-GAN models were used: a naive cVAE-GAN and an Information Factorization cVAE-GAN. Factorization cVAE-GAN (IFcVAE-GAN) quantifies reconstruction quality and attribute manipulation success by training a classifier on real images to classify desired attributes. Classification scores on edited images indicate control over attribute changes. Smaller reconstruction error and larger classification scores suggest better performance. Our model successfully edits images to have the 'Not Smiling' attribute in 81.3% of cases and the 'Smiling' attribute in all cases. The inclusion of a classification loss on reconstructed samples greatly affects attribute editing performance. The IcGAN approach has been proposed for conditional image synthesis, but has not been used in the VAE literature. It aims to maximize I(x; y) by providing label information to the decoder, but does not factorize attribute information well. In comparison, our model achieves better attribute editing tasks by learning a representation for faces that separates identity from facial attributes. Our model minimizes mutual information between identity and facial attribute encodings, ensuring label information is in \u0177, not \u1e91. It excels in facial attribute classification, outperforming a state-of-the-art classifier by over 1% on 2 out of 10 metrics. The model effectively factorizes information about facial attributes from identity representation. It focuses on attribute manipulation, showcasing limitations of a cVAE-GAN in editing desired attributes. The study focuses on learning a representation that preserves identity while allowing factorization for attribute manipulation. The cVAE-GAN model failed to edit samples for the 'Not Smiling' case, highlighting the need for models with a factored latent representation. The proposed IFcVAE-GAN model achieved good reconstruction quality by adjusting weightings on loss terms and using specific hyperparameters during training. The study introduced a model with specific hyperparameters that achieved good reconstruction quality for attribute manipulation. The model outperformed the cVAE-GAN in synthesizing images with the 'Not Smiling' attribute, demonstrating its effectiveness in image attribute editing tasks. Our model, IFcVAE-GAN, outperforms the cVAE-GAN in synthesizing images without smiles, achieving comparable reconstruction errors. The model is also applied to manipulate other facial attributes, such as 'Blonde Hair', with promising results. Our model, IFcVAE-GAN, demonstrates high-quality reconstruction and attribute editing. It factors attributes from identity, uses an auxiliary classifier for representation factorization, and achieves competitive scores on facial attribute classification tasks. Our model, IFcVAE-GAN, utilizes adversarial training to factor attribute label information out of the encoded latent representation. Similar approaches by Schmidhuber and BID16 also factorize the latent space, but our model incorporates this technique into the encoder of a generative model to predict attribute information. Unlike BID16, our model minimizes mutual information between latent representations and labels via adversarial information factorization. Our work closely resembles the cVAE-GAN architecture proposed by BID3 for synthesizing samples of a particular class. The objective is to synthesize a specific class of samples, like a \"Hathway\" face, rather than manipulating single attributes. Changing categories is easier as it results in noticeable image changes, while changing attributes requires targeted changes with minimal impact on the rest of the image. The model also learns a classifier for input images and emphasizes the need for \"identity preservation\" in the latent space. Our work focuses on latent space generative models for attribute editing in images, highlighting the importance of factoring label information out of the encoding for successful editing. This approach differs from category conditional image synthesis and emphasizes the need for semantically meaningful changes in image space. In image editing, our approach focuses on using a single generative model to edit attributes by changing a unit in the encoding. This differs from image-to-image models and emphasizes the importance of factoring out label information for successful editing. Our approach involves using a mini-max objective to factorize the latent space and learn disentangled representations of images, allowing for easy modification of image attributes like facial expressions. Our approach involves using a mini-max objective to factorize the latent space and learn disentangled representations of images, allowing for easy modification of image attributes like facial expressions. The Information Factorization conditional VAE-GAN model encourages attribute information to be factored out of the identity representation, facilitating accurate attribute editing without affecting identity. The model outperforms pre-existing models for category conditional image synthesis and is highly effective as a classifier. Our model is highly effective as a classifier, achieving state of the art accuracy on facial attribute classification. A table demonstrates an ablation study for our model with the residual network architecture. Results show the need for L aux loss and the impact of increased regularization on reconstruction quality. There is no significant benefit to using the L class loss. These findings are consistent with previous studies on the IFcVAE-GAN model. Results show that small amounts of KL regularization are necessary for good reconstruction in the GAN architecture of BID27. Models trained without L gan have slightly lower reconstruction error but produce blurred images. Even without L gan or L KL loss, the model can accurately edit attributes but with poor visual quality, indicating successful factorization of attribute information. Other models can also learn factored representations from unlabelled data. The representation learned by models like BID28, BID14, and BID5 can be evaluated using a linear classifier on latent encodings for facial attribute classification. Comparing the performance of E y,\u03c6 to a linear classifier trained on latent representations from DIP-VAE, known for learning disentangled representations from unlabelled data."
