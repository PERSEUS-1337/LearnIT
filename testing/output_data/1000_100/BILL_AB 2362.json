    "title": "AB 2362",
    "content": "The people of California enact the following: Existing law requires landlords to provide written notification to tenants before applying pesticides in certain ways to a dwelling unit or common area without a licensed pest control operator. The notification must include details such as the pest to be targeted, the pesticide to be used, the frequency of its use, and a health and safety statement. The bill aims to ensure that owners and tenants in common interest developments are notified in writing before pesticides are applied by the homeowner association or its agents, similar to the notification required when applied by a licensed pest control operator. The new section added to the Civil Code defines \"adjacent separate interest\" as a separate interest directly beside, above, or below another separate interest or common area. The curr_chunk defines key terms related to pesticide application in common interest developments, including \"authorized agent,\" \"broadcast application,\" \"electronic delivery,\" \"licensed pest control operator,\" \"pest,\" and \"pesticide.\" An association or its agent must provide written notice to owners and tenants before applying pesticides without a licensed pest control operator, including information on the pests to be controlled and the pesticide product to be used. CAUTION \u2013 Pesticides are toxic chemicals. Unlicensed use is allowed based on scientific evidence if proper conditions are followed. Risk depends on exposure, so minimize it. If experiencing symptoms after pesticide application, contact a physician or the California Poison Control System. For more information, contact the County Health Department for health questions and the Department of Pesticide Regulation for regulatory information. The association must provide notice at least 48 hours before applying pesticides, including the approximate date, time, and frequency of application. The notification must state that these details are subject to change. The association must provide notice 48 hours before applying pesticides in common areas. If not practicable, individual notice must be given to adjacent owners and tenants. In case of immediate health threat, notice must be posted within one hour after application. Tenants can receive notice through mail or personal delivery. Upon receipt of written notification, the owner or tenant may agree to allow immediate pesticide application by the association. Prior oral agreement can be made for immediate application in case of a request before the 48-hour notice period. The association must provide written notice before pesticide application, either in the separate interest or at the entrance. If other owners or tenants need to be notified, they should receive the notice promptly after the oral agreement is made, but no later than the pesticide application begins. A written notice must be attached to the board meeting minutes following the pesticide application."
