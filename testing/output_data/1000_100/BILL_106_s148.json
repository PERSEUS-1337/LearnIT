    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act\". Congress finds that approximately 500 bird species in the United States migrate among countries, with many neotropical migratory bird populations in decline due to habitat loss and degradation. Neotropical migratory birds require international cooperation for conservation efforts along their migration routes. Initiatives to conserve these birds and their habitat can be strengthened through increased coordination. The purposes of this Act are to perpetuate healthy populations of neotropical migratory birds, support conservation initiatives in the United States, Latin America, and the Caribbean, and provide financial resources for international cooperation.
