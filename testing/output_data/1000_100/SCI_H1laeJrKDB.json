    "content": "Recent deep generative models can provide photo-realistic images and content embeddings for computer vision and natural language processing tasks. Recent works focus on studying the semantics of the latent space to improve control over the generative process. A new method is proposed in this paper to enhance interpretability by finding meaningful directions in the latent space for precise control over properties like object position or scale in generated images. The method is weakly supervised and suitable for encoding simple transformations in generated images. The method proposed in the current text chunk enhances control over generated images by finding meaningful directions in the latent space for precise transformations like translation, zoom, or color variations. This method is effective for both GANs and variational auto-encoders, addressing the limitations of generative models in controlling the output images. The study explores modifying attributes of generated images by manipulating latent codes, providing insights into the structure of generative models' latent space. It reveals that latent spaces exhibit a vector space structure encoding factors of variations like object presence, positions, and lighting in images. The latent space of generative models encodes factors of variations like object presence, positions, and lighting in images. While discrete factors correspond to isolated clusters, continuous factors are described by a range of values. Control over image generation is limited to discrete factors, requiring labels and an encoder model, while continuous factors described by a real parameter t have been explored in previous works. In this paper, a method is proposed to control specific continuous factors of variations in generative models' latent space, such as vertical position, horizontal position, and scale of objects in images. The method does not require labeled datasets or an encoder model and can potentially be adapted for other variations like rotations, brightness, contrast, and color changes. The focus is on position and scale variations due to their evaluative nature. The method proposed in the paper focuses on finding interpretable directions in the latent space of generative models to control factors of variations in generated images. It demonstrates the effectiveness of the method both qualitatively and quantitatively, showing that properties of generated images can be controlled precisely by sampling latent representations along linear directions. The paper also introduces a novel reconstruction loss for inverting generative models and provides insights into the challenges of inverting generative models with optimization. The study focuses on disentanglement in generative models to control image properties by modifying latent codes. It is easier to alter an image than to label its properties. By determining latent codes, transformations can be computed in the latent space. The study explores disentanglement in generative models to control image properties through latent codes. By finding the latent code for an image, transformations can be computed in the latent space to modify the image. The optimization problem involves finding an approximate latent code that minimizes a reconstruction error between the original image and its projection. The choice of the reconstruction error is crucial in this process. The optimization problem in generative models involves choosing a reconstruction error, with pixel-wise Mean Squared Error and cross-entropy commonly used but known to produce blurry images. Alternative reconstruction errors have been proposed but are computationally expensive. The poor performance of MSE is attributed to favoring the expected value of all possibilities. The study aims to delve deeper into this explanation by analyzing the effect of MSE on images in the frequency domain. The generator in generative models struggles to produce diverse texture patterns due to limitations in its latent space. High frequencies in the Fourier domain contribute to blurry results when using pixel-wise errors. To address this, a loss function is proposed that reduces the weight of high frequencies, leading to sharper outputs. The loss function proposed reduces the weight of high frequencies in the Fourier domain, allowing for more detailed and realistic generated images. Comparison to other losses is done using LPIPS, and an optimization problem is solved to find z T such that G(z T ) \u2248 T T (I). Algorithm 1 creates a dataset of trajectories in the latent space corresponding to a transformation in the pixel space. The transformation is controlled by a parameter \u03b4t, and nearby pixels are assumed to follow the same distribution. This approach aims to address difficulties in convergence due to initialization issues. To improve convergence, Zhu et al. (2016) suggested using an auxiliary network for initialization. However, training a specific network for this task is costly. Natural images in pixel space exhibit a highly curved manifold, making linear combinations of images unnatural. To address slow convergence, we decompose the transformation into smaller steps and optimize sequentially without the need for extra training. Our approach, unlike Zhu et al. (2016), does not require additional training. We qualitatively compare our method to naive optimization in Appendix C. Transforming an image can result in undefined regions, which we ignore when computing L. Generative models may struggle to produce certain images, such as those outside the dataset's object shape positions. When generating images randomly, there is no guarantee they will remain within the data manifold. To mitigate outliers, we discard latent codes. After discarding outliers in the latent space, Algorithm 1 is used to generate trajectories. A model is then defined to predict factors of variations encoded in the latent space, assuming a monotonic differentiable function. The distribution of t = g(z, u) when z \u223c N(0, I) is given by a parametrized model g\u03b8 : R \u2192 R with trainable parameters \u03b8. The model typically uses piece-wise linear functions for g\u03b8, but it cannot be trained directly as only the difference \u03b4t = t G(z\u03b4t) \u2212 t G(z0) is accessible. The method involves modeling \u03b4t instead of t to estimate u and \u03b8 by minimizing MSE between \u03b4t and f(\u03b8,u)(z\u03b4t) - f(\u03b8,u)(z0) using gradient descent. This allows control over the distribution of images generated by G, enabling the choice of sampling images based on a desired distribution. This method provides control not only on individual outputs but also on the overall distribution of outputs from generative models. The experiments were conducted on two datasets: dSprites, consisting of binary images with varying shapes, and ILSVRC, containing natural images from different categories. The implementation was done using TensorFlow 2.0 and a BigGAN model, with code available for reproduction. The BigGAN model uses a latent vector and a one-hot vector to generate images from specific categories. The latent vector is split into six parts for different scale levels in the generator. \u03b2-VAEs were also trained to study disentanglement in generation control. Training was done on dSprites with an Adam optimizer for 1e5 steps. Evaluating the method's effectiveness on complex datasets is challenging. The analysis focused on two factors of variations: position and scale. Position estimation was effective on simple datasets like dSprites by computing the barycenter of white pixels. For natural images from BigGAN, saliency detection was used to extract the barycenter. Scale was evaluated by the proportion of salient pixels using a specific evaluation procedure. The proposed method allows for precise control of object position and scale in images from selected categories of ILSVRC, as shown in the quantitative analysis results. This approach is more generic compared to other methods that rely on object detectors for evaluation. The study merged datasets to learn a common direction for trajectories across categories. Results show shared directions for factors of variation. The latent code parts encoding position and scale in BigGAN were analyzed. The study analyzed the encoding of spatial factors of variations in BigGAN, showing that y position has a higher contribution than x position and scale. Results on geometric transformations for training and validation datasets are presented, with a note on the algorithm's limitations at large scales due to poor performance of the saliency model. The study tested the effect of disentanglement on method performance using \u03b2-VAE on dSprites with different \u03b2 values. Results showed better control of object position in the image with higher \u03b2 values, indicating a more disentangled latent space.\u03b2-VAE with larger \u03b2 values resulted in decreased standard deviation, improving method effectiveness. As \u03b2 increases, the standard deviation decreases, allowing for more precise control of image generation. The goal is to find interpretable directions in the latent space of generative models for control. Differentiating between GAN-like models and auto-encoders, conditional GANs and VAEs offer ways to control generated images but require specific design and labeled datasets. Our method aims to find interpretable directions in the latent space of generative models for control without the need for labels. Unlike other approaches like VAE and InfoGan, we do not require specific design or labeled datasets. Our method allows for precise control of image generation without changing the learning process.

It also discusses using spherical interpolation to reduce blurriness and proposes a data augmentation technique for generating less blurry images with a VAE.

Results show accurate reconstruction with \u03c3 = 3 and \u03c3 = 5, penalizing low frequencies for better results. Comparison with MSE and DSSIM methods is illustrated, showing the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Additionally, quantitative evaluation using LPIPS on images from the ILSVRC dataset demonstrates the performance of the method. The study compares image reconstruction using LPIPS with MSE and DSSIM methods, showing that LPIPS results in images closer to the target. The curvature of the natural image manifold complicates optimization, especially for non-linear transformations like translation and rotation. The study explores image reconstruction using LPIPS, highlighting challenges with optimization due to the curvature of the natural image manifold. Large translations and rotations pose problems as the shortest path in pixel-space is near orthogonal to the manifold. This issue affects the gradient during optimization of the latent code, making it small in cases of near orthogonality. In an ideal case where G is a bijection between Z and natural images, optimization can slow down if the gradient is orthogonal to the manifold. For example, in a scenario with a small white circle on a black background, moving the circle to the right may result in the gradient being zero if the circles do not intersect. The reconstruction error remains unchanged with a small object translation. Qualitative examples show results for geometric transformations and brightness using the BigGAN model. Latent codes are sampled for position, scale, and brightness with learned directions. Some categories may not control brightness due to training data limitations. The direction for position and scale is learned on ten categories, while for brightness, only the top five categories are used."
