    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Smartphone Theft Prevention Act\". Congress finds that mobile device theft costs consumers $30 billion annually, with 1 in 3 robberies involving mobile device theft. Carriers, manufacturers, law enforcement, and the Federal Communications Commission have collaborated to address this issue, but more action is needed. Consumers deserve secure technology to protect their information, and advancements in technological protections benefit the economy, consumers, and public safety. The wireless industry should educate consumers about security tools in partnership with law enforcement. The mobile device industry, law enforcement, and consumer advocates should proactively develop solutions to protect consumers, drive innovation, and deter theft. SEC. 343. FUNCTION FOR STOLEN MOBILE DEVICES. Part I of title III of the Communications Act of 1934 is amended to include a function for stolen mobile devices. In this section, definitions are provided for terms related to mobile devices, including 'account holder', 'commercial mobile data service', 'commercial mobile service', and 'mobile device'. The definitions clarify who is considered an account holder for a mobile device and the types of services and devices covered. The provider of commercial mobile service or data service must offer a function on the mobile device for the account holder to remotely delete all their information and make the device unusable on any network globally. The provider must offer a function on the mobile device for the account holder to remotely delete all information and render the device unusable globally, even if turned off or without the data storage medium. The device must prevent reactivation or reprogramming without authorization and reverse any unauthorized actions if recovered. Manufacturing or importing devices in the US for sale must adhere to these standards. The US requires mobile devices to have a function for remote data deletion and rendering the device unusable globally. Providers can be exempt if they offer technology with equivalent functionality. The Commission may exempt manufacturers and importers from the requirement for remote data deletion and device rendering if the device allows for technology with equivalent functionality. Additionally, a waiver may be granted for low-cost, voice-only mobile devices. The Commission may waive requirements for low-cost mobile devices primarily for voice service with limited data functions. Providers cannot charge fees for certain functions, and violators may face forfeiture penalties. The Commission may impose forfeiture penalties on violators of subsection (b) or (c) of section 503(b) in addition to any other penalties. Manufacturers and providers of mobile services can take actions to protect consumers from mobile device theft without violating this section. The term \"mobile device\" is defined in section 343 of the Communications Act of 1934. The Communications Act of 1934, added subsection (a), applies to mobile devices manufactured or imported into the US after January 1, 2015. The FCC can grant compliance extensions for those needing more time to meet requirements under section 343(b)."
