SEC. 7. ELIGIBILITY VERIFICATION PROCESS FOR ACA SUBSIDIES. A marketplace can automatically reenroll an individual in a qualified health plan annually, considering eligibility for subsidies and income changes. If the marketplace does not follow the specified processes, there are reenrollment limitations. The marketplace may not automatically reenroll an individual in a qualified health plan with subsidies until current income information is provided for redetermination. This section aligns with guidance on annual eligibility redeterminations and reenrollments issued by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in 2015. The marketplace must ensure that enrollees maintain authorization for disclosure of information, provide updated income details annually, and receive timely notices for redeterminations and reenrollments. The term \"marketplace\" refers to State Based Exchanges and the Federally Facilitated Exchange established under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act."
