    "content": "The Act titled \"Medicare Drug Formulary Protection Act\" allows for the removal of covered Part D drugs from the prescription drug plan formulary. The Medicare Drug Formulary Protection Act prohibits the removal of covered Part D drugs from the prescription drug plan formulary starting in 2006. The Medicare Drug Formulary Protection Act prohibits limitations on drug coverage, except at the beginning of each plan year or for newly enrolled individuals. The Medicare Drug Formulary Protection Act prohibits restrictions on drug coverage for individuals who enroll in a prescription drug plan, preventing the removal of covered drugs or imposing coverage limitations until the end of the plan year. The Medicare Drug Formulary Protection Act prevents restrictions on drug coverage for enrollees in prescription drug plans, allowing exceptions for new therapeutic uses and newly covered part D drugs. Exceptions include brand name drugs with generic alternatives approved under the Food and Drug Cosmetic Act. The Medicare Drug Formulary Protection Act allows exceptions for drug coverage restrictions in prescription drug plans, including brand name drugs going off-patent, drugs with FDA-imposed restrictions, and ineffective drugs. PDP sponsors must provide notice of removal under exceptions to limitations. The Medicare Drug Formulary Protection Act requires PDP sponsors to give appropriate notice of any removal or change in formulary or coverage restrictions to the Secretary, affected enrollees, physicians, pharmacies, and pharmacists. Additionally, sponsors must provide annual notice of changes in formulary and coverage limitations to enrollees during the coordinated election period. The Medicare Drug Formulary Protection Act mandates PDP sponsors to notify about any formulary changes or coverage restrictions to the Secretary and affected parties. The amendment specifies that the notice of changes in formulary or coverage limitations must be provided during the annual coordinated election periods."
