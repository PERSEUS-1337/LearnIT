    "content": "The \"Primary Care Enhancement Act of 2015\" allows for direct primary care service arrangements where individuals pay a fixed fee for ongoing primary care services, not billed to third parties. This arrangement is not considered a health plan or insurance for tax purposes. SEC. 3 amends the Internal Revenue Code to include periodic provider fees as medical care. This applies to taxable years after the enactment of the Act. SEC. 4 establishes the Medicare Primary Care Medical Home Demonstration Program. Section 1115A of the Social Security Act is amended to include a Primary Care Medical Home Model where qualified practices are reimbursed for services provided to individuals enrolled under part B of title XVIII. The Primary Care Medical Home Model reimburses qualified practices for services provided to individuals enrolled under part B of title XVIII. The Secretary establishes a periodic fee for each individual in the practice, ensuring affordable primary care. The Secretary establishes a periodic fee for individuals in the Primary Care Medical Home Model, capped at twenty percent of estimated monthly payments from Medicare Trust Funds. Performance benchmarks are set using ACO quality measures in the Medicare shared savings program. In 1899, adjustments are made to the periodic fee paid to qualified direct primary care medical home practices based on performance benchmarks. Practices meeting or exceeding the benchmark receive a 5 percent fee increase for each enrolled individual, while those not meeting the benchmark do not receive the increase. The periodic fee paid to qualified direct primary care medical home practices can be adjusted based on performance benchmarks. If a practice fails to meet the benchmark for 2 consecutive years, their participation in the model may be terminated. Practices are required to provide preventive care services. The medical homes offer preventive care, wellness counseling, primary care, coordination with specialty and hospital care, availability of ongoing care appointments 7 days a week, secure e-mail and telephone consultation, and a primary care provider panel size that supports the scope of services. The Secretary gives priority to direct primary care medical home practices enrolling dual eligible individuals, defined as those enrolled in part B of title XVIII and meeting specific criteria under the Social Security Act. The qualified direct primary care medical home practices in the model are not considered insurance products and are not regulated as such by State insurance commissioners. These practices must report annually to the Secretary on the progress of enrolled individuals with chronic conditions regarding emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and surgeries. The Secretary will provide qualified direct primary care medical home practices with necessary patient data for clinical purposes and evaluation of the model. This includes information on surgeries, specialist visits, and advanced radiology usage. Additionally, physicians currently opted out of Medicare are included in the model. Physicians opted out of Medicare can participate in direct primary care practices under the model, with payment made for services to Medicare beneficiaries under private contracts. Excluded physicians from federal health care programs cannot participate. The duration of participation is subject to certain conditions. The Secretary will conduct the model for at least 3 years. Qualified direct primary care medical home practices meeting requirements can continue permanently after the third year. The Secretary will expand the model nationwide if participating medical home practices meet requirements. The Medicare Advantage Program may utilize Direct Primary Care Medical Homes, subject to meeting requirements for expansion nationwide. The Medicare Advantage Program allows Medicare Advantage organizations to contract with qualified direct primary care medical home practices to offer primary care services and share savings. Qualified direct primary care medical home practices are defined as those described in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act."
