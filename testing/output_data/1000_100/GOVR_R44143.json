    "content": "Under the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause, both state and federal governments are prohibited from denying equal protection of the laws. Courts apply different levels of scrutiny based on the classification involved, with higher scrutiny for more suspect classifications. This increases the likelihood of a court finding the government's action unconstitutional. Strict scrutiny is the most demanding form of judicial review, applied to governmental classifications that are constitutionally suspect or interfere with fundamental rights. Courts consider historical discrimination, minority status, or inadequate political protection when determining suspect classifications. Suspect classifications include those based on race, national origin, and alienage. When applying strict scrutiny, reviewing courts assess whether the governmental action is narrowly tailored. When reviewing governmental action, courts apply strict scrutiny to suspect classifications like race or national origin, requiring the action to be narrowly tailored to a compelling government interest. Intermediate scrutiny is less stringent but still requires the action to be substantially related to an important government interest, such as gender-based classifications. Rational basis review is the least demanding form of judicial review. Rational basis review is the least searching form of judicial scrutiny, applying to classifications not subject to heightened levels of scrutiny. To survive, governmental action must be rationally related to a legitimate government interest. Courts consider the legitimacy of any possible governmental purpose, and the action only needs to be a reasonable way of achieving the purpose. Rational basis review is deferential to the government, presuming that the action is valid. The U.S. Constitution's due process guarantees in the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments prevent the government from depriving individuals of life, liberty, or property without following certain procedural and substantive requirements. The Supreme Court interprets these guarantees to include both procedural and substantive protections. Substantive due process protects fundamental rights from undue government infringement, subjecting such actions to strict scrutiny. The government must show a compelling interest and narrowly tailor its actions to avoid encumbering fundamental rights. The Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell v. Hodges resolved a circuit split on the constitutionality of state same-sex marriage bans, finding them unconstitutional. This decision recognized the fundamental right to marry for same-sex couples under the Fourteenth Amendment's substantive due process guarantees. The Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell v. Hodges declared state same-sex marriage bans unconstitutional, citing due process and equal protection principles. The Court emphasized the fundamental right to marry, stating that reasons for this right apply equally to same-sex couples, including individual autonomy, support for committed unions, and safeguarding children within marriages. The Supreme Court extended the fundamental right to marry to same-sex couples, acknowledging a departure from precedent. The Court emphasized that rights should not be defined by historical practices to prevent new groups from exercising fundamental rights. The Supreme Court extended the fundamental right to marry to same-sex couples, emphasizing that rights should not be defined by historical practices to prevent new groups from exercising fundamental rights. The Court found that rights also arise from a better understanding of constitutional imperatives in our era. It did not apply strict scrutiny to state same-sex marriage bans, departing from precedent and the approaches of lower courts. States argued for bans based on the desire to wait and see how the same-sex marriage debate progresses. The Supreme Court extended the right to marry to same-sex couples, emphasizing that historical practices should not prevent new groups from exercising fundamental rights. The Court did not apply strict scrutiny to state same-sex marriage bans, noting the invalidity of justifications like waiting to see how the debate progresses and incentivizing procreating couples to stay together during child rearing. The Court held that equal protection and due process guarantees protect the right to marry for same-sex couples. The dissenting Justices in Obergefell believed the majority overstepped by deciding on same-sex marriage, arguing it should have been left to the people. They also criticized the majority for establishing a new fundamental right not based on tradition or history, which they believed could lead to the Court making policy decisions on constitutional rights. The Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell regarding state same-sex marriage bans raised questions about its broader impact on the rights of gay individuals, the level of judicial scrutiny for classifications based on sexual orientation, implications for laws prohibiting plural marriages, and the Court's approach to recognizing fundamental rights. The decision seems limited to the marriage context, sparking debates on extending rights to gay individuals outside of marriage. The Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell focused on same-sex marriage bans, emphasizing the fundamental right to marry. It did not address the level of scrutiny for classifications based on sexual orientation, which could have broader implications for gay individuals' rights. The U.S. Courts of Appeals have differing views on the level of scrutiny for classifications based on sexual orientation. The Ninth and Second Circuits apply heightened scrutiny, while the Sixth Circuit only uses rational basis review. The Obergefell decision focused on the right to marry and may be limited to that context. The Obergefell decision focused on the fundamental right to marry, but did not resolve the circuit split on the level of scrutiny for classifications based on sexual orientation. This ambiguity leaves open the possibility that different circuit courts may apply either heightened scrutiny or rational basis review to laws based on sexual orientation. The Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell raised questions about extending the fundamental right to marry to polygamy, with Chief Justice John Roberts suggesting it could lead to the legalization of plural marriages. However, the majority's opinion seems limited to same-sex marriage, possibly to prevent extending the right to plural marriages. The Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell extended the fundamental right to marry to same-sex couples. While some argue that this rationale may not apply to plural marriages, others suggest that aspects of the Court's opinion could potentially support constitutional protections for plural marriages. The majority in Obergefell departed from precedent by considering factors beyond historical recognition when determining a fundamental right. The Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell extended the fundamental right to marry to same-sex couples, considering factors beyond historical recognition. This could lead to an expansion of rights deemed fundamental, raising questions about the level of judicial scrutiny for governmental actions infringing on fundamental rights. Increased scrutiny decreases the likelihood of finding government action constitutional, creating ambiguity about permissible government interference with fundamental rights."
