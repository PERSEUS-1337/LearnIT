    "content": "The \"Welfare to Work Act of 1994\" may be cited as the short title. The Congress expresses its sense regarding the act. The Congress acknowledges the challenges faced by welfare recipients in finding permanent employment and emphasizes the importance of creating entry-level jobs. It is believed that work experience in the private sector is more valuable than government workfare programs. The goal is to break the cycle of welfare dependency. To break the cycle of welfare dependency, maximize AFDC payments by exchanging them for work, providing a pathway to permanent employment, and offering a one-year tax credit to businesses for hiring AFDC recipients. SEC. 3. REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR HIRING AFDC RECIPIENTS. An amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 introduces a refundable credit for businesses that employ AFDC recipients. A tax credit is allowed for qualified first-year wages, with 50% of wages up to $6,000 and 25% of wages between $6,000 and $12,000. Qualified first-year wages are defined as wages for services in the first year of employment. The term 'qualified wages' refers to wages paid to qualified former AFDC recipients during the taxable year. A qualified former AFDC recipient is an individual certified by the designated local agency. The agency defines a family member receiving benefits under a State plan as ineligible if their wages from the employer make the family ineligible. The term does not include individuals in a targeted group. No credit is allowed for wages paid to a qualified former AFDC recipient replacing a satisfactory employee terminated without cause. Special rules apply. Technical amendments are made to various sections of the Code, including subsection (a) of section 280C and paragraph (2) of section 1324(b) of title 31, United States Code. The table of sections for subpart C of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Code is also amended. The amendments made by this section apply to individuals who start working for the employer after the enactment of this Act."
