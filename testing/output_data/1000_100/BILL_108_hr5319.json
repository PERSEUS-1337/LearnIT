    "content": "The \"Renewable Energy Financing Incentive Act of 2004\" allows for nonrecognition of gain from the sale of real property upon subsequent purchase of renewable energy property under section 1046 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"Renewable Energy Financing Incentive Act of 2004\" allows for nonrecognition of gain from the sale of real property if the seller acquires renewable energy property within the replacement period. Gain will only result if the price for which the real property is sold exceeds the cost of the renewable energy property acquired. The \"Renewable Energy Financing Incentive Act of 2004\" allows for nonrecognition of gain from the sale of real property if renewable energy property is acquired within the replacement period. Gain is recognized unless specified otherwise, with definitions including renewable energy property as facilities using renewable sources for electricity or fuel generation. Special rules apply to partnerships and corporations. The \"Renewable Energy Financing Incentive Act of 2004\" allows for nonrecognition of gain from the sale of real property if renewable energy property is acquired within the replacement period. Stock in a corporation primarily owning or operating renewable energy property is treated as such property. Special rules apply to cooperatives and organizations subject to specific tax sections. The replacement period is defined as a 2-year period from the sale date, and property must be identified for like-kind exchanges. The basis of renewable energy property is the same as the exchanged property, adjusted for money received and gains or losses recognized. If a taxpayer disposes of renewable energy property, any unrecognized gain will be recognized. The acquisition of renewable energy property by a taxpayer is subject to certain dispositions not taken into account, including dispositions after the taxpayer's death, in a compulsory conversion before the threat, or if the disposition was for the avoidance of federal income tax. The statute of limitations applies if any gain is realized on the sale or exchange of renewable energy property. If a taxpayer sells or exchanges renewable energy property and elects nonrecognition of gain, the assessment period for any deficiency will be extended to 3 years from notifying the IRS of the cost of purchasing such property, intention not to purchase within the replacement period, or failure to do so. The assessment period for any deficiency in the case of selling renewable energy property and electing nonrecognition of gain may be extended to 3 years. Amendments are made to the tax code regarding property acquisition resulting in nonrecognition of gain. Nonrecognition of gain from sale of real property upon subsequent purchase of renewable energy property applies to real property sold after December 31, 2004."
