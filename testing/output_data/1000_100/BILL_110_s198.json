    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Act of 2007\". Congress finds that the possession of weapons of mass destruction by hostile states or terrorist groups is the greatest threat to national security. The highest priority is to protect the US and its allies from such attacks. The US policy is to ensure compliance with the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, Chemical Weapons Convention, and Biological Weapons Convention, along with the safeguards system of the IAEA and control lists of the Missile. The United States' national security interests have been supported by various acts such as the Soviet Nuclear Threat Reduction Act of 1991 (Nunn-Lugar Act), the Cooperative Threat Reduction Act of 1993, and the Defense Against Weapons of Mass Destruction Act of 1996 (Nunn-Lugar-Domenici Act). These acts align with international agreements and control lists to prevent the proliferation of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons. The Nunn-Lugar-Domenici Act, also known as the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction program, has achieved significant milestones by deactivating nuclear warheads, destroying missiles and silos, eliminating launchers and bombers, and sealing nuclear test tunnels. President George W. Bush called for the expansion of the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction program in 2004 to prevent weapons and dangerous materials from falling into the wrong hands. The program helps former Soviet states employ weapons scientists, dismantle Soviet WMD arsenal, and secure leftover weapons and materials. More work is needed in this area. The Sense of Congress is outlined in Section 3. The Sense of Congress emphasizes the need to utilize all US capabilities to prevent catastrophic terrorism using weapons of mass destruction. This includes pursuing a strategy involving multilateral agreements, missile defense, arms control, threat reduction assistance, and export controls to prevent dangerous regimes and terrorist groups from acquiring these weapons. The United States must hold nations accountable for violations of international nonproliferation treaties and provide assistance to uphold these treaties.
