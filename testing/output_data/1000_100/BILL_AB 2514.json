    "title": "AB 2514",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 34171 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to define terms related to administrative budget and administrative cost allowance for successor agencies. The administrative cost allowance for successor agencies is set at 5 percent of property tax for the period January 1, 2012, through June 30, 2012, and up to 3 percent for each fiscal year ending on June 30, 2016. The allowance cannot be less than $250,000 unless reduced by the oversight board or by agreement with the successor agency. Starting July 1, 2016, the administrative cost allowance for successor agencies is up to 3% of the property tax distributed in the previous fiscal year. The allowance cannot be less than $250,000 unless reduced by the oversight board or by agreement with the department. Starting July 1, 2016, a successor agency's annual administrative costs cannot exceed 50% of the total Redevelopment Property Tax Trust Fund distributed to pay enforceable obligations in the previous fiscal year. This limit applies regardless of whether the costs are paid within the administrative cost allowance or not, but excludes costs paid from bond proceeds or grant funds. The oversight board approves the administrative cost allowance as the sole funding source for legal expenses related to civil actions. Employee costs for project implementation activities are not considered administrative costs. \"Designated local authority\" refers to a public entity formed under specific sections. An \"enforceable obligation\" includes defined criteria. An \"enforceable obligation\" includes bonds issued by the former redevelopment agency and loans borrowed for lawful purposes that are legally required to be repaid. Bonds must include debt service, reserve set-asides, and other required payments. (C) Payments required by the federal government, preexisting obligations to the state, and obligations imposed by state law, including federal base reuse obligations for the former Norton Air Force Base as confirmed by agreements. The curr_chunk discusses enforceable payments required for agencies' employees, including pension payments and obligations from collective bargaining agreements. These costs are considered obligations payable from property tax funds, especially for employees transferred to entities assuming housing functions from former redevelopment agencies. The successor agency or designated local authority must reimburse the housing entity for employee obligations costs under an agreement pursuant to Section 34176. The oversight board, along with the successor agency, has the authority to appeal judgments or settlements against the former redevelopment agency. They can also terminate agreements or contracts with approval and provide compensation if needed. Titles or headings in documents do not determine enforceable obligations. Contracts or agreements necessary for the administration or operation of the successor agency, including litigation expenses, settlements, office space, equipment, supplies, and insurance costs, shall be paid out of the administrative cost allowance starting January 1, 2016. A sponsoring entity may provide funds to a successor agency for legal expenses related to civil actions. If the successor agency wins the case, the funds provided will be repaid as an enforceable obligation. If the successor agency loses, the funds will be considered a grant and not eligible for repayment. Repayments of amounts borrowed from the Low and Moderate Income Housing Fund of a redevelopment agency must be approved by the oversight board and transferred to the Low and Moderate Income Housing Asset Fund for affordable housing purposes. \"Enforceable obligations do not include agreements between the city and former redevelopment agency, except for written agreements related to indebtedness obligations issued by December 31, 2010, or for refunding existing obligations by June 27, 2011.\" Loan agreements entered into by the redevelopment agency and the city, county, or city and county within two years of the agency's creation may be considered enforceable obligations. Agreements related to state highway infrastructure improvements committed by the agency before June 28, 2011, are also enforceable obligations. Additionally, agreements requiring the former redevelopment agency to repay or fulfill outstanding loans or development obligations are enforceable. A loan or development obligation imposed by a federal agency, such as the Department of Housing and Urban Development, to a city, county, or city and county, which then provided those funds to the former redevelopment agency. Contracts or agreements between the former redevelopment agency and other public agencies for services or funding outside of redevelopment project areas not properly authorized under Part 1 shall be void, except for housing-related contracts authorized under Part 1. The curr_chunk defines \"Indebtedness obligations\" as bonds or other debt issued to finance redevelopment projects, \"Oversight board\" as entities established by Section 34179, and \"Recognized obligation\" as listed in the Recognized Obligation Payment Schedule. The curr_chunk defines \"Recognized Obligation Payment Schedule\" as the document outlining payment amounts and due dates for enforceable obligations, \"School entity\" as defined in the Revenue and Taxation Code, and \"Successor agency\" as the entity succeeding the former redevelopment agency. The curr_chunk defines key terms related to property taxes and redevelopment agencies, including \"taxing entities,\" \"property taxes,\" \"department,\" \"sponsoring entity,\" and \"final judicial determination.\" The curr_chunk specifies the \"housing entity administrative cost allowance\" as up to 1% of property tax allocated to the Redevelopment Obligation Retirement Fund from July 1, 2014, to July 1, 2018, with a minimum of $150,000 per fiscal year. The housing entity administrative cost allowance, if assumed by a local housing authority from a former redevelopment agency, must be listed on the Recognized Obligation Payment Schedule and remitted on January 2 and July 1. If there are insufficient funds in the Redevelopment Obligations Retirement Fund, the unpaid amount can be carried over to future Recognized Obligation Payment Schedules without a five-year limit."
