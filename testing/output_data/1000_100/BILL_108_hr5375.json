    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"United Nations Accountability Act of 2004\". Congress finds allegations of mismanagement, fraud, and corruption in the United Nations Oil-for-Food program, as identified in audits by the United Nations Office of Internal Oversight Services. The audits revealed mismanagement in contracts for independent inspection agents in Iraq, with the contractor failing to fully perform its duties. The overall conclusion was that management of the contracts was inadequate and certain provisions were not adhered to. The OIOS audit found that the contractor in the United Nations Oil-for-Food program failed to adhere to certain contract provisions, including maintaining required staffing levels, overcharging, engaging in unprofessional conduct, and reporting inaccurate figures for goods. The audit also highlighted the need for stronger contract management by the United Nations Office of Iraq Programs, as there was no designated manager in place to ensure services were in line with the contract. The United Nations policy of not releasing OIOS audit reports to member states, including audits of the Oil-for-Food Program, has hindered member states' ability to fulfill their responsibilities. The United States has been denied access to these audits despite repeated requests. SEC. 3. ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY MEASURES FOR THE UNITED NATIONS. SEC. 3. ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY MEASURES FOR THE UNITED NATIONS. Congress urges the President to ensure that OIOS audit reports are shared with member states promptly and without modifications. The Department of State must report on the adequacy of financial disclosure rules for UN officials within 180 days. The Act defines key terms such as \"oil-for-food program\" and \"Office of Internal Oversight Services\" related to United Nations resolutions. The term \"appropriate congressional committees\" refers to specific committees in the House of Representatives and the Senate."
