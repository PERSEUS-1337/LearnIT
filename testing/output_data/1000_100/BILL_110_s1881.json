    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Americans with Disabilities Act Restoration Act of 2007\". Congress finds that the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 was intended to establish a clear prohibition of discrimination based on disability, provide broad coverage, and effective remedies. However, Supreme Court decisions have narrowed the Act's protection, excluding individuals Congress aimed to protect. Congress recognized that physical and mental impairments should not hinder a person's full participation in all aspects of life. Congress recognized that physical and mental impairments should not hinder a person's full participation in society, as prejudice and societal barriers often prevent individuals from utilizing their talents and skills. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990's definition of disability was based on the broad conception of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, encompassing actual and perceived limitations imposed by society. The Supreme Court emphasized in School Board of Nassau County v. Arline that society's misconceptions about disability can be as limiting as physical impairments. Congress expected the term \"disability\" in the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 to be broadly interpreted, but the Supreme Court has not followed this expectation. The Supreme Court has interpreted the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 strictly, creating a demanding standard for qualifying as disabled. They have narrowed the application of the definition and eliminated coverage for individuals who have mitigated their impairments through measures like medication and assistive devices. The curr_chunk aims to restore the broad scope of protection under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and address Supreme Court decisions that have limited discrimination protection. The curr_chunk clarifies that the protection of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 is available for individuals facing adverse treatment due to actual or perceived impairments, prejudiced attitudes, or societal barriers. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 protects individuals from adverse treatment due to impairments, prejudiced attitudes, or societal barriers, including architectural barriers and the failure to provide reasonable modifications and accommodations. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 protects individuals from adverse treatment due to impairments, prejudiced attitudes, or societal barriers, including architectural barriers and the failure to provide reasonable modifications and accommodations. SEC. 3. FINDINGS IN AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT OF 1990. Section 2(a) of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 is amended to emphasize that physical and mental disabilities are natural parts of human experience and should not hinder a person's right to fully participate in society. It also highlights the discrimination faced by individuals with disabilities and the history of unequal treatment they have endured. Individuals with disabilities have faced unequal treatment and limitations in society, leading to political powerlessness. Classifications excluding them should be strongly discouraged and only allowed for compelling reasons, not based on prejudice or stereotypes. SEC. 4. DISABILITY DEFINED. Section 3 of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12102) is amended to define 'disability' as a physical or mental impairment, a record of such impairment, or being regarded as having such an impairment, without consideration of mitigating measures. The term 'mitigating measure' refers to any treatment, medication, device, or other measure used to eliminate, mitigate, or compensate for the effect of an impairment. This includes prescription medications, personal aids, and devices. The term 'mitigating measure' refers to treatments or devices used to lessen the impact of an impairment. The term 'mental impairment' refers to disorders like mental illness or learning disabilities, while 'physical impairment' refers to physiological disorders affecting body systems. The term 'record of a physical or mental impairment' refers to a history of or misclassification as having an impairment, while 'regarded as having a physical or mental impairment' means being perceived or treated as having an impairment, regardless of actually having one. SEC. 5. ADVERSE ACTION. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 is amended to include discrimination against individuals using mitigating measures as an adverse action. SEC. 6 amends Section 102 of the Americans with Disabilities Act to prohibit discrimination based on disability. SEC. 7 addresses the definition of a qualified individual with a disability. SEC. 8 provides a rule of construction. Section 501 of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 is amended to ensure broad construction of the Act's provisions. Regulations must be issued by the Attorney General, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and Secretary of Transportation within 180 days to implement various sections of the Act. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 is amended to broaden its provisions. The Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board will issue additional guidelines to supplement existing design requirements for accessibility under titles II and III of the Act. This does not limit other agencies' authority to issue regulations under the Act. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 is amended to allow deference to federal regulations and guidance for implementation."
