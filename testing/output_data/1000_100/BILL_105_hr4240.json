The \"Y2K Liability and Antitrust Reform Act\" addresses liability for computer date failure in cases where only contract-based recovery for business losses and repair costs is allowed if certain conditions are met, excluding personal injury claims. The \"Y2K Liability and Antitrust Reform Act\" requires companies to provide free repairs or replacements for computer programs, software, or hardware that experience date failures, as long as the product was introduced for sale after December 31, 1994. The \"Y2K Liability and Antitrust Reform Act\" mandates free repairs or replacements for computer systems, components, programs, or software sold before January 1, 1995, that encounter date failures. Buyers are to be informed of the affected products and how to obtain repair or replacement. The \"Y2K Liability and Antitrust Reform Act\" limits contracting parties' ability to enter agreements on liability and damages from computer date failure. It defines \"person\" as someone engaged in commerce related to computer systems. An action against a person not described in the Act is deemed contract-based, allowing recovery for business loss and repair costs if specific conditions are met. The \"Y2K Liability and Antitrust Reform Act\" sets conditions for liability in cases of computer date failure. The plaintiff must not have suffered personal injury, and the defendant must have made efforts to prevent the failure. Testing systems for Y2K compliance by July 1, 1999, is required. The \"Y2K Liability and Antitrust Reform Act\" requires companies to take necessary steps to prevent computer date failure by August 1, 1999. This includes notifying customers and the President's Council on the Year 2000 Conversion of compliance efforts, test results, and the likelihood of transitioning to the Year 2000 without failure. Additionally, companies must prominently display this notice in their place of business for public review. The President's Council on the Year 2000 Conversion will publish received notices on its website. Contracting parties can still make agreements on liability and damages from computer date failure. Definitions include actions for damages from date failure, breach of contract, shareholder actions, and failure to address date failures properly. Computer date failure refers to the inability of a computer system or program to accurately process data between the years 1999 and 2000 and beyond, or the potential existence of such issues. Computer program or software is a set of instructions used in a computer, while a computer system encompasses the entire system. The term \"computer system\" refers to any electronic device or collection of devices that contains computer programs or electronic instructions and performs functions such as logic, arithmetic, data processing, storage, communication, or control. SEC. 3. TEMPORARY ANTITRUST EXEMPTION. Antitrust laws do not apply to conduct aimed at mitigating computer date failure impact from enactment of this Act to December 31, 2001, except for conduct resulting in a boycott. Antitrust laws are defined as per the Clayton Act. The term antitrust laws include section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and any State law similar to it."
