    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Railroad Unemployment Insurance Amendments Act of 1996\". It includes a waiting period for unemployment benefits. The Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act is amended to specify the payment of unemployment benefits, including a waiting period for the first registration period. The Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act is amended to include a waiting period for the first 14 days of unemployment due to a strike. Subsequent days of unemployment during the same strike will receive benefits as usual. If the strike continues after the initial period of unemployment ends, the waiting period will still apply. The Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act now includes a waiting period for the first 14 days of unemployment due to a strike. If the strike continues, the waiting period will apply to the employee's first registration period in a new period of continuing unemployment. The term 'period of continuing unemployment' is defined as a single registration period with more than 4 days of unemployment, consecutive registration periods with more than 4 days of unemployment each, or successive registration periods with more than 4 days of unemployment each starting within 15 days of the previous period. No benefits will be paid to an eligible employee if their total remuneration for a registration period exceeds the base year monthly compensation base. Employee's remuneration includes any gross amount that would have been payable if they were ready and willing to work. The employee must be ready and willing to perform suitable work available to them within the registration period to receive benefits. SEC. 3. WAITING PERIOD FOR SICKNESS BENEFITS. Amendment to the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act regarding the payment of sickness benefits after the 4th consecutive day of sickness in a period of continuing sickness. Benefits are payable for each day of sickness in excess of 7 during the employee's first registration period in a period of continuing sickness. The clause defines a period of continuing sickness as consecutive days of sickness or successive days of sickness due to a single cause without a break of more than 90 days. The period ends when the employee exhausts sickness benefits. SEC. 4 amends the maximum daily benefit rate calculation under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act. SEC. 5 sets the maximum number of days for benefits. SEC. 5 amends the maximum number of days for benefits under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act to 130 days for both unemployment and sickness, with a limitation that benefits cannot exceed the employee's compensation in the base year. The maximum number of days for benefits under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act is amended to 130 days for both unemployment and sickness, with a limitation that benefits cannot exceed the employee's compensation in the base year. Extended unemployment benefits or extended sickness benefits may be paid for up to 65 days within the extended benefit period after exhausting normal benefit rights. The extended benefit period begins on the first day of unemployment or sickness following the exhaustion of current benefit rights. Extended unemployment benefits or extended sickness benefits can be paid for up to 65 days within the extended benefit period after exhausting normal benefit rights. The extended benefit period consists of 7 consecutive 14-day periods, with each period serving as a registration period. The extended benefit period terminates when the employee reaches the age of 65, except in certain circumstances. Extended unemployment or sickness benefits can be paid for up to 65 days within the extended benefit period after exhausting normal benefit rights. For employees aged 65 or older, benefits may continue for paying benefits for days of unemployment. Employees with 10 or more years of service, who did not voluntarily retire or leave work without good cause, and have 14 or more consecutive days of unemployment or sickness may qualify for accelerated benefits in the next succeeding general benefit year. The Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act allows for extended benefits for up to 65 days after exhausting normal benefits. Employees aged 65 or older are exempt from receiving benefits for days of sickness starting at age 65. A deadwood provision in the Act has been repealed. The Unemployment Insurance Act (45 U.S.C. 352(h)) is repealed, along with the provision in the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act (45 U.S.C. 368) related to supplemental unemployment benefits. The amendments made by this Act will be effective on the date of enactment."
