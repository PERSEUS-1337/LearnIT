FINDINGS.\" Congress finds the need to increase the number of high school students prepared for STEM education, emphasizing the importance of hands-on laboratory experiences in science programs. The current quality of lab experiences is deemed inadequate, with a lack of consensus on defining high school science labs. The National Research Council and Government Accountability Office found disparities in high school science laboratory facilities based on student demographics. College students leaving science fields cited issues with high school science preparation, including lack of laboratory experience and exposure to theoretical or analytical modes. The Federal Government should invest in research and demonstration projects to enhance the teaching of laboratory science in high schools, addressing disparities in facilities and improving student preparation for college science fields. The grant program aims to enhance the teaching of laboratory science in high schools and improve student preparation for college science fields. The National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 is amended to establish a pilot program called 'Partnerships for Access to Laboratory Science' to enhance teaching of laboratory science in high schools. The National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 establishes the 'Partnerships for Access to Laboratory Science' program to improve laboratory facilities and provide instrumentation for math, science, engineering, and technology instruction at the secondary school level. Grants can be used for equipment, maintenance, renovation, and professional development. The 'Partnerships for Access to Laboratory Science' program focuses on professional development and training for teachers, integrating laboratory experiences with classroom instruction, training in laboratory safety, and implementing hands-on experiences to engage students. The 'Partnerships for Access to Laboratory Science' program aims to support individuals in mathematics, science, engineering, and technology fields for postsecondary studies through grants awarded to partnerships including higher education institutions or community organizations. The 'Partnerships for Access to Laboratory Science' program supports postsecondary studies in STEM fields through grants to partnerships involving higher education institutions, high-need local educational agencies, businesses, and nonprofit organizations. The Federal share of activities funded by the grant should not exceed 50 percent. The Director of the National Science Foundation will evaluate the effectiveness of pilot projects funded by the grant program in improving student performance in STEM fields. A report on the evaluation results, including best practices and materials developed by grant awardees, must be submitted to specific Senate and House committees within 5 years. Authorization of appropriations is also included. Authorization of appropriations for the National Science Foundation under this Act and its amendments includes $5,000,000 for fiscal year 2008 and necessary sums for the following 3 years."
