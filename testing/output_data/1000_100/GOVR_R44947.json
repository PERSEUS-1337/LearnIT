    "content": "Under Article III of the Constitution, Congress has the power to establish federal courts below the Supreme Court. The Judiciary Act of 1789 created federal district and circuit courts, including the Alien Tort Statute (ATS) in 1789. The ATS was modified in 1873 and 1911, with the current version enacted in 1948. The ATS aims to provide foreign plaintiffs a remedy for international law violations to maintain harmony in international relations. During the early years of the Republic, the United States struggled to meet its foreign affairs obligations under the Articles of Confederation. Only Connecticut passed legislation to penalize violations of international law, despite an affirmative obligation for the US to redress such violations. The Framers and the First Congress of the United States provided jurisdiction to federal courts to address violations of international law, including suits involving foreign diplomats, admiralty and maritime cases, and disputes between U.S. citizens and citizens of foreign nations. The Alien Tort Statute (ATS) was included to allow federal courts to hear claims for violations of international law that could impact U.S. foreign relations. In the 1780s, incidents involving foreign diplomats highlighted the potential for conflict. In the 1780s, a French diplomat was assaulted by Julien de Longchamps in Philadelphia, leading to a conflict over jurisdiction and extradition. Longchamps was eventually convicted and sentenced to two years in jail by a Pennsylvania court, but French requests to deliver him to their authorities were declined by Pennsylvania officials and the Confederation Congress. The Confederation Congress passed a resolution directing the Secretary of Foreign Affairs to apologize to Marbois for its limited ability to provide redress at the federal level. Similar tensions arose when a New York constable arrested a domestic servant of the Dutch Ambassador, who protested for diplomatic immunity. The federal government was unable to adjudicate the constable's actions, causing embarrassment and an inability to provide judicial relief to foreign officials in the United States. These incidents were not considered low-level diplomatic quarrels. The Marbois and Van Berckel incidents were not seen as minor diplomatic disputes. The Alien Tort Statute (ATS) was interpreted by the Supreme Court as a response to the federal government's inability to provide a judicial forum to protect the rights of foreign diplomats. Despite its original purpose, the ATS was rarely used for federal jurisdiction for almost two centuries. Only two reported cases successfully invoked the ATS for jurisdiction between 1789 and 1980. The Alien Tort Statute (ATS) was rarely used for federal jurisdiction for almost two centuries until 1980 when it gained prominence after the Fil\u00e1rtiga v. Pe\u00f1a-Irala case. This case involved two Paraguayan citizens suing the former Inspector General. In the Fil\u00e1rtiga v. Pe\u00f1a-Irala case, two Paraguayan citizens sued Americo Norberto Pe\u00f1a-Irala, a former Inspector General of Paraguay, in New York under the Alien Tort Statute (ATS). They alleged that he had kidnapped, tortured, and killed their relative for supporting a political opposition party. The Second Circuit ruled that torture by a state official against its own citizen violates international law. The Fil\u00e1rtiga court ruled that torture by a state official against its own citizen violates international law, leading to the ATS becoming prominent for asserting civil claims for human rights violations in U.S. federal courts. However, courts later identified limits on ATS jurisdiction not addressed in the Fil\u00e1rtiga case. In Tel-Oren, the D.C. Circuit questioned if the ATS creates a cause of action for plaintiffs or is solely jurisdictional. The case involved Israeli citizens suing the Palestinian Liberation Organization for a terrorist attack. The court unanimously dismissed the case without resolving the ATS requirements for jurisdiction and cause of action. In a case involving Israeli citizens suing the Palestinian Liberation Organization for a terrorist attack, the D.C. Circuit judges issued separate opinions for dismissal. Judge Bork argued that the ATS is purely jurisdictional and does not create a cause of action, while Judge Edwards believed the ATS does create a cause of action but still concurred in dismissal due to lack of official state action and insufficient recognition of terrorism as a violation of international law. Judge Robb found the case raised nonjusticiable political questions. In a case involving Israeli citizens suing the Palestinian Liberation Organization for a terrorist attack, Judge Bork and Judge Edwards disagreed over the cause-of-action question. This disagreement later became the subject of the landmark Supreme Court decision, Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain. Congress then passed the Torture Victim Protection Act in 1992, creating a civil cause of action for torture and extrajudicial killing. The Torture Victim Protection Act (TVPA) was created in 1992 to establish a civil cause of action for torture and extrajudicial killing, in response to Judge Bork's argument that a separate grant by Congress was needed for a private right of action for violations of international law. Unlike the Alien Tort Statute (ATS), the TVPA allows actions to be brought by and against individuals, including both U.S. and foreign nationals but excluding liability against corporations. The TVPA also imposes limitations on civil actions that are not present in the ATS. The TVPA requires plaintiffs to exhaust all remedies in the place where the claim occurred. The relationship between the TVPA and the ATS is unclear, with some courts viewing the TVPA as supplementing the ATS while others believe it was meant to \"occupy the field.\" Regardless, the TVPA provides a specific cause of action for claims that were previously argued under the ATS. In Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, the Supreme Court addressed the cause-of-action question regarding the Alien Tort Statute (ATS). The case involved a Mexican doctor accused of torturing and murdering a DEA agent, leading to his apprehension by DEA officials. In Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, the Supreme Court rejected arguments against criminal charges, leading to a civil case asserting ATS claims. The Court clarified the ATS jurisdiction and cause of action for alleged violations of international law. In Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, the Supreme Court clarified that the Alien Tort Statute (ATS) is a jurisdictional statute creating no new causes of action. The Court held that the ATS was not intended to be a \"jurisdictional convenience\" but rather allowed for a \"modest number of international law violations\" to be actionable without the need for a separate statute. Sosa clarified that the ATS allows federal courts to recognize a narrow set of common law causes of action for violations of the law of nations, including offenses like violations of safe conducts, infringement on the rights of ambassadors, and piracy. The jurisdiction is not limited to these claims but extends to present-day violations of international law, with the overarching limitation that only certain claims can be recognized. The ATS allows federal courts to recognize a narrow set of common law causes of action for violations of the law of nations, with the limitation that claims must be based on international norms accepted by the civilized world. The Court emphasized judicial caution and restraint in identifying new causes of action under the ATS. In a case where a claim for arbitrary arrest and detention was not sufficiently defined or supported in modern-day international law, the Court dismissed the claim. Since the Sosa decision, a two-step framework for addressing questions related to the breadth of ATS liability has been established by a majority of Justices on the Supreme Court. The ATS liability framework involves determining if a claim is based on a specific international law norm and if allowing the case to proceed is appropriate. Despite warnings of caution from Sosa, the use of ATS for human rights abuses continued. However, restrictions on ATS territorial reach in Kiobel slowed this trend. The Second Circuit dismissed an ATS suit against oil companies for alleged human rights abuses in Nigeria, ruling that corporations cannot be liable under the ATS. The Supreme Court granted certiorari on the issue of corporate liability but ultimately focused on whether the ATS applies to violations of the law of nations in a sovereign territory other than the US. The Kiobel Court, led by Chief Justice Roberts, applied the \"presumption against extraterritorial application\" to conclude that the ATS does not cover conduct solely within a foreign territory. The ATS does not reach conduct that occurred entirely in a foreign nation, following the \"presumption against extraterritoriality\" to avoid clashes between U.S. and foreign law. Federal courts presume statutes do not apply to claims in foreign territory unless there is a clear indication of extraterritorial application. The Kiobel Court found no evidence that the First Congress intended the ATS to have extraterritorial reach, designed to prevent diplomatic strife. The Kiobel Court held that the presumption against extraterritoriality applies to the Alien Tort Statute (ATS), barring Nigerian plaintiffs' claims for violations of the law of nations in Nigerian territory. The Court suggested that the presumption might be displaced in future ATS cases if the claims \"touch[ed] and concern[ed]\" the United States, but emphasized that mere corporate presence in the U.S. does not suffice. The Kiobel Court held that the Alien Tort Statute (ATS) does not apply to violations of the law of nations in foreign territory. The Court suggested that future ATS cases must \"touch and concern\" the United States, but did not provide further explanation. Justices Kennedy and Alito expressed the need for clarification on how litigants can satisfy this requirement. Justice Alito's \"broader standard\" requires that for a claim to \"touch and concern\" the United States under the Alien Tort Statute (ATS), the conduct constituting a violation of the law of nations must occur domestically. Justice Breyer, along with Justices Ginsburg, Sotomayor, and Kagan, disagreed with the majority's decision to dismiss the case, arguing that the ATS should not be limited by the presumption against extraterritoriality. Instead, Justice Breyer proposed limiting ATS jurisdiction to cases involving certain factors, such as the alleged tort occurring on American soil. Justice Breyer proposed limiting ATS jurisdiction to cases involving certain factors, such as the alleged tort occurring on American soil, the defendant being an American national, or the defendant's conduct substantially affecting an important American national interest to prevent the US from becoming a safe harbor for violators of international norms. This test was applied in the Kiobel case, leading to its dismissal due to insufficient ties to the United States for ATS jurisdiction. The Supreme Court's decision in Kiobel has limited the ATS for human rights abuses in U.S. courts, particularly in foreign cubed cases. Cases with connections to the U.S. face differing interpretations of the \"touch and concern\" test, creating a split among circuits. Five circuits have considered this test, with the Fifth and Second Circuits adopting a bright-line approach similar to Justice Alito's concurrence in Kiobel. The Fourth Circuit has a flexible approach to interpreting the Alien Tort Statute (ATS), allowing cases with extensive U.S. contacts and a strong connection to the U.S. to proceed, even if the primary conduct occurred abroad. This contrasts with the bright-line approach adopted by the Fifth and Second Circuits, which require the violation of the law of nations to have occurred in the U.S. for the presumption against extraterritoriality to be displaced. The Eleventh Circuit has a \"touch and concern test\" for ATS claims, focusing on U.S. relevant conduct. Factors like defendants' citizenship and U.S. national interests are considered, but not enough to override the presumption against extraterritoriality. The Ninth Circuit also considers U.S. connections, such as defendant's citizenship, in determining ATS claim territory. Some circuits interpret Morrison v. National Australia Bank Ltd. differently, analyzing the presumption of extraterritoriality in relation to Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. The Supreme Court held that the presumption against extraterritoriality defeated the plaintiffs' claim in Morrison because the focus of Section 10(b) is on the purchase and sale of securities, not the deceptive conduct. The application of Morrison's \"focus\" analysis in ATS cases may complicate plaintiffs' efforts to overcome the presumption against extraterritoriality. Courts have varied opinions on whether Morrison applies to the ATS. Some circuits, like the Ninth and Fourth, believe Morrison should not control in ATS cases due to the different standard set in Kiobel. In contrast, the Fifth and Second Circuits follow Morrison's analysis and require conduct violating the law of nations to occur domestically to displace the presumption. The Eleventh Circuit takes a hybrid approach. The Eleventh Circuit adopted a hybrid approach, combining Kiobel's standards with Morrison's focus test. The Supreme Court's decision in RJR Nabisco, Inc. v. European Community may help resolve the conflict by applying the presumption against extraterritoriality to civil provisions of RICO. The Court explained that Morrison and Kiobel provide a two-step framework for analyzing extraterritoriality issues. The Fifth Circuit and at least one district court have conflicting interpretations of whether Morrison's \"focus\" analysis applies in ATS cases post-RJR Nabisco. It is uncertain if RJR Nabisco will standardize lower courts' approaches to extraterritoriality under the ATS, and there may still be disagreements on the \"focus\" of the ATS even if the test is adopted by all circuits. The Fifth Circuit's interpretation of RJR Nabisco in ATS cases may lead to a bright-line rule that plaintiffs must show conduct violating the law of nations occurred in the US. The Supreme Court's decision in Jesner v. Arab Bank, PLC may further limit extraterritorial ATS claims, especially regarding corporate liability. The Supreme Court's decision in Jesner v. Arab Bank, PLC involved claims by foreign nationals injured by terrorist groups in Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza. The plaintiffs alleged that Arab Bank aided terrorist organizations, but the Court ultimately decided the case on extraterritoriality grounds. The plaintiffs alleged that Arab Bank facilitated terrorist actions by maintaining accounts for organizations and identifying families of victims for compensation. The court dismissed the ATS claims due to lack of corporate liability, despite growing consensus on the issue among sister circuits. Despite a growing consensus among sister circuits that the Alien Tort Statute (ATS) allows for corporate liability, the Supreme Court in Jesner v. Arab Bank declined to overturn its prior circuit precedent. The Court ruled that foreign corporations are not subject to liability under the ATS but left open the possibility for U.S. corporations to face claims. Justice Kennedy, writing for a 5-4 majority, placed the decision in the context of the two-part inquiry from Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain for evaluating violations of international norms under the ATS. The Supreme Court in Jesner v. Arab Bank declined to extend liability under the Alien Tort Statute (ATS) to foreign corporations, citing judicial caution and separation-of-powers concerns. The Court emphasized that Congress is better positioned to determine if imposing ATS liability on foreign corporations serves the public interest. The Jesner Court declined to extend ATS liability to foreign corporations, citing foreign relations impact and diplomatic tensions with Jordan. They concluded that foreign corporations may not be defendants in ATS suits due to separation-of-powers concerns. Several Justices diverged in their rationale for the holding. The Jesner Court declined to extend ATS liability to foreign corporations, citing foreign relations impact and diplomatic tensions with Jordan. A five-Justice majority joined portions of an opinion authored by Justice Kennedy, with Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Thomas joining the remainder. Justice Alito concurred in part, expressing courts should avoid recognizing ATS claims that do not advance its objective. Justice Gorsuch argued for dismissal based on separation-of-powers principles and historical ATS application to U.S. defendants. Justice Thomas also wrote separately. The Jesner Court declined to extend ATS liability to foreign corporations, citing foreign relations impact and diplomatic tensions with Jordan. Justice Thomas wrote a concurring opinion agreeing with Justice Kennedy's opinion but also with Justices Alito and Gorsuch. Justice Sotomayor dissented, arguing that the corporate form itself does not raise foreign policy concerns requiring immunity for foreign corporations under ATS. She suggested resolving tensions through other limitations on ATS jurisdiction. The Jesner Court's decision not to extend ATS liability to foreign corporations has sparked a debate over the future of the ATS for human rights abuse lawsuits. Some believe that very few cases will meet the Supreme Court's requirements for ATS jurisdiction due to Jesner, Kiobel, and Sosa's limitations. However, the ATS still holds significance as it allows suits against U.S. corporations and individual employees of foreign companies. The dissenters argued that foreign corporate liability should be permitted, while the majority emphasized that political branches are better suited to consider foreign policy implications. The Jesner Court's decision on ATS liability for foreign corporations has raised concerns about the future of the ATS for human rights abuse lawsuits. Some Justices want to revisit the discretion of federal courts under the ATS to recognize new causes of action. If federal courts lose this discretion, ATS jurisdiction may be limited to piracy, interference with ambassadors' rights, and safe conduct violations. This could significantly restrict the scope of ATS jurisdiction, potentially relegating the statute to its previous status of rarely being used. The ATS became important for human rights and terrorism-related litigation after the Fil\u00e1rtiga decision, but the Supreme Court has placed limitations on viable ATS claims through decisions in Sosa, Kiobel, and Jesner. Some believe the Court's rulings have limited the statute's reach, while others see potential for limited cases against natural persons or U.S. corporate defendants. The Jesner Court emphasized the need for \"further action from Congress\" before expanding ATS jurisdiction. The future of ATS litigation may be determined by Congress rather than the courts, as further action from Congress is needed before expanding ATS jurisdiction."
