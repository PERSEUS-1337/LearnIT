    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Missing Mercury in Manufacturing Monitoring and Mitigation Act\". Congress acknowledges the toxicity of mercury and its compounds to humans, ecosystems, and wildlife. It highlights the risks posed to pregnant women and unborn babies from mercury exposure. The main source of mercury exposure in the US is contaminated fish. The long-term solution to mercury pollution is to reduce global mercury use and releases to lower contamination levels in the environment, rather than reducing fish consumption. Uncontaminated fish is a crucial nutrition source globally. Mercury pollution from chlor-alkali plants affects water bodies locally and globally. In the US, only 8 out of 30 chlorine plants still use mercury, with 5 not committed to phasing it out. Only 10% of chlorine and caustic soda in the US is produced using mercury. The chlor-alkali industry in the United States primarily relies on the mercury cell process for chlorine and caustic soda production, despite cost-effective alternatives being available and in use for 90% of production. Other countries, like Japan, have already banned the mercury cell process due to its environmental impact. The industry acknowledges that mercury contamination can occur in products manufactured using this process, leading to direct and indirect mercury release. Despite this, neither the industry nor the Environmental Protection Agency has been able to address the issue effectively. The Environmental Protection Agency must improve its ability to track mercury use and emissions at chlor-alkali facilities to minimize domestic and international mercury supply, demand, and releases. Congress aims to develop policies to reduce mercury use and emissions in the United States, decrease mercury releases from current reservoirs, and minimize mercury exposure, especially for women of childbearing age and young children. Additionally, an amendment to the Toxic Substances Control Act addresses the use of mercury in chlorine and caustic soda manufacturing. Effective January 1, 2012, the manufacture of chlorine or caustic soda using mercury cells is prohibited in the United States. Owners of chlor-alkali facilities must submit annual reports to the EPA and state authorities from April 1, 2008, to April 1, 2012, identifying their operations. The report identifies types and quantities of mercury-containing hazardous and nonhazardous waste generated by a chlor-alkali facility, the mercury content of the wastes, how each waste was managed, including offsite locations, volume of mercury released into air or water, and estimated accumulation in pipes and plant equipment. The report for a chlor-alkali facility includes details on the accumulation of mercury in pipes and plant equipment, the quantity and forms of mercury in products for sale, and the option to combine this report with others required under the Solid Waste Disposal Act. After a chlor-alkali facility ceases operations, the Administrator conducts a comprehensive mercury inventory within a year, considering mercury purchased, remaining in equipment, and in waste generated. The Administrator conducts a comprehensive mercury inventory after a chlor-alkali facility ceases operations, obtaining records to determine mercury releases into the environment. An advisory committee, the Mercury Storage Advisory Committee, is established. The Mercury Storage Advisory Committee, composed of 9 members, including 2 appointed by the Speaker of the House and the Senate majority leader, with one designated as Chairperson and one as Vice-Chairperson, and 1 member being the Administrator. The Mercury Storage Advisory Committee consists of 9 members, including the Administrator, Secretary of Defense, State environmental agencies, State attorneys general, chlorine industry, mercury waste treatment industry, and a nonprofit environmental organization representative. Appointments must be made within 45 days of enactment. The Administrator appoints members of the Committee within 45 days of enactment. The Committee must hold its initial meeting within 30 days of all members being appointed. Meetings are called by the Chairperson, and a majority of members constitute a quorum. A report with findings and recommendations must be submitted to Congress within 1 year of enactment. The Committee will report on environmental, health, and safety requirements to prevent mercury release and worker exposure, estimated storage costs, optimal Federal facilities for storage, and the quantity of elemental mercury over a 40-year period. The report will include estimates of elemental mercury generated from recycling and other sources over a 40-year period, as well as any barriers preventing the private sector from storing elemental mercury. The report will cover storing elemental mercury produced by the private sector over a 40-year period, addressing barriers, advantages and disadvantages of consolidating storage, optimal storage plan for excess mercury, and additional research needed for long-term disposal options. Compensation of committee members is also discussed. The Committee members, whether federal employees or not, will be compensated for their duties. Non-federal employees will receive a daily rate equivalent to level V of the Executive Schedule, while federal employees will serve without additional compensation. The Committee members will receive compensation for their services, including travel expenses. The Administrator will provide necessary funding and personnel for the Committee to perform its duties, which will terminate after 180 days. The Committee will terminate 180 days after submitting its report. Regulations for transferring and storing mercury from closed chlor-alkali facilities must be established by July 1, 2008. Mercury from closed facilities must be transferred to a storage facility by that date. The Administrator will conduct a health assessment of employees at chlor-alkali facilities by July 1, 2009. Additional regulations may be promulgated as necessary to implement this section of the Toxic Substances Control Act. Use of mercury in chlorine and caustic soda manufacturing."
