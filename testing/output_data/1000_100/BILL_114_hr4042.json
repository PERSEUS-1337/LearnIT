    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Pre-K for USA Act.\" The Pre-K for USA Act findings include the benefits of high-quality prekindergarten programs, such as improved academic success, reduced need for other services, and lower likelihood of criminal behavior. In response to education funding cuts in Texas, some local governments funded full-day prekindergarten programs after the state legislature cut $5.4 billion in education funding and eliminated $200 million in grants for expanding prekindergarten programs. Texas missed out on up to $118.48 million in Federal funding to expand prekindergarten programs, with about 40 percent of school districts not offering prekindergarten programs and over half of those that do offering only part-day programs. Local governments and educational agencies would benefit from direct application of prekindergarten Federal program funding to support full-day prekindergarten programs. SEC. 3. PREKINDERGARTEN DEVELOPMENT GRANTS. The Secretary of Education, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, will award competitive grants to increase capacity for high-quality prekindergarten programs. Grants will be awarded for up to 3 years and applications must be submitted by Governors or chief executive officers of eligible entities. In developing a grant application under this Act, a State must consult with the State Advisory Council on Early Childhood Education and Care. To be eligible for a grant, a State or local entity must contribute non-Federal matching funds equal to at least 20% of the grant amount. These funds can come from State funding, local funding, or contributions. The Secretary may waive or reduce matching funds required for a grant application if financial hardship is demonstrated. Subgrants are awarded to State or local entities under this Act. The Secretary may award grants to local government entities under this Act, who can then award subgrants to eligible local entities. Subgrantees must comply with Act requirements. The Secretary cannot award a subgrant if the State or entity already received funding for the program in that fiscal year. Appropriations are authorized for fiscal years 2016-2025. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, an \"eligible local entity\" refers to a local educational agency, early childhood education program provider, or a consortium of these entities. \"Full-day\" is defined as a day equivalent to a full school day in the state and lasting at least 5 hours. The term \"high-quality prekindergarten program\" refers to a program for children aged 3 or 4, or those who have reached the legal age for state-funded prekindergarten, with qualified staff and nationally recognized standards. Teachers in high-quality prekindergarten programs must meet specific requirements, including having a bachelor's degree in early childhood education or a related field with coursework demonstrating competence, or having a bachelor's degree in any field and passing a State-approved assessment in early childhood education. Ongoing professional development in early childhood education is also required. In high-quality prekindergarten programs, teachers must have a bachelor's degree in early childhood education or a related field, or a bachelor's degree in any field with a credential in early childhood education. They must also maintain a maximum class size of 20 children and a specific child to instructional staff ratio. The prekindergarten program maintains a child to instructional staff ratio of 10 to 1, offers a full-day program, provides developmentally appropriate learning environments, aligns with state standards, offers competitive staff salaries, conducts ongoing monitoring and evaluation, and provides comprehensive services including health screenings. The prekindergarten program offers comprehensive services including health screenings, mental health support, family engagement opportunities, nutrition services, and assistance obtaining services when needed. The program includes nutrition education for children and families, coordination with local educational agencies, and physical activity programs aligned with evidence-based guidelines. The program provides high-quality professional development for staff, including in-class observation and evidence-based coaching. Additional support services are offered based on a needs analysis, and services are provided on-site to the maximum extent feasible.
