    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Raw Sewage Overflow Community Right-to-Know Act.\" It includes findings related to the issue. Congress finds that there are millions of cases of waterborne diseases in the United States each year, caused by inadequately treated sewage filled with harmful pathogens. Swimming in contaminated waters can lead to various gastrointestinal and respiratory illnesses, resulting in significant economic losses due to beach closures. Economic losses due to pathogen contamination in the United States are estimated at $1-2 billion annually. Swimming-related illnesses result in $28 billion in losses each year. Many sewer systems lack monitoring for overflows, leading to unreported incidents that threaten public health. Improved monitoring and reporting of sewer overflows could prevent millions of illnesses annually. Public health authorities are often not informed of sewer overflows that pose a risk to the public. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. Section 502 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to define \"sanitary sewer overflow\" as an overflow, spill, release, or diversion of wastewater from a sanitary sewer system, excluding combined sewer overflows and wastewater backups caused by blockages in privately owned building laterals. This definition includes overflows or releases of wastewater reaching waters of the United States, those that do not reach waters of the United States, and backups caused by blockages in a sanitary sewer other than a building lateral. SEC. 4. MONITORING, REPORTING, AND PUBLIC NOTIFICATION OF SEWER OVERFLOWS. Section 402 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to require publicly owned treatment works to implement measures for timely detection and public notification of sanitary sewer overflows that may impact human health. Publicly owned treatment works must notify the public, public health authorities, and the Administrator or State within 24 hours of becoming aware of a sanitary sewer overflow that may endanger human health. Additionally, a report must be provided within 5 days of the overflow. Publicly owned treatment works must report sanitary sewer overflows to the Administrator or State within 5 days, detailing the overflow's magnitude, suspected cause, steps taken to prevent recurrence, and mitigation efforts. Additionally, they must include all sanitary sewer overflows in their monthly discharge monitoring report. Publicly owned treatment works are required to report sanitary sewer overflows to the Administrator or State within 5 days, providing details on the overflow's magnitude, suspected cause, prevention steps, and mitigation efforts. States must then report annually to the Administrator on the total number of overflows, including wastewater released, overflow duration, location, response actions, and measures to prevent future overflows. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to include requirements for monitoring, reporting, and public notification of sanitary sewer overflows. Additionally, an authorization of $2.2 billion for fiscal years 2004 through 2008 is allocated for this purpose."
