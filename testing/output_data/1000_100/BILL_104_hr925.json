    "content": "The \"Private Property Protection Act of 1995\" ensures that no law or agency action should diminish the value of privately owned property. Federal agencies must exercise their authority to prevent such limitations. Owners have the right to compensation for any loss of property value. The Federal Government must compensate property owners if an agency action diminishes the property's value by 20% or more. If the value decreases by over 50%, the government can buy the affected portion at fair market value. Once compensation is received, the property cannot be used against the agency's limitation, even if the action is later revoked. If the government action reduces property value by 20% or more, owners must be compensated. If the value drops by over 50%, the government can buy the affected portion at fair market value. Once compensation is given, the property cannot be used against the agency's limit, even if the action is later reversed. If the compensation is refunded to the Treasury adjusted for inflation, the property can be used. SEC. 4.
