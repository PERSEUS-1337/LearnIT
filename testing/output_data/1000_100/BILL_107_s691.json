    "content": "The Washoe Tribe Land Conveyance is addressed in Section 1. Congress finds that the Washoe Tribe's ancestral homeland encompassed approximately 5,000 square miles around Lake Tahoe, recognized as indigenous people in 1997. Meetings were held to protect the natural resources in the region, resulting in a multiagency agreement supporting traditional land uses. The Act aims to support the Washoe Tribe's traditional uses of National Forest System land, including access to Lake Tahoe for cultural practices. It also seeks to return the Tribe to Lake Tahoe and enable them to engage in spiritual, stewardship, horticulture, gathering, learning, and bonding activities. The Secretary of Agriculture will convey approximately 24.3 acres of land to the Secretary of the Interior for the Washoe Tribe, with a reserved easement for public access. The Secretary of Agriculture will provide a reciprocal easement to the Washoe Tribe for vehicular access to a parcel over Forest Development Road #15N67. The Tribe must limit the use of the conveyed parcel to traditional and customary uses, prohibiting permanent residential structures. The Washoe Tribe must limit the use of a parcel to traditional and customary uses, prohibiting permanent residential or commercial development. Compliance with environmental requirements is necessary, and any violations may result in termination and reversion of the parcel. If the Washoe Tribe fails to comply with environmental requirements, the Secretary of the Interior may take corrective action. This could result in the termination of the Tribe's trust title to the parcel, which would then revert to the Secretary of Agriculture. The Senate passed the document on August 1, 2002, with Jeri Thomson as the Secretary."
