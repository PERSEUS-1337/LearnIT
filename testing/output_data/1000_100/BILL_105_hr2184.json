    "content": "The Act titled \"Private Security Officer Quality Assurance Act of 1997\" is cited as the short title. Private security officers in the United States are growing rapidly and function as an adjunct to public law enforcement. The industry provides opportunities for entry-level job applicants and protects individuals and various properties such as banks, hospitals, and airports. Private security officers in the United States are increasingly supplementing sworn law enforcement officers in providing services to the public. With the rise of private shopping malls, individuals are more likely to interact with private security personnel than with public law enforcement officers. This trend has accelerated as the number of public sector law enforcement officers has decreased, serving important public policy goals. Private security officers in the United States are becoming more prevalent in providing services to the public. The public struggles to differentiate between private security personnel and sworn law enforcement officers. The American public supports the use of well-trained private security personnel as a supplement, not a replacement, for law enforcement officers. Screening for private security officers, especially those carrying weapons, should be thorough. SEC. 3. BACKGROUND CHECKS. At the request of an employer or association, fingerprints or other identification methods must be submitted to the Attorney General for background checks on private security officers. The Attorney General will search criminal records and provide results within 30 days. The Attorney General encourages the use of technology for compiling criminal history information. Associations must submit employee fingerprints for processing within one business day. They also need to transfer identification and criminal history records to employers promptly. Associations must provide copies to licensing authorities for requests made on behalf of employers. The Attorney General may prescribe regulations for the transfer of identification and criminal history records to employers. The report on inquiries made by employers must be submitted to the Senate and House Committees on the Judiciary after 2 years. SEC. 4. CONFORMING AMENDMENTS. Amends section 534 of title 28, US Code to include private security officer background checks by designated employer associations.\n\nSEC. 5. CRIMINAL PENALTY.
