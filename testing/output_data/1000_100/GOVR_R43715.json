Airlines rely on this insurance for loan agreements, lease agreements, and to meet requirements of some foreign countries. After 9/11, there was a worldwide cancellation of third-party liability war risk coverage, leading to increased costs. The U.S. government expanded the federal Aviation War Risk Insurance Program to ensure U.S. air carriers could receive coverage. The U.S. government expanded the federal Aviation War Risk Insurance Program to ensure U.S. air carriers could receive coverage for hostile acts of violence against airlines. Private insurers now offer coverage for loss or damage to passengers and aircraft hulls in the event of a terrorist attack, but coverage for third-party damage caused by war or terrorism is limited. Airline insurance is a small percentage of total operating costs, with airlines paying approximately $2.3 billion for basic insurance in 2011. The price of aviation insurance varies depending on factors like airline location, size, safety record, and deductible. Private insurers provide coverage for war risks, while the market for non-war aviation coverage has been soft in recent years. A major terrorist incident could impact the capacity of the private market for aviation risk insurance. The series of airliner losses in 2014, including Malaysia Airlines flight 370 and flight 17, may lead to increases in aviation insurance premiums. Damage to aircraft in recent attacks on airports has further unsettled the aviation risk environment. Some insurers predict a potential 50% increase in premiums and a tripling of war risk insurance premiums, the largest jump since 9/11. However, some officials caution that it is premature to speculate on the level of price rises. The series of airliner losses in 2014, including Malaysia Airlines flight 370 and flight 17, may lead to increases in aviation insurance premiums. The insurance losses in 2014 may also lead to higher premiums for \"all-risk\" policies. It remains unclear how the commercial market is going to react and whether private coverage might become prohibitively expensive or even unavailable, especially for U.S. air carriers flying to destinations within the European Union. EU Regulation 785/2004 requires all air carriers and aircraft operators flying within, into, out of, or over EU territory to be insured for aviation-specific liabilities including war- and terrorism-related risks. Non-EU carriers operating to and from the EU must have insurance against third-party liability, including war risk insurance mandated by EU Regulation 785/2004. Aviation war risk insurance was not provided during World War I and II for commercial air operations. Prior to 1951, aviation war risk insurance was available but with 48-hour cancellation clauses. The 1951 law amended the Civil Aeronautics Act to provide war risk insurance for U.S. and foreign-flag aircraft operating in the interest of national defense or economy. The Secretary of Commerce could set insurance rates and establish a revolving fund within the Treasury. The 1951 law established a revolving fund within the Treasury for war risk insurance, funded through premiums and recoveries from losses. The insurance program covered returned premiums, losses, settlements, and liabilities, and could be underwritten by authorized aviation insurance companies. Disputes could be resolved in federal district court. The program continued under the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 and was later delegated to the FAA under the Department of Transportation in 1966. In 1970, members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) carried out a series of hijackings, including the attempted hijacking of an El Al Boeing 707 that was thwarted by an armed Israeli guard. The hijackers successfully hijacked three other airliners, which were taken to Dawson's Field in Jordan and destroyed after the passengers were removed. The Pan Am 747 hijacked on September 6, 1970, was ordered to fly to Beirut and then Cairo, where it was destroyed by an explosive. The aircraft was insured under an \"all risk\" policy and war risk policies split between FAA and commercial insurers. The event caused concerns in the commercial insurance industry regarding insuring Boeing 747s. The FAA expanded federal aviation war risk insurance coverage for Boeing 747s due to concerns over terrorist hijackings in the Middle East. The government set the rate at 20 cents per $100 of insurance, less than what the private market would have charged. This new insurance was offered as an emergency response to the ongoing crisis. The landmark 1973 federal court decision ruled that the Pan Am 747 destroyed by hijackers in Cairo was covered under the airline's standard \"all risk\" policy, not its war risk policies. The court defined \"act of war\" as an operation intended to gain a military advantage, narrowing the definition of war to combatants with significant attributes of sovereignty. This meant insurers offering \"all risk\" policies were liable for the claim. The court ruling held insurers of \"all risk\" policies responsible for the claim on the destroyed aircraft. Before 9/11, aviation war risk insurance was mainly provided without premiums through agreements with the Department of Defense. Premium war risk insurance was only used for specific foreign travel related to U.S. foreign policy interests. During the first Gulf War in 1990 and 1991, FAA issued war risk policies to carriers for specific routes in conflict areas. Air carriers cancelled flights to the Middle East due to soaring commercial war risk insurance rates, with premiums increasing significantly. Trans World Airlines and Pan Am suspended flights to high-risk locations like Israel, Athens, Istanbul, and Karachi. After the 9/11 attacks, commercial insurers canceled third-party liability war risk coverage for airlines and increased premiums for other war risk insurance. In response, Congress passed the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act of 2001 (P.L. 107-42), amending the Aviation War Risk Insurance. The Aviation War Risk Insurance Program was amended after the 9/11 attacks to include coverage for acts of terrorism. The program has been extended multiple times, most recently in 2014. The scope of policies was expanded to include coverage for losses or injuries to aircraft hulls, passengers, and crew. The Aviation War Risk Insurance Program was amended after 9/11 to include coverage for acts of terrorism. Limits for hull, passengers, and crew were set by insured airlines' existing policies, while third-party liability limits were based on FAA policies. Rates were matched to commercial rates in force on November 25, 2002, with a cap set at twice the premium paid as of June 19, 2002. Coverage would start from the first dollar of any covered loss incurred. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (TRIA) created a reinsurance program for terrorism losses in commercial property/casualty insurance. Airlines covered by the FAA program can still fall under TRIA for terrorism losses. The Aviation War Risk Insurance Program provides coverage to 44 U.S. air carriers, with coverage ranging from $100 million to $4 billion per carrier. TRIA is set to expire at the end of December 2014. The Aviation War Risk Insurance Program provides coverage to 44 U.S. air carriers, with coverage ranging from $100 million to $4 billion per carrier. The total maximum per occurrence coverage for all insured air carriers in force in January 2014 was $68 billion. The FAA currently insures 27 air carriers estimated to cover approximately 4% of total RPMs flown by U.S. airlines, with coverage ranging from $100 million to $3 billion per air carrier occurrence. Total maximum per occurrence exposure of all premium insurance currently in force is $31 billion, a 55% reduction from previous levels. The FAA's Aviation War Risk Insurance Program has seen a significant decrease in premium insurance exposure, with the total currently in force at $31 billion, a 55% reduction from January 2014. The agency has adjusted its estimates for premium collections in FY2014 and FY2015, with coverage including hull insurance, comprehensive liability insurance, and third-party war risk liability. The program offers coverage for various risks beyond war or terrorist attacks. The document outlines various risks covered by the Aviation War Risk Insurance Program, including war, hostile detonation of weapons, strikes, riots, political or terrorist acts, and malicious acts. Payments for ransom or extortion demands are not covered under this policy. The Aviation War Risk Insurance Program covers risks such as war, hostile detonation of weapons, strikes, riots, political or terrorist acts, and malicious acts. It does not cover payments for ransom or extortion demands. The policy excludes acts of sabotage, vandalism, confiscation by foreign governments, hijacking, and the discharge of weapons or explosives on covered aircraft. The FAA Premium War Risk Insurance Program covers risks such as war, hostile detonation of weapons, strikes, riots, political or terrorist acts, and malicious acts. Premiums are based on risk assumed by the program, limited to twice the premium air carriers paid for third party policies as of June 19, 2002. The program has a small administrative staff and paid over $10 million for claims related to 9/11 attacks. The FAA has paid over $10 million in total compensation for losses related to three specific incidents deemed \"war risk occurrences\" by the Secretary of Transportation. These incidents include an attempted bombing of Northwest Airlines Flight 253 in 2009, an incident involving an unattended SkyWest aircraft seized by a fugitive in 2012, and damage to a Boeing 767-223 aircraft in 2014. Total claims paid to date amount to $9.6 million for the SkyWest incident and $256,890 for the Boeing 767-223 aircraft. The Secretary of Transportation proposed a legislative reform for the Aviation War Risk Insurance Program in response to damages to a Boeing 767-223 aircraft caused by gunfire in Afghanistan. The proposal aims to provide war risk coverage for airline losses involving NBCR weapons and offer full aviation war risk coverage for 90 days in case of a market disruption similar to the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. The current proposal aims to provide non-premium war risk insurance for carriers operating under Department of Defense contracts in support of national defense. Previous budget proposals suggested changes to the Aviation War Risk Insurance Program, including a shared-risk model with commercial insurers taking on 80% of the risk by FY2018. The FY2013 and FY2012 budgets proposed a $150 million deductible for hull and liability exposures under the Aviation War Risk Insurance Program. Airlines for America (A4A) opposed the changes, stating that ending the program would harm the U.S. airline industry economically. A4A recommended maintaining the program and extending it for three years. The Secretary of Transportation has not issued a public statement on the March 2014 proposal, which argued against extending the current program due to budgetary concerns. Two approaches to reducing costs in government insurance programs are increasing funds coming in or reducing funds going out. This can be achieved by raising premiums, seeking higher returns on funds, or reducing assumed risk. Premiums collected by FAA totaled $165 million in FY2013, with the maximum amount set by statute. Increasing the statutory cap could raise premiums and eliminate implicit subsidies. The increase would depend on the gap between current premiums and actuarial rates. Airlines with low risk profiles might seek private insurance or operate with less coverage if premiums rise. Premiums received by insurers are typically invested until claims are paid. The Aviation Insurance Revolving Fund, currently over $2 billion, is invested in U.S. Treasury securities, with returns near historical lows. Private insurers invest in a wider range of instruments, yielding higher returns than Treasury securities. Private insurers earned approximately $67.6 billion on $1.48 trillion in cash and investments in 2013, compared to the Aviation Insurance Revolving Fund's $26 million in interest. If the Fund had similar returns to private insurers, it would have earned around $91 million in FY2013. Private insurers' investments are riskier than Treasury securities, with mechanisms like deductibles and co-insurance to share the risk. This risk-sharing discourages behavior that may lead to losses, known as \"moral hazard.\" Since 2002, the government has offered coverage with no deductibles or co-insurance, covering losses in full up to maximum limits. The Aviation War Risk Insurance Program also covers losses that may not be typical. The War Risk Insurance Program offers coverage for various risks, including vandalism, labor disturbances, and other acts intended to cause loss or damage. Placing more risk on airlines could lead to significant budgetary savings. Private insurers often share risks among multiple insurers through reinsurance or contractual arrangements tailored to the types of risks involved. Loss sharing typically occurs as a certain percentage of the total loss. Private insurers enter into reinsurance or other loss-sharing arrangements for various reasons, not just to share financial risk. They may have expertise or capacity in different areas of insurance operations, allowing them to benefit from each other's strengths. For example, one insurer may excel in judging risks and underwriting policies but lack financial capital, while another insurer may have high capital levels but lack expertise. A well-constructed loss-sharing arrangement can benefit both insurers. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act created a program structure to address these issues. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act established a program with loss-sharing based on the level of loss and a percentage of premiums. Government coverage starts at 20% of losses, decreasing over time. Improved risk assessment for flights in conflict zones could stabilize private market war risk insurance. Insurance underwriters are reviewing coverage for aircraft in conflict zones, requiring more details on flight routes and considering withdrawal of coverage in certain areas in the Middle East and Africa due to concerns about inconsistent risk assessment by airlines. Airlines often fly over conflict zones to save on fuel costs. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) convened a task force in response to questions about airlines flying over conflict zones. Current guidelines require countries to assess and mitigate risks to civilian aircraft in conflict zones, but not all countries consistently share information or take necessary precautions. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) task force addresses risks to civil aviation in conflict zones. Countries may not always prioritize mitigating risks, as it could impact travel and tourism. Aviation authorities like the FAA issue warnings and restrictions, leading to differing views on risk management. In 2014, FAA restricted flights to Israel during an armed conflict, prompting international airlines to suspend service. Israeli authorities urged carriers to resume flights, highlighting challenges in coordinating precautions among regulators, airlines, and insurers. The government may be hesitant to issue warnings and restrictions that could affect travel and tourism, even after incidents like the destruction of Malaysia Airlines flight 17. Improved processes for assessing conflict zone hazards to civil aviation could help reduce uncertainties and ambiguities in risk assessment. EU Regulation 785/2004 requires all air carriers to have aviation-specific liability insurance. The EU Regulation 785/2004 mandates that air carriers and aircraft operators must have aviation-specific liability insurance covering passengers, baggage, cargo, and third parties. The minimum insurance coverage required is 250,000 SDRs ($378,523) per passenger for passenger liability, higher than the Montreal Convention's requirement. Non-commercial aircraft operations with a MTOM of 2,700 kg have a lower minimum of 100,000 SDRs ($151,409) per passenger. Baggage liability requires 1,131 SDRs ($1,712) per passenger, and cargo liability requires 19 SDRs ($29) per kilogram in commercial operations. The EU Regulation 785/2004 mandates aviation-specific liability insurance for air carriers and operators. Minimum coverage per accident varies based on aircraft MTOM, ranging from 750,000 SDRs ($1,135,568) to 700 million SDRs (nearly $1.06 billion). Sanctions for non-compliance include license withdrawal and landing rights refusal. The federal government offers Aviation War Risk Insurance and Terrorism Risk Insurance Programs. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program, created after 9/11, provided federal coverage for losses from terrorist attacks when commercial insurance became expensive and limited. It was expected that the private sector would offer terrorism coverage by the end of 2005. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program (TRIA) was reauthorized multiple times due to the insurance industry's unwillingness to cover terrorism risk. Several bills have been introduced to extend the program further, with support from the insurance industry. TRIA provides government reinsurance for private insurers offering specific commercial property/casualty coverage, rather than directly covering businesses at risk of terrorism losses. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program (TRIA) requires insurers to offer terrorism coverage and reimburses them for losses under certain conditions. There are no upfront premiums, but a post-event recoupment fee may be applied to recover costs. TRIA coverage is limited compared to federal aviation war risk insurance and is funded from the government's general fund. Insurers must meet general deductibles for TRIA coverage, which is more limited than aviation war risk insurance. $100 million in insured losses from a terrorist act is required before federal funds flow. Private insurers must offer terrorism coverage under the same terms as other losses, but can charge a separate premium. Terrorism premiums may be limited under state laws regulating insurance."
