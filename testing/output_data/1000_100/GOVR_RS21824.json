    "content": "During debates over the 1998 HEA amendments, campus crimes, particularly drug-related incidents, were a major concern for Congress. Representative Souder highlighted the increasing drug abuse epidemic and proposed a provision to eliminate financial aid eligibility for students convicted of drug crimes. This provision was ultimately added to P.L. 105-244. The legislation under P.L. 105-244 states that students convicted of drug offenses are ineligible for federal student assistance under Title IV of the HEA. The period of ineligibility depends on the type and number of convictions, with indefinite ineligibility for multiple offenses. Reinstatement of eligibility requires completion of a drug rehabilitation program or removal of the conviction from the student's record. The period of ineligibility for federal student assistance due to drug offenses depends on the type and number of convictions. For possession, the ineligibility period ranges from one year to indefinite for first, second, and third offenses. For sale, the ineligibility period ranges from two years to indefinite for first and second offenses. Convictions prior to turning 18 or overturned convictions are not considered for eligibility. Indefinitely ineligible students must complete a drug rehabilitation program. Students who are ineligible for federal financial assistance due to drug offenses must complete a qualified rehabilitation program to regain eligibility. The program must meet specific requirements and include at least two unannounced drug tests. Participation in the program reduces the period of ineligibility. Upon completion of a qualified rehabilitation program, a student with multiple drug offense convictions can reduce their ineligibility period for federal financial aid. Participation in the program requires self-certification of completion and may result in future convictions reinstating ineligibility. Over 180,000 students have been affected by this provision, representing less than .25% of federal financial aid applicants. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 amended the provision regarding drug convictions affecting federal financial aid eligibility. Only convictions occurring while enrolled in postsecondary education and receiving Title IV aid disqualify students. The period of ineligibility remains based on the type of conviction. California and Texas have had a high number of students declared ineligible under this provision. The period of ineligibility for federal financial aid due to drug convictions depends on the type of conviction, recency, and prior convictions. Title IV of the HEA may be revised, with legislative proposals to modify the drug conviction provision. Issues include implementation, penalties, and who should be penalized. Discussions during the 1998 reauthorization highlighted the increase in drug usage on college campuses. During the 1998 reauthorization, the focus on drug-related crimes on college campuses was a major concern for policymakers. Congress included a provision for eligibility based on drug convictions, which critics argue unfairly singles out drugs. Supporters justify this focus by stating that drug-related crimes are more prevalent on college campuses compared to robbery, rape, and arson. The implications of limiting financial aid eligibility for drug convictions may be considered during reauthorization. During reauthorization, the focus on drug-related crimes on college campuses was a major concern for policymakers. The provision for eligibility based on drug convictions does not distinguish between misdemeanor or felony convictions, resulting in a loss of eligibility regardless of jail time served. Congress may debate the difference between felony and misdemeanor drug convictions in relation to student aid eligibility."
