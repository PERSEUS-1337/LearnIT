    "content": "President Bush signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004, which included funding for transportation and election reform projects. Congress passed a continuing resolution for FY2004 funding, extending funding for programs to January 31, 2004. The Senate passed its version of the FY2004 Transportation bill. The Senate passed its version of the FY2004 Transportation bill, recommending $91.0 billion, $5.1 billion more than the Administration requested. The House of Representatives passed H.R. 2989, providing $85.8 billion, with key differences including additional highway funding and the deletion of grants-in-aid to airports. The FY2004 budget consolidated appropriations for the Department of Transportation and the Department of the Treasury into a single bill due to the creation of the Department of Homeland Security. This restructuring also led to the combination of the former Transportation and Treasury subcommittees into one committee. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was created in FY2004, leading to the transfer of various agencies from the Department of Transportation and the Department of the Treasury to DHS. Budget numbers were adjusted for comparison, and the House and Senate had different divisions in their appropriation bills. The FY2003 Consolidated Appropriations Resolution included a 0.65% across-the-board rescission. The FY2003 Consolidated Appropriations Resolution included a 0.65% across-the-board rescission affecting the Department of Transportation and Department of the Treasury. The Administration's FY2004 budget request for these departments was $85.9 billion, $740 million lower than FY2003. The Senate's budget authority differs from the House's, with the Postal Service falling under \"Related Agencies.\" During deliberations on H.R. 2989, funding for FAA's Grants-in-Aid to Airports and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's Border Enforcement program was struck due to disputes over funding mechanisms. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 reduced transportation funding by $3.5 billion, dropping total funding in the bill from $89.3 billion to $85.8 billion. This includes a 0.59% rescission not reflected in the figures provided. Funding trends for transportation/treasury appropriations from FY1999-FY2004 are outlined in Table 3. The Department of Transportation's budget figures for FY1999-FY2003 have been adjusted for comparison with FY2004 by adding the Maritime Administration and adjusting for various agencies. Across-the-board rescissions were implemented in FY2001 and FY2003, with the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 containing a 0.59% rescission. The Administration's FY2004 budget proposed a DOT budget of $54.3 billion. The Administration's FY2004 budget proposed a DOT budget of $54.3 billion, which was 2.6% below FY2003's level. The budget request aligned with TEA-21 and FAIR21 authorizing acts, with some proposed changes to highway and transit funding structure. The FY2004 Transportation-Treasury Appropriations bill Conference Report Budget Authority table provided figures that may differ slightly from the text due to various funding actions. Funding for FAA's Grants-in-Aid to Airports program and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's Border Enforcement program was struck during House deliberations on H.R. 2989, reducing total transportation funding in the bill. The FY2004 Transportation-Treasury Appropriations bill Conference Report Budget Authority table showed reductions in transportation funding for various programs, including the Essential Air Service program, the Appalachian Development Highway System, and grants for motor carrier safety activities. Additionally, there were differences in funding amounts due to across-the-board rescissions and transfers between agencies. The FY2004 Transportation-Treasury Appropriations bill Conference Report Budget Authority table showed reductions in transportation funding for various programs, including the Essential Air Service program and grants for motor carrier safety activities. Differences in funding amounts were due to across-the-board rescissions and transfers between agencies. The total resources available for RSPA for FY2003 were $119 million, and for FY2004, it was $132 million, with a difference of $131 million, not $231 million. Congress postponed Amtrak's repayment of a $100 million loan from the DOT in FY2003 and would do so again in FY2004. Rescissions of unobligated previous years' contract authority were subtracted from the total resources available, resulting in $55.9 billion for FY2003 enacted. The FY2004 Consolidated Appropriations Act provides the FAA with $13.93 billion in funding, a $440 million increase from FY2003. The majority of the increased funding is allocated for Operations & Maintenance expenses, with no major new initiatives proposed. Funding comes mainly from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund, with only O&M funding using a mix of trust funds. The FY2004 Consolidated Appropriations Act provides the FAA with $13.93 billion in funding, with a focus on Operations & Maintenance expenses. Funding comes mainly from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund, with a mix of trust fund and Treasury general fund monies used for O&M funding. The Administration proposed a general fund contribution of almost $3.3 billion for FY2003, which was ultimately raised to $3.4 billion. For FY2004, the general fund contribution was increased to $4.5 billion. The FY2004 Consolidated Appropriations Act provides the FAA with $13.93 billion in funding, with a focus on Operations & Maintenance expenses. The general fund contribution has been increased to $4.5 billion, historically a key part of the annual FAA budget debate. Funding for Operations and Maintenance is set at $7.5 billion, with a significant portion allocated to FAA personnel salaries for air traffic control and safety activities. Facilities and Equipment funding for FY2004 is not specified in the provided text chunk. The FY2004 Act provides $2.91 billion for Facilities and Equipment (F&E), slightly less than the previous year. A Senate proposal to transfer $100 million of F&E funds to the Airport Improvement Program was dropped. Unobligated F&E funds of $30 million are subject to rescission. Research, Engineering, and Development (RE&D) receives $119.4 million, below the FY2003 level. Essential Air Service (EAS) program is also mentioned. The Essential Air Service (EAS) program receives funding from user fees collected from foreign aircraft overflights. In FY2003, $102 million was provided for EAS, with $50 million from its regular authorization and $52 million from the aviation trust fund. The FY2004 Act maintains this funding level, with $102 million allocated for EAS. The FY2004 Act allocates $102 million for the Essential Air Service program, rejecting proposals to reduce its size and require local contributions. The bill also excludes a provision for improved program coordination and funding reporting. Additionally, the Airport Improvement Program is funded at $3.425 billion, slightly higher than the previous year. The FY2004 Act allocated $3.425 billion for the Airport Improvement Program (AIP), with $20 million designated for the Small Community Air Service Program. The House-passed bill initially included AIP funding but was later removed. The Senate-passed bill provided $3.5 billion for AIP, including a $100 million transfer from the facilities and equipment account. The FAA was directed to prioritize projects at 241 airports for AIP discretionary grants. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 (P.L. 108-199) allocated $3.4 billion for the Airport Improvement Program (AIP) and prohibited using AIP grants for certain airport improvements related to bulk explosive detection systems. It also prohibited funds from being used for a ten-city Essential Air Service local participation pilot program. The FHWA budget for FY2004 requested $30.2 billion, a decrease of $2.2 billion from FY2003. The proposed obligation limitation was set at $29.3 billion, with funding for exempt programs at $931 million. The budget included changes reflecting the Administration's priorities. The FHWA budget for FY2004 proposed a $1.0 billion Infrastructure Performance and Maintenance initiative, distributing funds for \"ready-to-go\" projects addressing congestion and infrastructure improvements. Funds not used within six months would be reallocated. The budget also aimed to redirect gasohol excise tax revenues to the highway trust fund, adding $600 million in FY2004. Legislation would be required for this change. The House and Senate passed FY2004 appropriations bills for FHWA, with the House bill providing $34.6 billion and the Senate bill providing $34.8 billion. Both bills included obligations above the President's request, with earmarked discretionary programs. The Senate bill had a slightly higher obligation limitation than the House bill. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 set obligation limitations slightly above the House bill, with $931 million for exempt obligations. Discretionary programs were heavily earmarked by the Senate, with $175 million directed for surface transportation projects. The total budgetary resources for FHWA were $34.7 billion, slightly higher than the House total and lower than the Senate total. This represented an increase of over 6% from FY2003. The limitation on obligations was similar to both the House and Senate bills. The FY2004 conference agreement heavily earmarked discretionary programs under FHWA control, including Interstate Discretionary, Bridge Discretionary, and other programs. This was a departure from traditional practice, as funds under core formula programs were also earmarked in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004. The FY2004 conference agreement earmarked over $1 billion of unobligated core program funds for various projects, with a 100% federal share for earmarked projects, a departure from past practices. Additionally, nearly $300 million was allocated for Miscellaneous Highway and Highway Safety Programs. The FY2004 conference agreement allocated over $1 billion of unobligated core program funds for various projects with a 100% federal share. Additionally, nearly $300 million was designated for Highway and Highway Safety Programs, including transfers to Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, construction of Pennsylvania Avenue, Amber Alert grants, and funding for the Appalachian Development Highway System. The TEA-21 authorizing authority was set to expire in 2003, with Congress considering reauthorization proposals. TEA-21, the largest surface transportation program in U.S. history, was set to expire on October 1, 2003. Existing programs operate on extensions (P.L. 108-88 to February 29, 2004; P.L. 108-202 to April 30, 2004). Any new legislation is expected to retain existing program funding. Most highway and transit programs originated from ISTEA in 1991. FHWA has various highway programs, with major federal-aid programs like NHS and IM being core programs. The highway funding programs consist of NHS, IM, STP, BRR, and CMAQ, apportioned annually. There is also \"exempt\" funding for minimum guarantee and emergency relief, not limited annually. Allocated programs, like the Federal Lands Highway Program, are under direct control of FHWA or other entities. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) was established in 2000 under the Motor Carrier Safety Improvement Act of 1999. It enforces safety regulations for interstate commercial truck and bus operations, issues licenses for commercial drivers, and conducts inspections of Mexican-domiciled commercial drivers and vehicles entering the United States. FMCSA also administers grants and programs to help states with truck and bus safety activities. FMCSA conducts inspections of Mexican-domiciled commercial drivers and vehicles entering the United States, advances Intelligent Transportation Systems for commercial operations, and reviews carriers transporting property and passengers. Most funds come from the federal Highway Trust Fund. The FY2004 Administration request for FMCSA was $447 million, an increase of $134 million from FY2003. The conference committee specified an FMCSA appropriation of $366 million for FY2004. The conference agreement provides $190 million for motor carrier safety grants and information systems, along with an additional $111.5 million for various other FMCSA programs and activities. The approved budget for FMCSA's administrative and operations expenses in FY2004 is $176 million, supporting activities such as enforcement, outreach efforts, and the establishment of a medical review board. The funds allocated for FMCSA activities in FY2004 include support for personnel, outreach efforts, establishment of a medical review board, and agency information systems. Grants to states for enforcement of commercial vehicle regulations are also covered. The approved budget for these activities was $190 million. The MCSAP program provides grants to states for enforcing commercial vehicle safety regulations, covering up to 80% of program costs. The Senate bill allocated $47 million for border inspection stations. The FY2004 budget includes $170 million for MCSAP and $20 million for safety initiatives. An additional $111.5 million is provided for various initiatives like border inspection facilities and CDL improvement grants. NHTSA funding supports behavioral and vehicle programs to improve traffic safety, including reducing impaired driving, enhancing occupant protection, and ensuring compliance with safety regulations. The Administration requested $665 million for NHTSA in FY2004, an increase of $231 million from FY2003. In FY2004, the Administration requested $447 million for traffic safety grants to states and $218 million for NHTSA's operations and research activities to reduce highway fatalities and prevent injuries. This included funding for research, highway safety programs, and safety assurance measures. The House, Senate, and conference agreement recommend funding for NHTSA at $451.1 million, with $225 million for highway traffic safety grants and $222.5 million for operations and research. The Administration requested $1.09 billion for the FRA, with most funding going to Amtrak. The House agreed to $1.09 billion, the Senate to $1.57 billion, and P.L. 108-199 provides $1.455 billion. The House, Senate, and conference agreement recommend funding for NHTSA at $451.1 million, with $225 million for highway traffic safety grants and $222.5 million for operations and research. The Administration requested $1.09 billion for the FRA, with most funding going to Amtrak. The House agreed to $1.09 billion, the Senate to $1.57 billion, and P.L. 108-199 provides $1.455 billion. For Amtrak, the House agreed to $900 million, the Senate to $1.346 billion, and P.L. 108-199 provides $1.225 billion. The Administration requested $131 million for railroad safety and operations, $14 million more than FY2003. For railroad research and development, the President requested $35 million, $6 million more than FY2003. For next generation high-speed rail, the President requested $23 million, $7 million less than last year; Conferees agreed on $37 million. The FRA budget debate focuses on Amtrak, agency safety activities, Next Generation High-Speed Rail, and state funding for high-speed rail initiatives. The FRA promotes and regulates railroad safety with a proposed budget of $131.2 million in FY2004, a 13% increase from FY2003. The House and Senate recommended around $130 million for FRA safety programs. The conference agreement provides $130.8 million for the FRA's safety programs, mainly used for salaries, travel, training, and information systems monitoring. The funds support goals of reducing rail accidents, grade-crossing accidents, and hazardous materials incidents. The railroad safety statute was last reauthorized in 1994, with funding authority expiring in FY1998. Hearings since 1994 have not resulted in agreement on funding for FRA's regulatory and safety compliance activities. The FRA's safety programs receive funding for various activities, including research and development on railroad safety topics. The FY2003 DOT appropriation provided $29.1 million for R&D, with a request for $35 million in FY2004. The House Committee recommended $28.2 million, and the Senate Committee recommended an unspecified amount. The House approved $28.2 million, the Senate approved $34.2 million, and the conferees recommend $34 million for the Next Generation High-Speed Rail R&D program. The Administration requested $23.2 million for FY2004, which is $7.05 million less than the FY2003 appropriation. The House supported establishing compliance of diesel multiple units with safety regulations, while the Senate supported additional high-speed corridor planning. The Senate supported additional high-speed corridor planning and maglev projects, providing $37.4 million in funding. The President requested $900 million for Amtrak for FY2004, which was $150 million less than the previous year's appropriation. Amtrak stated it could not survive on $900 million, with the DOT Inspector General agreeing. The House and Senate agreed to the $900 million funding, with the House also allowing states to transfer funds from the Highway Trust Account to Amtrak. The Senate agreed to $1.346 billion for Amtrak, extending the requirement for funding through grant requests to all Amtrak routes. P.L. 108-199 provides $1.225 billion for Amtrak, postpones repayment of a $100 million loan from DOT, and establishes a procedure for competitive bidding on state-supported routes currently operated by Amtrak. Beginning in FY2003, Congress stipulated that Amtrak's appropriation would go to the Secretary of Transportation, who would then provide funding to Amtrak quarterly. Congress also imposed requirements on Amtrak, including the submission of a 5-year business plan requesting $1.6 billion annually for maintenance and addressing backlogged maintenance needs. The plan to address Amtrak's $6 billion in backlogged maintenance needs did not propose expanding the existing rail network. Two bills have been introduced to reauthorize Amtrak, with one authorizing $2 billion annually for three years and another authorizing $2 billion annually for six years. Additionally, there are several bills that aim to change federal passenger rail policy, including one that would shift planning and financial responsibility to the states. Sen. Hutchinson and others proposed a plan (S. 1505) to restructure Amtrak and passenger rail service, giving the federal government more responsibility and authorizing $2 billion annually for 6 years for Amtrak operations. Sen. Hollings and others proposed a plan (S. 1961) authorizing $2 billion annually for 6 years for Amtrak and $30 billion in bonds for capital improvements to the rail network. President Bush's FY2004 budget request for FTA was $7.226 billion. The FY2003 FTA appropriation was reduced to $7.179 billion after a rescission. The House, Senate, and P.L. 108-199 agreed on funding amounts. Proposed program changes were not reflected in appropriations due to lack of approval for reauthorization. For more details, refer to CRS Report RL31854. MARAD's mission is to promote the development of a U.S. merchant marine. For FY2004, the President requested $219 million for MARAD, which is $12 million more than the previous year. Congress appropriated about $11 million less than the President's request. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 contains an across-the-board rescission of 0.59%. The Conference Report directs $607 million supplemented with $70 million from other FTA programs, totaling $677 million. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2003 provides $226.4 million for MARAD, which is $7.8 million more than the House passed bill and $1.2 million less than the Senate passed bill. The focus is on the Maritime Guaranteed Loan Program, which offers loans for purchasing ships and modernizing shipyards. The Administration has requested no funds for additional loans in FY2004 but $4.5 million for existing loan administration. In the Wartime Supplemental Appropriations bill (P.L. 108-11), Congress provided $25 million for the Title XI program. The DOT Inspector General called on MARAD to improve loan application review and financial oversight after the bankruptcy of American Classic Voyages. The General Accounting Office also identified weaknesses in the program at a Senate Commerce Committee hearing. The General Accounting Office identified weaknesses in the Title XI program and made recommendations for financial oversight. The Administration requested $104.4 million for operations and training, with funding allocated for the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, state maritime academies, and MARAD operations. The Consolidated Appropriations Act provided $107 million for operations and training. The Administration also requested $98.7 million for the Maritime Security Program, which was approved in the Consolidated Appropriations Act. The Administration requested funding for the disposal of obsolete vessels in the National Defense Reserve Fleet (NDRF), due to environmental concerns. MARAD has until 2006 to dispose of over 130 surplus ships, mainly located in Virginia and California. The Consolidated Appropriations Act provides $16.2 million for ship disposal. The Senate passed a measure related to the Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA), which includes the Office of Pipeline Safety and the Office of Hazardous Materials Safety. RSPA conducts various transportation safety activities and requested a budget of $118 million for FY2004, with $67 million for pipeline safety and $25 million for hazardous materials safety. The Senate passed a measure related to the Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA) for FY2004. The requested budget was $118 million, with $67 million for pipeline safety and $25 million for hazardous materials safety. The House and Senate approved funding for RSPA in FY2004, with the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 providing $112.9 million, including $23.7 million for hazardous materials transportation. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 provides $112.9 million for RSPA, including $23.7 million for hazardous materials transportation safety and $66.3 million for pipeline safety. The Treasury Department has four main functions: formulating economic policies, serving as the financial agent for the government, enforcing financial laws, and producing currency. The Treasury Department's role in law enforcement has become more limited since the creation of the Department of Homeland Security in 2002. The Department consists of departmental offices and operating bureaus, with the bureaus accounting for over 95% of the Department's employment and funding. The Treasury Department's bureaus can be categorized into those with financial responsibilities and those involved in law enforcement. The Comptroller of the Currency, U.S. Mint, Bureau of Engraving and Printing, and others handle financial tasks, while law enforcement is carried out by agencies like the BATF, U.S. Secret Service, and IRS. The creation of the Department of Homeland Security has reduced the Treasury Department's involvement in law enforcement. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was established under P.L. 107-296, transferring agencies like the Secret Service and Customs Service from the Treasury Department to DHS. The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau was created to handle alcohol and tobacco regulations previously managed by BATF. The Treasury Department's budget request for FY2004 was $11.408 billion, a 3.5% increase from FY2003 after adjusting for transfers to DHS and the Justice Department. The Administration's top priorities for Treasury operations in FY2004 were to bolster IRS's efforts to monitor and enforce compliance with tax laws, improve overall efficiency, and combat money laundering and terrorist activities. The IRS accounts for 91.5% of the proposed Treasury budget, followed by the Financial Management Service, the Bureau of Public Debt, and Departmental Offices. The budget request also included funding increases for FinCen and the International Technical Assistance program. The Administration proposed merging the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration with the Office of Inspector General. The House Committee on Appropriations approved funding for Treasury operations in FY2004, authorizing $11.273 billion, which was $423.5 million more than FY2003 but $70 million less than requested by the Bush Administration. The difference with the Administration's request mainly concerned a smaller budget for IRS operations. H.R. 2989 provided less funding for IRS operations compared to the Administration's request, with reductions in processing, assistance, management, tax law enforcement, and information systems. It allocated more funding for Treasury's departmental offices, mainly for administrative costs related to functions transferred to the DHS, the Office of International Affairs, and the new Office of Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes. The proposal to merge OIG and TIGTA was denied due to the need for extensive new legislation. The bill H.R. 2989 added funding to OIG and TIGTA's budgets for FY2003, matched FinCen's requested funding for FY2004, and included amendments related to Treasury appropriations. One of the amendments aimed to reduce funding for an IRS pilot program and redirect the savings to improve compliance among business taxpayers. The bill was approved by the full House on September 9, 2003. The amendment introduced by Representative Bernie Sanders aimed to prevent the Treasury Department from using funds to assist in overturning a judicial ruling in the Cooper v. IBM case, where IBM's pension plan was found to discriminate based on age. The amendment passed by a vote of 258 to 160. The House passed an amendment to prevent the Treasury Department from assisting in overturning a judicial ruling in the Cooper v. IBM case. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved $11.196 billion in funding for the Treasury Department in FY2004, which was $202 million more than FY2003 but less than the Bush Administration's request and the House-approved amount for FY2004. The difference in funding was mainly due to a smaller budget for IRS operations. S. 1589 provided less funding for IRS operations compared to the Administration's request, including $26 million less for tax processing and $79 million less for IRS information systems. It also proposed merging IRS accounts for tax law enforcement and the EITC program, resulting in a drop in recommended funding by $55 million. Additionally, S. 1589 allocated more funding than requested for Treasury's departmental offices, with increases for the Office of International Affairs and the Office of Terrorist Finance and Financial Crimes. The bill also rejected the proposed merger of the OIG and TIGTA into a new office. The Senate Appropriations Committee opposed the merger of OIG and TIGTA due to their different duties and responsibilities. Instead, they recommended increased funding for OIG and TIGTA in FY2004. The bill also matched the Administration's recommended increase in funding for FinCen to manage new responsibilities under the USA Patriot Act of 2001. The Senate passed an amendment requiring the IRS to study a pilot program for EITC pre-certification. Another amendment was passed to prevent the Treasury Department from implementing a new regulation on pension plans. The Senate passed an amendment related to EITC pre-certification and pension plan regulations. The House and Senate agreed to resolve differences in funding for the Treasury Department operations in FY2004, with a total of $11.166 billion approved. The Senate and House resolved funding differences for the Treasury Department in FY2004, with $11.166 billion approved. The majority of the difference was related to IRS funding, accounting for 92% of total Treasury appropriations. The agreement allocated funds to various Treasury offices and programs, including $10.245 billion for the IRS. This measure was included in an appropriations bill covering seven separate bills. The conference report on H.R. 2673 included the language of the conference agreement on H.R. 2989 and imposed a 0.59% cut on discretionary spending. The House and Senate approved the report, and President Bush signed it into law as P.L. 108-199. The IRS administers various federal taxes and fees, excluding customs duties. In FY2002, the IRS collected $2,017 billion before refunds, with individual income tax revenue being the largest component at $1,038 billion. The Bush Administration requested $10.436 billion for IRS operations in FY2004, with allocations for processing, assistance, management, tax law enforcement, information systems, and business systems modernization. The FY2004 budget allocated funds for various IRS programs, including $500 million for business systems modernization, $251 million for fraud prevention in the Earned Income Tax Credit program, and $35 million for health insurance tax credit administration. Two enforcement initiatives sparked concern, one involving a pilot program for EITC claims and another hiring private collection agents for unpaid taxes. A new program aimed at curbing tax evasion received $133 million in funding. The Administration proposed a program to curb tax evasion by targeting abusive tax schemes, misuse of trusts, corporate tax avoidance, under-reporting of income, and failure to pay employment taxes. This initiative aimed to increase audits for high-income individuals and businesses by 72%. Concerns were raised about the adequacy of funding for IRS operations to enforce tax laws effectively. The IRS Oversight Board plays a crucial role in the annual appropriations process for the IRS. The IRS Oversight Board, established under the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998, reviews the annual IRS budget request and makes recommendations to the Secretary of the Treasury. For FY2004, the Board recommended a budget of $10.724 billion for the IRS, including hiring 2,120 additional full-time employees to enhance tax law compliance efforts and provide more resources for the BSM. The IRS Oversight Board recommended a budget of $10.724 billion for FY2004 to enhance tax law compliance efforts, provide resources for the BSM, and restore funds for customer service and enforcement. The House Committee on Appropriations passed a measure funding the IRS at $10.352 billion for FY2004. The House Committee on Appropriations passed a measure funding the IRS at $10.352 billion for FY2004, which was $85 million less than the amount requested by the Bush Administration. The funding was allocated to various IRS programs and initiatives, including processing, assistance, and management; tax law enforcement; information systems; BSM; and administering the health insurance tax credit. The Committee's report highlighted programs like low-income taxpayer clinics and the tax counseling program for elderly taxpayers. The House overwhelmingly passed H.R. 2989 on September 9, 2003, endorsing recommended funding levels for IRS accounts in FY2004. The bill included funding for various IRS programs, such as the Free-File Alliance and the earned income tax credit. Additionally, an amendment was adopted to prevent the IRS from overturning a federal judge's ruling on age discrimination in IBM's pension plan. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved $10.276 billion in funding for IRS operations in FY2004, with specific allocations for processing, assistance, and tax law enforcement. This amount was $296 million more than FY2003, but less than the Administration's request and the House's approval. The funding aimed to prevent the IRS from finalizing regulations on age-discrimination rules for pension plan conversions, potentially benefiting IBM in a legal appeal. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved $10.276 billion in funding for IRS operations in FY2004, with specific allocations for processing, assistance, and tax law enforcement. The Committee report praised two IRS programs: the Tax Counseling Program for the Elderly and Low-Income Taxpayer Clinics, recommending funding levels for each program. The Senate approved $10.276 billion in funding for IRS operations in FY2004, with allocations for tax law enforcement. The Senate passed a measure related to IRS funding without changes, but approved amendments preventing the Treasury Department from using funds for certain IRS regulations. The House version of H.R. 2989 provided additional funding of $76 million for the IRS in FY2004 compared to the Senate version. The extra funds were allocated to processing, assistance, and management, tax law enforcement, and information systems. Leaders from both the House and Senate agreed to a conference to reconcile the differences between the two versions. Under a conference agreement reached on November 12, 2003, funding for the IRS in FY 2004 would total $10.245 billion, with allocations for processing, assistance, management, tax law enforcement, and information systems. The agreement also includes funding for specific programs such as Tax Counseling for the Elderly and grants for low-income taxpayer clinics. The conference agreement on funding for the IRS in FY 2004 included $10.245 billion for various programs, with specific allocations for processing, assistance, management, tax law enforcement, and information systems. Additionally, $35 million was allocated for administering the health insurance tax credit. The agreement also addressed issues with the Business Systems Modernization program, expressing congressional dissatisfaction with cost increases, project delays, and poor management. Furthermore, the agreement prohibited the IRS from using funds to lift a moratorium on converting pension plans to cash-balance plans. The conference agreement on funding for the IRS in FY 2004 included $10.245 billion for various programs, with specific allocations for processing, assistance, management, tax law enforcement, and information systems. Additionally, $35 million was allocated for administering the health insurance tax credit. The agreement also required proposed legislation for transition relief for older participants affected by pension plan conversions and a final report on the EITC program by the IRS. This agreement was part of a consolidated appropriations measure (H.R. 2673) with an across-the-board cut of 0.59% in discretionary spending for federal programs outside of defense and military. The House approved the conference report for H.R.2673 with a 0.59% cut in discretionary spending for federal programs outside of defense and military in FY2004. The Senate and President Bush also approved the measure, which included appropriations for the United States Postal Service. The U.S. Postal Service generates most of its funding through product sales, receiving a regular appropriation from Congress for certain services. Congress is required to reimburse USPS $29 million annually until 2035 for services performed in the 1990s. The 2001 terrorist attacks led to new funding needs that USPS believes should be met through appropriations. The U.S. Postal Service received a revenue forgone appropriation of $59.6 million in FY2003, including $30.8 million for that year and $29 million annually under the Revenue Forgone Reform Act of 1993. The Administration proposed $55.7 million for FY2004 and $29 million for FY2003, totaling $65.5 million. $36.5 million would be available in FY2005, with an additional $31 million for FY2002 in FY2004. In FY2002, the Bush Administration proposed reversing the budget practice of using advance appropriations to avoid spending limitations. The USPS requested an additional $350 million for emergency response funds in FY2004 to protect employees and customers from threats like the 2001 anthrax attack. The funds would be used for ventilation and filtration equipment. No additional funds for emergency preparedness were included in the Administration's FY2003 or FY2004 Budgets. The Postal Service submitted an emergency preparedness plan in 2002 to combat biological and chemical threats in the mail, requesting substantial appropriations for FY2003 and FY2004. The House and Senate versions of the FY2004 bill provided funding as requested, including advance appropriations for revenue forgone in FY2005. The end-of-session Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 continued long-standing language forbidding USPS from reducing service below six-day delivery standards or closing rural post offices during FY2004. It also extended the sales period for the Breast Cancer Research semi-postal stamp to fund research until December 31, 2005. The Administration's Budget proposed correcting an over-funding issue for USPS. The Administration's Budget proposed correcting an over-funding issue for USPS by reducing the annual contribution to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, saving USPS $2.9 billion in FY2003 and $2.6 billion in succeeding years. This was achieved through legislation passed by Congress (P.L. 108-18). The Transportation, Treasury and General Government Appropriations bill funds most offices in the Executive Office of the President, except for three. The President's FY2004 budget proposed consolidating EOP salaries and expenses into a single annual appropriation called \"The White House\" totaling $183.8 million, a decrease from previous years. The White House consolidated appropriation for FY2004 would total $183.8 million, a 3.0% decrease from the previous year. The consolidation includes various accounts such as Compensation of the President, White House Office, Executive Residence, and others. This initiative aims to provide flexibility in resource allocation and staff support for the President and Vice President. Similar consolidations were proposed in previous budgets. The FY2004 White House consolidated appropriation proposal includes a 10% transfer authority among various accounts to streamline administration and oversight of public funds. Congress has concerns about consolidation impacting oversight of spending. The FY2004 White House consolidated appropriation proposal includes a 10% transfer authority among various accounts to address emerging priorities and improve efficiency within the Executive Office of the President. This transfer authority would allow the President to merge and reallocate up to 10% of any appropriation after notifying the Senate and House Committees on Appropriations. The FY2004 White House consolidated appropriation proposal includes a 10% transfer authority among various accounts to address emerging priorities and improve efficiency within the Executive Office of the President. An appropriation could not be increased by more than 50% by such transfers. Both the House and the Senate Committees on Appropriations recommended that separate appropriations for the EOP accounts will be continued and that the transfer authority proposal is not agreed to. The existing structure provides transparency and flexibility for reprogramming funds within accounts to address unforeseen budget needs. The President's FY2004 budget for EOP programs proposed an appropriation of $790.6 million, an increase of 1.7% from FY2003.

Reimbursable political events in the Executive Residence must be paid for in advance by the sponsor, with reimbursements separately accounted for and sponsoring organizations billed. The staff must report to the Committees on Appropriations and maintain a tracking system for reimbursable expenses. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations recommended, and the law provides the same appropriations as the President requested for the repair and restoration funds. The House committee report states that the funds will finance ongoing restoration projects. The Special Assistance to the President account funds the Vice President in carrying out assigned responsibilities. The President's FY2004 budget proposed an increase in appropriations for salaries and expenses for the Vice President.

The law appropriates $67.159 million and directs OIRA to ensure compliance with the Federal Data Quality Act. $1,000,000 of the funding is withheld until programmatic concerns are addressed. The public should have access to high-quality government data and a streamlined process for correcting inaccuracies. The Administrator of OIRA must report to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations. The Administrator of OIRA is directed to submit a report to Congress by June 1, 2004 on agencies' responsiveness to public requests for information correction. Funding restrictions prevent OMB from reviewing agricultural marketing orders or altering witness testimony transcripts. The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) develops policies and priorities for the National Drug Control Program, with a proposed budget increase in FY2004. The budget includes funding for salaries, expenses, and policy research. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended an appropriation of $28.8 million for the Office of National Drug Control Policy, including funding for policy research.

The House Committee on Appropriations recommended an appropriation of $226.350 million for the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTA) program, $20 million more than the President's request. The increase is to fully fund existing HIDTA program activities, expand HIDTAs where justified, fund new HIDTAs as appropriate, and support HIDTA activities through the Central Priority Organization Targets (CPOT) initiative. Existing HIDTAs in fiscal year 2003 will receive funding at least equal to the fiscal year 2003 initial allocation level. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended an appropriation of $226.350 million for the HIDTA program, $20 million more than the President's request. The additional funding is to fully fund existing HIDTA program activities, expand HIDTAs where warranted, and fund new HIDTAs and activities consistent with the program's mission. The ONDCP is advised to consider increased funding for specific HIDTAs and the expansion of the Appalachian HIDTA. The HIDTA program is recommended to be funded at no less than the FY2003 initial allocation level, with funds not to be used for further consolidation of the Southwest Border HIDTA. The ONDCP Director must submit a request for fund reprogramming based on HIDTA program priorities and effectiveness measures. Funds should be strictly used for implementing HIDTA strategies, considering local conditions and resource needs, without supplanting existing support for Federal, State, or local activities. The HIDTA program funds should not supplant existing support for drug control operations. Remaining funds can be transferred to Federal agencies for antidrug activities. The Committee expects ONDCP to consult with Appropriations Committees for new grant programs and coordinate with other agencies to target international drug traffickers. The General Accounting Office is directed to conduct a study on the effectiveness of the CPOT program and report to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations within 90 days. Committee views on methamphetamine reduction and specific issues in various HIDTAs are also expressed in the report.

Funds would only be available upon OPM approval of agency performance pay plans. OPM would allocate remaining funds at its discretion. The Senate Committee on Appropriations did not recommend an appropriation for the fund, believing that such initiatives should be budgeted and administered within individual agencies. The law provides an appropriation of $1 million, which cannot be obligated or transferred until legislation establishes the fund within OPM. Funds also cannot be transferred to federal agencies without prior approval from OPM. The Office of Special Counsel (OSC) investigates federal employee allegations of prohibited personnel practices, enforces the Hatch Act, and provides whistle-blowing channels. The President's FY2004 budget proposed a $13.5 million appropriation for the OSC, a 9.2% increase from FY2003, to reduce case processing backlogs.

The Administration proposed changes to these provisions, with details listed in Table 11. The status of General Schedule pay adjustments in January 2004 was uncertain. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 has enacted a 4.1% pay increase for federal white collar employees under the General Schedule, retroactive to January 1, 2004. This increase includes a 2% adjustment. The adjustment is based on changes in private sector salaries reflected in the Employment Cost Index (ECI), with the rate of pay adjustment calculated as the percentage rate of change in the ECI minus 0.5. The President signed an Executive Order for federal civilian personnel salary schedules in January 2003, with a 4.1% pay increase for the General Schedule. An additional 1% was allocated to locality-based comparability payments. In January 2004, a 2.0% pay increase was proposed, with an alternative plan for a 1.5% increase in basic pay and a 0.5% increase in locality pay. In January 2004, Congress did not finalize legislation for pay rates, but the President's plan included a 4.1% pay increase for civilian employees, with 2.7% for basic pay and 1.4% for locality-based payments. The pending Consolidated Appropriations, 2004 bill includes this provision. The Federal Wage System (FWS) compensates federal blue-collar workers based on local wage rates. Congress has limited adjustment rates for FWS wages in high-cost areas to prevent exceeding private sector salaries. In high-cost areas, FWS wages will be capped to prevent exceeding private sector salaries. The Monroney Amendment extended out-of-area survey application to Department of Defense personnel. Changes to Senior Executive Service salaries were enacted under the National Defense Authorization Act for 2004. Under the National Defense Authorization Act for 2004, changes were made to Senior Executive Service salaries. The minimum pay rate for January 2004 is $103,700 and the maximum is $145,600 for most employees. Those in agencies with certified performance appraisal systems by OPM can receive up to $158,100, equal to Members of Congress and U.S. District Court judges. The Administration's FY2004 pay proposal includes a 2% across-the-board increase and a $500 million fund for rewarding top performers with permanent base pay increases. No provisions were made for the pay of Members of Congress, Judges, or other federal officials in the House-passed or Senate-reported versions. The pay adjustment for federal officials, including Members of Congress and judges, is based on ECI calculations. A 2.2% pay adjustment was scheduled for January 2004, but was initially limited to 1.5%. The full adjustment of 2.2% will be retroactive. An amendment to deny the pay increase to Members was tabled by the Senate. The pay adjustment for federal officials in January 2004 was initially limited to 1.5% based on ECI calculations. The full adjustment of 2.2% will be retroactive, with P.L. 108-167 authorizing the increase for judges. Unlike other officials, judges require specific authorization for annual pay increases. The Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act, 2000 (P.L. 106-58) increased the President's salary to $400,000 per year starting January 20, 2001. Former Presidents receive a pension equal to Cabinet Secretaries' pay rate. The Federal Employees Compensation Act provides workers' compensation benefits for Federal employees injured on the job, with costs covered by agency budgets. The Administration proposed changes in FECA to charge administrative costs to employing agencies, aiming to improve workplace safety. The surcharge would be around 3.5% of benefit costs, mainly paid by the U.S. Postal Service and the Defense Department. The Administration supported competitive sourcing and objected to hindering amendments in H.R. 2989. The Office of Management and Budget successfully altered some competitive sourcing provisions in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004. Competitive sourcing is part of the President's Management Agenda. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is a component of the President's Management Agenda and has implemented initiatives to promote competitive sourcing. Circular A-76 provides policy and guidance for public-private competitions, with competitive sourcing provisions found in Section 647 of H.R. 2673. This section places conditions on competitions involving more than 10 federal employees, requiring agencies to develop a plan for a most efficient organization (MEO). The requirement of an MEO for standard competitions under Circular A-76 may hinder agencies from meeting the 90-day deadline for streamlined competitions. Section 647(a) also mandates consideration of the conversion differential in streamlined competitions, which is not required under the circular. The conversion differential in streamlined competitions under Section 647(a) is more stringent than Circular A-76. The competitive sourcing official must consider if contractor performance would be less costly to the agency by $10 million or 10% of personnel costs. It is unclear how this decision would impact the performance decision in completing the competition form. The conversion differential in standard competitions, as outlined in Section 647(a), is a more stringent requirement compared to Circular A-76. Agencies are required to add this differential to the cost of the non-incumbent's performance on the standard competition form. Additionally, Section 647(b) mandates executive agencies to submit annual reports to Congress on their competitive sourcing activities, including completed competitions, announced competitions, associated costs, and FTEs. The first report is due within 120 days after enactment, with subsequent reports due by December 31 of each year. The curr_chunk discusses the reporting requirements for agency competitive sourcing activities, including costs, savings, projected FTEs, and decision-making processes. It also mentions the absence of a methodology for collecting required information and the potential costs of fulfilling this requirement. Additionally, it mentions that agency heads are not required to limit the performance period in a letter of obligation issued to an MEO to five years or less. The curr_chunk discusses the flexibility allowed by Circular A-76 for MEOs in competitive sourcing, potentially resulting in less frequent recompetitions. Allowing agencies to write letters of obligation with performance periods longer than five years could help mitigate recruitment and retention concerns among federal government employees. Section 647(d) allows agency heads to use funds for monitoring public-private competitions, supporting oversight and decision-making. Section 647(e) prohibits moving work outside the US if previously done by federal employees domestically, potentially impacting contractor bids. The FY2004 Transportation-Treasury appropriations bill had provisions to prevent funds from enforcing travel restrictions, but these were dropped in the final Consolidated Appropriations Act. This could impact contractor bids and job retention in the US. The FY2004 Transportation-Treasury appropriations bill, which included seven regular appropriations acts, dropped two Cuba provisions from the House version of H.R. 2989. The White House threatened to veto any legislation weakening economic sanctions against Cuba. US policy towards Cuba has focused on isolating the Communist government through sanctions since the 1960s. The 1992 Cuban Democracy Act and 1996 Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act strengthened sanctions on Cuba. Sanctions on financial transactions, including travel, are governed by the Cuban Assets Control Regulations. There are ongoing debates in Congress about lifting or easing these sanctions to promote democracy and human rights in Cuba. Some advocate maximum pressure on the Cuban government for reforms, while others call for lifting certain U.S. sanctions. The House-approved H.R. 2929 had provisions to prevent funds from enforcing travel restrictions and remittances. Restrictions on travel have been a contentious component in U.S. efforts to isolate Cuba. The U.S. embargo regulations have resulted in a de facto travel ban to Cuba, with restrictions on financial transactions. Certain categories of travelers, such as government officials, journalists, and those with close relatives in Cuba, may travel under a general license. Supporters of the Flake amendment argue that U.S. policy towards Cuba restricts the rights of ordinary Americans to travel. The U.S. embargo regulations have led to a de facto travel ban to Cuba, with restrictions on financial transactions. Supporters of the Flake amendment argue that U.S. policy towards Cuba limits the rights of ordinary Americans to travel, while opponents believe lifting travel restrictions would benefit the Cuban government financially. H.Amdt. 377 (Delahunt) aimed to prevent funds from enforcing restrictions on remittances, with a vote of 222-196. In March 2003, OFAC amended Cuba travel regulations to allow travelers to carry up to $3,000 in remittances. In March 2003, OFAC tightened Cuba travel regulations, limiting certain types of educational exchanges. H.Amdt. 382 (Davis) aimed to preserve people-to-people educational exchanges, but was not approved. Supporters argued for unlimited remittances to Cuban households, while opponents feared funds would support the Cuban regime. Some groups praised the restriction of educational exchanges to Cuba, while others criticized the decision. Senate approved a measure to prevent funds from enforcing travel restrictions to Cuba. The provision by S.Amdt. 1901 (Craig) would take effect one day after enactment of the bill. Cuba's human rights crackdown in 2003 impacted legislative proposals to ease U.S. sanctions policy. The House-approved Cuba amendments to H.R. 2989 had less support than in 2002. The Flake amendment to H.R. 2989 was approved by a vote of 227-188, compared to a similar amendment in the FY2003 Treasury Department appropriations bill approved by a vote of 262-167.

The current aviation authorizing legislation includes ARAA, ATSA, FAIR21, and EAS. Other programs and agencies mentioned are BRR, BTS, CG, CMAQ, DOT, F&E, FAA, FAHP, FHWA, FRA, FTA, and Hazmat. The curr_chunk provides a list of abbreviations and acronyms related to various transportation programs and agencies, including FRA, FTA, Hazmat, HPP, HTF, IM, ITS, MCSAP, New Starts, NHS, NHTSA, NMCSA, O&M, OIG, OST, RABA, RD&T, and RE&D. The Department of Transportation (DOT) budget is funded through transportation trust funds and federal Treasury general funds. Key programs and agencies include FAA, RSPA, SCASD, STB, STP, TCSP, TEA-21, TIFIA, and TSA. Transportation is function 400 in the annual unified congressional budget and is part of the discretionary budget. Trust funds like the highway trust fund, airport and airway trust fund, and inland waterways trust fund are funded by specific taxes and accounted for over two-thirds of federal transportation spending in FY2002. Highway and transit funding make up the largest portion of DOT appropriations, with most programs funded through contract authority linked to the highway trust fund. This arrangement allows authorized funds to be automatically available at the start of each fiscal year without the need for appropriations legislation. During the 105th and 106th Congresses, major legislation changed the relationships between transportation trust funds and the federal budget. The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) linked annual spending for highway programs directly to revenue collections for the highway trust fund, giving special status to core highway and mass transit program funding in the federal budget. The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) created a \"firewall\" around highway and transit spending programs in the federal budget, ensuring funding guarantees that are difficult to alter. Additional highway funds can be provided annually through Revenue Aligned Budget Authority (RABA). TEA-21 changed the role of House and Senate committees in determining spending levels for transportation programs. TEA-21 established annual spending levels for highway and transit programs, with obligations set by RABA computation. The House and Senate appropriations committees have limited discretion in changing spending levels for specific programs or projects. In FY2000 and FY2001 appropriations acts, there were attempts to redistribute funds among programs and add earmarked projects. The Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century (FAIR21 or AIR21) guarantees federal aviation spending through point-of-order rules for the House and Senate, different from TEA-21. Supporters believe it requires increased spending on aviation programs, leading to growth in spending for FY2001 and FY2002. Enactment of FAIR21 guarantees federal aviation spending through point-of-order rules, with spending growth in FY2001 and FY2002. Congress can waive points-of-order during legislation consideration. Transportation budgeting uses a confusing lexicon of budget authority and contract authority. TEA-21 limited the role of appropriations in funding trustfund-financed programs like the federal-aid highway program by automatically providing contract authority to states at the start of each fiscal year. This control on obligations helps manage outlays in line with congressional budget agreements. TEA-21 limited the role of appropriations in funding highway and transit programs by setting obligations levels for FY1999 through FY2003. States pay for projects upfront and receive federal payments later. Trust fund balances remain high to cover future commitments. Highway and transit accounts have significant short- and long-term obligations. The distribution of contract authority funds to states and programs involves apportionments for formula-driven programs and allocations for programs under direct federal control. Apportionments are funds distributed to states, while allocations are distributed administratively to various entities. The terms apportionments and allocations refer to the distribution of funds to states and programs, not the federal budget process. Highway program recipients may mistakenly assume that a state apportionment is part of the federal budget."
