The Act aims to establish a grant program for State-administered notification systems to find missing seniors with Alzheimer's and dementia-related illnesses, promote best practices for Silver Alert systems, and increase awareness for coordinated efforts to locate missing individuals quickly and reunite them with their families. SEC. 3. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS. The Congress finds that Alzheimer's disease affects millions of people in the US, with a higher risk for those over 60. Data shows 1 in 8 individuals over 65 have the disease, and someone develops it every 71 seconds. The aging baby boomer population will increase the number of those with Alzheimer's and dementia. The Alzheimer's Association estimates that over 60% of Alzheimer's disease patients will wander away from their care facilities. Some states have implemented notification systems, similar to the Amber Alert, to help locate missing seniors with dementia. Some states have implemented notification systems, like the Amber Alert, to locate missing seniors with dementia. Timely dissemination of information about missing individuals increases chances of locating them. Other states have faced challenges in developing such systems due to budget constraints. Congress believes Silver Alert systems should have clear criteria to avoid frequent notifications based solely on age. Silver Alerts should only be issued for individuals incapable of making personal care decisions, initiated by someone who has recent contact with the missing individual, and should prioritize privacy and dignity. The issuance of Silver Alerts should prioritize the independence and autonomy of individuals with Alzheimer's disease and other dementia-related illnesses. It should also promote training for law enforcement officers on locating missing individuals with dementia and coordinating with state and local programs. The Federal Government can play a significant role in these efforts. The Federal Government can help States establish and improve Silver Alert systems to prevent injuries and loss of life among individuals with Alzheimer's disease and other dementia-related illnesses. The Silver Alert System Grant Program is established to assist States in preventing injuries and loss of life among individuals with Alzheimer's disease and other dementia-related illnesses. The Attorney General can award grants to States to establish or improve Silver Alert systems. Grants are for one-year periods and must be at least $100,000. Regulations will be prescribed for eligibility and application criteria. The Attorney General can award grants to States for Silver Alert systems, with selection criteria and $5,600,000 authorized for fiscal years 2009-2013. SEC. 5. ANNUAL REPORT ON SILVER ALERT SYSTEMS. The Attorney General must provide an annual report to Congress on Silver Alert systems, including a list of states with such systems, the number of alerts issued and individuals located, the time taken to locate individuals, the issuing agency, dissemination process, and operational costs. The annual report to Congress on Silver Alert systems includes information on the cost, criteria for issuing alerts, and individuals crossing state lines. Additionally, it covers actions taken to protect privacy and dignity, improve communication, and any other relevant details determined by the Attorney General. SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS. The term \"Silver Alert system\" refers to a State-administered notification system to locate missing individuals with Alzheimer's disease and other dementia-related illnesses. The term \"State\" includes all states of the United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands."
