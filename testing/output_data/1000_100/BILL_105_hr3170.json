    "content": "Section 1 introduces a new section, SEC. 1260, which deals with gains from constructive ownership transactions in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The new section SEC. 1260 addresses gains from constructive ownership transactions, treating such gains as short-term capital gain if they exceed the net underlying long-term capital gain. Additionally, the capital gain rate applicable is determined based on the rates that would have applied to the net underlying long-term capital gain. The taxpayer's tax for a taxable year may increase by interest if any gain is treated as short-term capital gain. This interest is calculated based on the due date for the return of tax and underpayments for prior years related to the gain. The taxpayer's tax may increase due to interest on short-term capital gains, calculated based on the return due date and underpayments from prior years. The financial position for tax purposes includes positions related to stocks, debt instruments, partnership interests, and investment trust interests. The taxpayer may be treated as having entered into a constructive ownership transaction with respect to a financial position, including notional principal contracts, futures contracts, options, or other transactions. The taxpayer may be treated as having entered into a constructive ownership transaction with respect to financial positions, including notional principal contracts, futures contracts, and options, if they enter into transactions with substantially the same effect. This section does not apply if all positions in the transaction are marked to market. Holding a long position in a notional principal contract means having the right to receive the investment yield on the property. The term 'forward contract' and 'related person' are defined in specific sections. 'Net underlying long-term capital gain' refers to the total capital gain if a financial position was acquired and sold on specific dates in a constructive ownership transaction. The net underlying long-term capital gain from a financial position is assumed to be zero unless proven otherwise. Taxpayers can elect to apply a subsection that allows them to recognize gain or loss on open constructive ownership transactions as if the related financial position was sold. Any gain or loss from a constructive ownership transaction is treated as ordinary income or loss. If gain or loss is recognized before the end of the taxable year, it will be taken into account for that year. Adjustments will be made for any subsequent gain or loss. Any gain or loss from a constructive ownership transaction is treated as ordinary income or loss. An election under this provision can be made without the Secretary's consent and applies to the year made and subsequent years unless revoked. The Secretary will prescribe necessary regulations for this section. The amendments made by this section apply to gain recognized after the enactment of this Act."
