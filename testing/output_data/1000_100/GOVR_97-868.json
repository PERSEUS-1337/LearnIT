    "content": "The Internet is a \"network of networks\" connecting millions of computers worldwide through unique IP numbers. Domain names simplify access, with TLDs like .com or .org. The DNS maps addresses to domain names using distributed databases. The Internet originated from research funding by DARPA and evolved with support from NSF and other science agencies. The DNS is managed by entities like IANA, which makes technical decisions about root servers and country code TLDs. NSF managed root servers, qualifications for TLD managers, protocol parameters, and IP address space. In 1993, NSF signed an agreement with InterNic for domain name registration. NSI became the sole registrar for .com, .net, and .org domains. Criticism grew over NSI's control and trademark disputes increased. There was a rise in trademark disputes due to the growth of registrations in the .com domain. Concerns about the legal foundation of IANA led to actions in the US and internationally. The International Ad Hoc Committee proposed creating seven new gTLDs and introducing more registrars for second level domain names. The US government formed an interagency group to evaluate the IAHC proposal. The US government formed an interagency group to address the domain name issue and assigned lead responsibility to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) of the Department of Commerce (DOC). In June 1998, DOC issued a final statement of policy, known as the White Paper, endorsing a new not-for-profit corporation to manage Internet names and addresses. The White Paper emphasized the need for stability, competition, private coordination, and fair representation in the management of Internet names and addresses. The Internet community came together in 1998 to discuss the management of Internet names and addresses. IANA and NSI proposed the creation of ICANN, which was finalized and submitted to the Department of Commerce in October 1998. A Memorandum of Understanding was signed between DOC and ICANN in November 1998 to transition management responsibility for DNS functions to a private-sector not-for-profit entity. ICANN and the Department of Commerce agreed to extend their MOU until September 30, 2006, specifying transition tasks for ICANN. In June 2005, NTIA outlined U.S. government principles on DNS, emphasizing security, authorization of root zone changes, and ICANN's role. DOC announced a new Joint Project on September 29, 2006. On September 29, 2006, the Department of Commerce (DOC) announced a new Joint Project Agreement (JPA) with ICANN to transition the coordination of technical functions related to DNS management to the private sector. The JPA focused on transparency and accountability mechanisms within ICANN. On September 30, 2009, DOC and ICANN agreed on an Affirmation of Commitments (AoC) to institutionalize global DNS coordination by a private-sector-led organization, ensuring accountability, transparency, security, stability, competition, consumer trust, choice, and international participation. ICANN is a public benefit corporation headquartered in Los Angeles, CA, organized under California Nonprofit Public Benefit Law. It has tax-exempt status and a Board of Directors advised by supporting organizations. The Board makes final policy decisions with 16 international members. ICANN is composed of a president, 15 members selected by various organizations, and non-voting liaisons. The organization's budget has significantly increased due to the growth of the Internet and domain name registration, with revenues reaching $159 million in 2015. Funding primarily comes from fees paid by registrars and registry operators. Registry operators, such as VeriSign, Inc. and Neustar, Inc., manage the master database of domain names in each top-level domain. Congressional committees oversee the Department of Commerce's management of ICANN's activities. The Department of Commerce has no statutory authority over ICANN. The Department of Commerce (DOC) has no statutory authority over ICANN or the DNS. The U.S. government originally owned and operated key components of network architecture enabling the domain name system. The 1998 Memorandum of Understanding initiated a process to transition DNS coordination to a private-sector entity. The DOC retains a role with respect to the DNS through contractual agreements with ICANN. The Department of Commerce (DOC) has agreements with ICANN and VeriSign for technical functions related to the DNS. The Affirmation of Commitments (AoC) was signed in 2009 to institutionalize global DNS coordination. The AoC has no expiration date and would only end if one party decides to terminate it. Many stakeholders debated whether the Department of Commerce should maintain control over ICANN after the JPA expiration in 2009. U.S. groups argued for continued oversight to prevent international control of the DNS, while international entities believed ICANN was ready for privatization. Senator Snowe introduced S.Res. 564 in the 110th Congress regarding ICANN's progress. The Senate acknowledged ICANN's progress in accountability and transparency but emphasized the need for further improvement. NTIA issued a Notice of Inquiry seeking public input on the JPA expiration, highlighting areas for enhancement in ICANN's institutional confidence. Key areas included long-term stability, accountability, responsiveness, private-sector leadership, stakeholder participation, contract compliance, and competition. Public comments were requested on the transition of DNS management to the private sector and ICANN's model of leadership and policy development. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce discussed the expiration of the JPA between DOC and ICANN, with most members favoring an extension or a permanent instrument to ensure ICANN's accountability to the public and stakeholders. The committee letter outlines key provisions for the permanent continuance of the DOC-ICANN relationship, including periodic reviews of ICANN performance, accountability measures, addition of new gTLDs, WHOIS information access, and ICANN remaining a not-for-profit corporation headquartered in the United States. The AoC calls for the establishment of review panels to ensure accountability, transparency, and the interests of global Internet users. The panel will evaluate ICANN governance, assess transparency, accountability, and responsiveness, and be composed of various stakeholders including the chair of ICANN's Governmental Advisory Committee, the Board of ICANN, and independent experts. Additionally, the panel will review ICANN's plan to enhance security, stability, and resiliency. The panel will review ICANN's plan to enhance the operational stability, reliability, resiliency, security, and global interoperability of the DNS. It will also examine the impact of new gTLDs on competition, consumer trust, and consumer choice. Additionally, the panel will review WHOIS policy. The panel will review existing WHOIS policy to assess its effectiveness in meeting the needs of law enforcement and promoting consumer trust. It will be composed of various stakeholders including the chair of the GAC, the CEO of ICANN, representatives of Advisory Committees and Supporting Organizations, independent experts, global law enforcement community, and privacy experts. The Accountability and Transparency Review Team (ATRT) released recommendations to improve ICANN's transparency and accountability in areas such as Board governance, GAC interaction, public input, and review mechanisms. The Board adopted all 27 ATRT recommendations in June 2011, focusing on ICANN management and staff implementing them rapidly for lasting reform. ATRT2 presented 12 new recommendations in December 2013, addressing issues from the first report. The \"IANA functions contract\" allows ICANN to manage critical technical functions related to the DNS. The DOC has authority over the root zone file, allowing the U.S. government to approve or deny changes to the DNS. The U.S. government aims to preserve the security and stability of the DNS and commits to not taking actions that could disrupt its operation. The JPA was separate from DOC agreements with ICANN and VeriSign. The expiration of the JPA and establishment of the AoC did not directly affect U.S. government authority over the DNS root zone file. NTIA awarded the IANA functions contract to ICANN through September 30, 2015, with an option to extend through September 2019. The contract includes a separation between policy development and implementation by the IANA functions contractor. The IANA functions contract awarded to ICANN by NTIA includes a conflict of interest policy, respect for local laws, and transparency requirements. The contractor must be U.S. owned and operated, with operations and systems in the U.S. NTIA has oversight authority over ICANN and the domain name system. NTIA announced its intention to transition stewardship role over key domain name functions. NTIA plans to transition its stewardship role and procedural authority over key domain name functions to the global Internet multistakeholder community. If successful, the IANA functions contract with ICANN will expire by September 30, 2015. NTIA is urging ICANN to collaborate with various global Internet stakeholders to develop a transition proposal. This includes parties directly affected by the IANA contract such as the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), the Internet Architecture Board (IAB), the Internet Society (ISOC), Regional Internet Registries (RIRs), top-level domain name operators, Verisign, and other global stakeholders. The NTIA is pushing for the globalization of ICANN and IANA functions, emphasizing equal participation of all stakeholders, including governments. NTIA requires broad community support for the transition proposal, focusing on maintaining the multistakeholder model, DNS security, global customer needs, and Internet openness. Transition supporters believe transferring authority to the global Internet community will strengthen U.S. government support. The U.S. government supports the transition of DNS authority to the global Internet community, emphasizing the multistakeholder model of Internet governance. Supporters believe this will enable the U.S. to effectively oppose intergovernmental control over the Internet. Critics express concerns about the potential loss of NTIA's oversight role in ensuring the integrity and stability of the DNS. Critics are concerned about the potential risks of foreign governments gaining influence over the DNS through the transition to a new Internet governance mechanism that no longer has U.S. government oversight. Representative Shimkus introduced H.R. 4342, the DOTCOM Act, to prevent the NTIA from relinquishing control over the Internet domain name system without a report from GAO addressing national security concerns and analyzing the advantages and disadvantages of the change. The bill also requires GAO to define the term \"multistakeholder model\" in Internet policymaking. The DOTCOM Act, H.R. 4342, was approved by the House Energy and Commerce Committee on May 8, 2014. The House Energy and Commerce Committee requested the GAO to examine the Administration's proposal to transition NTIA's authority over IANA to the multistakeholder Internet community on June 5, 2014. The text of the DOTCOM Act was offered as an amendment to H.R. 4435 on May 22, 2014, and was agreed to by a vote of 245-177. The House passed H.R. 4435 on the same day, with provisions to protect the .mil domain and its associated Internet protocol numbers. The Senate Armed Services Committee supported maintaining separation between policymaking and technical operation of root-zone management functions. They recommended transferring the remaining role of the United States Government in Internet Assigned Numbers Authority to a global multi-stakeholder community, ensuring exclusive use of '.MIL' top-level domain and Internet Protocol address numbers by the Department of Defense for national security. The Department of Defense was directed to sustain stewardship of Internet root zone servers. The committee urged DOD to ensure the .mil domain retains its status after the transition. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 was signed without the DOTCOM Act provision. Section 1639 of P.L. 113-235 emphasizes the need for assurances to protect legacy top-level domain names and IP address numbers, uphold consensus-based decision making, and ensure transparency and security in the IANA transfer process. Congress also highlights the importance of maintaining a free, open, and resilient Internet, particularly for national security purposes. The House Appropriations Committee approved H.R. 4660, the FY2015 Commerce, Justice, Science (CJS) Appropriations Act, which appropriates funds for DOC and NTIA. The bill report stated that no funds were allocated for the transition of Internet root zone servers managed by the Department of Defense. An amendment by Representative Duffy was adopted on May 30, 2014. An amendment by Representative Duffy to H.R. 4660, passed by the House on May 30, 2014, prohibits the use of funds for relinquishing NTIA's responsibility over Internet domain name system functions. The Senate Appropriations Committee directed NTIA to review any proposed transition of the IANA contract to ensure ICANN has an approved oversight plan. The committee directed NTIA to report quarterly on the privatization process and inform the committee in advance of any decisions. Concerns were raised about NTIA's advocacy for U.S. businesses and consumers in ICANN's Governmental Advisory Committee. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 was signed into law on December 16, 2014. The Appropriations Act, 2015 (P.L. 113-235) signed on December 16, 2014, prohibits NTIA from using funds for IANA transition activities until September 30, 2015. The Explanatory Statement directs NTIA to inform Congressional committees 45 days in advance of any changes to its role in ICANN or IANA activities. NTIA must report to Congress within 45 days of P.L. 113-235 enactment on potential consequences if Internet governance transition leads to harm. Proposed legislation includes H.R. 4367, H.R. 4398, and H.R. 5737, all aiming to prevent NTIA from giving up its DNS and IANA responsibilities. The DOTCOM Act of 2015 reintroduced by Representative Shimkus in the 114th Congress aims to prevent NTIA from relinquishing its responsibilities over the Internet domain name system until a report from GAO is submitted to Congress. The DOTCOM Act of 2015 reintroduced by Representative Shimkus in the 114th Congress aims to prevent NTIA from relinquishing its responsibilities over the Internet domain name system until a report from GAO is submitted to Congress, which will analyze the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed transfer, set criteria for the transfer, evaluate transfer proposals, address national security concerns, and define terms like \"multistakeholder model\" in Internet policymaking. In the Senate, S.Res. 71 was introduced by Senator Hatch on February 5, 2015, designating the week of February 8 through February 14, 2015, as \"Internet Governance Awareness Week.\" The resolution aims to increase public awareness about NTIA's proposed transition, emphasize the importance of the transition process, and highlight the need for accountability and governance reforms at ICANN. S.Res. 71 was passed by the Senate on February 5, 2015, and a hearing titled \"Preserving the Multistakeholder Model of Internet Governance\" was held by the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation on February 25, 2015, with testimony from NTIA, ICANN, and others on the transition status. ICANN has initiated a process for the multistakeholder community to reach consensus on the transition proposal for the IANA Stewardship and Enhancing ICANN Accountability. A draft proposal for the transition of NTIA's stewardship of the IANA functions includes forming a steering group composed of representatives from various ICANN constituencies and directly affected parties. The IANA Stewardship Transition Coordination Group (ICG) was formed by ICANN in response to public comments on the steering group draft proposal. The ICG, comprised of 30 individuals representing 13 communities, is responsible for coordinating the development of a transition proposal for the IANA functions. The ICG has requested proposals for the three primary IANA functions to be developed by the operational communities associated with each function. The ICG is working on developing a single consolidated proposal from three proposals on Domain Names, Number Resources, and Protocol Parameters. The Number Resources proposal was submitted on January 15, 2015, while the Protocol Parameters proposal was submitted on January 6, 2015. The Domain Names proposal is still in progress with a target submission date of June 2015. The ICG is working on consolidating proposals for Domain Names, Number Resources, and Protocol Parameters. While the Number Resources and Protocol Parameter proposals were completed in January 2015, consensus on the domain name function proposal has been challenging. The debate revolves around whether a new organization should oversee the IANA function contract or if ICANN should have enhanced accountability. ICANN is considering whether an external solution or internal solution should have authority over the IANA function. In parallel, ICANN is working on enhancing its accountability mechanisms to ensure stakeholder accountability post-IANA transition. This involves strengthening existing accountability mechanisms like the ICANN bylaws and the Affirmation of Commitments through a Cross Community Working Group (CCWG). The Cross Community Working Group (CCWG) has been formed by ICANN to enhance accountability towards stakeholders. It consists of 25 members appointed by chartering organizations, 141 participants, and up to seven advisors providing independent advice. The group will make decisions by consensus and is open to any interested person as a participant. The Cross Community Working Group (CCWG) is working on two interrelated Work Streams to enhance ICANN's accountability. Work Stream 1 focuses on mechanisms that must be in place by September 30, 2015, while Work Stream 2 addresses accountability topics with a longer timeline. If approved by CCWG chartering organizations, an accountability proposal will be submitted to the ICANN Board for approval or modification. The Workstream 1 proposal is set to be submitted to the ICANN Board in June 2015, while Workstream 2 will follow after the ICANN 54 meeting in October 2015. NTIA's approval is required for the multistakeholder community proposal for the transition. NTIA will not use appropriated funds to terminate the IANA functions contract with ICANN before September 30, 2015. The NTIA will not use appropriated funds to amend the cooperative agreement with Verisign before September 30, 2015. Congress expects NTIA to actively monitor the transition process and participate in discussions with ICANN, Verisign, and other stakeholders. NTIA will provide regular reports to Congress on the transition. The Advisory Committee supports an open and participatory multistakeholder process for the transition of IANA functions. They emphasize the importance of developing a well-thought-out plan that addresses all concerns. Administrator Strickling urges the CWG-Stewardship group to consider all transition proposal models and ensure accountability in any new organizational structures. NTIA emphasizes the need for stress testing proposed solutions to safeguard against future contingencies and ensure accountability in ICANN. They encourage addressing questions on board member removal, improving accountability tools, and syncing transition processes. NTIA will only consider a coordinated and complete transition plan. ICANN is an international organization that operates globally, with a diverse Board of Directors and constituency groups. The Governmental Advisory Committee provides advice on public policy matters. NTIA aims to receive a transition plan in the summer, with flexibility to extend the contract if needed. The ICANN Board considers GAC advice but is not obligated to follow it. There are calls for the U.S. government to relinquish control over ICANN and DNS to a higher intergovernmental body. The UN's WGIG report in 2005 recommended no single government should dominate international Internet governance. The report proposed further internationalization of Internet governance and suggested creating a new global forum for stakeholders. It presented four models, including ones where ICANN would be replaced or overseen by a higher intergovernmental body. The U.S. and the 109th Congress opposed transferring control of the domain name system from ICANN to an international body. The EU initially supported the U.S. position but later reconsidered during preparatory meetings in September 2005. The EU initially supported the U.S. position but shifted towards favoring an enhanced international role in governing the Internet. Conflict at the WSIS Tunis Summit was averted by an Internet governance agreement announced in November 2005. ICANN and the United States maintained their roles in the domain name system, while the Internet Governance Forum (IGF) was formed under the U.N. to provide a forum for stakeholders to discuss Internet policy issues. The IGF does not have binding authority and was renewed by the U.N. General Assembly in December 2010. In 2010, the U.N. General Assembly renewed the Internet Governance Forum (IGF) for another five years and tasked the U.N.'s Commission on Science and Technology for Development (CSTD) to develop a report on improvements. A Working Group on Improvements to the IGF was formed, including 22 governments and Internet stakeholder groups. Controversies arose in 2010 and 2011 regarding new generic top-level domains (gTLDs) and the addition of the .xxx TLD, leading to debates on increased government influence on ICANN policy decisions. Some nations advocated for an enhanced role for the Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC) on ICANN policy decisions. Some nations proposed creating an Internet policy development entity within the U.N. system to oversee existing bodies like ICANN. Another group suggested a voluntary \"International Code of Conduct for Information Security\" for discussion in the U.N. General Assembly, promoting multilateral management of the Internet. The World Conference on International Telecommunications (WCIT) was held in Dubai on December 3-14, 2012 by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) to revise the International Telecommunications Regulations (ITRs) to address governance of the Internet and ensure its stable and secure functioning. The WCIT in Dubai aimed to update the 24-year-old ITRs to include Internet governance. The US government advocated for the ITRs to focus on traditional telecommunications traffic and not extend control over the Internet. Concerns arose in Congress about potential intergovernmental control over the Internet at the WCIT. H.Con.Res. 127 and S.Con.Res. 50 were introduced in Congress to preserve the multistakeholder governance model of the Internet and promote a global Internet free from government control. H.Con.Res. 127 passed unanimously in the House, while S.Con.Res. 50 was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations in the Senate. The sense of Congress is to promote a global Internet free from government control and preserve the multistakeholder model. S.Con.Res. 50 was passed unanimously by the Senate and House, with a proposal during the WCIT seeking to extend ITR jurisdiction over Internet governance. The proposal stated Member States' sovereign right to establish public policy on Internet governance, including managing resources. It was withdrawn, but a nonbinding resolution was adopted by the ITU to promote an enabling environment for Internet growth. Resolution 3 emphasizes equal government roles in international Internet governance and encourages discussions on technical and policy issues within the ITU mandate. The United States declined to sign the treaty at the WCIT in Dubai due to Resolution 3 and new ITR articles related to spam and cybersecurity. The international debate over Internet governance is expected to continue, with the 113th Congress likely monitoring and opposing any future proposals for intergovernmental control over the Internet. H.R. 1580 was introduced to affirm the U.S. policy regarding Internet governance, similar to previous congressional resolutions. H.R. 1580 affirms the U.S. policy on Internet governance, emphasizing the multistakeholder model. It was passed unanimously by the House of Representatives in 2013. Global leaders called for strengthening multistakeholder cooperation to prevent Internet fragmentation and address concerns over surveillance. Global leaders recognized the need for ongoing efforts in Internet Governance, aiming to involve all stakeholders equally. A summit was planned in Brazil to address these challenges, leading to the NETmundial meeting in 2014 to craft Internet governance principles. The NETmundial meeting in 2014 focused on crafting Internet governance principles and proposing a roadmap for the evolution of the Internet governance ecosystem. The outcome was a nonbinding \"NETmundial Multistakeholder Statement\" reaffirming the multistakeholder model, endorsing the transition of IANA functions to the global community, and emphasizing human rights in a free and open Internet. On November 17, 2013, ICANN announced the formation of a Panel on the Future of Global Internet Governance. On November 17, 2013, ICANN formed a Panel on the Future of Global Internet Cooperation, involving stakeholders from various sectors. The Panel released a report in May 2014 outlining principles and frameworks for global Internet cooperation. In August 2014, the NETmundial Initiative for Internet Governance Cooperation and Development was announced by the World Economic Forum in collaboration with ICANN and other stakeholders. The NETmundial Initiative aims to apply principles for Internet cooperation and governance. The ITU's Plenipotentiary Conference in 2014 did not expand its role in Internet governance, as feared by the U.S. delegation. Top Level Domains (TLDs) are suffixes at the end of web addresses, like .com or .org. ICANN manages the creation of new gTLDs, with 22 currently in operation. Organizations apply to become registries for new gTLDs, setting up name servers and registration processes. ICANN initiated a process to introduce an indefinite number of new gTLDs into the domain name system, with rules and procedures developed between 2005 and 2011. The new gTLD program was approved in 2011, allowing for potentially hundreds of new gTLDs to be introduced. Applications were accepted from January to April 2012. Applications for new gTLDs were accepted from January 12 to April 12, 2012, with a fee of $185,000 required. The approval of the new gTLD program by ICANN has sparked controversy among trademark holders and governments due to concerns over higher costs, trademark protection, and combating cybercrimes. Governments advocated for additional intellectual property protections and more stringent rules to better protect consumers in the new domain space. ICANN faced strong opposition from trademark holders and some parts of the U.S. government in late 2011 regarding the gTLD expansion. Despite criticism, ICANN defended the program, stating it would offer more protections for consumers and trademark holders, promote competition and innovation in the domain name system. Ultimately, ICANN proceeded with the new gTLD program without delay. ICANN opened the application window for new gTLDs on January 12, 2012, receiving 1,930 applications by June 13, 2012. The evaluation phase began, with decisions on acceptance pending. The approval process could take 9 to 20 months, depending on various factors. ICANN introduced new gTLDs into the DNS system, with rules outlined in the Applicant Guidebook. Over 500 gTLDs are active, with more in the evaluation process. Concerns exist about potential abuse in new gTLD spaces, prompting changes for future rounds. The effectiveness of ICANN's approach to addressing intellectual property protection and unlawful behavior in new gTLD domain spaces is of interest as the program progresses. Legislation in the 107th Congress created a \"kids-friendly\" top-level domain for age-appropriate content, while also considering the establishment of an adult content top-level domain. In past Congresses, bills were introduced to establish a mandatory top-level domain for material harmful to minors, but they did not advance. ICANN considered allowing a top-level domain for adult content and entered negotiations for a \".xxx\" domain in 2005. The Department of Commerce requested more time for ICANN to address concerns about the proposed .xxx domain for adult websites. The ICANN Board authorized negotiations with ICM Registry to resolve objections raised. The ICANN Board voted against accepting the proposed .xxx domain agreement but did not rule out a revised agreement. ICANN later published a revised agreement for public comment, but ultimately denied the .xxx domain citing reluctance to manage Internet content. ICM Registry challenged ICANN's decision before an Independent Review Panel, which ruled in favor of ICM Registry in 2010. The International Centre for Dispute Resolution ruled in favor of ICM Registry for the .xxx TLD application, stating that ICANN's reversal was not consistent with fair policy. The ICANN Board later voted to allow ICM's .xxx application to proceed, with next steps including due diligence and negotiations for a registry agreement. The ICANN Board approved ICM Registry's .xxx TLD application after a ruling in favor of ICM by the International Centre for Dispute Resolution. This decision led to due diligence, negotiations for a registry agreement, and consultation with ICANN's Governmental Advisory Committee. Despite conflicts with GAC advice, the Board intended to proceed with the registry agreement, but ultimately, a mutually acceptable solution was not reached. On March 18, 2011, the ICANN Board approved the .xxx TLD registry agreement with ICM, allowing the domain to be available in December 2011. Concerns about DNS vulnerabilities led to the development of DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) to ensure the validity of transmitted information. DNSSEC was developed to mitigate vulnerabilities in DNS. \"Signing the root\" is a critical step in protecting against malicious attacks. NTIA sought public comments on deploying DNSSEC in the root zone. NTIA, NIST, ICANN, and VeriSign collaborated on an interim approach for DNSSEC deployment. NTIA filed a notice for public comments on testing and evaluation of DNSSEC implementation in the root zone. The implementation of system security extensions in the authoritative root zone was published by ICANN on July 15, 2010. DNSSEC must be adopted voluntarily by registries, registrars, and DNS server operators worldwide to enhance protection against fraudulent DNS redirection. The accessibility of WHOIS database information has been a contentious issue, with privacy advocates calling for limitations while businesses, intellectual property interests, law enforcement agencies, and the U.S. government support broader access. ICANN debated the accessibility of WHOIS information through its GNSO, which approved a narrow technical definition for public display. Privacy advocates, registries, registrars, and non-commercial users supported this definition, while intellectual property interests, businesses, ISPs, law enforcement, and the Department of Commerce favored a broader definition. At ICANN's June 2006 meeting, opponents urged reconsideration of limiting access to WHOIS data. The GNSO deferred a decision on WHOIS database privacy on October 31, 2007, recommending more studies and rejecting a proposal for third-party contact information. Currently, the GNSO is conducting extensive studies on WHOIS. In June 2011, ICANN initiated four separate studies of WHOIS recommended by the Governmental Advisory Committee in 2008. Additionally, a WHOIS policy review team began its first review on October 1, 2010. The WHOIS policy review team started its first review on October 1, 2010, and issued a final report on May 11, 2012, with 16 recommendations for strengthening WHOIS. The ICANN Board approved a resolution on November 8, 2012, to redefine the purpose of collecting gTLD registration data. An Expert Working Group released recommendations for a next-generation Registration Directory Service on June 6, 2014. ICANN is currently working on implementing these recommendations. The ownership and registration of domain names have raised intellectual property concerns. The White Paper called for WIPO to develop recommendations for trademark/domain name dispute resolutions, adopted by ICANN in August 1999. A dispute resolution policy was implemented on December 9, 1999, to address abusive registrations through a special administrative procedure. The Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy started on December 9, 1999, alongside the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act passed by the 106th Congress. This act allows courts to order the forfeiture, cancellation, or transfer of domain names registered in \"bad faith\" related to trademarks, with potential civil damages ranging from $1,000 to $100,000 per domain name. The addition of new generic top-level domain names by ICANN has sparked debates on intellectual property issues, with concerns raised by trademark holders, industry groups, and governments about potential trademark protection costs. Domain names are also being considered as a tool to combat online content piracy. In the 112th Congress, bills like PROTECT IP and SOPA aimed to combat online piracy by restricting Internet traffic to infringing content. ICANN's decisions on DNS management impact various policy issues like intellectual property, privacy, and cybersecurity. The transfer of DNS management to the private sector raises questions on achieving Internet stability, security, competition, and fair representation. The debate over ICANN policymaking involves questions of competition, private vs. governmental influence, and fair representation of the global Internet community. Some governments seek increased control over Internet policies, while defenders of the multistakeholder model argue for a bottom-up, consensus approach to foster Internet growth. The 114th Congress will closely examine NTIA's proposed transition of authority over ICANN and the DNS to a multistakeholder-driven entity. Congress will assess if the transition is in the best interest of the United States and the Internet, monitor the development of a transition plan, and ensure a stable, secure, and open DNS post-transition. Congress will also evaluate the role of intergovernmental telecommunications conferences in the future. Intergovernmental telecommunications conferences pose a threat to internet governance, and NTIA and other government agencies are working to counteract this. The outcome of these issues could significantly impact the evolution of ICANN, the DNS, and the Internet."
