    "content": "In January 2004, federal white-collar employees received a 4.1% pay adjustment under H.R. 2673, signed into law by President George Bush. President Bush signed H.R. 2673 into law on January 23, 2004, providing a 2.1% pay adjustment to federal civilian employees. Executive Order 13332 issued on March 3, 2004, allocated an average 1.2% annual and 0.9% locality pay increase. OPM published revised salary tables on March 4, 2004, showing recommended locality payments and net pay increases for federal employees. FEPCA adjustments, not cost-of-living adjustments, have not been fully implemented. In 2003, federal white-collar employees received a 4.1% combined annual and locality pay adjustment. In 2004, they also received a 4.1% adjustment. If specified by FEPCA, the net pay increase would have been higher in both years. The report discusses the annual adjustment and locality payments for federal employees under the General Schedule, Foreign Service Schedule, and Veterans Health Administration Schedule. The annual pay adjustment is based on the Employment Cost Index (ECI) and may vary for different positions within the federal government. The annual pay adjustment for federal employees is based on the Employment Cost Index (ECI) and may vary for different positions within the government. The pay rates are increased by 0.5 percentage points less than the ECI percentage, with the adjustment effective at the beginning of each calendar year. The President can issue an alternative plan in case of a national emergency or serious economic conditions, which must be submitted to Congress before September 1. President Bush issued an alternative plan for a 1.5% annual pay adjustment in January 2004, implemented by Executive Order 13322 on December 30, 2003. GS employees receive locality-based comparability payments, extended to other positions as well. OPM clarified limitations for non-General Schedule employees in December 2001. Blue-collar workers under the Federal Wage System receive a prevailing rate adjustment. Blue-collar workers under the Federal Wage System receive a prevailing rate adjustment, capped at the average pay adjustment for white-collar employees. In 2004, blue-collar pay in certain locations will not be less than the increase for GS employees in that area. Special rate employees receive the higher of special rate or locality payment. Law enforcement officers under Section 403 of FEPCA receive both special rates and locality pay. Federal employees in Alaska, Hawaii, and outside the continental US receive a cost-of-living allowance instead of locality pay. FEPCA established locality-based comparability payments to address pay disparities greater than 5% within each locality for GS employees. The President can adjust these payments in case of a national emergency or serious economic conditions. A report must be submitted to Congress at least one month before any alternative payments are made. President Bush issued an alternative plan on August 27, 2003, for a 0.5% locality pay adjustment in January 2004, implemented by Executive Order 13322 on December 30, 2003. The Bureau of Labor Statistics conducts surveys to document non-federal pay rates in 32 pay areas nationwide. The surveys transitioned from the Occupational Compensation Survey Program to the National Compensation Survey program for locality payments starting in January 2004. In January 2004, a phase-in of NCS survey data for locality payments was approved by OPM to reduce the disparity between non-federal and federal salaries to 5% as mandated by FEPCA. OPM compares salaries in each pay area and closes a certain percentage of the pay gap each year. In 1994, 20% of the pay gap was closed, with an additional 10% to be closed each year thereafter. However, the actual closure percentages were lower each year. By January 2002, FEPCA mandated that pay disparities should be reduced to 5% in each pay area. The Pay Agent uses data from surveys to determine locality rates recommended to the President. The gaps used for locality payments are 22 months old by the adjustment date. NCS surveys were not used for some previous locality payments, but are being phased in. The March 2002 gaps were determined using OCSP and NCS survey data. The Federal Salary Council explained how pay gaps were determined for locality payments in 2004, aging survey data to a common reference date before comparing it to GS pay data. The overall gap between GS average salaries was reported as of March 2002. The Federal Salary Council reported in March 2002 that the overall gap between GS average salaries and non-federal average salaries was 32.02%. To reduce this disparity to 5% as mandated by FEPCA, recommended locality pay raises ranged from 19.45% to 47.64% in different pay areas for 2004. Comparing 2003 locality payments with those recommended for 2004 resulted in recommended increases ranging from 11.90% to 25.23% nationwide. The Federal Salary Council recommended locality pay raises ranging from 19.45% to 47.64% in different pay areas for 2004 to reduce the gap between GS and non-federal average salaries. The nationwide average net pay increase would have been 15.15% if ECI and locality-based comparability payments were granted as required by law. The council recommended that areas with pay gaps below RUS receive the same adjustment as RUS, and areas with low publishability and pay gaps below RUS for three surveys were to be included in 2004. The Council recommended not dropping locations like Indianapolis, Kansas City, Orlando, and St. Louis as separate pay areas at this time. The basic criteria for determining pay areas were established in 1993 and remain unchanged. The Council plans to review new data before making changes to locality pay area definitions. The Council recommended an exception for Barnstable County, MA, which is seeking to become part of the Boston pay area due to not being in a separate locality pay area and lacking 2,000 GS employees. The Council voted to address this issue at its October 1 meeting. The Council recommended including Barnstable County, MA, in the Boston locality pay area in 2004 to address the lack of a separate locality pay area and insufficient GS employees. St. Mary's County, MD, was also recommended to be included in the Washington, DC-Baltimore, MD, pay area for 2004. Santa Barbara County, CA, and New London, CT, have been included in their respective pay areas since 1994 and 1998, despite falling below the employee threshold. The council recommended that New London and Santa Barbara continue to be areas of application for their respective pay areas for 2004. Monterey County, CA, is recommended to be included in the San Francisco pay area in 2004. In 2001, Rhode Island was designated as part of the Boston pay area due to its small county size. The state is treated as a single county and meets the criteria for continued inclusion in 2004. The criteria for federal facilities crossing pay area boundaries is also discussed. In 2001, Rhode Island was included in the Boston pay area as a single county. The criteria for federal facilities crossing pay area boundaries were discussed, with a focus on the employment criteria for inclusion in pay areas. Edwards Air Force Base, despite not meeting the employment criteria, was recommended to remain in the Los Angeles pay area in 2004. The council recommended improvements in the BLS National Compensation Survey program. The progress report on 2004 locality payments includes improvements in assigning federal grade levels to non-federal jobs, development of a four-factor evaluation system by OPM, and implementation of an econometric model by BLS to estimate salaries for jobs not randomly selected in surveys. OPM also worked on improving the matching of federal survey jobs with non-federal survey jobs. The working group developed a crosswalk between Federal job classifications and the new Standard Occupational Classification System. BLS used the new crosswalk and March 2001 GS employment weights for data delivery. Additional improvements could be made in the crosswalk, and OPM is expected to provide updated GS employment information to BLS annually. For supervisory occupations, grade the highest level of work supervised and adjust the grade level based on the level of supervision. BLS and Pay Agent staffs have designed a new approach based on grading the highest level of work supervised and adding one, two, or three grades based on the level of supervision. Final tests of the new approach are to be conducted in the fall, with implementation planned for surveys in December 2003. Criteria are being developed to identify and exclude jobs classified above GS-15 in government. The BLS has developed methods to identify and exclude non-Federal jobs classified above GS-15. The council recommended caution in using NCS data for locality payments and suggested improvements by BLS to increase sample size in certain localities. The OPM published final regulations in 2003 regarding the definitions of metropolitan areas for locality pay areas, which no longer change automatically. OMB revised definitions for Metropolitan Statistical Areas in 2003, but OPM advised that it would not immediately impact the General Schedule locality pay program. The Federal Salary Council and the President's Pay Agent reviewed new statistical area definitions in 2003, which differed from previous definitions used in the locality pay program. Changes included the introduction of 'Micropolitan Statistical Areas' and 'Combined Statistical Areas' in place of 'Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Areas'. Population density was no longer a criterion for defining locality pay areas. The Federal Salary Council reviewed new statistical area definitions in 2003, including the introduction of Micropolitan and Combined Statistical Areas. Population density was no longer a criterion for defining locality pay areas. The Council discussed using the new definitions for the locality pay program, with further study needed before any decisions were made. The Federal Salary Council reviewed new statistical area definitions in 2003, recommending the adoption of new MSA definitions for locality pay areas. Changes in MSAs were attributed to demographic shifts and criteria adjustments. The working group suggested using Combined Statistical Areas for pay adjustments in January 2005, expanding pay area definitions in some regions. The Federal Salary Council recommended adopting new MSA definitions for locality pay areas in 2003, with changes attributed to demographic shifts. The working group suggested using Combined Statistical Areas for pay adjustments in January 2005, expanding coverage in some regions. Additionally, three pay areas with gaps below RUS were proposed to be folded into RUS to save resources for surveying other areas. The council's recommendations were tentatively approved by the Pay Agent and the President for the January 2005 pay adjustments. The Congress prohibited the use of funds to disestablish any pay locality in the Transportation/Treasury bill. Representative Farr and Senator Jack Reed proposed amendments to address pay reductions for federal employees in Monterey County, California. Senator Reed's amendment was agreed to by the Senate during consideration of the appropriations bill. The amendment under Section 646 of the bill prohibited the removal of any area within a locality pay area. H.R. 2989 was incorporated into the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004. Section 644 of the conference agreement stated that funds could not be used to enforce regulations inconsistent with the Federal Salary Council's recommendations. This provision became Section 644 of P.L. 108-199 on January 23, 2004. The Pay Agent submitted its annual report on locality payments to the President on December 5, 2002. Due to the national emergency and economic slowdown, they recommended against implementing the proposed pay increases for January 2004. They suggested exploring alternative compensation approaches for Federal employees. The Pay Agent's report recommended against implementing proposed pay increases for January 2004 due to the national emergency and economic slowdown. The cost of locality-based comparability payments in January 2004 would be $8.830 billion to reduce pay disparity. The Pay Agent did not adopt the council's recommendation to include Barnstable County, Massachusetts in the Boston locality pay area. The Pay Agent's report in 2003 addressed improvements in the BLS National Compensation Survey Program, including new commuting patterns data and metropolitan area definitions based on the 2000 census. The Pay Agent looked forward to reviewing the results of the NCS data in the following year and encouraged expedited completion of remaining improvements. President George W. Bush's administration proposed a 2.0% federal civilian pay adjustment in the FY2004 budget. The statutory annual pay adjustment required in January 2004 is 2.7%. If the President wants to change the required rate of the annual adjustment, he must submit an alternative plan. Pay Agent staff are urged to expedite the completion of remaining improvements. The President issued an alternative plan on August 27, 2003, proposing a 2.0% pay adjustment in January 2004, with 1.5% annual and 0.5% locality pay. The cost of the adjustment was estimated at $2 billion. Executive Order 13322, issued on December 30, 2003, implemented the plan. The President's alternative plan proposed a 2.0% pay adjustment in January 2004, costing $2 billion. Executive Order 13322, issued on December 30, 2003, implemented the plan, including a $500 million Human Capital Performance Fund to reward high-performing employees. The fund was authorized by Section 1129 of P.L. 108-136. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended an appropriation of $2.5 million for the fund in H.R. 2989. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended an appropriation for a performance pay plan in Bill 2004, contingent upon approval from OPM. The Senate Committee on Appropriations did not recommend an appropriation for the fund, believing it should be managed within individual agencies. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended an appropriation of $1 million for the Human Capital Performance Fund, contingent upon approval from OPM. Funding was not provided in H.R. 2989 as passed by the Senate, but was incorporated into H.R. 2673, the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004. The obligation or transfer of funds was dependent on the establishment of the fund within OPM, with approval required from relevant subcommittees before funds could be allocated to any federal agency. The OPM Director may transfer amounts to federal agencies for performance payplans, enacted in P.L. 108-199. President's alternative plan includes a 2% pay raise proposal, with concerns about unfunded raises leading to hiring freezes. Federal employee union representatives express discouragement. National Commission on the Public Service recommended abolishing the General Schedule classification system due to maintenance costs. The National Commission on the Public Service recommended abolishing the General Schedule system due to the resources and effort needed for maintenance and the constant tinkering required for equal pay. They proposed a broad-band system with fewer pay grades, allowing managers to set pay based on competence and performance. Various agencies are already implementing pay banding systems, with the possibility of different forms being adopted by other agencies. Salaries for certain employees are adjusted to match federal bank examiners in P.L. 107-123. New HRM systems for civilian employees in Homeland Security and Defense are authorized in P.L. 107-296 and P.L. 108-136. Changes to pay setting systems at both agencies will include broad pay bands. Congress annually determines federal white-collar pay adjustments, which may differ from the President's recommendations. In 2002 and January 2003, Congress set overall pay adjustment amounts. Resolutions in Senate and House expressed the need for parity between military and civilian pay increases. These resolutions are nonbinding and do not require the President's signature. Members of Congress from the Washington, DC area wrote letters to President Bush and House Committee on the Budget expressing their views. The House Committee on the Budget was urged to support equal pay raises for federal civilian employees and the military in the FY2004 budget. The House passed the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for FY2004, emphasizing the need for compensation parity between civilian employees and members of the uniformed services. The Senate Committee on the Budget, on March 14, 2003, included the same language as the House in a Sense of the Senate provision in the Concurrent Budget Resolution. This resolution serves as a framework for Congress to consider spending legislation. The Departments of Transportation and Treasury and Independent Agencies Appropriations Bill, 2004 (H.R. 2989), proposes a 4.1% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees, including those in the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security. The House Subcommittee approved H.R. 2989 for consideration by the full committee, which included a 4.1% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees. The House Appropriations Committee ordered the bill to be reported favorably to the House of Representatives, with the pay adjustment language included in Section 740(a). The House passed a bill with a 4.1% pay increase for federal civilian employees, despite opposition from the Bush Administration. The Administration proposed a 2.0% raise, citing the need for fiscal responsibility during economic challenges. Additionally, a Human Capital Performance Fund was suggested to reward high-performing federal employees. The Administration is concerned about unfunded civilian pay raises costing DOD $660 million and Government-wide $2.1 billion. The bill does not fund the President's request for a $500 million Human Capital Performance Fund. The 4.1% pay adjustment in the bill exceeds inflation and private-sector pay increases but does not address Federal employee turnover. The 4.1% pay adjustment in the bill exceeds inflation and private-sector pay increases but does not address Federal employee turnover. Providing a 4.1% pay adjustment for civilian employees in the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security would limit the flexibility of those agencies as they design new personnel and pay systems. S. 1589, the Senate version of the Transportation/Treasury appropriations bill, would provide a 4.1% pay adjustment. The full committee approved a 4.1% pay adjustment bill on a 29-0 roll call vote on September 4, 2003. Section 636 of the bill would provide the pay adjustment, and Section 502 would ensure that the increase is absorbed within appropriated levels. An amendment was made to the bill on October 23, 2003, to include a 4.1% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees in the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security. The Senate passed H.R. 2989, amended, on a 91 to 3 vote on October 23, 2003. The Federal Salary Council recommended a 4.1% pay adjustment to be allocated as a 2.7% annual pay adjustment and a 1.4% locality pay adjustment. H.R. 2989 was incorporated into the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004. The House and Senate agreed to the conference report on January 22, 2004. The conference report on H.R. 2989, passed on January 22, 2004, provided a 4.1% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees, effective from January 1, 2004. President Bush signed the bill into law as P.L. 108-199, which also included an additional 2.1% pay adjustment for federal employees. President Bush issued Executive Order 13332 on March 3, 2004, allocating a 4.1% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees, with 1.2% annual and 0.9% locality increases. The cost of the adjustment is approximately $4.1 billion. OPM released revised salary tables for 2004 the next day. The Federal Salary Council and Pay Agent recommendations for the January 2005 pay adjustments are discussed in CRS Report RL32355. Congress could consider amending FEPCA to address the federal white-collar pay-setting system. The Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act (FEPCA) aims to reduce the salary disparity between non-federal and federal employees to 5%. However, as of 2004, the average pay gap is 25.73%. The methodology for setting federal pay adjustments has been questioned since FEPCA's enactment in 1993. Congress could consider amending FEPCA to address the pay disparity issue. The methodology for setting federal pay adjustments has been criticized since FEPCA's enactment in 1993. Concerns were raised about data completeness, credibility of gaps, and the uniform adjustment for all jobs in a locality. Despite these concerns, no changes were proposed to FEPCA. The Bureau of Labor Statistics surveys were not approved for determining locality payments in 2000-2003, leading to the use of aged data from 1995 and 1996. Congress directed the President's Pay Agent to prepare a report on this issue in P.L. 106-554. The President's Pay Agent was directed to prepare a report for Congress on methodological concerns regarding federal pay adjustments. Improvements to the survey methodology are being made, and a white paper on compensation was issued in April 2002. A study by the Congressional Budget Office in November 2002 compared federal General Schedule employee salaries with nonfederal employees in similar jobs. The Congressional Budget Office compared federal employees' salaries in different occupations with those in private firms. Results showed that federal employees in professional and administrative roles generally earned less than their private counterparts, with 85% lagging by over 20%. However, 30% of federal employees in technical and clerical positions had salaries higher than private sector workers. Overall, technical and clerical jobs had smaller pay differences, with 75% of federal employees in these roles earning salaries within 10% of private sector levels. This analysis highlighted concerns about the lack of pay variation in the federal system. The federal paysystem lacks variation in pay raises by occupation, leading to disparities in salaries compared to the private sector. Granting the same percentage raise to all workers results in above-market salaries for some groups and below-market salaries for others, especially for jobs with the greatest pay disadvantage in the federal workforce. This undermines the aim of providing comparable federal pay to nonfederal jobs. The federal workforce saw a shift towards professional and administrative occupations from 1985 to 2000. The cost of implementing FEPCA is a concern, with estimates of $8.830 billion for locality-based comparability payments in January 2004. Unions advocate for pay parity between federal civilian employees and the military, criticizing the President's proposal for disregarding FEPCA. AFGE highlights issues with upholding FEPCA due to problems with the Department of Labor's methodology. The Employees Pay Comparability Act (FEPCA) faces challenges with the Department of Labor's methodology in determining federal pay comparability with the private sector. The methodological problems have expanded to the Employment Cost Index (ECI) component, in addition to the locality component. The President's efforts to eliminate the locality component have been ongoing, with concerns raised by unions about pay parity between federal civilian employees and the military. The President's Pay Agent recommended adjustments for January 2004, but due to the national emergency and economic slowdown, locality pay increases were not implemented. Executive Order 13322 provided a 1.5% annual pay adjustment and a 0.5% locality-based comparability payment. Executive Order 13332 further adjusted certain rates of pay. The Executive Order 13332 provides a 2.1% pay adjustment for 2004, with 1.2% annual adjustment and 0.9% locality-based comparability payment. Pay rates are calculated by increasing the basic General Schedule (GS) by the annual adjustment percentage and then adding the locality payment. The resulting pay rates are compared with 2003 rates to determine the net increase in pay for 2004. Salary tables for 2004 can be found online. MSA refers to Metropolitan Statistical Area and CMSA refers to Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area."
