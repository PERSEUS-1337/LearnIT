An alternative approach is adding noise directly to the agent's parameters for more consistent exploration. Combining parameter noise with traditional RL methods benefits both off- and on-policy methods. Exploration is a key challenge in deep RL to prevent premature convergence to local optima. Exploration in deep reinforcement learning is crucial to prevent premature convergence to local optima. Various methods have been proposed to enhance exploration, including adding temporally-correlated noise and parameter noise to the agent's parameters. These approaches aim to increase the variety of behaviors exhibited by the policy. This paper explores combining parameter space noise with deep RL algorithms like DQN, DDPG, and TRPO to improve exploratory behavior. Results show that parameter noise outperforms traditional action space noise in sparse reward environments for both discrete and continuous tasks. The standard RL framework involves an agent interacting with a fully observable environment modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP). The agent's goal is to maximize the expected discounted return by following a policy parametrized by \u03b8. Off-policy RL methods enable learning from captured data for experimental evaluation. Off-policy RL methods, such as Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG), allow learning from data collected by different policies. DQN uses a neural network to estimate the optimal Q-value function, while DDPG is suitable for continuous action spaces and employs an actor-critic approach. Both algorithms update their models using off-policy data to improve performance. Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) is an on-policy method that improves upon traditional policy gradient methods by using the natural gradient direction. It requires updating function approximators according to the currently followed policy, in contrast to off-policy algorithms like DDPG. TRPO aims to maximize the critic's estimated Q-values by back-propagating through both networks and utilizes a stochastic policy for exploration through action space noise. Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) improves upon traditional policy gradient methods by computing an ascent direction that ensures a small change in the policy distribution. It solves a constrained optimization problem using discounted state-visitation frequencies and advantage functions. Policies are represented as parameterized functions, typically neural networks, with structured exploration achieved through additive Gaussian noise sampling. State-dependent exploration involves perturbing the parameter vector of the current policy with Gaussian noise. This perturbed policy is sampled at the beginning of each episode and kept fixed throughout the rollout. The difference between action space noise and parameter space noise is highlighted, showing that action space noise leads to different actions for the same state, while parameter space noise perturbs the policy parameters at the beginning of each episode. Perturbing deep neural networks with spherical Gaussian noise can ensure consistency in actions and introduce a dependence between state and exploratory action. Salimans et al. (2017) demonstrated a reparameterization technique that allows for meaningful perturbations in networks, using layer normalization to maintain consistency across different layers. Adaptive noise scaling in parameter space is crucial for maintaining consistency in deep neural networks. The scale of parameter space noise needs to be adjusted over time to account for changes in network sensitivity. This adjustment is based on the variance in action space induced by the noise, ensuring effective perturbations for improved learning. Parameter space noise can be adjusted based on a threshold value, with a scaling factor \u03b1 and threshold value \u03b4. In off-policy methods, noise is applied for exploration and training, while in on-policy methods, noise can be incorporated using an adapted policy gradient. The expected return of a stochastic policy can be expanded using likelihood ratios and the re-parametrization trick for N samples. Parameter space noise exploration is compared against evolution strategies for deep policies in sparse reward environments. Reference implementations of DQN and DDPG with adaptive parameter space noise are available online. The added value of parameter space noise is compared to action space noise in high-dimensional environments. DQN is used for discrete environments, while DDPG and TRPO are used for continuous tasks. Parameter noise is adjusted based on KL divergence for fair comparison. In high-dimensional environments, parameter space noise is compared to action space noise. Parameter perturbation involves reparametrizing the network to represent an explicit policy \u03c0 for more meaningful changes. The policy \u03c0 predicts a probability distribution over actions, trained separately from the Q-network according to standard DQN practices. Parameter space noise is trained to maximize the probability of outputting the greedy action based on the current Q-network. It is compared against regular DQN and two-headed DQN with -greedy exploration. Random actions are sampled for the first 50 thousand timesteps to fill the replay buffer before training. Combining parameter space noise with a bit of action space noise yields better results. Experimental details are provided in Section A.1, with 21 games of varying complexity tested. The study presented by BID4 compares the performance of parameter space noise and action space noise in training agents for various games. Results show that parameter space noise often outperforms action space noise, especially on games requiring consistency. Learning progress starts sooner with parameter space noise. Comparison with a double-headed version of DQN confirms the effectiveness of parameter space noise. Parameter space noise is effective for improved exploration, especially in games requiring consistency like Montezuma's Revenge. However, more sophisticated exploration methods like BID4 may be necessary for extremely challenging games. Proposed improvements to DQN such as double DQN, prioritized experience replay, and dueling networks are likely to further enhance results. Experimental validation of combining parameter space noise with exploration methods is suggested for future work. In this study, parameter noise is compared with action noise in continuous control environments using DDPG as the RL algorithm. Different noise configurations are evaluated, including no noise, uncorrelated additive Gaussian action space noise, correlated additive Gaussian action space noise, and adaptive parameter space noise. The scale of parameter space noise is adjusted to match the effects of Gaussian action space noise. The study compares parameter noise with action noise in continuous control environments using DDPG as the RL algorithm. Different noise configurations are evaluated, including uncorrelated Gaussian action space noise. Performance is assessed on various tasks, with HalfCheetah showing that parameter space noise outperforms other exploration schemes by avoiding local optima and achieving higher returns. Parameter space noise outperforms correlated action space noise in the environment, indicating a significant difference. DDPG can learn good policies even without noise, suggesting well-shaped reward functions in the environments. Adding parameter noise in Walker2D decreases performance variance between seeds, aiding in escaping local optima. In this section, the effectiveness of parameter noise in enabling RL algorithms to learn in environments with sparse rewards is evaluated using a toy problem with a chain of states. The agent receives small rewards in the initial state and larger rewards in the final state, with increasing difficulty as the chain length increases. Different algorithms are compared across varying chain lengths to assess their performance. The effectiveness of parameter noise in enabling RL algorithms to learn in environments with sparse rewards is evaluated using a toy problem with a chain of states. The chain length N is varied, and different seeds are trained and evaluated for each N. The problem is considered solved if one hundred subsequent rollouts achieve the optimal return. Parameter space noise outperforms action space noise and even the more computationally expensive bootstrapped DQN. In a simple environment where the optimal strategy is always to go right, parameter space noise outperforms bootstrapped DQN. However, in cases where the optimal action depends on the state, parameter space noise may not work as well. Results highlight exploration behavior differences compared to action space noise in this specific scenario. The text discusses various environments in rllab 5 modified to have sparse rewards. Tasks include raising a paddle, reaching an upright position, crossing a target distance, driving up a hill, and reaching targets in SwimmerGather. DDPG and TRPO are used to solve these environments with a time horizon of T = 500 steps. Performance results are shown for DDPG, while TRPO results are in Appendix F, with each configuration run with five random seeds for median return analysis. SparseDoublePendulum is easy to solve with DDPG, while SparseCartpoleSwingup and SparseMountainCar require parameter space noise for successful policies. SparseHalfCheetah shows some progress but fails to learn a successful policy. SwimmerGather tasks prove challenging for all DDPG configurations. Parameter space noise can enhance exploration behavior, but results are not guaranteed universally. Improvements in exploration are not guaranteed universally, so evaluating the potential benefit of parameter space noise on a case-by-case basis is necessary. Evolution strategies (ES) and traditional RL with parameter space noise are compared directly for performance on 21 ALE games. ES explores by introducing noise in the parameter space, while traditional RL uses black-box optimization and back-propagation for optimization. By combining parameter space noise with traditional RL, temporal information can be included while benefiting from improved exploration behavior. Parameter space noise combines the exploration properties of Evolution Strategies (ES) with the sample efficiency of traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL). Despite being exposed to significantly less data, DQN with parameter space noise outperforms ES on 15 out of 21 Atari games. This demonstrates the effectiveness of parameter space noise in addressing the exploration problem in reinforcement learning. Various algorithms have been proposed to guarantee near-optimal solutions in a polynomial number of steps based on the number of states, actions, and horizon time. In the context of deep reinforcement learning, various techniques have been proposed to enhance exploration, but they are often computationally expensive. Perturbing policy parameters has been suggested as a method to improve exploration, showing better performance than random exploration in some cases. Our method is applied and evaluated for both on and off-policy settings, using high-dimensional policies and environments with large state spaces. It is closely related to evolution strategies and aims to improve exploration in deep reinforcement learning. Our approach utilizes parameter perturbations for exploration in deep reinforcement learning, showing improved performance compared to traditional action space noise methods. Parameter space noise is a simple yet effective alternative to techniques like -greedy and Gaussian noise, successfully combined with DQN, DDPG, and TRPO algorithms. This method allows for solving environments with sparse rewards where action noise may not be effective. Parameter space noise is a viable alternative to action space noise in reinforcement learning. The experimental setup includes a network architecture with convolutional layers and a hidden layer, utilizing ReLUs and layer normalization. Additionally, a policy network with a softmax output layer is included for parameter space noise. The Q-value network is updated every 10 K timesteps using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 10 \u22124 and a batch size of 32. The replay buffer can hold 1 M state transitions. For the -greedy baseline, the policy is perturbed at the beginning of each episode with the standard deviation adapted every 50 timesteps. To avoid getting stuck, -greedy action selection with = 0.01 is used. Initial data is collected with 50 K random actions before training starts. Observations are down-sampled to 84 \u00d7 84 pixels and converted to grayscale, with a concatenation of 4 subsequent frames sent to the network. Up to 30 noop actions are used at the beginning of each episode. The network architecture for DDPG includes 2 hidden layers with 64 ReLU units each for both the actor and critic, with actions included in the second hidden layer for the critic. The critic and actor in DDPG are trained with different learning rates, 10^-3 and 10^-4 respectively. Layer normalization is applied to all layers, and target networks are soft-updated with \u03c4 = 0.001. The critic is regularized with an L2 penalty of 10^-2, and the replay buffer holds 100 K state transitions with \u03b3 = 0.99. Parameter space noise is adaptively scaled to match action space noise, with \u03c3 = 0.2 for dense environments and \u03c3 = 0.6 for sparse environments. TRPO uses a step size of \u03b4 KL = 0.01. TRPO uses a step size of \u03b4 KL = 0.01, with \u03c3 = 0.6. Policy network has 2 hidden layers with 32 tanh units for nonlocomotion tasks and 2 hidden layers of 64 tanh units for locomotion tasks. Hessian calculation is subsampled with a factor of 0.1, \u03b3 = 0.99, and batch size per epoch is set to 5 K timesteps. Various environments from OpenAI Gym and rllab are used for different tasks. SparseDoublePendulum and DISPLAYFORM5 are used for training agents with different reward structures. DQN with a simple network architecture is employed, and each agent is trained for up to 2K episodes with varying chain lengths. Performance evaluation is done after each episode to determine if the problem is solved. The problem is considered solved if one hundred subsequent trajectories achieve the optimal episode return. Figure 6 depicts the environment for testing exploratory behavior. Different DQN variations are compared, including adaptive parameter space noise DQN, bootstrapped DQN, and \u03b5-greedy DQN. Parameters such as \u03b3, replay buffer size, learning rate, and batch size are specified for training the network using the Adam optimizer. The expected stochastic policy \u03c0\u03b8(a|s) with \u03b8 \u223c N(\u03c6, \u03a3) is also discussed. The expected return can be expanded using likelihood ratios and the reparametrization trick for N samples. Setting \u03a3 := \u03c3^2 I and using an adaption method to re-scale as needed. Parameter space noise requires picking a suitable scale \u03c3, which can vary over time. A simple solution is proposed to resolve these limitations. The parameter space noise is adapted by varying the scale \u03c3 k over time, related to action space variance. \u03c3 k is updated every K timesteps using a heuristic based on the Levenberg-Marquardt method. The distance measure d(\u00b7, \u00b7) is used to update \u03c3 k, with \u03b1 = 1.01 and \u03b4 as a threshold value. Different distance measures are outlined for methods like DDPG and TRPO, which use behavioral policies, while DQN defines the policy implicitly through the Q-value function. The policy in DQN is defined implicitly by the Q-value function, leading to pitfalls in distance measurement. A probabilistic formulation is used for both non-perturbed and perturbed policies, allowing for distance measurement in action space. The probabilistic formulation of policies in DQN allows for distance measurement in action space by normalizing Q-values. This approach avoids pitfalls in distance measurement and relates to -greedy action space noise without the need for additional hyperparameters. The distance measure in DDPG and TRPO relates action space noise to parameter space noise by adaptively scaling \u03c3 to match the KL divergence between greedy and -greedy policy. This results in effective action space noise with the same standard deviation as regular Gaussian action space noise. For TRPO, noise vectors are scaled by computing a trust region around the noise. The trust region around the noise direction is computed to ensure the perturbed policy remains close to the non-perturbed version. Learning curves for 21 Atari games are provided, comparing the final performance of ES and DQN. The results for InvertedPendulum and InvertedDoublePendulum are noted to be noisy. Adaptive parameter space noise achieves stable performance on InvertedDoublePendulum, comparable to other exploration approaches. TRPO with noise scaled according to parameter curvature shows consistent learning on challenging sparse environments. Adding parameter space noise aids in learning more consistently on these environments."
