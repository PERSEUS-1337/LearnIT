    "content": "Public and private health care spending is increasing due to factors like rising enrollment in health insurance and demographic changes. The tax subsidies in the Internal Revenue Code for health care provision are often overlooked in budget discussions. These subsidies, known as tax expenditures, confer preferential tax status to certain forms of income, resulting in foregone revenue. Congressional attention to health-related tax expenditures raises questions about their value, changes over time, and impact since the enactment of the Affordable Care Act. The report analyzes historical data on health-related tax expenditures published by the Joint Committee on Taxation, focusing on changes in value relative to total revenue collected and federal support for health programs. It examines whether federal support for health has grown more through direct outlays or indirectly through revenue losses attributable to tax expenditures. The curr_chunk discusses tax expenditures defined by the Joint Committee on Taxation, based on the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974. It relies on a modified Haig-Simons baseline for estimation methodology. The Joint Committee on Taxation defines tax expenditures based on a modified Haig-Simons baseline, categorizing provisions by budget function. They publish estimates of tax expenditures during each session of Congress. The Department of the Treasury has its own list of tax expenditures categorized by budget function. The health budget function used by the Joint Committee on Taxation for tax expenditures is broader than that used for outlays by agencies like the Office of Management and Budget. This is due to historical practices and the challenge of categorizing cross-cutting health provisions. Additionally, the Congressional Budget Office categorizes tax expenditures by budget area. The Congressional Budget Office categorizes tax expenditures by forms outlined in the 1974 Budget Act: exclusions, exemptions, deductions, preferential tax rates, and tax credits. Economists evaluate tax expenditures based on economic efficiency, equity, and administrative simplicity, aiding Congressional decision-making by identifying potential impacts on certain groups. For example, tax expenditures in health insurance can correct some market inefficiencies while creating others. Tax expenditures in the form of exclusions and deductions could affect tax progressivity and administrative considerations. Administering social programs through the tax code may benefit lower-income households but could increase complexity and costs. Direct spending or grant programs may be easier for beneficiaries and reduce administrative costs. JCT currently identifies 14 health tax expenditures. In FY2016, health tax expenditures are estimated at $234.0 billion, with the largest tax exclusion for employer-sponsored insurance (ESI) being the largest tax expenditure in the federal tax code. The ESI tax exclusion is projected to increase from $145.5 billion to $169.4 billion from FY2015 to FY2019. The second largest health tax expenditure is for subsidies for insurance purchased in the exchanges. The annual tax expenditure amount for advance premium tax credits (APTCs) is projected to increase from $29.6 billion to $84.8 billion from FY2015 to FY2019. Health-related tax expenditures subsidize private health insurance and activities with positive societal benefits. Older health tax provisions in the code also play a significant role. Some older health tax provisions in the code have origins in legal doctrine or income definitions at the time of adoption. These provisions, like the itemized deduction for charitable giving to nonprofit health organizations, are part of larger categories of activity. The ESI tax exclusion, dating back to 1918, allowed employer payments for individual health coverage to be deductible. Regulatory rulings had conflicting outcomes on the tax treatment of employer health contributions. The ESI tax exclusion, dating back to 1918, allowed employer payments for individual health coverage to be deductible. The Internal Revenue Code Act of 1954 expanded the role of the exclusion by excluding employer health contributions from income. JCT data on health-related tax expenditure estimates from FY1974 to FY2019 show changes in provisions over time. Health-related tax expenditures have increased in value over time, with a 43.0% increase in real terms from FY2004 to FY2014. JCT does not typically combine multiple tax expenditure values due to potential interactions between provisions. In FY2014, health-related tax expenditures increased by 43.0% in real terms, with an average annual increase of 11.5% in nominal dollars from FY1974 to FY2014. After the ACA in 2010, growth rates fluctuated but remained positive. The annual value of health tax expenditures is estimated to rise to $296.2 billion in FY2019 from $210.4 billion in FY2015. Factors contributing to this growth include changes in demographics and health care costs. Before FY2015, JCT identified Medicare-related tax expenditures as the value of benefits exceeding insurance payments, not the total value of Medicare benefits received. Medicare benefits are excluded from income tax, but a positive tax expenditure was measured if insurance benefits exceeded what enrollees paid. For example, a positive tax expenditure for Medicare Part D indicated that insurance value exceeded premiums paid. Medicare-related tax expenditures increased over time in both nominal and inflation-adjusted value. Tax expenditures for Medicare increased in both nominal and inflation-adjusted value over time. From FY1987 to FY2014, the annual tax expenditure value for Medicare-related provisions rose by 10.2% (nominal) and 7.7% (real) on average. JCT estimated that these provisions accounted for 26.8% of total health tax expenditures in FY2014, up from 1.9% in FY1974. The value of health-related tax expenditures has generally increased over time, from 6.4% of total revenue in FY2015 to 7.7% in FY2019. Various taxes imposed by the ACA, such as the Cadillac tax, individual mandate, employer mandate, and medical device tax, contribute to revenue collection. Additionally, a 3.8% unearned income Medicare contribution tax was imposed on higher-income taxpayers. The annual revenue raised by health-related tax expenditures is small compared to total health tax expenditures. OMB classifies a narrower set of activities under its health budget function than JCT uses for tax expenditures. The comparison between outlays and tax expenditures is complex due to different measurement bases. The comparison between federal health outlays and tax expenditures is useful for tracking support to the health sector. Health programs like Medicare and Medicaid have mostly mandatory costs, while research and veterans' health care are funded through discretionary spending. Health-related tax expenditures historically exceeded discretionary outlays but were less than mandatory outlays. Health-related tax expenditures have grown over the years, reaching 1.5% of GDP in FY2014. The appendix provides a description and legislative origins of each health tax expenditure provision. Medicare-related tax expenditure provisions were no longer classified starting from FY2015. Some health tax expenditures are long-standing provisions in the Internal Revenue Code. Some provisions in the Internal Revenue Code have historical origins in past legal definitions or administrative rulings.
