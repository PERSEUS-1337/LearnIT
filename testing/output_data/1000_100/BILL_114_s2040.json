    "content": "The \"Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act\" recognizes the threat of international terrorism to the United States and the need to address aiding and abetting liability. The legal framework for civil aiding and abetting and conspiracy liability in the context of chapter 113B of title 18, United States Code is based on the decision in Halberstam v. Welch. Individuals or entities that knowingly support terrorism pose a threat to US national security and may be held liable. The purpose of this Act is to provide civil litigants with broad access to the court system in the United States to pursue claims against those who have supported terrorist attacks within the country. This includes individuals, entities, and foreign countries that have knowingly provided material support to the perpetrators. The Act aims to allow civil litigants to sue individuals, entities, and foreign countries that have supported terrorist attacks against the United States. It states that foreign states can be held accountable for international terrorism under certain conditions. Foreign states can be sued in the United States for physical injury, property damage, or death caused by acts of international terrorism or tortious acts committed by the foreign state, its officials, employees, or agents. Nationals of the United States can bring claims against foreign states if immunity does not apply. Foreign states are not subject to US court jurisdiction for negligence under subsection (b). Amendments are made to the table of sections for chapter 97 of title 28, United States Code. Responsibility of foreign states for international terrorism against the United States is addressed in section 1605B. Section 2333 of title 18, United States Code, is amended to include liability for aiding and abetting in civil actions related to terrorist acts committed by designated foreign terrorist organizations.

The courts of the United States have exclusive jurisdiction in such actions, and the Attorney General may intervene. The amendment does not affect immunity of foreign states under other laws. The amendment allows a court of the United States to stay a proceeding against a foreign state if the Secretary of State certifies ongoing good faith discussions for resolving claims. The stay can last up to 180 days and can be extended upon petition by the Attorney General. The amendment allows a court to stay a proceeding against a foreign state if ongoing good faith discussions are certified by the Secretary of State.
