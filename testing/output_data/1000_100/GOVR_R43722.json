Offices of inspector general (OIGs) conduct audits, investigations, and in some cases, employees have law enforcement authority. This includes carrying a firearm, making arrests without a warrant, and executing warrants for arrest, search, or seizure of evidence. Law enforcement authority is deemed essential for certain OIG missions, especially when investigations pose safety risks. Federal inspectors general (IGs) have substantial independence and powers to combat waste, fraud, and abuse within federal departments and agencies. Offices of inspector general (OIGs) conduct audits, investigations, and in some cases, employees have law enforcement authority. This report provides a list of statutes and regulations used to vest OIGs with law enforcement authority and resources that add context to their need for it. Each federal agency, including OIGs, has a unique mission and purpose for law enforcement authority, especially when concerns arise about weapons procurement. For example, the Social Security Administration's OIG explained an ammunition purchase that garnered public attention in August 2012. The OIG's procurement of standard issue ammunition for agent training and safety has raised concerns, but it is necessary for their duties. The USDA's OIG also faced inquiries about replacing automatic firearms with semi-automatic ones, in line with their mandate to combat criminal activity and fraud. The USDA OIG's Investigations division conducts extensive criminal investigations, resulting in numerous indictments, convictions, and monetary recoveries. OIG Special Agents are authorized to make arrests, carry firearms, and conduct undercover operations to combat fraud, theft, bribery, and extortion in USDA operations. The USDA OIG's Investigations division conducts criminal investigations involving fraud, theft, bribery, and extortion. OIG can be vested with law enforcement authority through the IG Act or by the Attorney General. The IG Act provides law enforcement authority to federal entities named in Section 6(e)(3). The Attorney General can delegate this authority when OIG is hindered in its responsibilities, lacks assistance from other agencies, and has proper safeguards in place. OIGs within specific agencies, including the National Archives, Amtrak, Peace Corps, and others, have been granted law enforcement authority. The IG Act authorizes federal entities like the Corporation for National and Community Service, the Export-Import Bank of the United States, and others to have law enforcement authority. Attorney General can delegate this authority when needed, with proper safeguards in place. Guidelines by then-Attorney General John Ashcroft detail training requirements for OIG employees with law enforcement authority, including firearms training and adherence to DOJ's deadly force policy. The Department of Justice's guidelines require OIGs with law enforcement authority to undergo periodic training in various legal and investigative procedures, consult with DOJ before using electronic surveillance, and receive approval for undercover investigations. Additionally, some OIGs have law enforcement authority through laws outside of the IG Act. The Bureau of Justice Statistics maintains a Census on Federal Law Enforcement Officers, which includes data on the number of federal employees authorized to carry firearms. In September 2008, 33 OIGs had 3,501 agents authorized to carry firearms, with no reported assaults or injuries to law enforcement officers within an OIG that year."
