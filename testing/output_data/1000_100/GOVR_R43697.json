    "content": "Ebola virus disease (Ebola, or EVD) is a severe, often fatal disease first detected in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 1976. It is spread through contact with infected bodily fluids and has caused a large outbreak in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia. Nearly 10,000 people have been infected, with almost 5,000 deaths reported. In October, nearly 10,000 people have contracted EVD, with almost 5,000 deaths reported. WHO updates EVD cases regularly at http://www.who.int/ebola. Due to weak surveillance systems, actual cases may be higher than reported. Mali reported its first EVD case, and concerns exist about undetected cases in neighboring countries. WHO is sending a team to Mali for assistance. Efforts are underway to develop drugs for EVD treatment, with plans to test two Ebola vaccines on health workers and volunteers in January. The organization mentioned a potential treatment for Ebola in Liberia by early November. Health practitioners currently provide supportive care for EVD symptoms to reduce fatality rates. Disease spread can be limited through surveillance and containment measures outlined by WHO manuals. Previous Ebola outbreaks were successfully contained using these measures. The current outbreak in West Africa is due to inadequate health systems for implementing containment and surveillance measures. The current Ebola outbreak in West Africa is different from previous outbreaks due to its emergence in new countries and simultaneous multi-country transmission. Efforts to contain the disease have been successful in some countries like Senegal and Nigeria, but new cases are still being investigated in Mali. The outbreak has also resulted in cases outside of Africa for the first time. The current Ebola outbreak in West Africa is unique as it has spread to new countries and is transmitting simultaneously across multiple countries. Efforts to contain the disease have been effective in some countries, but new cases are still under investigation in Mali. In October, health workers in the United States and Spain contracted Ebola while caring for patients, but no additional cases have been reported. The outbreak is spreading in both rural and urban areas, posing challenges for responders in densely populated urban settings with limited access to clean water, sanitation, and healthcare facilities. Ebola is spreading rapidly in affected countries, with cases doubling every 15-40 days in Liberia and Sierra Leone. The Ebola outbreak in West Africa is spreading rapidly, with cases doubling every 30-40 days in Sierra Leone. A separate outbreak in the DRC has resulted in 66 cases and 49 deaths, with congressional actions accelerating to address the situation. In response to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, Congress enacted legislation providing $88 million for CDC Ebola response activities and research for treatments and vaccines. The Department of Defense was also permitted to reprogram $750 million for building Ebola treatment units in Liberia. The affected countries' health systems were already weak before the outbreak. The health systems in the affected countries were weak before the Ebola outbreak and have been overwhelmed by the crisis. WHO identifies six components of a health system: human resources, governance, financing, supply chain, service delivery, and information. The affected countries face severe deficiencies in these areas, enabling the virus to spread. The outbreak has led to perceptions of government ineptitude, with mistrust prompting civilians to resist government responses. Attacks on health workers and facilities have been reported. The affected governments have used armed forces to enforce disease control measures and quarantine neighborhoods, leading to public resentment. Some have criticized the effectiveness of quarantines, citing concerns about human rights, food scarcity, and unrest. Liberia and Sierra Leone have stopped quarantining some neighborhoods following protests and expert criticisms. Despite concerns, Sierra Leone officials considered a sensitization campaign successful, detecting Ebola cases and recovering bodies. Low per capita health spending in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone has contributed to poor conditions in health facilities. Low per capita health spending in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone has led to poor conditions in publicly-funded health facilities. Delays in compensation and benefits for health workers have caused absenteeism and worker shortages, with some workers abandoning their posts during the Ebola outbreak due to safety concerns and unpaid salaries. Financial aid from donors, including the United States, is being provided to support payment of health workers' salaries and other incentives in Liberia. The affected countries lack sufficient financial resources for their Ebola response plans and require ongoing support from donors. The United Nations estimates that Guinea needs $194 million, Liberia needs $473 million, and Sierra Leone needs $220 million to address the health and secondary effects of the Ebola outbreak. Severe shortages of health workers and clinics in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea are hindering access to medical care and treatment for Ebola patients. Human resource constraints and concerns about health center conditions are leading people to care for the ill on their own, contributing to the spread of the virus. The shortage of medics and health facilities is also affecting people needing care for non-Ebola related issues. Observers are concerned about inadequate access to Ebola care and the impact of clinic closures on maternal and child health in the affected countries. Before the outbreak, maternal and child mortality rates were already high, with thousands of women and children dying each year from preventable causes. Pregnant women are avoiding health facilities due to fear of contracting Ebola, leading to further health complications. Many health facilities are closed in Liberia due to fear of Ebola, leading to high maternal and child mortality rates. Sierra Leone had a shortage of doctors before the outbreak, and Liberia now has significantly fewer doctors providing clinical care. EVD deaths among health workers have worsened staffing levels. The Ebola outbreak has led to a significant decrease in healthcare workers in Sierra Leone and Liberia, with over 40% of EVD deaths among health workers occurring in Liberia. WHO estimates that at least 250 healthcare workers are needed to treat 70 Ebola patients, and the affected countries require over 13,000 health workers for various tasks. Foreign aid is expected to contribute 5% of the needed personnel, with the rest coming from national health staff. The Ebola outbreak has severely impacted healthcare in affected countries, leading to closures of health facilities and limited access to clinics. This has resulted in people traveling long distances for healthcare, delaying treatment and reducing survival prospects. The lack of healthcare services is hindering efforts to detect and contain the virus. The Ebola outbreak has caused severe shortages in health services, including treatment centers, laboratories, contact tracing, and safe burial services. Most affected countries are struggling to meet the demands, leading to patients being turned away and potentially infecting more people. Liberia is facing the most severe treatment shortage, with only 23% of the needed beds available. The U.S. plans to support the construction of 27 Ebola Treatment Units (ETUs) in Liberia to improve treatment capacity. Health experts are investigating a recent reduction in people seeking Ebola care in Liberia, with some beds left vacant. Safe disposal of dead bodies is improving, with 90% removed within 24 hours. EVD responders are working with community leaders to adapt funeral practices that can spread the virus. Inconsistent adherence to infection control protocols is contributing to EVD cases among health workers. CDC identified multiple opportunities for Ebola transmission to healthcare workers in Liberia. Exposure to Ebola patients in hospitals, inadequate use of protective equipment during cleaning, and potential transmission among healthcare workers have been identified as key concerns. CDC Director noted poor sanitation conditions in health facilities, with limited access to running water and unreliable ambulance services in rural areas. Power outages and water supply interruptions further hinder efforts to control the outbreak. The affected countries have limited supplies of protective gear, leading to shortages among health workers. This puts healthcare workers at risk of contracting and spreading Ebola, as well as other infectious diseases. WHO has noted shortages of protective equipment even in Ebola treatment units. Additionally, health providers lack sufficient supplies of antibiotics and safe blood to treat Ebola. The price of disinfectants and medicine has doubled due to increased demand for protection. The price of disinfectants and medicine has doubled as people try to protect themselves from Ebola. Transportation of aid workers and supplies is hindered by poor road conditions and limited air service. Awareness about preventing EVD infection has improved, but poverty and health system constraints make it difficult for many to avoid infection. Consumption of wild animals is common in areas with high food insecurity. Efforts to contain the Ebola outbreak are hindered by weak laboratory and surveillance systems, leading to uncertainty about the number and location of cases. Limited laboratory capacity has resulted in extensive diagnosis backlogs, endangering health workers and hindering containment efforts. International responses are crucial in addressing the challenges posed by the outbreak. International responses are accelerating to contain the Ebola outbreak, with estimated costs rising to $490 million by August. The outbreak has spread to Sierra Leone and Nigeria, causing over 3,600 cases and 1,800 deaths. The United Nations established a response plan in September. The United Nations established the U.N. Mission for Ebola Emergency Response (UNMEER) in September to coordinate the international response to the outbreak. The six-month, $988 million plan calls for addressing health and social impacts, with donors contributing $493 million and pledging an additional $279 million as of October 29, 2014. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) estimates that $894 million has been committed for addressing the Ebola outbreak, with an additional $938 million pledged for preparedness needs. WHO and UNOCHA may revise their funding requests as the outbreak spreads. WHO's Ebola Response Roadmap outlines the need for $490 million to build referring and isolation centers and increase diagnostic capacity. Since September, pledges to send health workers to the region have increased, with several countries committing medical support, including Cuba, the U.S., Britain, and China. The African Union and East African Community have also committed to sending health workers to help combat the Ebola outbreak in the region. Human resource constraints continue to hinder containment efforts. The Liberian Government, WHO, CDC, and partners developed the Community Care Campaign to target vulnerable households in Liberia, expanding to cover the region. Community care centers managed by NGOs, CHWs, and family members of EVD patients will complement Ebola Treatment Units. Sierra Leone is also establishing CCCs. The United States is a leading funder of the international Ebola response. The United States is the top funder of the international Ebola response, with financial support increasing. USAID reports $344.6 million in humanitarian funding for EVD responses. The U.S. Global Ebola strategy aims to control the outbreak, mitigate impacts, establish leadership, and advance global health security. Focus is on Liberia, where the outbreak is widespread, but efforts extend to all affected countries. President Obama appointed an Ebola Czar to coordinate domestic and global responses. The United States has nearly 900 government personnel stationed in the region, with over 700 military personnel deployed to the affected countries in response to the Ebola outbreak. U.S. efforts are focused on building capacity in foreign nations to prepare and respond to disease outbreaks, primarily through USAID and CDC. Since 2005, USAID has invested approximately $1 billion in pandemic preparedness programs. USAID has spent $1 billion on helping countries detect, prepare for, and respond to outbreaks originating in animals like Ebola. The Emerging and Pandemic Threats program, funded by Congress, operates in 18 countries in Africa and Asia, focusing on viral detection, risk determination, and a \"one health\" approach. USAID has deployed a Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) to West Africa to coordinate the U.S. Government's response to the Ebola outbreak, committing over $300 million for combating Ebola in West Africa. This includes resources for treatment beds, protective equipment, and hygiene kits to prevent the spread of new viral threats. USAID is providing hygiene kits with supplies like soap, bleach, gloves, and masks to prevent disease spread. They are also supporting IFRC to raise awareness, train volunteers, and manage safe burials for Ebola. CDC funds global pandemic preparedness through various programs. CDC has requested additional support in FY2015 ($45 million) to fund activities for the Global Health Security Agenda, accelerating efforts to detect, prevent, and respond to global infectious disease threats like Ebola. CDC supports pandemic influenza preparedness in over 50 countries, sending experts to work with WHO country offices or forming cooperative agreements with partners. CDC teams traveled to Guinea and Liberia in March 2014 to help characterize and control the Ebola outbreak, conduct contact tracing, and improve data management. CDC has committed over $16.7 million for Ebola responses, while DOD announced $22 million for a field hospital in Liberia. HHS supports the Global Health Security Agenda to detect and respond to infectious diseases like Ebola. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps will deploy 65 officers to Liberia to manage and staff a hospital. President Barack Obama announced \"Operation United Assistance\" involving 4,000 U.S. military forces to support relief efforts, train health workers, and establish treatment centers in Liberia. The first 22-bed Ebola Treatment Center is expected to be completed by the end of October. The current Ebola outbreak has overwhelmed Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia. The U.S. military is providing support with personnel and funding for Operation United Assistance. Total DOD funding for the global Ebola response is expected to exceed $1 billion. Congress has enacted legislation to expand efforts to detect, treat, and prevent the spread of the disease. The U.S. Congress has enacted legislation to expand responses to the Ebola outbreak, providing funds for U.S. and international efforts. As the outbreak spreads, additional funds may be requested. WHO estimates 13,000 health workers are needed to contain the outbreak, with human resource constraints most acute in Liberia. The United States is collaborating with the Liberian government and other organizations on a Community Care Campaign. Doctors Without Borders has expressed concern about the WHO Community Care Campaign, warning that without proper infection control, supplies, trained staff, and supervision, the CCCs could become \"contamination centers.\" WHO acknowledges the risk of virus transmission within the CCC due to implementation deficiencies. Inconsistent adherence to infection control protocols is leading to Ebola cases among health workers, raising questions about the ability to ensure IPC protocols among trained personnel. The concern arises regarding adherence to IPC protocols by non-governmental organizations, community health workers, and family members providing Ebola care in CCCs. WHO recommends only one family member to care for each patient to prevent EVD spread, but cultural practices in Liberia may challenge this. Factors like income loss and emotional stress may also impact adherence. The curr_chunk discusses challenges in adherence to IPC protocol in Ebola Care Centers (CCCs), including issues with waste management, safe burial practices, and deficiencies in sanitation facilities in affected countries. It highlights the importance of strict adherence to protocol, especially among lay caretakers without medical training. The Community Care Campaign emphasizes the need for daily supervisory visits by trained health care workers to ensure compliance with IPC protocols and proper use of PPE in Ebola Care Centers. Poor supply chain management leads to interruptions in medical supplies and a lack of protective equipment in health clinics. The lack of protective equipment in Ebola Treatment Units (ETUs) and health clinics has been linked to EVD infections among health workers. WHO and partners are working to ensure a continuous supply of commodities to Community Care Centers (CCCs). The U.S. is implementing the Community Care Campaign, providing community care kits in Liberia and issuing grants to NGOs for managing CCCs. Observers have criticized WHO leadership over the global Ebola response, citing budget cuts that have reduced effectiveness and capacity to contain outbreaks. Earlier budget cuts have also led to staff reductions and closure of critical units, undermining operational capabilities. Some critics argue that WHO's response to the Ebola outbreak has been hindered by bureaucratic bloat and underqualified staff due to political connections, leading to debates on WHO's role as an advisory body or operational entity. Suggestions include establishing a \"Health Systems Fund\" for long-term capacity building and addressing crises like Ebola. Calls for a ready-to-deploy emergency health response team are countered by concerns about sovereignty issues. The debate over disease-based funding for health emergencies intensified following the introduction of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). Supporters argue that disease-specific programs strengthen oversight capacity, while opponents believe they exacerbate human resource shortages in the public sector. The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) was introduced to address the HIV/AIDS epidemic by providing funding to non-governmental organizations and local partners to establish care facilities. While successful in saving lives and preventing infections, there is debate over using PEPFAR funds for building health systems. Deborah Birx aims to allocate 50% of PEPFAR resources to care and treatment activities, raising concerns about potential impacts on health system strengthening efforts. The U.S. Congress also faces challenges in providing focused support for the current Ebola outbreak while ensuring long-term health system development in affected countries. Ken Isaacs from Samaritan's Purse emphasized the importance of focusing on emergency response rather than long-term health system development during crises like the Ebola outbreak. USAID has set up a working group to strengthen health systems post-outbreak, but funding mainly targets specific diseases, limiting resources for broader health system strengthening efforts. The ongoing Ebola outbreak has prompted various U.S. agencies to respond, with the Department of State leading diplomatic efforts, USAID coordinating responses, CDC managing public health activities, and DOD providing support for foreign armed forces. Each agency, except USAID, can utilize flexible authorities to address the crisis. Coordination of diplomatic engagements by the Department of State is done through existing channels, reducing the need for additional resources. The CDC and DOD can finance outbreak responses and health activities through existing channels without requiring additional funding. Congress provides specific directives on how foreign aid funds are used, limiting USAID's ability to address unforeseen events like the Ebola outbreak without reallocating funds. According to USAID, funds are being reprogrammed to address the current Ebola outbreak, as well as ongoing outbreaks like H7N9 avian influenza and MERS-CoV. Supporters believe the appropriation structure ensures congressional priorities are met, while opponents argue it limits agility in the field. Disease outbreaks are unpredictable, but with surveillance and response mechanisms, their impact can be minimized. USAID's pandemic preparedness efforts are focused on East and Central Africa, where previous outbreaks have occurred. The FY2015 budget request for pandemic preparedness is lower than the previous year. Experts predict the Ebola outbreak can be contained by the end of January, but the high death tolls are causing long-term effects in the region. MSF reports that some villages in Sierra Leone have lost most adult community members, leaving vulnerable populations without resources. The Ebola outbreak in West and Central Africa is leaving vulnerable populations, including children and the elderly, without resources for agriculture and food. Concerns are growing about the increasing number of orphaned children, who are particularly at risk of marginalization due to fear of the virus. The outbreak is also impacting the capacity of governments to address other health issues, such as maternal and child mortality rates, due to a decrease in health personnel and resources. The Ebola outbreak in West and Central Africa is affecting vulnerable populations, leading to abandonment of posts, diversion of resources to treatment centers, and public avoidance of health centers. The full health effects may not be known until containment. Broader health and development needs may be addressed, sparking debate on global health assistance funds allocation. Congress may face arguments for various health and development issues worsened by Ebola, including maternal and child mortality, orphanhood, poverty, food scarcity, and water-borne infections. Despite multiple outbreaks since 1976, there are no specific therapeutic options, cure, treatment, vaccine, or post-exposure prophylaxis for health workers regularly exposed to Ebola. Several experimental treatments and vaccines for Ebola are in clinical trials to determine safety and efficacy. The debate surrounds the ethical use of these experimental drugs, particularly in terms of equity between U.S. workers and African patients. Concerns include administering untested drugs to African patients and the potential exacerbation of mistrust in healthcare workers. WHO announced in August that it is ethical to offer unproven interventions for Ebola treatment. In October, they planned to test two vaccines on 20,000 health workers and volunteers. An experimental treatment may be available in Liberia by early November. WHO convened a meeting to fast track testing and deployment of treatments. WHO convened a meeting with health officials and funding agencies to fast track testing and deployment of vaccines for the Ebola epidemic. Concerns arise about ethical practices during trials, especially if adverse reactions occur. Neighboring countries are at risk of Ebola cases, with Mali reporting its first case. WHO is assisting in building surveillance and response plans. A study from Oxford University suggests future outbreaks may occur in Central and West Africa due to the presence of suspected vectors like fruit bats. The article raises concerns about future Ebola outbreaks in urban areas of sub-Saharan Africa and questions the effectiveness of the U.S. response and support for pandemic preparedness efforts. It also discusses the impact of disease-specific funding on pandemic preparedness and the reprogramming of USAID funds for the Ebola outbreak. Additionally, it questions whether ongoing outbreak responses are improving the capacity of affected countries to respond to future outbreaks."
