    "content": "The \"Cut, Cap, and Balance Act of 2015\" is also known as the \"Cut\" Act. It modifies the Congressional Budget Act by adding spending limits. The \"Cut, Cap, and Balance Act of 2015\" sets spending limits for fiscal year 2016 to prevent exceeding specified budget authority and outlays. Adjustments can be made by the House or Senate Committee on the Budget for enforcement purposes. The concurrent resolution on the budget adjusts allocations based on new budget authority and outlays. The House or Senate Committee on Appropriations can revise suballocations accordingly. For appropriations related to the Global War on Terrorism in fiscal year 2016, specific amounts are designated for Overseas Contingency Operations. For fiscal year 2016, the allowable adjustments under section 251(b)(2)(A) of the Balanced Budget Act shall not exceed $58 billion in budget authority and outlays. SEC. 317 of the bill sets limits on total spending in the House of Representatives and the Senate, with exemptions for certain functions like Social Security, Medicare, Veterans Benefits, Net Interest, and Military personnel accounts. SEC. 102 enforces spending caps through sequestration. SEC. 102 enforces spending caps through sequestration under Title III of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. Implementation of sequesters under this section involves separate implementation for discretionary and direct spending, following specific provisions of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. Military personnel accounts, TRICARE for Life, Medicare, military retirement, and Social Security are exempt from certain provisions. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 exempts military retirement, Social Security, veterans, net interest, and discretionary appropriations from sequestration. Presidential Order can be modified to override the order if the same level of reductions in new budget authority and outlays is achieved. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 exempts certain categories from sequestration. A bill or resolution altering a sequestration order must achieve the same level of reductions in new budget authority and outlays for the applicable year as set forth in the order. SEC. 201 of TITLE II--CAP limits total spending by amending definitions in the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. GDP is defined as gross domestic product. Additionally, SEC. 319 of Title III enforces GDP outlay limits. The term 'GDP outlay limit' is defined as an amount based on projected GDP for each fiscal year, with specific percentages set for each year from 2016 to 2025. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget determines these limits. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget establishes the GDP outlay limit in the President's budget for the budget year. Total federal outlays include all on-budget and off-budget outlays. Sequestration to enforce this section is implemented according to the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. Certain programs are exempt from this section. Certain programs, such as social security (functional category 650), veterans (functional category 700), and net interest (functional category 900) shall be exempt from the GDP outlay limit set by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget in the President's budget. SEC. 320 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 prohibits the consideration of any legislation that would exceed the current GDP outlay limits set in section 319. TITLE III--BALANCE\n\nSec. 301 requires a balanced budget amendment to be submitted to states. The Secretary of the Treasury cannot use additional borrowing authority until a balanced budget amendment is transmitted to the States, which includes requirements for total outlays not exceeding total receipts, a spending limitation as a percentage of GDP, and tax increases needing a \\2/3\\ vote in Congress for ratification. It is not allowed in the House or Senate to consider any legislation causing the Secretary to exercise additional borrowing authority until the balanced budget amendment is transmitted. The amendment to the Constitution described in subsection (a) is transmitted to the States."
