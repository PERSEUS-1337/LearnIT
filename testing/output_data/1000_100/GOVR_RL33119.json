    "content": "Prior to the passage of SAFETEA, federal highway, highway safety, and transit programs were periodically reauthorized. The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) provided funds for FY1998-FY2003. Short-term extension acts were used after October 1, 2003, causing uncertainty in the highway and transit community. Long-term reauthorizations, like TEA-21, are preferred for better planning and construction of infrastructure. Highway and transit interests welcomed the passage of SAFETEA, despite delays, as it provides federal funding linked to the highway trust fund. The trust fund consists of separate accounts for highways and mass transit, primarily funded by gasoline and diesel fuel taxes. The transit account receives 2.86 cents per gallon, with a portion reserved for an underground storage tank fund. The highway trust fund, funded by fuel taxes, has been a reliable source of funding for surface transportation for almost 50 years. In FY2004, the highway account received $31 billion in tax revenues, while the mass transit account received $5 billion. However, in recent years, the trust fund has been collecting less than what is being spent, with the FY2004 obligations exceeding the revenues collected. The highway trust fund's unexpended balance is substantial but declining, causing uncertainty about its long-term financial health. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 provided additional income through changes in gasohol taxation. Reauthorization legislation was passed in the 2nd Session of the 108th Congress, but agreement could not be reached on total program funding. The Administration and Congress could not agree on total program funding for the next reauthorization period due to differing views on project funding and fuel tax increases. Some Members of Congress proposed gasohol changes and other mechanisms to support a larger program, but additional revenue sources were needed to meet desired program size. Conferees on SAFETEA discussed various tax and other changes to increase trust fund revenues and offset highway and transit spending. The SAFETEA finance title included provisions to increase trust fund revenues and offset highway and transit spending through modest revenue increases, cutting tax fraud, and transferring Treasury general fund revenues. It was believed that these changes, combined with gasohol legislation and expected economic growth, would be sufficient to finance the $286.4 billion program created by the act. TEA-21 changed the highway trust fund's relationship to the Federal Unified Budget by creating new budget categories and setting statutory limitations on obligations. TEA-21 amended the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 to create new budget categories for highway and mass transit. It set limitations on obligations for fiscal years FY1999 to FY2003 and introduced Revenue Aligned Budget Authority (RABA) to adjust funding based on highway revenues. Despite these changes, annual revenues and expenditures still impact the federal deficit calculation. The net effect was a predetermined level of funding for core highway and transit programs. The changes in TEA-21 established a funding guarantee for core highway and transit programs, known as a discretionary spending guarantee. These \"firewalls\" ensured funds were dedicated solely to these programs. SAFETEA continued this budget format, providing $286.4 billion in guaranteed spending for FY2004-FY2009, sparking debates on funding distribution. SAFETEA provided a significant increase in funding for federal surface transportation programs, totaling over $244 billion in guaranteed spending authority for the period FY2005-FY2009. This marked an increase from the previous TEA-21 legislation, sparking debates on funding distribution. The House version of SAFETEA contained a \"re-opener\" provision for funding reconsideration, which was opposed by the Bush Administration and not included in the final act. TEA-21 established a spending mechanism to adjust highway program obligations based on revenue changes in the highway trust fund. Total annual spending increased each year, with FY2009 spending almost 23% higher than FY2005. Detailed funding information can be found in the report's Appendix and at http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/safetealu/fundtables.htm. The Reauthorization and Reform Act (RABA) adjusted program obligations in response to changes in revenue from the highway trust fund. Initially providing increased spending authority, RABA faced a reduction in FY2003, which Congress chose to override by increasing spending instead. This led to a push for changes in RABA calculations to minimize drastic revenue swings. SAFETEA altered RABA calculations by using a two-year calculation period and delaying reductions until FY2007, reducing the likelihood of spending cuts. Since 1982, Congress has addressed concerns over the distribution of federal highway aid among states through minimum guarantee provisions, with some states labeled as donor states seeking a higher share rate-of-return. The regional nature of transportation policy has often led to debates on equity in funding distribution. Donor states advocate for a higher share rate-of-return, currently at 95%, on their tax payments to the Treasury. They argue for equity, stating they have been subsidizing the repair and improvement of donee state infrastructure for years, especially in the Northeast. Donor states claim they are more road dependent and do not benefit from federal transit spending like some donee states. Southern and western donor states argue their fast growth areas have needs as great or greater than donee states. Advocates for donee states argue that fairness should be tied to needs, citing the age of their infrastructure, high costs of urban road maintenance, and limited financial resources in western states. They believe a national highway network should not be based solely on state boundaries and criticize Midwestern and southern states for seeking federal funds without investing their own resources. The debate over equity remedies has broader implications. The debate over equity remedies has implications for various overarching issues, such as the role of the federal government in relation to states and the potential broadening of the minimum guarantee to include Federal Transit Administration programs. The 109th Congress faced challenges in balancing donor state demands for a higher rate-of-return and donee state demands to be held harmless. The 109th Congress faced challenges in balancing donor state demands for a higher rate-of-return and donee state demands to be held harmless. To address this, a minimum guarantee mechanism was constructed to increase overall federal highway program size, ensuring equity remedies for all states. The TEA-21 and SAFETEA legislation aimed to provide equity in highway funding by giving more money to all states and even more to donor states to reach a designated percentage share. The minimum guarantee program under TEA-21 became the largest highway program, but SAFETEA replaced it with an \"Equity Bonus\" program to bring donor states up to their guaranteed rate-of-return levels. The act directs the Secretary of Transportation to allocate funds to states to ensure they receive a minimum return on their payments to the highway account of the HTF for fiscal years 2005-2009. Various programs are subject to the equity provision, including new formula programs and existing ones like the Coordinated Border Infrastructure Program and the Highway Safety Improvement Program. Hold harmless provisions ensure certain states receive a minimum return or their share of total apportionments. The TEA-21 act requires states to meet specific criteria to be held harmless and receive a minimum return on their payments to the highway account. Twenty-seven states qualify under these criteria based on factors like population density, income, fatality rate, and fuel excise tax rate. The Equity Bonus Program guarantees that states receive a minimum percentage of their annual TEA-21 apportionments. The annual percentage floors range from 117% to 121% for FY2005 to FY2009. Funds are distributed to core programs like IM, HBRR, NHS, STP, CMAQ, and HSIP after the first $2.639 billion is apportioned to the STP. The distribution of funds among core programs like IM, HBRR, NHS, STP, CMAQ, and HSIP is based on apportionment ratios. Over five years, SAFETEA's Equity Bonus Program distributions will cost $40.9 billion. Funds for these programs are apportioned annually to states using formulas in SAFETEA, also known as \"apportioned\" or formula programs. TEA-21 reserved most highway funding for core programs, which, along with the minimum guarantee, accounted for 86% of highway spending in FY2003. SAFETEA expands the number of core programs. SAFETEA increases core highway programs from five to six, including IM, NHS, STP, HBRR, CMAQ, and HSIP. The majority of highway funding goes to these core programs, with additional smaller programs like metropolitan planning and recreational trails. Only a few new programs were added during reauthorization. SAFETEA added two new formula programs: the Coordinated Border Infrastructure Program (CBI) and the Safe Routes to School Program (SRSP). Funding under the Federal-Aid Highway program was distributed to states based on various factors like lane miles, vehicle miles traveled, and estimated tax payments. Some programs had formulas based on factors like state share of bridge repair costs or non-attainment area population under the Clean Air Act. SAFETEA made adjustments to existing program formulas, including eliminating the 10% safety STP set-aside and creating a $20 million NHS set-aside for ferry construction. It also adjusted calculations for CMAQ in non-attainment areas for ozone standards. Additionally, it set a $40 million set-aside for the Territorial Highway Program and maintained a 15% minimum for the off-system bridge program. The off-system bridge program set-aside minimum is maintained at 15% for FY2007-FY2009, with the 35% ceiling removed. The formula distribution is weighted based on federal lane miles, FAHP vehicle miles traveled, and annual fatalities. The minimum payment to each state is set at 0.5%. Railway-Highway Crossings program funding is distributed 50% based on a formula distribution and 50% based on the number of public railway-highway grade crossings in each state. The Railway-Highway Crossings program funding is distributed based on the ratio of public railway-highway grade crossings in each state to the total number in all states. $90 million annually from HSIP is set aside for high-risk rural roads construction and operational improvements. Funding under SAFETEA is apportioned to states along the Canada-U.S. and Mexico-U.S. borders based on commercial truck and personal vehicle crossings. Funds for highway programs are apportioned among states based on various criteria, including the total weight of incoming cargo, the number of ports-of-entry, and student enrollment in primary and middle schools. States are guaranteed a minimum of $1 million. Highway programs not apportioned are subject to allocations based on established criteria and congressional earmarking. In SAFETEA, there are various programs with significant funding levels, including congressionally mandated high priority projects, federal lands program, interstate maintenance discretionary program, bridge discretionary program, and transportation and community system pilot preservation program. New programs include transportation improvement program, national corridor infrastructure program, and projects of national or regional significance, all subject to 100% earmarking. The SAFETEA act includes innovative financing mechanisms like GARVEEs, TIFIA, and SIBs to accelerate project completion and attract additional funds for highway projects. These mechanisms have specific strengths and weaknesses identified by GAO, CBO, and FHWA. SAFETEA makes changes to federal finance programs TIFIA and SIB, providing financial assistance for transportation projects. It reduces project size thresholds and allocates $122 million annually for TIFIA. The SIB program allows any state to establish SIBs with federal funds. SAFETEA allows states to establish State Infrastructure Banks (SIBs) with federal funds for transportation projects, including tolling programs and HOV lane tolling. The program authorizes funding for tolling projects and congestion pricing pilot projects, with $11 million for FY2005 and $12 million annually for FY2006-FY9. The act also impacts private facility bonds and bonding for tolling projects. The new program directs the Secretary of Transportation to carry out 15 demonstration projects allowing toll collection to manage congestion, reduce emissions, or expand highways. Funding will primarily go towards HOT lanes, with revenue use restricted to debt service and operating costs. Excess revenues may be used if the toll facility is well-maintained. The facility can use excess revenues for federal-aid highway or transit projects. Tolls can vary based on time of day or congestion levels to improve air quality and manage traffic. A pilot toll program allows states to collect tolls on Interstate System highways for construction purposes. Fees on express lanes must be collected electronically. The pilot program allows states to collect tolls on three Interstate System facilities for construction purposes. States must show toll financing is the most efficient way to advance the project. Revenues can only be used for debt service, investor returns, and maintenance costs. States cannot enter agreements preventing improvements to public roads affected by diverted traffic. Section 1121 of the act allows state departments of transportation to implement toll programs on HOV lanes, including on the Interstate System, for vehicles not eligible for HOV use. The program must include enrollment procedures, automatic toll collection systems, variable toll amounts to manage traffic levels, and enforcement policies. Additionally, low emission and energy-efficient vehicles may receive preferential toll rates for HOV use. The act allows tax-exempt private activity bonds to finance highway projects and rail-truck transfer facilities, with a $15 billion limit on bond issuance. Three categories of projects qualify for tax-exempt bonding: highway projects under Title 23, international tunnels or bridges receiving federal assistance under Title 23, and truck-train transfer facility projects under Title 23 or Title 49. No estimate is provided for the potential infrastructure impact. The conference report does not estimate the potential infrastructure impact of tax-exempt private activity bonds for highway projects and rail-truck transfer facilities. The bonding provision in SAFETEA could have a substantial impact, with California alone receiving over $15 billion in formula highway assistance. Projects using private activity bonds may be supported by tolls, and the ADHP program aims to promote economic development in Appalachia. The Appalachian Development Highway Program (ADHP) receives funding from the highway trust fund and is administered by the Appalachian Regional Commission. Funds are allocated to member states based on cost estimates for the Appalachian Development Highway System (ADHS). 85% of ADHS roads are either completed or under construction. Additional federal funds of $4.47 billion are needed to complete the system. The program received $450 million annually under TEA-21 and $470 million under SAFETEA. Toll revenues cannot be used as credits for non-federal matching funds on ADHP-funded projects. SAFETEA contains over 5,000 earmarks for high priority projects worth $14.8 billion, compared to TEA-21 with 1,849 earmarks worth $9.4 billion. Additionally, new earmarked categories have been created, including projects of national and regional significance with almost $1.8 billion allocated for 25 projects. The SAFETEA bill contains over 5,000 earmarks for high priority projects worth $14.8 billion, including categories for national corridor infrastructure improvements and transportation improvements totaling over $4.4 billion. Additionally, there are 32 individually listed earmarks throughout the highway title of the bill. The SAFETEA bill includes over 5,000 earmarks totaling $14.8 billion for high priority projects, with $774 million in earmarks in the highway title and $241.6 million in the research title. The transit title has 662 projects worth $1.6 billion and 39 stand-alone earmarks valued at $191 million. Total earmarking in the bill is estimated to exceed $24 billion, with focus on how it affects the Equity Bonus calculation. The SAFETEA bill includes over 5,000 earmarks totaling $14.8 billion for high priority projects, with $774 million in earmarks in the highway title and $241.6 million in the research title. Earmarks in the bill are categorized as \"below the line\" or \"above the line,\" impacting state shares. Transit earmarks are not part of the Equity Bonus calculation, while Transportation Enhancements program activities are similar to TEA-21, funding various project categories. The Transportation Enhancements (TE) program activities include historic preservation, scenic beautification, rehabilitation of transportation facilities, preservation of railway corridors, archeological research, and environmental mitigation. Funding for TE program activities has been modified under SAFETEA, ensuring a minimum allocation of funds for these projects. The Transportation Enhancements (TE) program, established under TEA-21 and reauthorized under SAFETEA, aims to improve transportation efficiency, reduce environmental impacts, and enhance access to jobs and services. The Transportation, Community, and System Preservation (TCSP) program assists in integrating transportation and community plans, with a focus on private sector initiatives. Funding for TCSP projects is authorized to improve transportation efficiency, reduce future infrastructure costs, and encourage compatible private development patterns. The TCSP program aims to integrate transportation and community plans, focusing on private sector development patterns. It has a six-year total funding authorization of $270 million, with $25 million authorized for FY2005 and $61.25 million authorized for FY2006-FY2009. This is more than TEA-21's authorization but less than the funds appropriated during TEA-21's lifespan. Competitive grants were awarded in FY1999 under TEA-21, while TCSP projects were earmarked in annual transportation appropriations bills from FY2000 to FY2003. The Transportation Enhancements (TE) program has been a major federal program supporting pedestrian and bicycle mobility since the passage of ISTEA. Funding for TCSP projects ranged from $13.5 million in FY1999 to $89.5 million in FY2003. SAFETEA continues to provide significant funding for bicycle and pedestrian programs, promoting non-motorized trips and safety initiatives. States can allocate TE funds for pedestrian and bicycle facilities, safety and educational activities, and preservation of abandoned railway corridors. The Transportation Enhancements (TE) program supports pedestrian and bicycle mobility. Between FY1992 and FY2004, 55% of TE funds were used for pedestrian and bicycle facilities. The Safe Routes to School Program encourages children to walk and bike to school, promoting a healthy lifestyle. Other programs also support the construction of bicycle and pedestrian facilities. The Safe Routes to School Program, funded at $612 million for FY2004-FY2009, aims to promote walking and biking to school. Each state receives a minimum of $1 million per year, with the federal government covering 100% of project costs. Funds are not transferable and remain available until expended. Funds allocated under the Safe Routes to School Program can be used by state, local, and regional agencies for infrastructure projects that improve walking and biking to school. This includes sidewalk improvements, traffic calming measures, bicycle facilities, pedestrian crossings, and secure bike parking. Noninfrastructure activities to encourage walking and biking are also eligible for funding. Noninfrastructure-related activities, such as public awareness campaigns, traffic education, and funding for safe routes to school programs, must account for 10-30% of the state's apportioned amount under the Safe Routes to School Program. States must allocate funds for a full-time coordinator position. The Secretary is required to provide grants to a national nonprofit organization for a safe routes to school clearinghouse. The Safe Routes to School Program requires states to allocate funds for noninfrastructure activities like public awareness campaigns and traffic education. A national safe routes to school clearinghouse will be funded by the Secretary's administrative expenses. Additionally, a task force will study and develop strategies for safe routes to school programs, with results to be reported to Congress by March 31, 2006. SAFETEA provides $45.3 billion in guaranteed transit funding for FY2005-FY2009, a 46% increase over TEA-21. Congress made changes to the funding distribution in the transit program, with a decrease in funding for urban areas and an increase for rural areas. The share of funding for the largest states decreased, while the share for the least-populated states increased. Overall, the act made minor changes to the federal transit program, adding new programs and funding categories. The act includes provisions for federal agencies in the National Capital Region to offer transit passes as a benefit, makes alternatives analysis eligible for FTA grants, and earmarks funding for the Bus and Bus Facilities Program. This adds $1.7 billion in funding over the FY2006-FY2009 period to urban and non-urban area formula programs. The funding for transportation services to persons with disabilities is apportioned to states based on population forecasts. Half of the funding goes to urbanized and non-urbanized areas within each state, while the other half is for urbanized areas in states with high population densities. This program aims to increase transportation options for individuals with disabilities, including access to jobs and employment support services. The total authorized funding for this program is $339 million over the period FY2006-FY2009. The program aims to protect national parks and public lands while providing access for all, including persons with disabilities. It has a total authorization of $97 million and is exempt from certain labor protection provisions. Additionally, a new formula program within the Urbanized Area Formula Program provides extra funding for small urbanized areas with comparable transit service levels. The program addresses funding disparities for small urbanized areas under 200,000 in population by measuring performance factors like passenger miles and vehicle revenue hours. This issue arose due to the lack of performance factors in the formula for smaller urbanized areas, leading to unequal funding distribution. DOT was directed to study this issue under Section 3033 of TEA-21. The Urbanized Areas Formula Program will shift 1% of funding from urbanized areas over 200,000 in population to those under 200,000. A new category within the New Starts program will streamline evaluation for projects seeking less than $75 million in federal funding. This program is authorized at $200 million annually for FY2007-FY2009. The exemption from the evaluation process for projects seeking less than $25 million in federal funding is eliminated. $45 million is set aside from the Non-Urbanized Area Formula Program for grants to Indian tribes for public transportation on Indian reservations. 20% of the Non-Urbanized Area Formula program funding will now be apportioned according to a state's share of the nation's total non-urbanized land area. The act authorizes $90 million for magnetic levitation train deployment for FY2005-FY2009. The TEA-21 authorized funding for maglev deployment, with 50% allocated for a project between Las Vegas and Primm, Nevada, and 50% for a project east of the Mississippi River. Projects in Pennsylvania and Maryland were selected to compete for funding. The act reauthorized the Swift Rail Act, expanding eligible expenses to include development of high-speed rail corridors. Funding levels remained at $70 million annually for corridor development and $30 million for high-speed rail technology improvements for FY2006-2013. The act authorizes $50 million for the elimination of rail-highway grade crossing hazards in high-speed rail corridors and grants to the Alaska Railroad for capital rehabilitation and improvements benefiting passenger transportation. The Federal Railroad Administration is directed to establish a program to review rail joint bar inspection data. The SAFETEA act authorizes a new grant program for highway safety, the Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP), which replaces the existing roadway hazard elimination program. FRA is directed to develop regulations for pressurized tank cars and improve identification of cracks in rail joint bars. The Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP) was funded through a 10% set-aside from the Surface Transportation Program, amounting to $560 million in FY2005. States were required to spend at least $317 million annually on hazard elimination. The new HSIP Program is authorized at $1.2 billion in FY2006, rising to $1.3 billion by FY2009, apportioned based on lane-miles and vehicle miles traveled on federal-aid highways. The Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP) funding is based on a state's share of total vehicle miles traveled and fatalities on federal-aid highways. States receive a minimum of 0.5% of the funding. $220 million is reserved for rail-highway grade crossing hazard elimination, and $90 million for high-risk rural roads projects. States must prepare a strategic highway safety plan. Total program authorization is $1.2 billion in FY2006, increasing to $1.3 billion by FY2009. The Safe Routes to Schools program, authorized at $54 million in FY2005 and rising to $183 million in FY2009, funds infrastructure projects to increase children's safety within two miles of schools. A new grant program promotes seat belt use, with states enacting primary seat belt laws eligible for grants. The grant program promotes seat belt use, with states achieving a seat belt use rate of 85% eligible for grants. The funds can be used for highway safety purposes, with a federal share of 100%. The program is authorized at $125 million annually for FY2006-FY2009 and also expands a grant program to reduce alcohol-impaired driving. States must meet certain criteria or carry out specified programs to receive grants. The grant program promotes seat belt use and funds highway safety purposes. States must meet criteria or carry out specified programs to receive grants, including checkpoints, blood alcohol testing, severe penalties for high BAC levels, rehabilitation programs, prevention strategies for underage drinking, license revocation system, and community programs funded by fines collected for DUI. The grant program under the act funds various programs to prevent impaired driving, with a total authorization of $555 million. It also includes new programs for motorcyclist safety and child restraint requirements. Additionally, the act directs the DOT to establish standards to reduce vehicle rollover crashes and increase roof strength. The Transportation Equity Act (TEA-21) includes provisions to increase roof strength in vehicles to protect occupants in rollover crashes and enhance occupant protection in side impact crashes. Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) are used to improve performance and safety in highway or transit projects by providing real-time traffic information for traffic management centers. During TEA-21, federal investment in ITS totaled about. During TEA-21, federal investment in ITS totaled about $230 million per year, with $100 million for research and $120 million for deployment. SAFETEA provides $110 million annually for ITS research. The ITS deployment program ended after FY2005, with project costs now eligible in core highway programs. The act aims to advance new technologies, improve standards, and develop a national ITS program plan. Both short- and long-term research and development activities play a role in addressing performance challenges. The federal role in Research and Development (RD) and Technology Deployment (TD) aims to address challenges in surface transportation systems such as congestion, security, and environmental degradation. Agencies like FHWA, FTA, NHTSA, and RITA oversee these efforts. Funding supports programs like ITS and FHWA's RD and TD program. The FHWA-administered programs receive funding for transportation research and education under Title V of SAFETEA, authorizing approximately $295 million annually. This includes funds for surface transportation research, training, education, Bureau of Transportation Statistics, and University Transportation Research Program. Research funds are used to advance technologies for highway improvements and safety. Title IX of SAFETEA focuses on improving highway pavements, structures, roadway safety, and studying highway policies. Technology deployment funds are allocated for specific research and projects, with state and industry experts emphasizing the importance of FHWA's RD and TD funds for maximizing federal aid funds. Congress is considering freight railroads' capacity to handle increasing trade volumes and highway congestion. Freight railroads are looking to expand infrastructure capacity without government aid. Congress is evaluating federal assistance for rail network expansion. Increased train traffic in towns causes delays for motor vehicles. Railroads are intensifying track usage for efficiency. Congressional concern remains over captive shippers since rail industry deregulation in 1980. In the 109th Congress, rail shippers served by a single railroad are facing high rates and poor service. SAFETEA addresses these issues in title IX, including a request for a report on rail system performance and funding mechanisms to tackle the problems. SAFETEA (section 9003) expands federal loan program for rail track rehabilitation and improvement. RRIF Program increases from $3.5 billion to $35 billion, with $7 billion reserved for smaller railroads. Loan approval process is expedited, with Secretary required to provide loans within 90 days. Loans can be issued without collateral and without prior loan applications. Additionally, loans can be issued for rail-to-rail competition purposes. SAFETEA (section 9002) creates a federal grants program for relocating or grade separating rail tracks to improve community traffic flow and economic development. The program authorizes $350 million annually from 2006 to 2009, with grants capped at $20 million and federal share not exceeding 90% of project cost. Enhancing rail infrastructure capacity and alleviating bottlenecks are added priorities for RRIF loans. SAFETEA authorizes federal grants for rail track relocation or grade separation, with a maximum federal share of 90% of project cost. Funding includes projects like improving rail connections in Chicago and eliminating grade crossings in various locations. Additionally, SAFETEA mandates a comprehensive study of the nation's rail transportation system post-deregulation in 1980. SAFETEA authorizes federal grants for rail track relocation or grade separation, with a maximum federal share of 90% of project cost. It includes projects to improve rail connections in Chicago and eliminate grade crossings. The legislation also mandates a study on the effectiveness of public policy in balancing the needs of railroads and shippers for reasonable rates and adequate service. Additionally, a new grant program called \"Freight Intermodal Distribution Pilot Grant Program\" is created to improve freight mobility around U.S. ports and intermodal facilities, with designated projects in Oregon, Georgia, California, Alaska, and North Carolina. The Recreational Trails Program (RTP) is a federal-aid program to help states develop and maintain recreational trails for various uses. It provides funds for activities such as hiking, biking, horseback riding, and off-road vehicle use. SAFETEA authorizes $370 million in contract authority for the RTP for FY2005-2009. The Recreational Trails Program (RTP) under SAFETEA authorizes funding levels for FY2005-2009, with specified amounts allocated annually. Funds are distributed to states based on a legislative formula, with requirements for how the funds are to be used for motorized, non-motorized, and diverse trail projects. The program also eliminates discretionary waivers for project allocations but retains exemptions for small states. The SAFETEA amendment to the Recreational Trails Program changes the federal share for projects and encourages states to use youth conservation corps. It expands permissible uses for funding, including trail safety and maintenance, with a limit of 5% for educational purposes. A new provision allows funding for trail condition assessment. SAFETEA allows pre-approval planning and environmental compliance costs to be credited towards the non-federal share for RTP projects. DOT must comply with NEPA requirements before proceeding with highway or transit project design, property acquisition, or construction. NEPA mandates the preparation of an environmental impact statement for federally funded actions that significantly impact human quality of life. The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires the preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for federally funded projects that significantly impact the human environment. Projects with unclear impacts require an Environmental Assessment (EA), and if impacts are deemed significant, an EIS must be prepared. Projects with no significant effects are processed as categorical exclusions. Compliance with Section 4(f) of the Department of Transportation Act of 1966 is also required within the NEPA process. Section 4(f) of the Department of Transportation Act of 1966 applies to the use of publicly owned parks, wildlife refuges, and historic sites. It prohibits using these resources for transportation projects unless no alternative exists, and the project minimizes harm. Environmental Streamlining provisions in TEA-21 aim to expedite federally funded transportation projects while protecting the environment. The Department of Transportation Act of 1966 prohibits the use of public parks, wildlife refuges, and historic sites for transportation projects unless no alternative exists. The Environmental Streamlining provisions in TEA-21 aim to expedite federally funded transportation projects while protecting the environment through improved interagency cooperation and a coordinated environmental review process for highway projects with significant environmental impact. Since TEA-21, administrative activities have been undertaken to facilitate streamlining. SAFETEA includes provisions to streamline the environmental review process for highway construction and transit projects, focusing on NEPA and Section 4(f) requirements. The goal is to expedite compliance with environmental regulations, similar to the efforts under TEA-21. The term \"streamlining\" is not explicitly used in SAFETEA, but the objective remains the same. SAFETEA provisions aim to expedite compliance with environmental regulations, particularly NEPA and Section 4(f). Key provisions include designating DOT as the lead agency, defining roles of lead and cooperating agencies, and establishing deadlines for decision-making. New entities like \"participating agencies\" are introduced to streamline the NEPA process. The SAFETEA provisions aim to expedite compliance with environmental regulations, including NEPA and Section 4(f). Key provisions include establishing deadlines for comments, a statute of limitations on judicial claims, using transportation funds to expedite reviews, a dispute resolution process, allowing states to determine project classifications, and creating state pilot programs for federal compliance responsibilities. Additionally, SAFETEA allows for the use of publicly owned parks and recreation areas under Section 4(f). SAFETEA provisions allow for the use of parks, wildlife refuges, and historic sites with \"de minimis impacts\" determined by relevant authorities. DOT is required to issue regulations clarifying factors for determining prudent and feasible alternatives under Section 4(f) requirements. Additionally, administrative procedures under the National Historic Preservation Act are specified for compliance. The Interstate System cannot be considered a \"historic site\" under Section 4(f) due to administrative procedures. However, individual elements may still have historic significance protected under Section 4(f). The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 established the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement (CMAQ) program to reduce emissions from highway travel and assist states in complying with air quality standards. Funding was authorized for projects targeting carbon monoxide and ozone reduction. The CMAQ program funds projects to reduce carbon monoxide and ozone emissions, including transportation control measures, auto emission control programs, alternative fuel vehicles, traffic flow improvements, and pedestrian/bicycle facilities. Funding is apportioned based on population and pollution needs, with a minimum guarantee for states without nonattainment areas. TEA-21 expanded the program to include projects aimed at reducing emissions. SAFETEA expanded CMAQ funding eligibility to include projects like advanced truck stop electrification systems, transportation systems management improvements, emergency communications equipment, and diesel retrofits. Total CMAQ funding for FY2005-FY2009 was $8.6 billion, compared to $8.1 billion under TEA-21. SAFETEA expanded CMAQ funding eligibility to include projects like advanced truck stop electrification systems, transportation systems management improvements, interoperable emergency communications equipment, and diesel retrofits. SAFETEA changes requirements for states receiving minimum apportionment to use CMAQ funds for eligible projects. DOT is directed to evaluate CMAQ projects' impacts on air quality and congestion levels and maintain a project impact database. As of May 2005, 124 areas with a total population of 159 million people were required to develop State Implementation Plans (SIPs) under the Clean Air Act. Federal agencies are prohibited from funding projects in these areas unless they conform to the SIPs to prevent new violations or delays in reaching air quality standards due to increased vehicle emissions from new highways. The Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) must demonstrate conformity with emissions regulations every two years to receive federal funds for highway and transit projects. Conformity requirements are expected to become more challenging due to increased emissions from SUVs and light trucks, higher vehicle miles traveled, stricter air quality standards, and recent court decisions tightening conformity rules. The Clean Air Act requires metropolitan areas to reduce vehicle and industrial emissions to avoid a suspension of highway and transit funds. A 2003 survey by the Government Accountability Office found that only 5 areas had to change transportation plans in the past six years, but one-third of planners expect future difficulties in demonstrating conformity. Waivers of conformity are not allowed, with only a one-year grace period after an area is designated as nonattainment. The Clean Air Act requires metropolitan areas to reduce emissions to avoid funding suspension. Only limited exempt projects can be funded in nonattainment areas, with a one-year grace period. Concerns include limitations on funding new emission-reducing projects and a mismatch between planning cycles. The GAO recommended extending the time frame between transportation plan updates to better coordinate conformity demonstrations. The Clean Air Act requires metropolitan areas to reduce emissions to avoid funding suspension. P.L. 109-59, generally supported by transportation planners but opposed by environmental groups, requires less frequent conformity demonstrations and shortens the planning horizon to 10 years in many cases. The law also establishes a 12-month grace period following a failure to demonstrate conformity before a lapse would be declared."
