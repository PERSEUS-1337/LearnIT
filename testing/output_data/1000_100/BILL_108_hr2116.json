    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Tar Creek Restoration Act\". It includes findings related to the restoration project. The Tar Creek Superfund Site in Ottawa County, Oklahoma, was a lead and zinc mining area from the early 1900s to the 1970s. Mining operations on Indian land required pumping water from the Boone Aquifer. The site is flood-prone and part of the Tri-State Mining District. During World War I and II, mining at the Tar Creek Superfund Site accounted for over 45% of the Nation's wartime lead and zinc consumption. Millions of tons of waste tailings were created and recommended to be stockpiled aboveground for later reprocessing. In 1960, Congress passed an act to encourage lead and zinc production at the site, but as mining declined in the 1970s, underground mine workings began to refill with water from the Boone Aquifer. In the 1970s, underground mine workings at the Tar Creek Superfund Site began refilling with water from the Boone Aquifer, leading to the creation of acid mine water. Despite efforts by the Environmental Protection Agency starting in 1984 to remediate the water, it was deemed essentially impossible in 1994 after spending millions of dollars. The site has over 1,300 mine shafts and 100,000 boreholes, with many open mine shafts still posing a source of contamination. The stockpiled chat at the Site, laced with heavy metals like lead, contributes to flood problems in the area. It also recharges underground mine workings and has been used in construction, contaminating residential areas with toxic substances. In 1994, the EPA started remediation of residential yards contaminated with unsafe lead levels. Studies show many children at the Site have high blood lead levels, leading to health issues. Dust from stockpiled chat poses a health risk. Mining activities caused cave-ins near populated areas and schools. The Site poses environmental and health risks due to stockpiled chat, subsidence dangers, and high lead levels in children. No remediation efforts have been made by the US Government, and the Site can never be safe for human habitation.

The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency will provide assistance under the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 to residents in the Tar Creek Superfund site in Oklahoma. The EPA will continue to be responsible for the cleanup of the site, and will work towards a comprehensive resolution with other appropriate entities. The Environmental Protection Agency will collaborate with other officials to address environmental and health issues at the Tar Creek Superfund site."
