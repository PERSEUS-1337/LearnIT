    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Pulmonary Hypertension Research and Education Act of 2007\". The Congress finds that pulmonary hypertension is a serious and often fatal condition where blood pressure in the lungs rises to dangerously high levels. The walls of the arteries thickening and constricting, causing the right side of the heart to pump harder, leading to enlargement and potential failure. Federal investment in pulmonary hypertension research must be expanded to find a cure or effective treatment, and collaboration among research centers should be increased. Pulmonary hypertension is difficult to diagnose and is rarely detected in routine medical examinations. In advanced stages, pulmonary hypertension limits activity and causes symptoms even at rest, leading to disability. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute established the first patient registry in 1981 to study the disease. Research on pulmonary hypertension has been ongoing for more than seven years, with studies focusing on immunologic and genetic factors, agents causing narrowing of blood vessels, and factors leading to cell growth and scar tissue formation. Treatments for pulmonary hypertension have advanced with six FDA-approved medications and more in trials, although effectiveness varies among patients. The number of physicians treating pulmonary hypertension and patients receiving treatment has significantly increased over the past decade, leading to a growing need for medical professional education. Lung transplantation is often a last resort treatment for pulmonary hypertension, as not all medications are effective and have significant side effects impacting patients' quality of life. Despite the availability of easy-to-administer oral therapies, managing pulmonary hypertension remains complex. Education of medical professionals is crucial for optimal patient care. A landmark meeting in December 2006 emphasized the importance of communication among researchers for future advancements in treating this disease. The Public Health Service Act is amended to expand pulmonary hypertension research and training through the creation of a Pulmonary Hypertension Clinical Research Network. The Director of the Institute will establish a Pulmonary Hypertension Clinical Research Network to conduct clinical trials for new treatments and promote collaboration among experts in the field. The network will include at least 15 designated clinical centers. The Director will appoint key personnel and committees for the Pulmonary Hypertension Clinical Research Network, including a project scientist, data center, safety monitoring board, steering committee, and protocol review committee. The steering committee of the Pulmonary Hypertension Clinical Research Network determines clinical trials, sets standards for subject selection, develops protocols, and publishes results. Trials may include combination therapies, new drug avenues, endothelial progenitor cell use, and treatment effect discovery. The Institute is responsible for managing and supporting the network, including monitoring trial progress, ensuring disclosure of conflicts of interest, and adhering to Institute policies. The Institute appoints a grants management specialist to assist in fiscal management of the network. The Director also appoints members of various committees for oversight. The Director of the Institute will establish a Pulmonary Hypertension Preceptorship and Training Program through a grant to a national nonprofit entity. The program aims to educate medical professionals in clinical settings to increase the number of physicians in the United States. The program aims to increase the number of physicians in the United States trained to diagnose, treat, and manage pulmonary hypertension by establishing regional training sites at academic health centers, hospitals, or private medical practices. Each site will have a designated contact, and a percentage of grant funds will be allocated for program purposes. The grant funds allocated for providing stipends to site contacts and recruiting health professionals. Nonprofit entities will establish enrollment mechanisms and program guidelines in collaboration with training sites and the Institute. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2009 through 2012 is provided for program implementation. Increasing public awareness of pulmonary hypertension. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will develop and share information on pulmonary hypertension, including basic information, incidence, diseases linked to it, importance of early diagnosis, and treatment options. This information will be disseminated through a national non-profit entity with expertise in pulmonary hypertension. Authorization of Appropriations.--For the purpose of carrying out this section, there are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary for each of the fiscal years 2009 through 2012. SEC. 5. DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION TO HEALTH PROFESSIONALS ON PULMONARY HYPERTENSION. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will develop and provide information on pulmonary hypertension to healthcare providers, including warning signs, early diagnosis importance, diagnostic criteria, and FDA-approved therapies. This information will be disseminated to various healthcare professionals to ensure they remain informed about the disease. Human Services will disseminate information on pulmonary hypertension through a national non-profit entity with expertise in the field. Authorization of appropriations is provided for fiscal years 2009 through 2012. The Comptroller General of the United States will conduct a study on Medicare and Medicaid coverage standards for individuals with pulmonary hypertension, detailing coverage for FDA-approved therapies. The study will consider outpatient or home health care settings for service delivery. A report on the findings must be submitted to Congress within six months of the Act's enactment."
