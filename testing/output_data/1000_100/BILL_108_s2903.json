    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Nonprofit Athletic Organization Protection Act of 2004\". Congress finds that amateur sports and education-based athletics are important for youth development, academic achievement, and social skills. Nonprofit organizations strive to prioritize the well-being of young athletes despite the risks of injuries. Amateur athletics promote physical fitness and lower obesity levels in young participants. Playing rules in sports are necessary to ensure age-appropriate competition and safety. Despite the inherent risks, injuries cannot be completely avoided in sports due to the intense physical activity involved. Rules makers in amateur sports are facing an increasing number of lawsuits for negligence in developing or not adopting specific rules. Defending these claims can hinder their ability to provide services and discourage top coaches, officials, and administrators from participating in rule committees. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"economic loss\" refers to pecuniary loss from harm, including loss of earnings, medical expenses, and loss of business opportunities. \"Harm\" includes physical, nonphysical, economic, and noneconomic losses. \"Noneconomic loss\" encompasses physical and emotional pain, suffering, mental anguish, and loss of enjoyment of life. The curr_chunk defines \"nonprofit organization\" as an organization exempt from tax under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, and \"nonprofit athletic organization\" as a nonprofit organization primarily involved in athletic competitions. The term \"State\" includes the District of Columbia and any commonwealth, territory, or possession of the United States. SEC. 4. LIMITATION ON LIABILITY FOR NONPROFIT ATHLETIC ORGANIZATIONS. Liability protection is granted to nonprofit athletic organizations for harm caused by their actions or omissions in adopting rules for sanctioned competitions or practices, as long as they were acting within their duties, properly licensed, and the harm was not due to willful misconduct or negligence. The section outlines exceptions to liability protection for nonprofit athletic organizations, including cases of misconduct, negligence, or reckless behavior. It also specifies that employees, agents, and volunteers can still be held responsible in civil actions. Additionally, state laws requiring risk management procedures or training are not considered inconsistent with this liability protection. State laws can hold nonprofit athletic organizations liable for the actions of their employees, agents, and volunteers similar to employer liability. The limitation of liability does not apply if the civil action is brought by a government officer. This limitation does not cover claims related to antitrust, labor, environmental, defamation, tortious interference of contract law, civil rights law, or discrimination protection. SEC. 5. PREEMPTION.\n\nThis Act preempts State laws inconsistent with it, except for laws providing extra liability protection for nonprofit athletic organizations' rule-making activities.\n\nSEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\nThis Act takes effect upon enactment and applies to claims for harm caused by nonprofit athletic organizations' actions filed after the effective date."
