In response to the 1970s energy crisis, Congress promoted distributed generation, including customer-sited generation like net metering. Net metering allows electric consumers to use energy generated on-site to offset energy provided by the utility. Net metering allows electric consumers to use on-site generated energy to offset utility-provided energy. Solar PV is the most common type in net metering, with federal and state policies influencing its deployment. Recent state policy changes impact solar energy development pace, with Congress having options to consider. This report provides background information and discusses current issues related to net metering policy, which determines how electricity customers with distributed generation are compensated for electricity they deliver to the grid. Net metering is often used to mean a policy of net energy metering (NEM), where electricity delivered to the grid is compensated on a one-to-one basis for electricity purchased from the grid. Net metering policies determine how electricity customers with distributed generation are compensated for the electricity they deliver to the grid. As of April 2019, 45 states had net metering policies in place that require utilities to offer net metering to customers, with some policies including alternatives to net energy metering. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), almost 2 million customers participated in net metering programs in the United States in 2018, representing about 1% of U.S. electricity customers. The number of net metering customers increased from 2013 to 2018. Data before 2013 also show growth in net metering participation, but EIA changed the way it reported net metering data beginning in 2013. According to EIA data, net metering participation varies by state, with Hawaii having the highest rate at over 15% of customers. Factors influencing participation include state policies, renewable standards, electricity prices, and solar resources. Electricity ratemaking is the process of allocating total costs to customers for producing and delivering electricity. State regulators approve rates for utilities to charge customers, ensuring cost recovery through bill payments. Electricity ratemaking involves allocating costs to customers for power generation and distribution. This includes building and operating power plants, maintaining the grid, utility operating costs, programmatic costs, and a return on investments. Rates are typically set based on volumetric rates, where customers within the same class pay a set rate per kilowatt-hour, resulting in higher bills for higher electricity usage. Customers' bills vary monthly based on electricity consumption. Regulators estimate a volumetric rate to cover utility costs shared among all customers. Customer charges, separate from electricity rates, appear as fixed values on bills. Bills include volumetric charges and fixed customer charges. EPACT05 encouraged states to adopt net metering, but did not specify compensation methods. States have implemented different approaches, impacting DG markets. Compensation mechanisms strongly influence the value proposition of DG investments for customers. The section discusses states' approaches to implementing net metering, where customers are compensated at the utility's retail rate of electricity. Initially, policymakers viewed the retail rate as a proxy for the value of solar or DG, assuming it was acceptable when markets for solar PV were uneconomic. The retail rate for net metering provides high compensation for participating customers, allowing them to recover upfront costs of a DG system quickly. This approach may encourage more participation compared to other compensation methods. Compensating net metering customers at the retail rate may lead to increased costs for non-net metering customers due to a cost shift or cross-subsidy. This arises from the allocation of total utility costs among all customers, where net metering customers reduce their electricity needs but not other utility-provided services, potentially causing rates for non-net metering customers to rise to cover grid maintenance costs. Some stakeholders have raised concerns about potential equity issues with residential net metering customers having higher incomes than non-net metering customers, leading to cross-subsidy worries. Studies vary in estimating the extent of cross-subsidies, with methodological differences contributing to the lack of consensus. Local factors like distributed generation penetration and electricity demand growth can also impact observed cross-subsidies. One synthesis of estimates around 2015 found that net metering cost shifts range from $444 to $1,752 per customer per year. Observers may disagree on the need for policy action regarding cross-subsidies. A 2017 study assessed various factors affecting electricity rates, including net metering, and found that DG would likely cause rate increases between 0.03 cents/kWh and 0.2 cents/kWh. The presence of cost shifts in net metering does not necessarily mean money is transferred from non-net metering customers. Addressing cost shifts can be delayed due to ratemaking processes. Cost shifts are not unique to distributed generation (DG) and are unavoidable in rate design. Some states are moving towards more precise allocations of system costs and benefits for net metering customers. States are considering options like adding fixed charges or changing compensation rates for net metering customers to address concerns about cross-subsidies. This approach aims to help utilities recover grid maintenance costs while maintaining advantages like administrative simplicity. Utilities and advocates for low-income customers support this approach to reduce cost shifting. Adding fixed charges or alternative compensation rates can reduce cost shifting and increase fairness, but opponents, such as the solar industry and environmental advocates, argue that it hinders competition and overlooks the societal benefits of distributed generation. Determining the value of fixed charges accurately reflecting net metering customers' grid use has been complex. Some states have adopted an avoided cost rate to represent the energy costs utilities save when customers generate their own energy. The avoided cost rate, also known as an energy rate or wholesale rate, primarily reflects energy production costs. It may include network upgrades for integrating distributed generation like solar PV. This rate is typically lower than retail rates and can be estimated by regulators or through wholesale electricity markets. Net metering customers with solar PV may be compensated based on a value of solar (VOS) rate. The value of solar (VOS) rate reflects estimated societal benefits of distributed solar PV, such as reduced air emissions. Solar advocates support including societal benefits in net metering policies. VOS is typically higher than avoided cost rates but lower than retail rates. New York is one state implementing a related compensation rate for distributed energy resources (DERs) to reflect grid and societal benefits. The debate around alternative compensation approaches for distributed generation (DG) includes considerations of costs, benefits, and quantification challenges. States vary in their evaluation of net metering, as shown in a 2018 analysis of 15 state studies. State net metering policies vary in aspects beyond compensation, such as program caps, source eligibility, credit retention, and system ownership, which can impact DG deployment. Program caps set limits on participation based on power units or percentage of electricity demand, influencing the promotion of DG. State net metering policies vary in aspects beyond compensation, such as program caps, source eligibility, and technology type restrictions. Solar energy is the dominant source for net metering capacity, but some states allow other energy types to participate based on cost factors, customer type, and location. State net metering policies vary in aspects beyond compensation, such as program caps, source eligibility, and technology type restrictions. Factors like customer type (e.g., commercial, industrial) and location (e.g., urban, rural) can also influence the attractiveness of certain renewable energy projects. For example, combined heat and power facilities may appeal to large commercial and industrial customers, while distributed wind projects may be more attractive to farms or customers with large acreage. Net metering customers can deliver surplus generation to the grid and receive compensation based on state policies. Credit retention policies vary by state and determine how long credits can carry over, potentially reducing electricity costs to $0 for net metering customers. Different arrangements like aggregate net metering for farms or municipalities, shared net metering for community solar projects, and virtual net metering for multi-family dwellings are allowed in some states. Some Members of Congress have introduced legislation addressing states' net metering policies, including limiting state regulators' ability to change compensation rates or add fixed charges. Other proposals require regulators to consider if net metering policies create cross-subsidies. H.R. 4175 in the 116th Congress would mandate states to consider adopting net billing policies for community projects. In the 116th Congress, legislation is being proposed to study the costs and benefits of net metering and distributed solar generation. Bills such as S. 346 and H.R. 1009 would require the National Academies to study various aspects of net metering, including alternative incentives for distributed generation and consumer incentives."
