    "content": "REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR WETLAND RESTORATION AND CONSERVATION EXPENSES. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to include a new section on wetland restoration and conservation expenses. The wetland restoration credit allows eligible taxpayers to claim a credit against the tax imposed for the taxable year, including wetland restoration, conservation, and easement credits. The wetland restoration credit is based on expenditures for restoring farmed or converted wetlands to their natural state, following an approved restoration plan. The wetland conservation credit is available to eligible taxpayers for restoring farmed or converted wetlands to their natural state. The credit is based on expenditures made during the first 5 years of a qualified conservation agreement or easement, approved by the Natural Resources Conservation Service. The credit is calculated as the applicable percentage of the soil-specific Conservation Reserve Program rental rate for the taxpayer's qualified wetland. The wetland conservation credit is available to eligible taxpayers for restoring farmed or converted wetlands to their natural state. The credit is based on expenditures made during the first 5 years of a qualified conservation agreement or easement. The applicable percentage varies based on the term of the agreement, ranging from 50% to 70%. The wetland conservation credit is available to eligible taxpayers for restoring farmed or converted wetlands to their natural state. The credit is based on expenditures made during the first 5 years of a qualified conservation agreement or easement, with the percentage varying based on the agreement term. If a taxpayer elects a wetland easement credit for a qualified wetland, the wetland conservation credit for that wetland is zero. The wetland conservation credit is available to eligible taxpayers who own wetlands, farmed wetlands, or prior converted wetlands, along with surrounding actively farmed cropland, and have entered into a qualified conservation agreement or easement. The value of the qualified wetland in agricultural use is determined by a certified appraisal during the taxable year. An election under this subsection applies to the taxable year for which it is made. The term 'qualified wetland' refers to wetlands being converted to fully functioning condition through restoration expenditures, along with surrounding nonwetland areas that buffer water quality or wildlife habitat values, as specified in a conservation agreement or easement. The term 'qualified wetland' includes wetlands and surrounding nonwetland areas, with certain exclusions for land receiving payments from conservation programs. Wetland, farmed wetland, and prior converted wetland are defined by the Food Security Act of 1985. The term 'qualified conservation agreement' refers to an agreement with a governmental unit for 10-30 years, where the taxpayer agrees to comply with conservation requirements for a qualified wetland and obtain compliance certification every 5 years. An eligible taxpayer complies with conservation requirements by not using the wetland for agriculture and not manipulating it to enable agricultural production or development of built structures. The term 'qualified conservation easement' refers to an easement granted in perpetuity by the taxpayer to restrict the use of wetlands for conservation purposes. No credit is allowed for expenses already deducted or received from other programs. The section specifies that married couples must file joint returns for the taxpayer to be eligible. Conforming amendments are made to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1998."
