    "content": "The \"Cord Blood Education and Awareness Act of 2009\" includes sections on public education campaigns, patient informed consent, professional education, targeted education grants, and authorization of appropriations. The Act also contains findings related to cord blood education and awareness. Congress finds that leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma are responsible for a significant number of deaths in the United States, particularly among children and young adults. Many leukemia patients require bone marrow transplants but struggle to find a suitable match. Umbilical cord blood stem cells are highlighted as a potential solution in this Act. Umbilical cord blood stem cells have been effectively used in over 14,000 transplants worldwide in the last 20 years. They are a rich source of stem cells for transplantation, especially for children, with lower rates of graft versus host disease compared to bone marrow. Cord blood cells have successfully treated nonmalignant blood, immune, and metabolic disorders such as aplastic anemia, sickle cell anemia, and immunodeficiencies. Cord blood cells contain various types of stem cells that can differentiate into different cell types in the body, reduce inflammation, and promote tissue repair. Research is ongoing for using cord blood cells to treat conditions like type 1 diabetes, brain injury, cerebral palsy, hearing loss, renal failure, spinal cord injury, and congenital heart defects. In the United States, over 90% of cord blood cells from 4 million births are discarded annually. Only a few states mandate informing parents about banking options. The Institute of Medicine recommended clear information and balanced perspectives on cord blood banking in 2005. \"Informed consent for cord blood collection, storage, and use should be obtained before labor and delivery, following adequate information disclosure.\" SEC. 3. PUBLIC EDUCATION CAMPAIGN. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must develop a publication on umbilical cord blood within a year of this Act. It will explain the value and uses of cord blood, differences between autologous and allogeneic use, and public vs. private cord blood banking. The options available to a mother regarding umbilical cord blood after delivery include donating to a public bank, storing in a private family bank, or storing for family members through a donor program. The curr_chunk discusses the medical processes involved in collecting cord blood, criteria for umbilical cord blood banking, options for ownership and future use of donated cord blood, and the cost and availability of public and private cord blood banks. The curr_chunk provides information on accredited private cord blood banks, availability of free family banking and sibling donor programs, and the need for publicly donated cord blood samples among specific racial and ethnic groups based on medical data. The Secretary will develop a patient informed consent document on cord blood disposition, to be signed by expectant women before delivery. The document will include information on cord blood banking options, medical value of cord blood stem cells, and a declaration of the chosen disposition option. Certain professionals must disclose information and obtain informed consent from pregnant patients. Effective 1 year after the enactment of this Act, healthcare professionals providing prenatal care must disclose information on umbilical cord blood banking options to pregnant women before the third trimester. They must also obtain written informed consent regarding the disposition of cord blood stem cells at least 2 weeks before the woman's estimated delivery date. The provider must obtain written informed consent from pregnant women for the disposition of cord blood stem cells before the estimated delivery date. Physicians providing ambulatory prenatal care must comply with this requirement. The provider must comply with requirements for pregnant women's care and enforcement methods. If a State fails to comply, payment reductions may be imposed. Amendments are made to sections related to CHIP. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 is amended to include informing pregnant women about blood cord banking in group health plans. Physicians providing ambulatory prenatal care to pregnant women must comply with specific requirements. State laws apply, and the amendments apply to agreements made after the enactment of the Act. The Secretary will create educational materials on umbilical cord blood stem cells for healthcare providers offering prenatal services to pregnant women. Additionally, targeted education grants will be provided. The Secretary may provide grants for targeted education on umbilical cord blood stem cells to healthcare providers, ethnic minorities, families with genetic diseases, and populations affected by conditions treated with cord blood. Authorization of appropriations is also included. Authorization of appropriations for the Act includes $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2010 and $5,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2011 to 2014."
