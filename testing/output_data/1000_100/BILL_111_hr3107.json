    "content": "The Act titled \"Stop Nuclear Assistance to State Sponsors of Terrorism Act of 2009\" is referred to as such. It includes findings related to the issue. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was established in 1957 with the objective of promoting atomic energy for peaceful purposes and preventing its use for military purposes. The United States is the largest financial contributor to the IAEA's regular budget. The IAEA's Technical Cooperation Program provides nuclear technical cooperation for peaceful purposes to countries worldwide through voluntary contributions. The United States is the largest financial contributor to the IAEA's Technical Cooperation Fund. A report by the Government Accountability Office found that Cuba, Iran, Sudan, and Syria received over $55 million in technical cooperation assistance from 1997 to 2007, despite being designated as state sponsors of terrorism. These countries received over $4.4 million in assistance in 2008. Proliferation concerns about the Technical Cooperation Program have persisted. The Technical Cooperation Program has raised proliferation concerns due to its assistance to certain countries like Iran, which has projects related to nuclear power plants. The United States faces challenges in fully identifying and resolving these concerns due to a lack of formal mechanisms for obtaining project information during the proposal phase. The GAO report highlighted limited documentation on how proliferation concerns were addressed in Technical Cooperation Program proposals and identified shortcomings in U.S. policies and IAEA procedures related to TC program fellowships. The report also noted that the IAEA does not exclude countries based on political considerations and that there are no distinctions between \"good\" and \"bad\" countries in providing technical cooperation. The GAO report raised concerns about the potential for Technical Cooperation Program assistance to advance weapons of mass destruction programs in U.S.-designated state sponsors of terrorism. It also questioned the State Department's confidence in the IAEA's safeguards to prevent TC projects from contributing to weapons development. Additionally, the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 prohibited funds for programs in Libya, Iran, Cuba, or the Palestine Liberation Organization. The Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1998 and the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 imposed restrictions on funding for IAEA programs in Cuba. The GAO report suggested withholding a portion of future contributions to the Technical Cooperation Fund proportional to the amount provided for projects in Cuba. The IAEA has reported Iran's violations of UN Security Council Resolutions regarding heavy water projects and uranium enrichment. UN Resolution 1737 limits technical cooperation with Iran to humanitarian purposes. The IAEA Director General reported that Iran has 7,000 centrifuges for uranium enrichment, running almost 5,000 of them, with a stockpile of over 1,300 kilograms of low-enriched uranium. This amount is considered enough for further enrichment into high-enriched uranium for a potential atomic bomb. The IAEA Director General has raised concerns about Iran's nuclear program, citing issues with the implementation of the Additional Protocol and lack of transparency regarding centrifuge manufacturing and uranium enrichment activities. Iran has repeatedly failed to cooperate with the IAEA regarding concerns about possible military dimensions of its nuclear program and has refused to comply with multiple resolutions, blocking inspections of its nuclear facilities. Iran continues to block IAEA inspections of its nuclear facilities, denying access to the enrichment site at Natanz and refusing to place additional surveillance cameras. In April 2008, it was revealed that Syria, with North Korea's help, was building a secret nuclear reactor at Dair Alzour capable of producing plutonium for nuclear weapons. On April 28, 2008, General Michael Hayden stated that the Syrian reactor at Dair Alzour could produce enough plutonium for 1 or 2 bombs within a year of becoming operational. The IAEA Director General reported on November 19, 2008, that the Syrian facility at Dair Alzour resembled an undeclared nuclear reactor, with Syria not providing requested documentation or agreeing to visits to other locations. The Board of Governors stated on June 15, 2009, that Syria's limited information and access hindered the Agency from determining the nature of the destroyed facility at Dair Alzour. Uranium particles were found at the Miniature Neutron Source Reactor facility in Damascus, which were not included in Syria's declared inventory of nuclear material.

No US funds to IAEA can support assistance to countries like North Korea that are state sponsors of terrorism or in breach of nuclear agreements or under investigation. The Secretary of State must withhold voluntary contributions within 30 days of this Act's enactment. The Secretary of State must withhold US contributions to the IAEA proportional to the amount spent on assistance to specified countries. If the withholding is not done within 30 days, a specified amount will be withheld from the US assessed contribution to the IAEA. SEC. 4. WAIVER. The provisions in subsections (b) and (c) of section 3 may be waived if the IAEA suspends assistance to countries in section 3(a) or if the President certifies these countries no longer pose a threat. SEC. 5. UNITED STATES ACTIONS AT IAEA. The President will direct the US Representative to the IAEA to block funds for assistance to countries in section 3(a). SEC. 6. REPORT. The President must submit a report on the implementation of the Act to congressional committees within six months of its enactment. Definitions are provided in Section 7. Section 7 of the Act defines key terms, including \"appropriate congressional committees\" and \"state sponsor of terrorism.\""
