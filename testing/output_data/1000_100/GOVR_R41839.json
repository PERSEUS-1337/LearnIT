    "content": "The Dodd-Frank Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) within the Federal Reserve System to oversee various consumer financial products and services. The CFPB has regulatory, supervisory, and enforcement authority over institutions offering deposit taking, mortgage lending, credit card lending, loan servicing, and other financial services. The CFPB, established by the Dodd-Frank Act, is the primary federal consumer financial supervisor overseeing institutions offering various financial products. It has the authority to implement federal consumer laws like TILA and RESPA, with most powers becoming effective on the designated transfer date, currently set for July 21, 2011. The CFPB, established by the Dodd-Frank Act, is set to transfer powers on July 21, 2011. The Bureau's authority is tied to the appointment of a Director, who has not been nominated yet. Until then, the Secretary has limited interim authority under the CFP Act. Section 1066 of the CFP Act grants the Secretary interim authority over the Bureau, with subsection 1066(b) allowing the Treasury Department to provide administrative services before the designated transfer date. The specific scope of these services is not defined, but they may include HR support and securing communication services. The Treasury Department's administrative support powers under section 1066(b) are in effect from the date of enactment until the designated transfer date. The Secretary's interim authorities under CFP Act subsection 1066(a) allow them to perform functions of the Bureau until the Director is confirmed by the Senate. This authority is limited to the functions of the Bureau under subtitle F. The Secretary's authorities under subsection 1066(a) do not expire until a Director is appointed, and the majority of the CFPB's authorities do not go into effect until the designated transfer date. Subtitle F transfers consumer financial protection functions from seven \"transferor agencies\" to the Bureau. The Bureau will receive authority from various agencies including the FDIC, NCUA, FTC, and HUD, encompassing rulemaking, supervision, enforcement, and compliance examination over larger depository institutions. The CFPB has the authority to coordinate the transfer of employees from transferor agencies to perform transferred authorities. Identified personnel must be transferred to the Bureau within 90 days. Most authorities under subtitle F will go into effect on the designated transfer date. The Secretary may exercise all transferred authorities until a CFPB Director is appointed. The CFPB has the authority to coordinate the transfer of employees from transferor agencies to perform transferred authorities. Most authorities under subtitle F will go into effect on the designated transfer date. The Secretary may exercise all transferred authorities until a CFPB Director is appointed. Additionally, the Bureau's newly established powers include enhanced consumer protection authorities not previously provided to federal regulators before the Dodd-Frank Act. The newly established authorities of the CFPB include enhanced supervisory powers over non-depository financial institutions, new rulemaking powers, and consumer compliance enforcement powers over smaller depository institutions. The CFPB can supervise non-depository providers of payday loans, mortgage loans, mortgage brokerage services, foreclosure relief services, and student loans. The Bureau has flexibility to identify other types of institutions that may be subject to its supervision. The CFPB has the authority to supervise non-depository financial institutions, conduct examinations, impose reporting requirements, and establish eligibility standards for covered institutions to ensure compliance with consumer laws and detect risks to consumers. The CFPB has the authority to supervise non-depository financial institutions, conduct examinations, impose reporting requirements, and establish eligibility standards for covered institutions to ensure compliance with consumer laws and detect risks to consumers. Section 1024 provides the CFPB with consumer compliance enforcement powers over covered non-depository financial institutions, while section 1022 establishes the Bureau's general authority to prescribe regulations, issue orders, and issue guidance to administer and carry out the purposes of federal consumer financial laws. Subtitle C of the CFPB grants the Bureau the authority to issue specific regulations, including declaring acts or practices as unfair, deceptive, or abusive. It also allows the Bureau to require disclosures for consumer financial products and services. While the general rulemaking provisions of subtitle B are already in effect, the specific rulemaking authorities under subtitle C will come into effect on a designated transfer date. The Bureau's enforcement and supervisory powers over smaller depository institutions are limited, leaving them with a secondary role. The CFPB has limited supervisory and enforcement authority over smaller depository institutions, playing a secondary role to banking regulators. The Bureau can refer enforcement actions to banking regulators and participate in examinations on a sampling basis. It has access to examination reports and can require smaller depository institutions to submit reports directly. The Bureau's limited supervisory and enforcement authority over smaller depository institutions will take effect on the designated transfer date. The newly established powers provided for by provisions other than subtitle F may not be within the scope of the Secretary's interim Bureau authorities. Actions taken by the Bureau so far have been administrative functions or preparation for substantive authorities to go into effect. The Bureau has taken administrative and preparatory steps for the exercise of substantive authorities that will go into effect on the designated transfer date, including talking to interested parties, collecting information, coordinating personnel transfers, conducting planning meetings, hiring new personnel, and securing office space and websites. The Treasury Department's CFPB responsibilities, as outlined in its 2010 annual report, align with the Bureau's planned activities for the designated transfer date. The Bureau will acquire consumer compliance supervisory and enforcement powers over larger depository institutions post-transfer date. The Secretary's interim Bureau powers may expand after the designated transfer date if a Director has not been appointed, potentially leading to substantive actions impacting financial institutions in consumer markets. For example, the FRB proposed regulations under TILA to impose origination standards on certain mortgage lenders, open for comments until July 22, 2011. The authority to prescribe regulations under TILA will transfer to the Bureau on July 22, 2011. Final regulations imposing mortgage origination standards must be prescribed by the Bureau, not the FRB. The Secretary may also have the authority to issue these regulations until a Bureau Director is appointed. Parties may initiate lawsuits claiming actions under the CFP Act exceed the Secretary's authority, with unpredictable outcomes due to various facts and circumstances."
