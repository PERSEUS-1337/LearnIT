    "content": "Human history began in Africa, with human ancestors evolving into homosapiens around 200,000 years ago. Small bands of modern humans migrated out of Africa 50,000 to 100,000 years ago, becoming ancestors of all human populations. The Bantu people of West Africa expanded their settlement around 2,500-5,000 years ago, becoming predominant in sub-Saharan Africa. Nilo-Saharan language speakers are found in the Sahel grasslands and parts of eastern Africa. The Nilo-Saharan languages may have originated in the Nile valley, but the term \"Nilotic\" is no longer used due to intermingling with Bantu speakers. Bantu agriculture was not suitable for extreme southern Africa, where the Khoisan people lived. By 500 BC, the Bantu had mastered iron smelting, leading to successful agriculture and expansion. European explorers in Africa after 1450 AD found farmers growing a variety of crops, including bananas. After the discovery of America, African farmers quickly adopted New World crops like maize and peanuts. By 1500, an estimated 47 million Africans were living in farming communities across the continent. Some regions, like Kenya's Rift Valley, relied on a pastoral lifestyle, exchanging livestock for grains. The lack of large towns and cities in Africa was likely due to the risk of diseases that had evolved with humans on the continent. African societies had diverse cultural practices and languages, with loyalties centered around extended families and clans rather than large ethnic groups. Powerful individuals or chiefs, known as \"big men,\" emerged in some areas, providing protection and economic support. This social structure differed from the political landscape in present-day Africa. African kingdoms developed through powerful chiefs consolidating authority via conquest and alliances. The Kongo kingdom, with a powerful king ruling several provinces, showcased great artistic achievements. The Atlantic slave trade began in 1441, lasting 400 years and involving around 10 million people. During the 400-year Atlantic slave trade, between 10-13 million people were taken from Africa, with most going to Brazil and the Caribbean. The peak occurred in the 18th century, with annual totals reaching 100,000. In 1807, the British parliament voted to end the trade, leading to the Royal Navy intercepting over 1,600 ships and freeing 160,000 captives. The Atlantic slave trade conducted by European traders on the West African coast involved purchasing slaves with goods like guns, alcohol, and cowrie shells. Slavery in Africa was practiced through capturing people in wars or as punishment, with some victims being kidnapped for the trade. The Atlantic slave trade involved capturing slaves in Africa through wars, punishment, and kidnapping victims. Historians note that slaves in traditional African societies were treated less harshly than in the New World. The trade led to turmoil, outbreaks of war, and instability in West Africa, fueled by the exchange of slaves for guns. Warfare related to the slave trade, loss of millions of productive individuals, and psychological damage weakened African societies. The Atlantic slave trade caused turmoil and instability in West Africa, weakening societies. By 1870, European powers were preparing to colonize Africa, despite the potential for indigenous political entities to develop into nation-states. For example, the kingdom of Ashanti in West Africa and Buganda in East Africa were thriving with strong central governments, advanced trade, and powerful leaders. In the 19th century, secondary empires emerged in Africa, relying on European military technology and promoting Islam. Holy wars led to the creation of a vast West African Islamic empire centered on Sokoto. In East Africa, the sultans of Zanzibar extended their power, while Egypt expanded its control. In southern Africa, the Boers, descendants of Dutch, Huguenot, and German settlers, established a secondary empire in the 19th century. They defeated the Zulu with modern weapons and tactics, establishing farms in depopulated grasslands. The European scramble for Africa halted the development of indigenous political entities in the region, with British forces ending the last resistance in Somalia in 1920. By then, all of sub-Saharan Africa, except for Ethiopia and Liberia, was under European control. Ethiopia resisted Italian colonization, defeating them at Adowa in 1896, but was unable to oust them from Eritrea. Italy invaded Ethiopia again in 1935. The European scramble for Africa in the opening phase of World War II was facilitated by advances in medicine and military technology, giving Europeans advantages over African forces. Many Africans chose not to resist colonial invasion due to Europe's military superiority, although some groups did launch armed struggles against colonizers. Many European leaders were initially hesitant to colonize Africa due to doubts about financial gains balancing the cost. However, imperialists, nationalists, anti-slavery activists, missionaries, and business interests pushed for expansion. Diamonds and gold discoveries in southern Africa further fueled colonial interests. The new colonial powers valued Africa's agricultural potential, with Germany seeking raw cotton in Tanganyika and King Leopold II of Belgium hiding his profit motives under humanitarian concerns. Leopold built an empire in the Congo through treaties at the Berlin West Africa Conference, gaining recognition for his International Association of the Congo. The Berlin Conference set rules for future colonization in Africa, limiting it to the strongest powers like Britain, France, and Germany. Portugal also secured territories in Angola and Mozambique. By the First World War, Britain emerged as the dominant power in Africa with colonies stretching from southern Africa to Egypt, including the Gold Coast and Nigeria. France and Britain held large territories in West and Central Africa. The United States did not have colonies in Africa but assisted in settling former slaves on the West African coast in 1820. The Republic of Liberia declared independence in 1847 and used firearms to conquer indigenous peoples, leading to societal disintegration in the late twentieth century. In April 1980, indigenous soldiers killed the Americo-Liberian president, William Tolbert, leading to a decade of political violence and a 6-year civil war. The effects of Leopold's rule in Congo included forced labor, beatings, mutilations, and starvation as a policy tool, as depicted in Joseph Conrad's novel, The Heart of Darkness. The colonial era in Africa led to infrastructure development, improved public health, and some education opportunities. Christian missions promoted literacy and education, leading to the rise of African leaders like Jomo Kenyatta and Kwame Nkrumah who studied abroad. After studying abroad, African leaders like Kwame Nkrumah and Nnamdi Azikiwe became presidents of their respective countries. Colonial economic policies in Africa led to dependence on exporting primary products for manufactured goods, hindering the development of market economies. The colonial state in Africa was authoritarian and not focused on promoting democracy. Colonial regimes imprisoned critics and took authoritarian measures, setting precedents for post-colonial rulers. Political participation for Africans was limited until the end of the colonial period when elections began. Britain and France worked closely with local chiefs and big men, discouraging popular participation. During the colonial era, colonial authorities worked closely with local chiefs and big men to obtain labor and tax revenues. This cooperation contributed to issues of corruption, nepotism, and authoritarianism in independent Africa. Colonial practices also intensified ethnic divisions by emphasizing language and cultural differences among African peoples. Europeans viewed the world in terms of \"tribes\" and \"nations,\" shaping Africa's present-day ethnic landscape. The British, in particular, grouped people together as \"tribes\" for administrative convenience. During the colonial era, Europeans, especially the British, ruled indirectly through tribal chiefs, strengthening tribal loyalties. Today, ethnic divisions in Africa lead to violent politics, weaken institutions, and hinder economies. The colonial partition imposed artificial boundaries, separating linked cultures and hindering transport between African regions. The colonial era in Africa imposed artificial boundaries, hindered transport between regions, and suppressed indigenous political arrangements. World War II weakened colonial powers, hastening the end of colonialism in Africa. During World War II, the United States and Britain affirmed the right of all peoples to choose their form of government. The United Nations Charter committed colonial powers to developing self-government in their territories. African nationalists, influenced by European and Asian revolutionary movements, organized opposition to colonial regimes upon returning from education abroad. The struggle for social justice among black Americans inspired African nationalists like Nkrumah, influenced by W.E.B. DuBois. By the 1940s, British policymakers foresaw African independence in the distant future, while France pursued assimilation policies in its colonies. Nationalist sentiments grew across Africa, leading to movements like the Mau Mau uprising in the early 1950s. In the early 1950s, African countries like Ghana, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Kenya gained independence from colonial powers like Britain and France. The independence movements were fueled by rising African nationalism and political parties organizing protests. France also granted independence to its African colonies in 1960 after Guinea voted for independence rather than close association with France. In 1960, countries in French-held Africa gained independence. The Belgian Congo also gained independence in 1960. In southern Africa, independence was delayed due to substantial white populations opposing majority rule. Rhodesia declared independence from Britain in 1965, leading to UN sanctions and a civil war. Zimbabwe became independent in 1980. Guerrilla wars erupted in Angola and Mozambique in the 1960s, with independence achieved in 1975. In the 1960s, independence was achieved in Angola and Mozambique in 1975 after armed struggles. Namibia gained independence in 1990. In South Africa, apartheid was imposed by the National Party in 1948, leading to protests and violent resistance in the 1970s and 1980s. In the 1980s, South Africa faced harsh government repression as resistance grew. Military strikes were launched against the African National Congress (ANC) beyond South Africa's borders. The white-controlled government realized defending apartheid was unsustainable and engaged in secret discussions with the ANC. Nelson Mandela was freed in 1990, leading to constitutional negotiations and universal-suffrage elections in 1994. Mandela became President, marking a significant shift in South Africa's political landscape. In the early 1960s, Africa saw a promising future with new leadership and economic growth. The Organization of African Unity was established in 1963 to promote solidarity and development. However, challenges like civil war in the former Belgian Congo began to emerge. In the 1960s, problems emerged in Africa with civil wars, coups, and economic decline. Countries like the former Belgian Congo, Togo, Ghana, and Nigeria faced political instability and conflict. Sub-Saharan Africa's economic growth declined significantly in the following decades, with many countries under authoritarian regimes and experiencing violent civil wars. In the post-independence era, Africa faced civil wars, coups, and economic decline. Countries like Uganda, Ethiopia, Sudan, Somalia, and Chad experienced violent conflicts. Drought in 1982-1984 worsened the situation, leading to high death tolls in war-torn countries like Ethiopia and Sudan. The impact of colonialism, ethnic divisions, authoritarian rule, and limited indigenous elites were key factors contributing to Africa's challenges. During the colonial period, Africa faced challenges of independence with small indigenous elites. The population in sub-Saharan Africa grew from 200 million in 1950 to 600 million in 1990. The Cold War fueled conflicts in Africa with arms from the Soviet Union and the US supporting anti-democratic regimes. France's policy in Africa aimed at maintaining great power status by cultivating special relationships with former colonies, providing military and economic assistance, and promising intervention to protect friendly regimes from unrest. In the later 1980s and early 1990s, scholars focused on African state and society characteristics to explain the continent's difficulties, leading to discouraging conclusions. In the 1980s and 1990s, scholars analyzed African states and concluded that corruption, personal ambitions of leaders, and economic difficulties hindered societal change and development. The concept of the \"failed state\" in Africa was widely discussed, with media coverage of famine and conflict in countries like Somalia and Sudan. Despite some positive developments, overall GDP growth from 1990 to 1998 was lower than the population growth rate. Several positive developments in Africa in the early 1990s raised hopes for a better future. The end of the Cold War meant authoritarian rulers could no longer manipulate superpowers for power. Changes in South Africa averted a violent revolution, with expectations of becoming an economic engine for the region. Some African countries were implementing free market reforms, leading to GDP growth rates exceeding population growth. Political reforms were also underway in many African nations. In the early 1990s, Africa saw positive developments with political reforms and economic growth, including annual GDP increases of 5% or more. Authoritarian states were undergoing changes due to demands for democratization, leading to the emergence of diverse interests in civil society. Multiple political parties were allowed in countries that were previously one-party states, and elections were becoming more free and fair. Analysts like Richard Joseph noted a \"virtual miracle\" of political freedom in Africa. The hopes of the early 1990s for African democratization have faded as authoritarian leaders manipulate elections and stifle opposition to hold onto power. Richard Joseph described the emergence of \"virtual democracies\" in Africa, where governments maintain a facade of liberal democracy while repressing dissent. Events in Zimbabwe and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire further highlight the challenges to genuine democracy in the region. Events in Zimbabwe and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire have proven discouraging to advocates of democratization. In C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, a military coup in 1999 and exclusion of a qualified candidate from elections led to ethnic and religious divisions. In Zimbabwe, political violence marred the 2000 elections, with opposition members killed. Critics accused the government of destroying the rule of law in its campaign to take over white-owned farms. Sub-Saharan Africa's AIDS epidemic continues to worsen. The HIV epidemic in Africa is intensifying, with 25.3 million infected individuals in the region. Uganda and Senegal have seen success in prevention campaigns, but overall infection rates in Africa are high, with some countries having over 20% of the adult population HIV-positive. The epidemic has already claimed 17 million lives, and mortality rates are increasing, exacerbated by ongoing armed conflicts in the region. The Democratic Republic of the Congo and neighboring countries in Africa are facing ongoing armed conflicts, hindering development and causing refugee crises. Economic growth in the region is stagnant, with South Africa's economy also struggling. The economic growth in sub-Saharan Africa was minimal in 1998 and 1999, delaying the possibility of sparking an economic expansion in the region. Academic authors view the region as marginalized in the global economy, with concerns raised by \"Afro-pessimists\" about the continent's political and economic prospects. A study by the U.S. National Intelligence Council in 2000 predicted that poor governance, demographics, and disease would contribute to Africa's increasing international marginalization by 2015, with most African states missing out on global economic growth. Some observers reject Afro-pessimism about sub-Saharan Africa, arguing that it stems from stereotyped views and media focus on violence. They believe in a \"new reality\" where governments are becoming more accountable, economic policies are empowering the private sector, and progress is being made in addressing challenges. The International Monetary Fund acknowledged economic stagnation and poverty in Africa but remains optimistic about an economic renaissance. President Thabo Mbeki and others support the idea of an African Renaissance, citing progress in reconciliation and democratization in the 1990s. The optimistic view on democratization in Africa highlights successful transitions in South Africa and Nigeria, with widespread gains in universal suffrage elections. The wave of elections in the 1990s set precedents for further democratization, despite economic disappointments. The Clinton Administration's policy towards Africa was optimistic, highlighting economic growth in countries like Botswana, Mozambique, Rwanda, and Uganda. Optimists believe that with economic reforms, governance improvements, and international support, more African countries could increase per capita incomes and improve quality of life. Debt relief and natural resources like oil deposits and minerals also contribute to a brighter future outlook for the continent. President Clinton's policy towards Africa was optimistic, with a focus on economic growth and democratic transitions. He made extensive trips to Africa in 1998 and 2000, emphasizing the continent's potential for transformation and progress. President Clinton praised Nigeria for its democratic progress and cooperation with the US in combating crime and peacekeeping. He also highlighted the importance of addressing the African HIV/AIDS epidemic and emphasized Africa's potential as a trading partner, particularly in oil imports. The Administration supported the African Growth and Opportunity Act for increased trade and investment opportunities. The Administration supported the African Growth and Opportunity Act, which became law in May 2000. Other interests in Africa included preventing weapons proliferation, preserving environmental resources, combating the drug trade and terrorism. Initiatives like the Leland Initiative and the Greater Horn of Africa Initiative aimed to enhance Africa's access to the Internet and reduce food insecurity. The LIFE Initiative was launched to combat the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Africa and globally. The Administration's initiatives involved various U.S. agencies, boosting their Africa-related capabilities. Challenges arose, such as the Somalia incident in 1993 and the delayed response to the Rwanda genocide in 1994. In response, efforts were made to strengthen Africa's peacekeeping. The Administration's efforts to strengthen Africa's peacekeeping capabilities through initiatives like the Africa Crisis Response Initiative (ACRI) and the \"train and equip\" program for Nigerian battalions preparing for peacekeeping duties in Sierra Leone. U.S. officials played mediator roles in African conflicts, with the peace agreement between Ethiopia and Eritrea being a notable success. However, ongoing conflicts in Africa remained a source of frustration for policymakers, hindering efforts to promote economic growth and political reform. Trade results during the Clinton years showed mixed growth in U.S. imports from Africa. During the Clinton years, U.S. imports from Africa grew at a slower rate compared to overall U.S. imports, with most trade concentrated in a few countries, particularly in the petroleum sector. African imports and exports made up about 1% of U.S. totals in 1999, while U.S. investment in the sub-Saharan region, focused on petroleum, was around 1.2% of total U.S. foreign direct investment. Despite this, U.S. firms had significant investments in Africa, such as Southwestern Bell's share in the South African telecommunications industry and Caterpillar Inc. dealerships in 15 countries. The establishment of Caterpillar Inc. dealerships in 15 countries marked a significant development in the industry. Sub-Saharan Africa gained importance in foreign policy in 1958 with the creation of a Bureau of African Affairs. Controversies have arisen over Africa policy, focusing on issues like apartheid, African development, and Soviet/Cuban involvement. The Eisenhower Administration faced its first African crisis in 1960 with the Congo rebellion, which raised concerns about Soviet exploitation. During the Kennedy Administration, the U.S. supported African nationalists and approved funding for a dam in Ghana. President Kennedy also pushed for reforms in white regimes in southern Africa. In 1963, the U.S. backed a U.N.-sponsored arms embargo against South Africa. The Johnson Administration focused on Congo, providing covert aid to suppress rebellions seen as communist-inspired or beneficial to the Soviet Union. Mobutu Sese-Seko solidified his position as Zaire's president with U.S. backing during this time. During the Nixon and Ford Administrations, the focus of Africa policy shifted to southern Africa, particularly Angola, Mozambique, and Rhodesia. There was political controversy over policymakers being too sympathetic to white minority regimes, while Henry Kissinger believed the Soviet Union was pursuing a policy of \"ruthless opportunism\" in Africa. Congressional concerns over getting involved in another Vietnam limited deeper U.S. involvement in Congo (Zaire) during Mobutu Sese-Seko's presidency. During the Carter Administration (1977-1981), U.S. foreign policy in Africa focused on human rights, advocating for majority rule in Zimbabwe, independence for Namibia, and criticizing apartheid in South Africa. The Administration also pushed for reforms in Zaire, but Cold War considerations continued to constrain Africa policy. The Carter Administration faced challenges from Soviet and Cuban influence in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in Ethiopia where a pro-Soviet regime had emerged. During the Carter Administration, the U.S. forged ties with Somalia in response to the pro-Soviet regime in Ethiopia. This led to the Ogaden War, with Cuba assisting Ethiopia against Somali invasion. Cold War concerns influenced the opposition to sanctions against South Africa. Cuban troops in Angola were a major concern for the Reagan Administration. During the Reagan Administration, there was strong support for covert aid to UNITA in Angola. Chester Crocker favored a policy of \"linkage\" to secure Cuban withdrawal from Angola in exchange for Namibia's independence. Despite political opposition, a regional peace agreement was achieved in 1988. In 1986, Congress enacted sanctions against South Africa over President Reagan's veto. The George H.W. Bush Administration continued Africa policymaking from 1989-1993. During the George H.W. Bush Administration (1989-1993), policymakers focused on the Horn of Africa. They successfully managed a peaceful transition in Ethiopia in 1991, preventing a crisis like the one in Liberia. Somalia faced clan violence, drought, and famine, leading to a humanitarian disaster by 1992. Bush sent U.S. troops for a multi-national humanitarian intervention before leaving office, saving many from starvation despite American casualties in 1993. The administration also urged Mobutu for reforms as part of promoting democracy and economic liberalization. In recent decades, Congress has taken various actions related to Africa, including enacting the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) in 2000 to boost U.S. trade with Africa. The Global AIDS and Tuberculosis Relief Act of 2000 authorized $300 million for HIV/AIDS efforts worldwide. In 1998, the Africa: Seeds of Hope Act was passed to promote African food security through U.S. assistance programs. In 1990, Congress created the Development Fund for Africa (DFA) to protect Africa aid levels post-Cold War. In 1992, the Horn of Africa Recovery and Food Security Act was passed to promote democracy. In 1994, the African Conflict Resolution Act authorized U.S. assistance for peaceful resolution of African conflicts. In 1985, Congress passed the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act (P.L. 99-440) over President Reagan's veto, setting policy objectives for the United States in South Africa and imposing sanctions. Additionally, in 1985, Congress passed an emergency supplemental appropriation for African famine relief (P.L. 99-10) following media coverage of famine in Ethiopia and Sudan. The International Security and Development Cooperation Act of 1985 repealed the Clark Amendment. The \"Clark Amendment\" of 1976 prohibited aid for military operations in Angola, sponsored by Senator Dick Clark. The \"Byrd Amendment\" of 1971 exempted the US from UN sanctions on Rhodesia for critical materials. The curr_chunk provides a list of books related to Africa and United States foreign policy towards Africa. The curr_chunk lists various CRS Issue Briefs on Africa, including topics such as U.S. Foreign Assistance, AIDS, Congo, Nigeria, and Sudan."
