    "content": "Foreign assistance in Latin America and the Caribbean is a key tool for advancing U.S. interests, with aid programs tailored to the diverse needs of countries in the region. While some countries still require comprehensive assistance due to ongoing challenges, others have progressed and now receive support for new security issues like citizen security and combating organized crime. Despite the decreasing reliance on aid as a defining factor in U.S. relations with the region, foreign assistance continues to play a significant role in advancing U.S. policy goals. Foreign aid remains crucial for advancing U.S. policy in Latin America and the Caribbean. Congress oversees aid programs and considers budget cuts, potentially impacting aid efficiency. The Budget Control Act of 2011 may lead to reduced aid budgets. This report provides an overview of historical and recent trends in U.S. assistance to the region. The report examines historical and recent trends in U.S. aid to Latin America and the Caribbean, focusing on the Obama Administration's FY2013 request for assistance. It also discusses key funding provisions in foreign aid appropriations bills and potential issues for congressional consideration. U.S. assistance to the region has a long history, with a spike in the 1960s following President Kennedy's Alliance for Progress initiative. After a decline, U.S. assistance to Latin America increased in the 1970s due to the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. Throughout the 1980s, support was provided to the Contras and Central American governments fighting leftist insurgencies. Aid decreased in the mid-1990s after the end of Soviet Union, civil conflicts, and spread of democracy. Assistance began to rise again in the late 1990s, with higher levels due to increased spending on humanitarian and development aid, especially after Hurricane Mitch in 1998. In 1998, the United States provided humanitarian aid to Central America, including establishing PEPFAR and MCC. The Obama Administration focused on economic growth in the region and increased aid for development. Aid was also given to Haiti after the 2010 earthquake. Most aid through 2010 was for counternarcotics and security, with significant assistance to Colombia since FY2000. The United States has provided substantial foreign aid to Colombia and its Andean neighbors through \"Plan Colombia\" to combat drug trafficking and internal armed conflict. Aid was increased in FY2008 with the M\u00e9rida Initiative for Mexico and Central America, and split into CARSI and CBSI in FY2010. However, U.S. assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean has started to decline after a decade of increasing aid levels. U.S. aid to Latin America and the Caribbean has been decreasing since FY2010, with a 10% decrease in assistance from $2.1 billion to $1.9 billion between FY2008 and FY2012. This decline is part of a larger trend where aid to this region, as well as East Asia and the Pacific and Europe and Eurasia, has decreased. However, aid to South and Central Asia, the Middle East, and Africa has seen increases, reflecting changes in U.S. foreign policy priorities. U.S. aid to Latin America and the Caribbean has decreased from 10% in FY2008 to under 8% in FY2012, as resources shifted towards Africa and countries important for anti-terrorism efforts. Development assistance in the region focuses on economic progress and social stability. The U.S. aid to Latin America and the Caribbean has decreased in recent years, with a focus on economic progress and social stability. Funding is used for long-term projects in economic reform, democracy promotion, basic education, human health, and environmental protection. USAID manages most development and humanitarian assistance programs, including food assistance and support for refugees. The State Department administers the Migration and Refugee Assistance account and manages a portion of the global health account addressing HIV/AIDS. Economic Support Fund is also a significant source of U.S. assistance for the region. The Economic Support Fund (ESF) is used to promote U.S. economic, political, and security interests in Latin America and the Caribbean. Managed by USAID and the State Department, ESF funds programs for political and economic stability, security assistance, counternarcotics efforts, and global threat mitigation. The United States provides aid to Latin America and the Caribbean through various programs such as Nonproliferation, Anti-terrorism, De-mining, and Related programs (NADR), Foreign Military Financing (FMF), and International Military Education and Training (IMET). The State Department manages these accounts, with a shift towards development and humanitarian assistance in recent years. In FY2012, over $730 million in U.S. aid was provided to the region through various aid accounts. In FY2012, the United States provided significant aid to Latin America and the Caribbean through various accounts, totaling over $730 million. This aid was allocated for development, humanitarian assistance, and security efforts in the region, with top recipients being Haiti, Colombia, and Mexico. The United States has provided Haiti with high levels of aid for many years, especially after the 2010 earthquake. Aid to Colombia has decreased as the country's security situation has improved, shifting towards economic and social development. U.S. assistance for Mexico focuses on support. In FY2012, the United States provided $357 million for Haiti, $379 million for Colombia, and $330 million for Mexico, with a focus on fighting transnational criminal organizations. The Obama Administration's FY2013 foreign aid budget request would continue the downward trend in assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean, with a requested $1.7 billion for the region. The Obama Administration's FY2013 foreign aid budget request for Latin America and the Caribbean proposes cuts in funding for the region, with Brazil, Venezuela, Argentina, and Guyana facing significant reductions. Colombia and Mexico would also see a decrease in assistance. El Salvador is the only country set to receive a substantial increase in aid under the \"Partnership for Growth Initiative.\" The shift in U.S. aid emphasis is moving away from security assistance towards development and humanitarian aid. The Obama Administration's FY2013 foreign aid budget request for Latin America and the Caribbean includes a shift towards development and humanitarian assistance. The total aid request for the region is over $698 million, with a 4% decrease from FY2012. The request includes $434 million through the Economic Support Fund account, representing a 7% decline from FY2012. If fully funded, 33% of U.S. aid would go towards security assistance, a 19% decrease compared to previous years. Security assistance for Latin America and the Caribbean would decrease by about 19% compared to FY2012 and 10% compared to FY2011. The distribution of assistance within the Western Hemisphere shows that 36% is dedicated to Mexico and Central America, 29% to the Caribbean, and 27% to the Andean nations of South America. Brazil and the Southern Cone countries would receive just 1% of U.S. assistance for the region, with the final 7% dedicated to regional programs. The United States provided Mexico and Central America with $27.5 billion in foreign assistance between FY1980 and FY2010, with over 91% in economic aid. El Salvador received the most assistance, followed by Honduras, Guatemala, and Mexico. Assistance to the region has decreased since the 1980s when it was a priority to combat Soviet influence. During the 1990s, U.S. assistance to Mexico and Central America declined significantly, totaling $7.6 billion in 2010 U.S. dollars, a 41% decrease from the previous decade. Aid further decreased between FY2000 and FY2009 to about $5.9 billion in 2010 U.S. dollars. Despite the decline, new aid initiatives benefited countries like El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Mexico. Mexico and Central America received significant U.S. assistance through the M\u00e9rida Initiative, with Mexico receiving 57% of the $1.3 billion in FY2010. In FY2011 and FY2012, they received $532.4 million and $696.2 million, respectively. The FY2013 request for the region is $619.8 million, with Mexico set to receive $269.5 million, an 18% decrease from the previous year. In FY2013, U.S. assistance to Mexico would decrease by $60.6 million (18%) compared to FY2012. The shift in the M\u00e9rida Initiative focuses on providing training and capacity building programs instead of expensive security equipment. Assistance would strengthen Mexico's law enforcement entities and support justice sector reform efforts. The transition from a written, inquisitorial system to an oral, adversarial system in Mexico is supported by human rights training and equipment. Aid also includes support for partnerships with Mexican universities, institutional reforms for private sector competitiveness, and climate change mitigation efforts. Congress has required withholding 15% of assistance until human rights conditions are met. The \"Northern Triangle\" countries of Central America face challenges in combating organized crime with limited resources. Guatemala would receive about $93.6 million in U.S. assistance under the FY2013 request, with a focus on development projects, food security, healthcare, and security force training. Conditions have been placed on U.S. assistance to the Guatemalan military since 2005. U.S. assistance to Guatemala and Honduras in FY2013 includes support for development projects, food security, healthcare, and security force training. Conditions have been placed on aid to the Guatemalan military since 2005, with a focus on supporting the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG). In Honduras, aid would primarily support efforts to decentralize governance, improve service delivery, ensure transparency in elections, enhance education quality, implement a food security strategy, and reform the national health system. The State Department withholds 20% of FY2012 assistance for Honduran security forces until human rights conditions are met. El Salvador would receive $41.8 million in U.S. assistance in FY2013, a 43% increase from FY2012. El Salvador is part of the Partnership for Growth initiative to promote economic development. Crime and lack of competitiveness are identified as growth constraints in El Salvador. In FY2013, U.S. assistance for El Salvador focused on security and justice sector reforms, reducing corruption and crime, strengthening education systems, improving public administration, and enhancing private sector competitiveness. Assistance to Nicaragua decreased by $390,000 under the FY2013 request, remaining significantly lower than in FY2011 due to strained relations with President Daniel Ortega. The U.S. assistance for Nicaragua in FY2013 focused on democracy promotion projects, market-oriented economic policies, and support for the military. The majority of the funds would be directed towards training and technical assistance for democratic leaders, civil society groups, and independent media. Additionally, some assistance would be provided to the Nicaraguan military for counternarcotics efforts. Despite the closure of USAID Missions in neighboring countries, Belize, Costa Rica, and Panama, they would still receive small amounts of U.S. assistance. Nicaragua's funding decreased due to strained relations with President Daniel Ortega. The FY2013 U.S. assistance for Belize, Costa Rica, and Panama would total $6.4 million, a 56% increase from FY2012. This includes equipment and training for security forces to combat drug trafficking and other security threats. Additionally, there is $29.7 million for USAID's Central America Regional program, with a focus on HIV/AIDS prevention and trade capacity building efforts in Central America. The Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI) receives $107.5 million under the FY2013 request. CARSI funds activities to support U.S. and Central American security objectives, providing equipment, technical assistance, and training for narcotics control. CARSI provides equipment, technical assistance, and training to improve narcotics interdiction and disrupt criminal networks in Central America and the United States. It also supports law enforcement and justice sector institutions, addresses deficiencies, and enhances citizen safety. Additionally, CARSI funds prevention efforts to reduce drug demand and provide opportunities for at-risk youth. Funding comes from the State Department's Western Hemisphere Regional program, with assistance provided bilaterally and for regional projects. The breakdown of funding by country is not publicly available. From FY1980 through FY2010, the United States provided almost $14 billion in assistance to the Caribbean, with the majority going to Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, and Haiti.

From FY1980 through FY2010, the United States provided almost $14 billion in assistance to the Caribbean, with Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, and Haiti being the main recipients. U.S. aid to the region increased significantly in FY2010 to almost $1.7 billion, largely due to Haiti's devastating earthquake in January 2010. In FY2010, a new Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI) was initiated to increase assistance to Caribbean countries for reducing illicit trafficking and promoting social justice. U.S. aid to the Caribbean in FY2011 and FY2012 totaled $572 million and $522 million respectively, with a decline to $492 million in the Administration's FY2013 request. Haiti received the majority of funding, with smaller amounts allocated to the regional CBSI program and the Dominican Republic. For FY2013, Haiti would receive over two-thirds of U.S. assistance to the Caribbean, focusing on reconstruction after the earthquake. Efforts to alleviate poverty, promote stability, and strengthen democratic processes in Haiti are top congressional concerns. The U.S. government's post-earthquake strategy for Haiti includes infrastructure, energy, food security, health services, and governance. Thomas C. Adams is the Special Coordinator managing the assistance program for Haiti. Thomas C. Adams is the Special Coordinator for Haiti, appointed by Secretary of State Clinton in 2010. USAID leads U.S. assistance efforts in Haiti, collaborating with various organizations. Over 1.5 million Haitians were in tent camps post-earthquake, with 550,000 remaining in 2012. U.S. aid aims to stimulate economic growth and create opportunities beyond Port-au-Prince. International efforts also address a cholera outbreak that began in 2010. The FY2013 foreign aid request includes bilateral programs for various Caribbean countries to combat HIV/AIDS and support security forces. In the Eastern Caribbean, a $35.2 million program based out of Bridgetown, Barbados, would assist Barbados and the six countries of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS). The FY2013 foreign aid request includes bilateral programs for Caribbean countries to combat HIV/AIDS and support security forces. In the Eastern Caribbean, a $35.2 million program based out of Bridgetown, Barbados, would assist Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. The aid would also manage HIV/AIDS programs in Guyana, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago. In the Dominican Republic, global health activities focused on HIV/AIDS and maternal and child health would be supported. For Cuba, $15 million is requested for humanitarian aid. The Administration is requesting $15 million for humanitarian assistance in Cuba to support political prisoners, strengthen civil society, and promote uncensored information flow. Alan Gross, a USAID subcontractor imprisoned in Cuba since 2009, has been a focus of calls for release. In Guyana, the FY2013 bilateral request is for almost $7 million, reflecting a downward trend in assistance as efforts to combat HIV/AIDS have improved. USAID's Mission in Guyana will be closing, and the program will be managed by USAID's Mission in Barbados. In Jamaica, the FY2013 bilateral request is for $5.4 million to support basic education and climate change adaptation, along with regional HIV/AIDS assistance. Additionally, the FY2013 request includes $59 million for the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative. The Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI) was developed by the Obama Administration in 2009 and 2010 to reduce illicit trafficking, enhance public safety, and promote social justice in the Caribbean. Since FY2010, funding for the CBSI has totaled $203 million, with allocations of $62 million in FY2010, $77 million in FY2011, and an estimated $64 million in FY2012. The program focuses on areas such as maritime and aerial security cooperation, law enforcement capacity building, border/port security, justice sector reform, and crime prevention for at-risk youth. The State Department does not provide a breakdown of CBSI assistance by country in its annual budget justification. The United States provided about $25 billion in assistance from FY1980 through FY2010 to Andean countries in South America, with Colombia receiving the highest percentage. Assistance was mainly in economic aid, with some military aid. Since the 1990s, U.S. assistance to the Andean region has focused on narcotics-related aid to Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, and Colombia, totaling $3.6 billion in 2010 dollars. Assistance increased in the 1990s to almost $6 billion, with Peru, Bolivia, Colombia, and Ecuador receiving aid. From FY2000 to FY2009, aid more than doubled to $14.3 billion, with Colombia receiving the majority for drug eradication and interdiction efforts under Plan Colombia.

Aid increased in the 1990s to almost $6 billion, with Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador receiving assistance. From FY2000 to FY2009, aid more than doubled to $14.3 billion, with Colombia receiving the majority for drug eradication and interdiction efforts under Plan Colombia. States supported Plan Colombia with a focus on drug eradication, alternative development, and support for the Colombian military in its struggle against leftist guerrillas and rightist paramilitaries. Peru and Bolivia also received significant amounts of aid, $2.5 billion and $2.1 billion respectively, although assistance to both countries declined annually during the second half of the decade. In FY2010, aid to the Andean region amounted to $1.2 billion, with Colombia accounting for almost 70% of the aid, followed by Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador. FY2013 Appropriations Request shows a decrease in aid to the region, with Colombia accounting for 73% of the aid in FY2011 and FY2012 combined. Assistance to Colombia accounted for 73% of aid to the Andean region in FY2011 and FY2012. In FY2013, assistance to the region would decrease by about 12%, with Colombia accounting for most of the decline. Other Andean countries would also see decreases in assistance compared to FY2012 estimates. The $332 million FY2013 request for Colombia represents the majority of U.S. assistance to the region, with a $47 million reduction reflecting Colombia's progress in improving security and funding its own programs. The decline in U.S. assistance to Colombia in FY2013 reflects a shift towards supporting Colombia's National Consolidation Plan (NCP) to re-establish state control in areas previously dominated by armed groups. The strategy includes security, counternarcotics, and development initiatives, with U.S. support through the Colombia Strategic Development Initiative (CSDI). Since 2002, U.S. assistance to Colombia has been tied to human rights efforts and severing ties with paramilitaries. The proposed $73.7 million in assistance for Peru aims to strengthen democracy through social and economic inclusion, improved governance, and environmental stewardship. The aid includes funding for alternative development programs, health and education services, and conservation efforts. The $22.2 million FY2013 request for Bolivia includes assistance for drug eradication, anti-money laundering efforts, and strengthening the judicial system. U.S.-Bolivian relations have deteriorated since 2008, leading to a decrease in U.S. assistance over the years. For Bolivia, the FY2013 request includes aid for health sector activities, strengthening local government management, biodiversity protection, and counternarcotics efforts. In Ecuador, the majority of the $21.3 million request would fund projects supporting alternative development programs, local governments, and citizen participation. The United States provides aid for counternarcotics operations in Bolivia and democracy assistance in Venezuela. The focus is on modernizing law enforcement capabilities and supporting nongovernmental organizations. The FY2013 request is for $3 million in democracy assistance, implemented by USAID to promote broad participation in the democratic process in Brazil and the Southern Cone countries of South America. The United States provided $1.6 billion in foreign assistance to these countries between FY1980 and FY2010, with Brazil receiving the largest share followed by Paraguay, Chile, Argentina, and Uruguay. U.S. assistance to Brazil and the Southern Cone countries has increased over the decades, with aid rising significantly after the 1980s when dictatorships ruled the region. Assistance totaled $254 million in the 1980s, $523 million in the 1990s, and $741 million between FY2000 and FY2009. In FY2010, Brazil and the Southern Cone received $109 million in U.S. aid. In FY2011 and FY2012, the United States provided Brazil and the Southern Cone countries with $33.3 million and $23.9 million, respectively. The FY2013 request for the sub-region is $14.4 million, with Brazil receiving $6.2 million. Despite a decrease in funding, Brazil still accounts for 43% of the total assistance. U.S. aid to Brazil is transitioning from supporting development programs to promoting development in third countries. The FY2013 aid for Brazil focuses on promoting development in third countries, with funding through the DA account to strengthen the Brazilian Cooperation Agency and implement projects in agriculture, food security, and school feeding programs in sub-Saharan Africa and the Western Hemisphere. Additionally, support for HIV/AIDS programs, counternarcotics, and security efforts in Brazil is included. Paraguay would receive $5.9 million under the FY2013 request. Paraguay would receive $5.9 million under the FY2013 request, with over 85% of the assistance funded through the DA account. The assistance aims to improve justice sector transparency, strengthen civil society oversight capacity, and help small farmers increase productivity and access to markets. U.S. assistance to Paraguay would also support security efforts through the IMET, FMF, and INCLE accounts, providing training and equipment to the military and aiding the counternarcotics unit. Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay would receive small amounts of U.S. assistance despite having higher per capita incomes. The three countries Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay, with higher per capita incomes, would receive a combined $2.3 million in U.S. aid in FY2013. This includes support for modernizing military forces, improving interoperability with U.S. forces, and enhancing capacities for international peacekeeping missions. Argentina and Chile would also receive $270,000 each in NADR funds for port security, export controls, and anti-terrorism initiatives. The USAID regional programs in the Caribbean, Central America, Latin America, and South America are discussed. The State Department's Western Hemisphere Regional program provides funding for initiatives to foster economic opportunity, social equity, and counter transnational crime and drug trafficking.

In FY2010, DOD allocated $84 million in humanitarian assistance through nearly 200 projects in at least 28 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. Assistance included alert systems, nets, and health center renovations. Haiti received the largest amount after the 2010 earthquake. DOD also helps partner countries prepare for and respond to disasters with deployable resources. Within 24 hours of the Haiti earthquake, SOUTHCOM deployed a team for assessment and support. DOD plays a crucial role in disaster response and humanitarian assistance in Latin America and the Caribbean, providing air traffic control, delivering supplies, and ensuring security. Despite USAID being the lead authority, DOD often takes the initial response due to its capabilities. Additionally, DOD offers counterdrug support to the region, with independent authorities granted by Congress. In FY2010, DOD provided Latin America with $435 million in counterdrug assistance, with Colombia and Mexico being the largest recipients. Some countries in the region have also received DOD assistance for counterterrorism and stabilization activities.

Honduras also signed a $215 million compact in 2005 for economic growth, with a focus on rural development. The MCC terminated $10 million in funding for Honduras due to the ouster of President Manuel Zelaya in 2009, reducing the total compact funding to $205 million. Despite completing the compact in 2010, MCC decided not to renew it in 2011 due to Honduras's poor performance on corruption. However, Honduras remains eligible for a threshold program of up to $20 million to address corruption and economic growth barriers. Nicaragua signed a $175 million compact with the MCC in 2005, focusing on the western region of the country. The MCC compact for Nicaragua in July 2005 focused on the western region for economic growth, with projects including transportation, rural development, and property regularization. Funding was reduced to $113.5 million after the suspension in 2008, and the compact ended in May 2011.

In FY2011, 2,600 Peace Corps volunteers were in Latin America and the Caribbean, focusing on development projects in various areas. Program funding for the region was around $65 million in FY2011 and is expected to be $60 million in FY2013. Due to budget cuts, the number of volunteers is projected to decrease to 1,800 by the end of FY2013, with reductions in most countries except Colombia. The Peace Corps plans to close programs in the Eastern Caribbean. The Peace Corps plans to close its programs in the Eastern Caribbean countries of Antigua and Barbuda, St. Kitts and Nevis, and Suriname due to security concerns and their classification as upper-middle-income countries. In the past, the Peace Corps has suspended operations in Latin American and Caribbean countries like Haiti and Bolivia due to violence and instability. In January 2012, volunteers were pulled out of Honduras because of high levels of violence. In 2011, a volunteer was shot in San Pedro Sula during a robbery attempt on a public bus. The Honduras program was suspended in September 2012 due to security concerns. Volunteer training classes for El Salvador and Guatemala were cancelled in December 2011, but programs continue with plans to send new volunteers in 2013. The Obama Administration's priorities for U.S. policy in Latin America include promoting economic opportunity, citizen security, democratic governance, and clean energy. The State Department emphasizes the importance of citizen security in achieving U.S. objectives in Latin America. The $1.7 billion aid budget request for the region allocates 45% to citizen security programs in Mexico, Colombia, Central America, and the Caribbean. The programs aim to strengthen institutions, address crime root causes, and ensure long-term public security. Additionally, 20% of the aid is designated for Haiti to support earthquake recovery, sanitation, and health services. The FY2013 budget priorities for the region include \"Peace and Security\" assistance accounting for 30% of aid, \"Governing Justly and Democratically\" for 24%, \"Investing in People\" for 23%, and \"Economic Growth\" for various projects. The Administration's request for aid in Latin America and the Caribbean is about 10% less than in FY2012. USAID plans to close its mission in Panama, manage programs for Guyana from Barbados, reduce aid to Colombia and Peru, and withdraw from sectors where progress has been made. Positive economic trends in the region have led to reduced poverty and income inequality. Some Members have concerns about the proposed 10% decrease in aid for Latin America and the Caribbean, questioning if the resources are sufficient. There is agreement on the importance of maintaining assistance for citizen security and counter-narcotics efforts in Mexico, Colombia, Central America, and the Caribbean. Assistance for Haiti's recovery is also a point of consensus, with calls for monitoring to ensure transparency and accountability. Some Members oppose parts of the Administration's proposed funding for FY2013. Some Members oppose portions of the Administration's proposed FY2013 funding for Latin America and the Caribbean. This includes opposition to the Global Climate Change Initiative and increases in funding for Bolivia, Ecuador, and Nicaragua. There is also opposition to cuts in democracy funding for Cuba and Venezuela. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees have marked up their versions of the FY2013 State Department, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs appropriations measure, potentially reducing worldwide foreign aid funding. The House version could mean a significant cut from the Administration's request. Members of Congress should examine if the FY2013 request reflects U.S. interests and objectives in Latin America and the Caribbean. The FY2013 State Department appropriations measure may result in reduced foreign aid funding, particularly for Latin America and the Caribbean. Congress should assess the balance and effectiveness of aid programs in the region, considering potential impact of proposed cuts on U.S. policy and bilateral relations. Coordination among U.S. government agencies and international donors could help maximize impact of foreign assistance funds. The State Department and USAID manage most assistance in Latin America and the Caribbean, with DOD's role increasing. Lack of awareness between agencies leads to potential overlap in aid efforts. Improved coordination could enhance the impact of aid programs. Congress should consider closer coordination with other international donors in Latin America and the Caribbean to enhance the efficiency of foreign assistance. In 2010, the region received $10.7 billion in aid, with the United States contributing $2.7 billion. Improved coordination could prevent duplication of efforts and ensure that aid programs are complementary and focused on specific countries or sectors. Improved coordination among international donors in Latin America and the Caribbean can enhance the efficiency of foreign assistance. This coordination may be challenging, as the leading country or organization is unclear, and donors may disagree on labor division. Foreign assistance often has strategic objectives alongside development goals. The United States has initiated trilateral cooperation agreements with successful countries in the region like Brazil, Chile, and Colombia to provide aid to third countries, aiming to access new solutions and expertise. The Administration requested assistance for Brazil in FY2013 to strengthen their development agency and implement joint agriculture, food security, and school feeding programs in third countries. The House FY2013 foreign aid appropriations bill recommends $18.6 million to support Colombian government efforts in counternarcotics and law enforcement challenges. Support for emerging donors can build capacities for regional stability and development, but critics raise concerns about potential drawbacks. Critics raise oversight concerns about providing foreign assistance through foreign governments, as it may lead to misuse of U.S. funds. Questions for Congress include clarifying agency roles, promoting inter-agency coordination, and identifying areas where the U.S. has a comparative advantage in providing assistance. When providing foreign assistance through partner nations, it is crucial to assess their political will and program sustainability to ensure effective use of U.S. funds. Without willingness to implement reforms and sustain programs, the impact of assistance may be limited and short-lived. The nations of Latin America and the Caribbean have a mixed record in terms of political will and program sustainability. Despite some successes in Colombia and Panama, there have been challenges with political will in the region according to GAO reports. Political will has often been lacking in Latin America, hindering sustainability of efforts initiated with U.S. support. Studies show that U.S.-funded programs have struggled due to lack of resources after support ends, including training programs, equipment, and counternarcotics initiatives. Even MCC-funded projects have faced challenges with sustainability, such as roads built in Honduras for small farmers lacking long-term maintenance plans. As Congress considers foreign aid for Latin American and Caribbean countries, they should assess the recipient country's capacity for equipment maintenance and financial responsibility. Questions to consider include the need for assistance, host nation's ability to sustain efforts, political will for reforms, and the use of public-private partnerships. Appropriations committees in Congress have discussed FY2013 funding. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees marked up FY2013 appropriations bills for the Department of State and Foreign Operations in May 2012. The House bill totaled $48.3 billion, while the Senate bill totaled $52.3 billion. Funding levels in FY2013 would have been lower than the previous year and the Obama Administration's request. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees marked up FY2013 appropriations bills for the Department of State and Foreign Operations. The House bill totaled $48.3 billion, while the Senate bill totaled $52.3 billion. The Obama Administration criticized the House bill for going beyond agreed-upon cuts and stated that the funding levels would damage national security. Specific foreign assistance amounts for Latin America and the Caribbean were not specified in the legislation. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees expressed concerns over conditions in Latin America and the Caribbean, intending to provide assistance levels above the Administration's request. They emphasized the importance of supporting counternarcotics and law enforcement efforts in key countries to combat drug trafficking and violent crime. The Security and stability of these neighbors directly impact the United States, prompting calls for additional U.S. aid. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees called for additional U.S. aid to strengthen democratic institutions and address poverty in Central and South America. Specific funding levels were recommended for Colombia and Mexico above the requested levels. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended increased aid for Colombia and Mexico to support training, technical assistance, anti-crime efforts, and economic development activities along the U.S.-Mexican border. The House and Senate recommended different funding levels for democracy programs in Venezuela and Cuba. The House supported $5 million above the Administration's request, while the Senate backed the requested amount. Additionally, the House recommended increased funding for CARSI and CBSI, while the Senate supported the requested levels for regional security programs. The House and Senate recommended different funding levels for various programs, with the Senate proposing higher funding for conservation programs in the Brazilian Amazon and the Inter-American Foundation. Congress did not take action on H.R. 5857 or S. 3241, instead enacting a six-month continuing resolution (P.L. 112-175) that expired in March 2013. New legislation (P.L. 113-6) was approved to fund federal programs through the end of FY2013. Funding for State Department and Foreign Operations in FY2013 was maintained at FY2012 levels, with some exceptions. However, budget sequestration cuts reduced funding by about 5%, applied at the account level. Country-level allocations for FY2013 were not yet available due to these reductions."
