    "content": "The National Security Agency (NSA) conducted a secret Terrorist Surveillance Program (TSP) leading to a national debate on its legality under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). The program involved warrantless surveillance of international communications involving individuals believed to be associated with al Qaeda. The Bush Administration defended the program citing constitutional and statutory support. Senator Mitch McConnell introduced the Terrorist Surveillance Act of 2006 as a standalone bill. Senator Mitch McConnell introduced the Terrorist Surveillance Act of 2006 as a standalone bill, along with Senator William H. Frist introducing related bills in the 109th and 110th Congress addressing electronic surveillance programs for detecting and preventing international terrorist threats. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act provides a statutory framework for such surveillance programs. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) provides statutory authority for electronic surveillance, physical searches, and other surveillance methods to acquire foreign intelligence information. The Bush Administration argued that FISA lacked the speed and agility to combat terrorism effectively. Attorney General Gonzales informed the Senate Judiciary Committee about FISC orders authorizing the collection of international communications related to terrorism. The Attorney General announced that surveillance previously conducted under the TSP will now be subject to FISC approval. The President has decided not to reauthorize the TSP when the current authorization expires. Intelligence Committees were briefed on classified details of FISC orders. The NSA program faced legal challenges, with a court ruling it unconstitutional for violating various laws and amendments. The decision was appealed to the Sixth Circuit Court, which stayed the judgment pending appeal. In 2006, the American Civil Liberties Union v. National Security Agency case resulted in a judgment and permanent injunction pending appeal. The attorneys for the appellants filed a letter in January 2007 regarding orders from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. Proposed legislation would create a new Title VII of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to address electronic surveillance programs. The bills propose changes to electronic surveillance under FISA, including repealing wartime authorities for surveillance without a warrant, modifying definitions, criminal provisions, and addressing weapons of mass destruction. The Terrorist Surveillance Act of 2006 creates a new Title VII in FISA for electronic surveillance programs targeting foreign intelligence information and international terrorism. The program allows for immediate surveillance upon suspect activity and extended periods of surveillance. The Terrorist Surveillance Act of 2006 establishes new FISA provisions for electronic surveillance programs targeting foreign intelligence information and international terrorism. The FISC reviews and authorizes these programs, with initial authorizations lasting up to 90 days and reauthorizations determined by the FISC. If an application is denied, the Attorney General can submit new applications or appeal to the FIS Court of Review. The Attorney General must discontinue surveillance of any target within the United States under Title VII of FISA if criteria for electronic surveillance under Section 104 of FISA are met, unless certain conditions are fulfilled. Surveillance can only continue under Title VII if an application for FISC authorization is made under Section 104 of FISA. The bills authorize the transfer of cases involving challenges to classified communications intelligence activity to the FIS Court of Review if it harms national security. The Attorney General's affidavit triggers the transfer from the originating court. The Attorney General's affidavit triggers the transfer of cases challenging classified communications intelligence activity to the FIS Court of Review. The language in proposed subsection 702(b)(1) of FISA may be unclear regarding the transfer process. The FISC, not the FIS Court of Review, has jurisdiction to determine standing and the legality of the program in criminal proceedings. The Classified Information Procedures Act and FISA govern the disclosure of national security information. Decisions of the FISC can be reviewed by the FIS Court of Review and the U.S. Supreme Court. Challenges to electronic surveillance programs can be dismissed by the FISC or originating court. Litigation privileges are preserved under new subsections. A new Section 703 of FISA is created under S. 3931, outlining requirements for electronic surveillance program applications. The FISC can request additional information from the Attorney General for decision-making. Section 704 addresses necessary findings for an ex parte FISC order approving a surveillance program, including constitutionality considerations. The new Sec. 705 of FISA addresses congressional oversight of electronic surveillance programs, requiring the Attorney General to submit classified reports every 180 days to congressional intelligence committees. This does not limit the authority of Congress to obtain necessary information for its functions and duties. Sec. 8 of S. 3931 and Sec. 208 of S. 3929 amend FISA by repealing certain sections that allow the President to authorize surveillance without a court order following a declaration of war. Current laws prohibit interception of communications unless specific exceptions apply. The Communications Act of 1934 allows electronic surveillance by US officials in the course of their duties under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978. The exclusivity provision in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511(2)(f) ensures that other laws do not affect surveillance acquisition by the United States. The Communications Act of 1934 allows electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978. The exclusivity provision in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511(2)(f) ensures that surveillance acquisition by the United States is not affected by other laws. The amendments to FISA in Sec.8(b)(2) of S. 3931 and Sec. 208(b)(2) of S. 3929 address Section 109 of FISA, 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1809, providing criminal sanctions for unauthorized electronic surveillance or disclosure of information. The amendments in Sec. 8(b)(2) of S. 3931 and Sec. 208(b)(2) of S. 3929 address criminal liability for unauthorized electronic surveillance or disclosure of information under FISA. The penalties under FISA would be increased to a fine of up to $100,000 and imprisonment for up to 15 years. Amendments to FISA include expanding the definition of \"agent of a foreign power\" to include individuals expected to possess foreign intelligence information in the United States. The definition of \"electronic surveillance\" under FISA would be updated to include the intentional acquisition of communication contents under specific circumstances. This change is proposed in S. 3931 and S. 3929, which also increase penalties under FISA and expand the definition of \"agent of a foreign power.\" The proposed update to the definition of \"electronic surveillance\" under FISA includes the intentional acquisition of communication contents under specific circumstances where a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy. This expands the current law and includes minimization procedures to protect the privacy of U.S. persons while allowing for the retention and dissemination of evidence of criminal activity to law enforcement. The proposed update to FISA includes minimization procedures to protect the privacy of U.S. persons while allowing for the retention and dissemination of evidence of criminal activity to law enforcement. Minimization procedures also apply to electronic surveillance without a court order for acquiring foreign intelligence information. The proposed update to FISA includes new minimization procedures to protect the privacy of U.S. persons during electronic surveillance. These procedures restrict the retention and dissemination of communication contents unless a court order is obtained or if there is a threat of death or serious bodily harm. The proposed update to FISA includes new minimization procedures to protect the privacy of U.S. persons during electronic surveillance. It restricts the retention and dissemination of communication contents unless a court order is obtained or if there is a threat of death or serious bodily harm. The definition of \"wire communication\" and \"contents\" in FISA would be amended under the proposed legislation. Section 102 of FISA authorizes electronic surveillance without a court order for acquiring foreign intelligence information. The proposed amendment expands the scope of electronic surveillance to include communications of foreign powers or agents of foreign powers. The Attorney General must certify that electronic surveillance will not acquire the contents of any communication involving a U.S. person. Surveillance can only be conducted with certification and minimization procedures. The Attorney General must assess compliance and report to congressional intelligence committees. If surveillance targets an agent of a foreign power, the report must include facts and circumstances relied upon. The Attorney General must certify electronic surveillance will not acquire U.S. person communication contents. Surveillance requires certification and minimization procedures. The Attorney General must report to congressional intelligence committees on compliance. If targeting a foreign power agent, report must include justification for belief. Attorney General can direct carriers to assist in surveillance while maintaining secrecy and minimal interference. The proposed subsection 102(b)(1) of FISA creates new authority for the President, through the Attorney General, to authorize acquisition of foreign intelligence information for up to one year concerning a person believed to be outside the US. Acquisition must not constitute electronic surveillance and involve assistance from communication service providers. The proposed subsection 102(b)(1) of FISA grants the President authority, through the Attorney General, to authorize acquisition of foreign intelligence information for up to one year concerning a person believed to be outside the US. The acquisition should not involve electronic surveillance and requires assistance from communication service providers. The certification by the Attorney General for such acquisition activity must meet certain criteria, including the purpose of obtaining foreign intelligence information and the use of minimization procedures. Compliance with the certification and minimization procedures is necessary, with the Attorney General reporting assessments to the congressional intelligence committees. The Attorney General's certification for acquisition of foreign intelligence information under FISA would be transmitted to the FISC and maintained under seal. The Attorney General can direct a person to assist in the acquisition while maintaining secrecy. Records must be kept under approved security procedures. The new subsection 102(d) of FISA requires the government to compensate individuals providing aid at prevailing rates. If directed to provide aid and failing to comply, the Attorney General can seek FISC intervention. Non-compliance could result in contempt of court. Individuals can challenge the legality of directives by filing a petition with the FISC petition review pool. The assigned judge must review a petition regarding a directive within 72 hours. If deemed frivolous, it is denied, and the directive affirmed. A petition to modify a directive can only be granted if it is found to be unlawful. If not modified, the directive must be affirmed, and compliance ordered. Review of an FISC decision can be sought by filing a petition with the FIS Court of Review. The FIS Court of Review must provide a written statement of reasons for its decision within seven days. Review of the FIS Court of Review decision can be petitioned to the U.S. Supreme Court. Judicial proceedings under Section 102 of FISA must be conducted expeditiously and maintained under security measures. All petitions under this section are to be filed under seal. Proposed subsections 102(h)-(k) of FISA outline procedures for handling classified information, immunity for providers of communication services, and disclosure of information acquired under Attorney General authorization. Proposed subsections 102(l)-(n) of FISA address the use and disclosure of information acquired under Section 102, including restrictions on disclosure for law enforcement purposes and the preservation of privileged communication. The federal government may only introduce or disclose information acquired under FISA in proceedings if it complies with specific requirements, including notifying the aggrieved person and the court beforehand. Under proposed subsection 102(n), a state or political subdivision can only use information obtained from a Section 102 acquisition in legal proceedings if they notify the aggrieved person, the court, and the U.S. Attorney General beforehand. The aggrieved person can move to suppress the evidence if it was unlawfully acquired. The motion to suppress evidence acquired unlawfully or not in conformity with an order of authorization must be made before the trial, hearing, or proceeding. If the Attorney General affirms that disclosure would harm national security, a motion to suppress can be filed in federal or state court seeking to discover information. The U.S. district court will determine the lawfulness of a Section 102 acquisition and may review relevant materials in camera. Portions of the materials may be disclosed to the aggrieved person if necessary for an accurate determination. Under proposed subsection 102(q) of FISA, if a U.S. district court finds an acquisition under Section 102 was not lawfully authorized or conducted, unlawfully obtained evidence would be suppressed. If the court determines the acquisition was lawful, the aggrieved person's motion may be denied except for necessary discovery or disclosure. Orders related to Section 102 acquisitions would be binding on all federal and state courts except for a U.S. court of appeals. Proposed subsection 102(r) of FISA allows federal officers to consult with law enforcement personnel to coordinate efforts in investigating or protecting against foreign threats. Coordination does not replace required certifications under subsections 102(a) or (b). Proposed changes to FISA include retaining directives and orders for 10 years, authorizing the Chief Justice to designate FISC judges, and granting authority for FISC orders under certain conditions. Proposed changes to FISA involve amending the certification process for electronic surveillance under FISA, shifting the responsibility from executive branch officials to the Assistant to the President for National Security. The certification process for electronic surveillance under FISA may be amended to be conducted by the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs or an authorized executive branch official. This change would involve excluding certain information from FISC orders for surveillance on foreign powers, requiring a statement on the need for physical entry and details on surveillance techniques and information on U.S. persons. The proposed changes to FISA include expanding the list of officials who can request a review of surveillance applications and amending the certification process for electronic surveillance. The proposed changes to FISA, including amending Sec. 105 of FISA, would redesignate subsections and replace current specifications for electronic surveillance orders. The proposed changes to FISA would redesignate subsections and replace current specifications for electronic surveillance orders, including in subsection 105(c)(1) the order of current subsections and deletion of certain requirements. The proposed changes to FISA would require specific details in electronic surveillance orders, including the type of surveillance and whether physical entry is needed. Extensions of surveillance orders can be granted on the same basis as the original order, with some exceptions. The proposed changes to FISA would allow for surveillance orders targeting foreign-based political organizations or entities directed by foreign governments. Extensions of these orders can be granted for up to one year if no communication of a United States person will be acquired. The FISA allows for extensions of surveillance orders based on new findings, not exceeding one year. Emergency authorization for electronic surveillance can be granted for up to 72 hours without a court order in certain situations. The Attorney General must notify a FISC judge during this period. The FISA allows for extensions of surveillance orders for up to one year based on new findings. Emergency authorization for electronic surveillance can be granted for 72 hours without a court order, with a requirement to seek a court order under Sec. 105 within that time frame. The new language would grant authority to an executive branch officer appointed by the President for emergency surveillance without a court order. The new language would grant authority to an executive branch officer appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate to conduct emergency electronic surveillance without a court order. The Attorney General must be informed of the surveillance, and a FISC judge must be notified as soon as possible after the decision to employ emergency surveillance is made. An application for a FISC order must be made within 72 hours of the authorization of emergency surveillance. Under the new provision, an application must be made to a FISC judge within seven days after surveillance is authorized. The 72-hour limit for emergency electronic surveillance approval by the Attorney General would be replaced by a seven-day limit approved by an executive branch officer appointed by the President. The revised language in the new provision requires that minimization procedures be followed for emergency electronic surveillance. Additionally, modifications to subsection 105(i) address limitations of liability for those involved in FISA electronic surveillance or physical search. The revised provision requires minimization procedures for emergency electronic surveillance. It limits liability for those aiding in FISA surveillance or searches, and restricts the use of information on unconsenting U.S. persons obtained through FISA surveillance. The revised provision in the current text allows for the suppression of unlawfully acquired information in official proceedings. It also modifies the destruction of unintentionally acquired communication if it involves individuals with a reasonable expectation of privacy in the United States. The provision in subsection 106(i) of FISA may be amended to include significant foreign intelligence information, indicating a threat of death or serious bodily harm. The language in the amendment is somewhat unclear, but it aims to address the handling of acquired communication involving individuals with a reasonable expectation of privacy in the United States. The proposed amendment to subsection 106(i) of FISA aims to address the unintentional acquisition of communication contents by surveillance devices. It states that if both sender and recipients are in the US, the contents should be destroyed unless they contain significant foreign intelligence or indicate a threat of harm. The language of the amendment is somewhat unclear, with redundancy in mentioning foreign intelligence information. The proposed amendment to subsection 106(i) of FISA addresses unintentional acquisition of communication contents by surveillance devices. It states that if both sender and recipients are in the US, contents should be destroyed unless they contain significant foreign intelligence or indicate a threat of harm. Sec. 9(g)(2) of S. 3930 makes a conforming amendment to subsection 106(k), reflecting a change made to Sec. 104 of FISA. Sec. 9(h) of S. 3931 amends congressional oversight provisions of FISA to require a feasibility study for a secure document management system. The proposed amendments to FISA aim to streamline the process of electronic surveillance applications and filings to the FISC. It includes changes to the definition of \"agent of a foreign power\" and the prompt transmittal of FISC rulings to personnel submitting applications. The proposed amendments to FISA include changes to the definition of \"agent of a foreign power\" under subsection 101(b)(1) and subsection 101(b)(2) of FISA, expanding the categories of persons considered as \"agents of a foreign power.\" The proposed amendments to FISA expand the definition of \"agent of a foreign power\" to include individuals involved in sabotage, international terrorism, or the development of weapons of mass destruction. This would classify them as agents of a foreign power under FISA. The new definition of \"weapon of mass destruction\" includes destructive devices intended to cause death or injury to a significant number of people, as well as weapons designed to cause harm through toxic chemicals or their precursors. The proposed amendments to FISA expand the definition of \"agent of a foreign power\" to include individuals involved in sabotage, international terrorism, or the development of weapons of mass destruction. This would classify them as agents of a foreign power under FISA. The amendments also encompass the release, dissemination, or impact of toxic or poisonous chemicals, biological weapons, and weapons designed to release radiation at dangerous levels. The proposed amendments to FISA include new subsections that allow surveillance orders to remain in force even if the target is outside the United States. Additionally, conforming amendments would be made to the table of contents of FISA to reflect the changes in Section 102 and the repeal of wartime authorities. The proposed amendments to FISA include the repeal of wartime authorities under FISA, Sections 111, 309, and 404, and the creation of a new Title VII of FISA."
