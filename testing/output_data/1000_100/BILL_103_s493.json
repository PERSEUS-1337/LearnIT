    "content": "The Act titled \"Hospital Cooperative Agreement Act\" aims to promote collaboration among hospitals to reduce costs and enhance the efficiency of healthcare delivery by avoiding unnecessary duplication of expensive medical services and equipment. Additionally, it introduces a Hospital Technology and Services Sharing Demonstration Program under the Public Health Service Act to facilitate this cooperation. The Secretary will establish a demonstration program awarding grants to hospitals for collaboration on expensive medical technology. The program aims to reduce costs, increase access to care, and improve quality. Eligible applicants must be hospitals submitting an application to the Secretary. The program aims to reduce costs, increase access to care, and improve quality by awarding grants to hospitals for collaboration on medical technology. Eligible hospitals must submit an application including a statement of intent to negotiate a cooperative agreement, description of activities, and additional information as required by the Secretary. Evaluation guidelines will be developed by the Administrator of the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research. The Secretary, in consultation with the Administrator, will evaluate applications for grants based on guidelines developed under paragraph (2) to enhance quality of care and preserve hospital facilities in communities served. The Secretary will evaluate grant applications to improve quality of care and preserve hospital facilities in communities served. Grants awarded under this section must be used to facilitate collaboration among hospitals, not for purchasing facilities or equipment. Permissible uses include expenses for specialized personnel, administrative services, support services, and instructional programs. Cooperative agreements awarded under this section aim to increase access to quality care in rural areas outside metropolitan statistical areas. These agreements involve sharing medical technology and services among participating hospitals. The term 'medical technology' includes drugs, devices, and procedures used in medical care, along with support systems. Eligible services for sharing must have high capital or operating costs and help avoid excess capacity in the community. This may include mobile clinic services. The demonstration program aims to increase access to quality care in rural areas. The demonstration program established under this section will last for 5 years. After 5 years, the Secretary will submit a report to Congress on the potential benefits of cooperative agreements in reducing healthcare costs, increasing access to medical services, and improving healthcare quality. The report will also include recommendations for future programs. Antitrust laws allow hospitals to engage in cooperative agreements without violating antitrust laws. The term 'antitrust laws' includes the Sherman Act, Federal Trade Commission Act, and laws against unlawful restraints. The Clayton Act, also known as existing antitrust laws, prohibits unlawful restraints and monopolies. It includes State antitrust laws and authorizes appropriations for enforcement."
