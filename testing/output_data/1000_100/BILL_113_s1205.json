    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Local Energy Supply and Resiliency Act of 2013\". Congress finds that a significant amount of energy in the United States is released as waste heat from power plants, industrial facilities, and buildings. This waste heat can be recovered and used for heating, cooling, or converted into electricity. Additionally, renewable energy resources in communities play a crucial role in energy sustainability. The use of local waste heat and renewable energy resources in communities in the United States strengthens industrial competitiveness, reduces reliance on fossil fuels and associated emissions, increases energy supply resiliency and security, and keeps more energy dollars in local economies. District energy systems play a crucial role in tapping waste heat and renewable energy resources, serving various institutions and areas, and helping to reduce power demand and constraints on transmission and distribution systems. The Act aims to promote the use of waste heat and renewable energy resources through district energy systems, which involve generating power near load centers and meeting air conditioning demand with chilled water. Implementing these systems involves overcoming technical, economic, legal, and institutional barriers, often requiring technical assistance. A key challenge is the lack of low-interest, long-term capital funding for implementation. The Act aims to encourage the use and distribution of waste heat and renewable thermal energy to reduce fossil fuel consumption, enhance energy supply resiliency, reduce air pollution, strengthen industrial competitiveness, and retain energy dollars in local economies. It also aims to facilitate the implementation of local energy infrastructure by providing technical assistance and low-cost financing. The Act aims to encourage the use and distribution of waste heat and renewable thermal energy to reduce fossil fuel consumption, enhance energy supply resiliency, reduce air pollution, strengthen industrial competitiveness, and retain energy dollars in local economies. It also aims to facilitate low-cost financing for the construction of local energy infrastructure through the issuance of loan guarantees. The Act aims to encourage the use and distribution of waste heat and renewable thermal energy to reduce fossil fuel consumption, enhance energy supply resiliency, reduce air pollution, strengthen industrial competitiveness, and retain energy dollars in local economies. It also aims to facilitate low-cost financing for the construction of local energy infrastructure through the issuance of loan guarantees. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines terms related to energy systems, including \"combined heat and power system\" for efficient energy generation, \"district energy system\" for providing thermal energy to buildings, and \"Loan Guarantee Program\" for financing local energy infrastructure. The Local Energy Infrastructure Loan Guarantee Program supports systems that recover energy from waste or renewable resources, generate electricity using combined heat and power, distribute electricity in microgrids, store thermal energy, and distribute thermal energy via district energy systems. A microgrid is a group of interconnected loads and distributed energy resources within defined electrical boundaries. A microgrid is a controllable entity that can connect and disconnect from the grid to operate in grid-connected or island-mode. Renewable energy resources include biomass, geothermal energy, and municipal solid waste. The curr_chunk discusses definitions related to renewable thermal energy, including heating or cooling energy from renewable sources, natural cooling sources, and the Secretary of Energy's role. Thermal energy is defined as heating or cooling energy used for various purposes. The curr_chunk defines waste energy as energy contained in various sources like exhaust gases, hot liquids, and pressure drops in gas systems. The curr_chunk specifies waste energy sources such as pressure drops in gas systems, condenser water from chilled water plants, and other forms of waste energy determined by the Secretary. It also outlines that unused waste energy in existing facilities or unconventional use in new facilities qualifies for consideration. The curr_chunk outlines a technical assistance program. The Secretary will establish a program to provide technical assistance for identifying, evaluating, planning, and designing local energy infrastructure. Assistance will include opportunities for waste or renewable energy, technical and economic assessments, utility interconnection, contract negotiation, and permitting/siting issues. The program established by the Secretary provides technical assistance for local energy infrastructure, including waste or renewable energy, assessments, utility interconnection, and permitting/siting issues. Nonprofit or for-profit entities are eligible for grants to cover eligible costs. Information dissemination includes case studies and computer software for infrastructure assessment and design. The Secretary may award grants to eligible entities for local energy opportunities, covering costs for initial assessments, feasibility studies, guidance on overcoming barriers, and detailed engineering of energy infrastructure. Applications for technical assistance must be submitted to the Secretary as required. The Secretary may award grants for local energy opportunities, prioritizing projects that maximize fossil fuel elimination, enhance energy supply reliability, and minimize environmental impact. Applications for technical assistance must be competitive and submitted periodically. The Secretary may award grants for local energy opportunities, prioritizing projects that minimize environmental impact, facilitate renewable energy use, increase industrial competitiveness, and maximize local job creation. Rules and procedures for program administration must be adopted within 180 days. $150,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2014 through 2018. SEC. 5. LOAN GUARANTEES FOR LOCAL ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE. A Local Energy Infrastructure Loan Guarantee Program is established under Title XVII of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The Secretary may provide loan guarantees for commercial or innovative projects defined as 'local energy infrastructure' under the Local Energy Supply and Resiliency Act of 2013. $4 billion of loan guarantee authority under section 1703 is reserved for this purpose, and unobligated funds from section 1703 may be used for loan guarantees under this section. SEC. 6. Definition of investment area amended to include potential for local energy infrastructure implementation as per the Local Energy Supply and Resiliency Act of 2013."
