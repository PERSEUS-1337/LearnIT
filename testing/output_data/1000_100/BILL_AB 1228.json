    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature aims to encourage higher education institutions to provide information to foster care agencies about admissions requirements and financial aid. They also urge the Regents of the University of California and the Trustees of the California State University to consider using admissions-by-exemption for homeless and foster youth. The California Community Colleges are requested to prioritize housing for current and former homeless and foster youth, providing them with housing at no extra cost during academic breaks. Priority for housing during academic breaks is given to current and former homeless youth and foster youth. Each campus of the California Community Colleges is required to develop a plan to provide housing resources for current and former homeless youth and foster youth, ensuring access during academic breaks. A homeless youth is defined as a student under 25 years old who has been verified as homeless within the past 24 months. The text discusses the eligibility criteria for students to be considered as former homeless youth for a period of six years from the date of admission. Additionally, it mentions specific individuals who can verify this status, such as the director of federal TRIO programs or financial aid administrators. Each campus of the California State University must prioritize current and former homeless youth and foster youth for student housing, especially during school breaks or year-round occupancy, providing housing at no extra cost. Current and former homeless and foster youth are prioritized for student housing at California State University campuses, with housing available for most days of the year. Each California State University campus is requested to develop a plan to ensure homeless and foster youth under 25 can access housing resources as needed, verified by homeless services providers. The Education Code is amended to include provisions for homeless and foster youth under 25 to access housing resources, verified by homeless services providers. Students verified as former homeless youth retain this status for six years from admission. Each campus of the University of California with student housing facilities must prioritize current and former homeless and foster youth for housing, especially during school breaks or year-round occupancy, providing it at no extra cost. Priority for housing facilities should be given to current or former homeless youth and current and former foster youth, especially during the majority of the calendar year. The University of California campus is required to develop a plan to ensure housing resources for homeless youth and foster youth during academic terms, breaks, regardless of student housing availability. Homeless youth are defined as students under 25 verified as homeless within the past 24 months by a homeless services provider. The federal TRIO program director, financial aid administrator, and former homeless youth verified student status for six years. The University of California is exempt unless the Regents make it applicable."
