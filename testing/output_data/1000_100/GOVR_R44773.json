    "content": "The Constitution outlines the process for appointing a Justice to the Supreme Court, involving nomination by the President and confirmation by the Senate. The recent nomination of Merrick Garland by President Obama followed the vacancy left by Justice Scalia's death in 2016. President Obama nominated Merrick Garland, a judge from the District of Columbia, to replace Justice Scalia on the U.S. Supreme Court. Republican leaders, including Mitch McConnell and Chuck Grassley, argued that the vacancy should not be filled until after the next presidential election. In contrast, Democratic leaders like Harry Reid and President Obama believed that the Senate should act promptly to confirm a nominee. President Obama nominated Merrick Garland to replace Justice Scalia on the U.S. Supreme Court. Despite Obama's call for a fair hearing and vote, the Senate took no action on the Garland nomination. The nomination was returned to Obama at the end of the 114th Congress. President Trump later nominated Neil Gorsuch to fill the vacancy, which is currently pending before the Court. The Gorsuch nomination, the 162nd to the Court, is currently pending before the Senate. This report provides analysis and historical information related to the Scalia vacancy, including the frequency of vacancies on the Supreme Court, comparison of the length of the Scalia vacancy to past vacancies, vacancies during presidential election years, vacancies filled during different presidencies, and vacancies requiring multiple nominations. Since President George Washington's initial appointments to the Supreme Court in 1789 and 1790, vacancies have occurred on average every two years. In the post-War period, vacancies have occurred every 2.4 years, and since 1980, every 3.1 years. The gap between Justice Stevens' retirement in 2010 and Justice Scalia's death in 2016 is the fifth longest in Court history at 2,054 days. Justices on the Supreme Court hold office \"during good Behaviour.\" Justices on the Supreme Court typically have lifetime appointments and may serve until they voluntarily step down or pass away. Historically, 42% of vacancies on the Court have been due to a Justice's death, while 58% have occurred for other reasons such as retirement or promotion. Since 1956, only 2 out of 25 vacancies on the Supreme Court were due to a Justice's death, with the passing of Justice Scalia in 2016 being the most recent instance. Prior to 1900, a higher percentage of vacancies arose from a Justice's death, accounting for 59% of vacancies between 1791 and 1899. Vacancies on the Supreme Court have varied in duration, lasting from 1 day to 835 days. Prior to 1900, vacancies lasted longer on average than in the 20th or 21st centuries. The average time for a vacancy to be filled from 1791 to 2010 was 121 days, with a median of 61 days. Since 1900, vacancies on the Supreme Court have lasted an average of 77 days, with the Scalia vacancy currently at 382 days, making it the seventh longest in history. The vacancy created in 1969 by Justice Abe Fortas' resignation lasted 363 days, one of the 10 longest vacancies on the Court. Since 1791, the average time from nomination to final Senate action for Supreme Court vacancies has been 28 days, with variations over time. Nominations prior to 1900 waited an average of 18 days, while since 1956, nominations have waited an average of 67 days. Figure 3 displays the 10 longest pending nominations for a Supreme Court vacancy. Since 1791, nominations for Supreme Court vacancies have varied in length, with the average time from nomination to final Senate action being 28 days. The Scalia vacancy is currently the seventh longest vacancy on the Court, with Judge Garland's nomination being the longest pending nomination in history at 293 days. Six out of 10 nominations were not approved by the Senate, including two rejected in roll call votes. The longest-pending nomination for a Supreme Court vacancy was that of Louis Brandeis in 1916, lasting for 295 days. Some vacancies with multiple nominations may appear to last longer, like the one created by Justice Smith Thompson in 1843, which lasted 424 days with six nominations totaling 190 days before confirmation. Since 1791, there have been a total of 9 vacancies on the Supreme Court during a presidential election year where the vacancy occurred before the general election and the President nominated a replacement before the election. The Scalia vacancy is the first to occur since 1932 under these circumstances. It is one of three vacancies where the Senate did not approve a President's nominee for a vacancy that arose during a presidential election year. Since 1791, there have been nine vacancies on the Court during presidential election years where the vacancy arose before the election year itself. The Scalia vacancy is the first to occur since 1932 under these circumstances. There have been nine vacancies on the Court during presidential election years where the vacancy arose before the election year itself. For eight of these vacancies, the Senate confirmed a nomination during the election year. In 1987, Justice Powell's retirement created a vacancy that was filled the following year. In 1968, President Johnson nominated Abe Fortas and Homer Thornberry in anticipation of vacancies on the Court. Prior to the Scalia vacancy, there have been seven vacancies on the Supreme Court that arose during one presidency and were filled during a different administration, representing approximately 6% of all vacancies filled on the Court since 1791. The last time a vacancy occurred during one presidency and was filled during a different presidency was in 1881. Justice Nathan Clifford's vacancy was eventually filled by President Arthur after President Garfield's assassination. The Scalia vacancy was filled by President Arthur on December 20, 1881, marking one of seven vacancies filled by a President from a different party. The last time a vacancy occurred during one presidency and was filled during a different administration was in 1862. During the \"Second Party System\" and \"Modern Party System,\" eight Supreme Court vacancies occurred. The Scalia vacancy had the longest period from occurrence to a President leaving office, with 342 days. Most departing Presidents nominated for vacancies during their presidencies. Six of the eight Presidents, including President Obama, submitted a nomination for vacancies that arose during their presidencies. The number of days reported for each vacancy does not represent the total days it existed before being filled. For example, the Baldwin vacancy during Tyler's presidency lasted 835 days, with 317 days from occurrence to his departure. Similarly, the Scalia vacancy during Obama's presidency lasted 382 days, with 342 days from occurrence to his departure. Vacancies on the Supreme Court are not always filled after a single nomination. Since 1791, there have been 20 vacancies on the Supreme Court that required more than one nomination before being filled. The Scalia vacancy is the most recent example of this, lasting 382 days with 342 days from occurrence to his departure. Between 1860 and 2016, there have been 12 vacancies on the Supreme Court that required multiple nominations before being filled. Six vacancies involved the Senate rejecting nominations, four involved the President withdrawing nominations, and one nominee died before taking office. The Scalia vacancy is unique as the nomination was returned to the President after the Senate took no action. Vacancies on the Supreme Court that required multiple nominations have generally lasted longer than the median length of a vacancy. Eight out of 11 vacancies lasted longer than 61 days, with 7 lasting at least 100 days. Six vacancies lasted longer than the average length of a vacancy on the court. Nominees eventually approved by the Senate received unanimous or nearly unanimous support. Four of the nominees were approved by voice vote. Of the six nominees whose nominations received a roll call vote, three had no nay votes, one had fewer than 5 nay votes, and another had fewer than 10 nay votes. The exception was Samuel Alito, nominated in 2006, who received 42 nay votes."
