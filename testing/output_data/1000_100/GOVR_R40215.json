    "content": "During a confirmation hearing in January 2009, OMB Director-designate Peter Orszag discussed plans for oversight of the economic stimulus package. The incoming Administration favored creating a special oversight board chaired by a Chief Performance Officer. They planned to create a website with information on contracts and financial details. The Obama Administration established Recovery.gov website for oversight of stimulus legislation, aiming to track tax dollars spent and root out waste. Numerous oversight provisions were included in economic stimulus legislation, emphasizing unprecedented accountability. Agencies' capacity for oversight has raised concerns. Concerns have been raised about agencies' capacity and a depleted contracting workforce to spend stimulus funds rapidly while improving competition and oversight. Questions have been raised about the resources of inspectors general and the Government Accountability Office for oversight. The House and Senate passed their versions of the stimulus bill in early 2009, with negotiations ongoing. Balancing speed with prudence and ensuring transparency are key challenges in responding to a crisis. Challenges in responding to a crisis include reconciling values of transparency, accountability, efficiency, effectiveness, and equity. Agencies and policymakers often have little time for planning or reflection. Long-term issues involve building capacity in federal agencies, Congress, and the President to better handle crises and anticipate and prevent them. The federal government is seen as a system of \"nested\" oversight, with multiple entities overseeing simultaneous activities. The federal government operates as a system of \"nested\" oversight, with multiple entities overseeing activities simultaneously. Congress oversees the President and agencies, while entities like the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) provide assistance. OMB is responsible for managing and overseeing agency activities, which are also monitored by agencies themselves. Tools like monitoring and evaluation are used in this oversight framework. In developing an oversight framework, various perspectives on objectives include compliance with laws, congressional intent, avoidance of mismanagement, unbiased funding allocations, effectiveness, and efficiency of activities. Implementation agencies and nonfederal recipients play a role in oversight alongside OMB. The oversight of economic stimulus legislation involves multiple stakeholders such as implementing agencies, nonfederal recipients of funds, OMB, a proposed oversight board, and IGs. Table 1 compares oversight provisions in the House- and Senate-passed versions of the legislation. References to \"the Act\" within each bill generally refer to either Division A or Division B, not the entire bill."
