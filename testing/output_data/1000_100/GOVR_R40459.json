    "content": "The Department of Defense (DOD) fuel consumption fluctuates yearly based on mission changes. DOD may use up to 1% of US refined petroleum products annually, with foreign purchases potentially doubling consumption. The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) under the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) buys fuel for all DOD services in the US and overseas. DESC's origins trace back to World War II, initially under the Army-Navy Petroleum Board, then transferring to the War Department in 1945 and becoming the Joint Army-Navy Purchasing Agency. In 1962, it joined the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) and was named the Defense Fuel Supply Center (DFSC) in 1964. The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) was established in 1964 to manage DOD's petroleum products and coal purchases. In 1998, it was re-designated with an expanded mission to manage a variety of energy products. DESC awards fuel contracts based on cost and manages bulk petroleum products, ships' bunker fuel, refueling at airports, and post-camp-and-station fuel. DOD is a major consumer of petroleum products, primarily JP-8, JP-5, and diesel fuel. This report summarizes DOD's fuel purchases from FY2000 to FY2008 and compares fuel spending to overall DOD spending. The report discusses DOD's fuel purchases from FY2000 to FY2008, comparing fuel spending to overall DOD spending and prices to commercially equivalent fuel. It also addresses recent legislation directing DOD to consider alternative fuels and stimulate commercial interest in supplying their needs. The DOD's interest in alternative fuels from coal and oil shale has not led to commercial operations yet. Legislation now prevents federal agencies from spending on fuel sources that worsen global warming. Proposed rules on greenhouse gas reporting may have minimal impact on refineries. New legislation to cap greenhouse gas emissions could affect refinery operations. DOD's fuel consumption varies yearly based on mission changes. DESC's bulk fuel purchases mainly consist of JP-8 jet fuel, with the Air Force and Army being primary consumers. DESC's total fuel purchases peaked at 145.1 million barrels in FY2003, primarily consumed by the Air Force and Army. JP-8 purchases peaked in FY2004, declining since then. Overall DESC fuel expenditures grew from $3.6 billion in FY2000 to nearly $18 billion by FY2008, with JP-8 representing 60% of purchases in FY2000 and 46% by FY2008. The Department of Defense (DOD) maintains a fuel \"war reserve\" that can be used in contingencies, while also replenishing fuel stores through purchases. Fuel costs have been increasing due to rising crude oil prices and refining margins. The average cost of petroleum products purchased rose significantly from FY2000 to FY2008. Jet and diesel fuel prices have also increased, reversing the price advantage that military jet fuels once had over commercial equivalents. The Department of Defense (DOD) responded to increasing fuel costs by purchasing alternate jet fuels and increasing diesel fuel purchases. The margin between refiners' crude oil cost and refined product prices also grew significantly from FY2000 to FY2008. Outlays represent cash payments made to liquidate the government's obligations in a fiscal year. Total defense outlays increased significantly from FY2000 to FY2007, with Operation and Maintenance spending rising by 231%. Fuel costs also surged by 497%, reaching 3% of DOD's spending by FY2008. The U.S. produces one-third of its crude oil, relying on other countries like Canada, Saudi Arabia, and Mexico for the rest. Refineries have shifted from light sweet crude oil to heavier sour crudes due to diminishing supply. Crude oil is separated into gasoline, kerosene/jet fuel, and diesel fuel in a refinery's distillation tower. Residuum from distillation is processed into gasoline and middle distillate range products using heat, pressure, hydrogen, and catalysts. Refineries may also produce kerosene/jet fuel depending on their complexity. Refineries may produce kerosene/jet fuel and diesel fuel, with specifications for jet fuel being more rigorous. They are set up to run specific grades of crude oil, such as light sweet or heavy sour. Light sweet crude is preferred for gasoline refining due to its easier refining process. Refineries can be topping, which separates crude oil through distillation, or hydroskimming, which includes naphtha reforming and sulfur treatment processes. Refineries vary in complexity based on the type of crude oil they process. Hydroskimming refineries run light sweet crude to produce gasoline, while cracking refineries add catalytic cracking to run light sour crude for distillates. Coking refineries use coking/resid destruction to process medium/sour crude oil. The Nelson Complexity Index measures a refinery's complexity based on its secondary processing units. The Nelson Complexity Index rates the complexity of refineries based on secondary processes. U.S. refineries have an average index of 10, with only 59 having coking capacity. Gulf Coast refineries can yield up to 8% jet fuel and over 30% diesel. Refineries are upgrading processes to handle heavier crude oils and reduce sulfur content in diesel fuel by 2010. The EPA regulations limit the sulfur content of highway-use diesel fuel in the US to 15 ppm, creating \"ultra-low sulfur diesel\" (ULSD). Refiners must produce lower sulfur diesel to prevent contamination during pipeline transport. DOD has shifted to using JP-8 instead of diesel for land-based tactical vehicles. The U.S. Army has adopted the ASTM standard MIL-DTL-83133E for JP-8, limiting sulfur content to 3,000 ppm, with typical levels at 140 ppm. EPA guidelines recognize the need for tactical vehicles to operate on JP-8 or JP-5 fuel. The EPA has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from automobiles under the Clean Air Act. In 2009, they found that greenhouse gases contribute to air pollution that may endanger public health. Recently, the EPA proposed a rule for Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases, including emissions from petroleum refineries. The EPA proposed a rule for Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases, including emissions from petroleum refineries. Petroleum refineries emit approximately 205 million metric tons CO2 annually, representing 3% of U.S. GHG emissions. Compliance costs could be minimal, but the rule sets the stage for future legislation capping GHG emissions. Bills like H.R. 2454 aim to establish a cap-and-trade system to reduce emissions, including from refineries. Between FY2003 and FY2008, DESC reported its top domestic suppliers as Shell, Valero Marketing and Supply Company, ExxonMobil, and BP Corporation. These companies operate 31 refineries in the United States with a combined crude capacity of nearly 6 million barrels per day. Not all refineries may supply jet fuel to DOD. The suite of refineries averages a Nelson Complexity Index rating of 10, with two-thirds having coking capacity. The number of refineries in the United States decreased from 155 to 141 between 2000 and 2009, but the crude oil distillation capacity increased to 18.6 million barrels per day. The median capacity of operating refineries is around 80,000 bpd, with larger refineries making up 85% of the total capacity. Gulf Coast refineries can yield up to 8% jet fuel and over 30% diesel fuel. U.S. refineries produce ten times more commercial jet fuel than military specification jet fuel, ranging from less than 50 to over 60 million barrels annually since 2000. Military jet fuel production accounts for 9% to 11% of U.S. net jet fuel production but less than 1% of all U.S. refined petroleum products. DESC's worldwide jet fuel purchases have exceeded U.S. refining industry's jet fuel output, with U.S. refineries sometimes supplying less than 50% of DESC's jet fuel purchases. This has led DESC to increase purchases of commercial jet fuels like Jet A, upgrading them to military specification to meet demand. DESC reduces spending on fuel by upgrading commercial jet fuel to military specification. The lack of U.S. refining capacity does not affect DOD's fuel supply, as closer refineries supply fuel to forward operating areas. DESC also purchases fuel from foreign refineries to support U.S. forces outside the continental United States. DOD's authority to procure fuel stems from the Navy's power under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 7229. DESC now relies on the general procurement authority under 10 U.S.C. 2304 to purchase fuel in a one-step process under the Defense Working Capital Fund (DWCF). This allows DOD to buy almost any kind of supply or service, award contracts, and internally transfer fuel to DOD customers. This operation helps the Department take advantage of price breaks for large quantity purchases and provides stabilized prices for all products during the fiscal year. The term \"acquisition\" is defined as the process of acquiring property or services with appropriated funds to support an executive agency's missions and goals. Title 10 U.S.C. Chapter 137 governs the Armed Forces acquisition process, and the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) in Title 48 CFR outlines federal agency acquisition regulations. The FAR System does not include internal agency guidance. DESC typically awards one-year bulk-fuel contracts and multi-year direct delivery fuel contracts using fixed-price contracts with economic price adjustment clauses. These contracts are governed by FAR and DFARS regulations, allowing for upward and downward revision of contract prices based on specified contingencies. Economic price adjustment provisions are used when future costs are unpredictable, especially for refined petroleum products. DESC has determined that supplies and related services are eligible for multi-year contracting provisions under FAR and DFARS regulations. DESC has adopted contracting instructions for multiyear contracts for bulk petroleum, ships' bunker, into-plane, and post-camp-and-station for the period of October 1, 2008, through September 30, 2009. DOD and military departments can enter initial five-year contracts for liquid fuels or natural gas with options for up to three five-year renewals, not exceeding twenty years. Multiyear contracts cover purchases for one to five program years, with performance in later years contingent on fund appropriations and potential cancellation payments to contractors. The key difference between a multiyear contract and a multiple year contract is that multiyear contracts buy more than one year's requirement without establishing an option for each program year after the first. Multiyear contract authority for supplies derives from general procurement statutes for acquisition of property. DOD agencies may enter into multiyear contracts for supplies to promote national security and achieve substantial savings. A multiyear contract for supplies can be entered into to achieve substantial savings and promote national security. The contract cannot exceed $500 million without approval from the Secretary of Defense and must be reported to congressional defense committees. DOD has the authority to procure fuel derived from coal, oil shale, and tar sands under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2922d, including multi-year contracts. The Secretary of Defense can waive provisions of law for alternative fuel acquisition based on market conditions for defined fuel sources like petroleum, natural gas, coal, and coke. The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) determines contract delivery prices based on the \"lowest laid down cost\" to the government, using Defense Fuel Supply Points to redistribute fuel. DESC sets uniform fuel prices for all DOD customers, including a surcharge for operating costs. The five-year limit on multi-year contracts can be waived by the Secretary of Defense, but DESC is cautious about jeopardizing its sales authority under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2922e by exercising this waiver authority. The Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for FY2009 requires analyses and force planning processes to consider hidden costs in fuel logistics. It mandates that new military capabilities must include a life-cycle cost analysis that factors in the fully burdened cost of fuel. Additionally, the act appoints a director responsible for overseeing the energy required for military operations. The Department of Defense (DOD) has faced a 500% increase in fuel costs over the past decade, impacting its budget for military operations. Fuel costs have accounted for up to 3% of DOD's spending and over 7% of the Operation and Maintenance budget. Unlike the airline industry, DOD cannot pass on these costs to customers and has limited options to address the financial impact. The Department of Defense (DOD) has faced a 500% increase in fuel costs over the past decade, impacting its budget for military operations. DOD's only recourse has been to request supplemental appropriations to pay for increased costs and supplies, unlike the airlines. DOD has explored options like fuel hedging, multi-year contracting, and using alternate fuels to limit vulnerability to fuel price swings and supply shortages. DESC's business model includes fixed-price contracts with economic price adjustment clauses for price revisions. DESC has an economic price adjustment clause in its contracts to manage fuel price fluctuations. This clause allows for price revisions based on crude oil prices, reducing DESC's risk. Airlines use hedging strategies like buying futures contracts to lock in fuel prices. Southwest Airlines, for example, hedged fuel at $51/barrel when crude oil prices peaked at $147/barrel in 2008. In 2004, the Defense Business Board explored ways to reduce DOD's exposure to fuel price volatility by hedging in commercial markets or through \"no-market\" hedging with the Interior Department. They suggested using lease revenues from the Interior Department to offset increasing DOD fuel costs during crude oil price spikes. The Group proposed seeking legislative authority to transfer funds between Interior and Defense based on which department benefits from price changes. The Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) leases generate revenues allocated by Congress to various government accounts, including coastal states. OCS lessees pay royalties-in-kind with oil delivered to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), created in response to the 1970s Arab oil embargo. The SPR, when filled to capacity, holds 70 days of imported supply. Drawdowns under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act can be through sales or exchanges. President George H.W. Bush's drawdown during the 1991 Persian Gulf War led to a rapid crude oil price decline. In 2006, the Government Accountability Office reported that 40% of revenues came from OCS leases. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported in 2006 that 40% of U.S. refineries processed heavier crude oil than that stored in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). Refineries using lighter oils cannot operate at full capacity. The types of oil in the SPR are not fully compatible with 36 vulnerable refineries, leading to a potential 5% decrease in U.S. refining throughput. The SPR's effectiveness during an oil disruption, especially involving heavy oil, could be compromised. The SPR does not have a defined role in mitigating a Department of Defense (DOD) fuel supply disruption. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) has limitations in producing jet fuel due to refineries yielding only 8% jet fuel on average. This restricts the SPR's role in supporting DOD's fuel requirements during a supply disruption. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 prohibits federal agencies from procuring alternative fuels unless they have lower greenhouse gas emissions than conventional petroleum sources. The Air Force has abandoned plans for a coal-to-liquid fuel plant at Malmstrom Air Force Base, Montana. DESC is interested in a pilot program for synthetic fuels to support DOD JP-8 fuel requirements in Alaska. DOD is shifting towards efficiency in response to crude oil supply shortages and price spikes. Congress may be concerned about the refining sector's lack of responsiveness to DOD's procurement announcements. The refining sector may not be responsive to DOD's procurement announcements during high petroleum prices. Refinery operators may question the value of emission credits versus operating marginally profitable refineries. Congress is concerned about potential refinery shutdowns impacting defense fuel suppliers. For more information on alternative fuel sources and greenhouse gas legislation, refer to CRS reports. Avgas is a high octane fuel for light aircraft, DFM is used in ship propulsion plants, DF2 is for ground mobility vehicles, FSII prevents icing, and FOB is a trade term for delivery. Jet A-1 (JA1) and Jet A are civilian-aviation kerosene-based turbine fuels with specific ASTM specifications. Jet A-1 is identified by NATO as F-35 and has a lower freeze point compared to Jet A. Jet B is a distillate that can be used as an alternative to Jet A-1 but is more difficult to handle. JP-4 is the military equivalent of Jet B with corrosion inhibitor and anti-icing additives, meeting U.S. Military Specification MIL-DTL-5624U Grade JP-4 and British Specification DEF STAN 91-88 AVTAG/FSII. JP-5 is a kerosene-based fuel with a higher flash-point developed for military aircraft on aircraft carriers. JP-5 is a kerosene-based fuel with a higher flash-point (140\u00b0F) than Jet A-1 and JP-8. It is suitable for use as ship turbine fuel. JP-8 is the military equivalent of Jet A-1 with corrosion and icing inhibitors. The Air Force switched to JP-8 in 1996 for safety and combat survivability. JP-8 is less flammable and hazardous than JP-4, containing less benzene and n-hexane. JP-8+100 includes an additive for increased thermal stability. JP-8 is a fuel with increased thermal stability, adopted for use in diesel-powered tactical ground vehicles. Military installations are bases or activities under military department jurisdiction. Mogas is the primary fuel for non-tactical ground vehicles. Multiyear contracting is a method to acquire known requirements over up to five years. Naphtha is a petroleum distillate used as a feedstock in gasoline production to increase octane levels. Agency funding for multiyear contracts must adhere to OMB Circulars A-11 and A-34."
