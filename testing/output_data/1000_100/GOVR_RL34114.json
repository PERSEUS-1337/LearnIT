Congress has three formal methods to combat noncompliance, including the inherent contempt power to detain and imprison a contemnor until compliance is achieved. The inherent contempt power allows Congress to detain a contemnor until compliance with a subpoena is met, serving to encourage cooperation. Criminal contempt permits the executive branch to prosecute noncompliant individuals, while judicial enforcement involves seeking a civil judgment to enforce congressional subpoenas. The report discusses Congress's contempt power and the enforcement of congressional subpoenas. It examines the procedures for inherent contempt, criminal contempt, and civil enforcement, particularly when dealing with executive branch officials. Noncompliance with a congressional subpoena may lead to contempt of court. Civil enforcement may be necessary for Congress to ensure compliance. The power of Congress to investigate and obtain information, including confidential information, is broad and essential to its legislative function. This authority was established in Supreme Court rulings from the 1920s. The Supreme Court described the Senate's power of inquiry as essential for legislative function, stating that compulsion is necessary to obtain needed information. This power has been recognized since the Constitution was framed. The power of inquiry is essential for legislative function, with compulsion necessary to obtain information. In Sinclair v. United States, a witness refused to answer questions at congressional hearings and was convicted for contempt of Congress. The Supreme Court upheld the conviction, emphasizing the importance of providing information to Congress. The Supreme Court upheld a witness's conviction for contempt of Congress, stating that Congress has the authority to require disclosures to aid its investigative power, even if the information may also be useful in pending lawsuits. This ruling reinforces Congress's broad investigative authority. The Supreme Court has affirmed Congress's expansive investigative authority, stating that it includes inquiries into waste, fraud, abuse, and maladministration within government departments. This power is inherent in the legislative process and is not limited to cases of wrongdoing. The Supreme Court has affirmed Congress's broad investigative authority to probe corruption, inefficiency, and waste within government departments. This power is considered necessary for effective legislation and was upheld in early Supreme Court decisions. The Supreme Court has affirmed Congress's broad investigative authority, as seen in early decisions like Anderson v. Dunn and McGrain v. Daugherty. Under inherent contempt power, individuals can be brought before the House or Senate, tried, and imprisoned for non-compliance. This traditional method was exemplified in the case of Anderson, where a non-Member was accused of bribery. The House of Representatives accused Anderson, a non-Member, of bribery. Anderson was brought before the House, granted counsel and defense witnesses, and found guilty of contempt. The Speaker reprimanded him and discharged him from custody. This established a pattern of attachment, appearance before the bar, and provision for defense in cases of contempt. The House of Representatives has established a process for contempt charges, including identification of the accuser, counsel, and a hearing. Prompt judicial review is available through a writ of habeas corpus. Due process standards must be followed, including notice and an opportunity to be heard. The court's decision may focus on jurisdiction and compliance with due process.

Due process standards must be followed, including notice and an opportunity to be heard. The court's decision may focus on jurisdiction and compliance with due process. Inherent contempt proceedings may involve monetary fines instead of incarceration, drawing on courts' authority to impose fines for contemptuous behavior. Congress could potentially impose fines as an alternative to jail time, as suggested in dicta from a 1821 Supreme Court decision. The power of imprisonment is the least possible power adequate for self-preservation in assemblies of the Union. In cases where Congress has authority to investigate, it may compel testimony using the same means as a court of justice. Commitment is the alternative for contumacious individuals, with other punishments being mere commutations for confinement.

In cases where Congress has authority to investigate, it may compel testimony using the same means as a court of justice. Commitment is the alternative for contumacious individuals, with other punishments being mere commutations for confinement. While there is a possibility of levying a fine for contempt of Congress, there is no precedent for Congress imposing a fine in this context. Inherent contempt proceedings do not require cooperation from the executive or judicial branches, allowing the House or Senate to conduct summary proceedings and cite the offender for contempt. The contemnor can seek limited judicial review through a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The inherent contempt process allows Congress to compel testimony and imprison individuals until compliance with subpoenas, but limitations include a time constraint on imprisonment and the process being described as outdated and ineffective. Due to these drawbacks, inherent contempt has not been used since 1935, and it may be more efficient if initial fact-finding is done by a special committee. Between 1795 and 1857, 14 inherent contempt actions were initiated by the House and Senate, with 8 considered successful in meting out punishment, compelling testimony, or producing documents. However, the process was seen as time-consuming, cumbersome, and sometimes ineffective. In 1857, a statutory criminal contempt procedure was enacted as an alternative to the inherent contempt procedure, allowing for judicial trial of the contemnor by a United States Attorney. Despite this, most contempt proceedings continued to be handled at the bar of the house rather than through criminal contempt in the following two decades. Members felt the need for statutory provisions to deal with witnesses who fail to provide information, leading to the enactment of 2 U.S.C. Sections 192 and 194. Section 192 outlines penalties for non-compliance, while Section 194 establishes the procedure for referring a witness for criminal prosecution. The criminal contempt statute under 2 U.S.C. Sections 192 and 194 involves committee approval, reading the committee report on the floor, House approval for prosecution, or Speaker certification if Congress is not in session, and certification to the U.S. Attorney. It is punitive to punish uncooperative witnesses and deter others from similar behavior, as the witness cannot avoid punishment by testifying or providing documents after being found in contempt. After a witness is voted in contempt by the House or Senate, they may lack incentive to cooperate with the committee. The U.S. Attorney is duty-bound to bring the contempt matter before a grand jury, but it is unclear if this duty is mandatory or discretionary. Case law provides conflicting guidance on this issue. In Ex parte Frankfeld, the District Court granted habeas corpus petitions for two witnesses charged with violating 2 U.S.C. Section 192 by the House Committee on Un-American Activities. The court ordered their release due to procedural errors, noting that Congress intended for strict procedures to be followed in such cases. The District Court in Ex parte Frankfeld granted habeas corpus petitions for witnesses charged with violating 2 U.S.C. Section 192 by the House Committee on Un-American Activities, citing Congress's intent for strict procedures. Congress mandated the certification of facts to the district attorney, who must then submit them to the grand jury, as seen in United States v. United States House of Representatives. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in Wilson v. United States also emphasized the mandatory nature of bringing contempt matters before the grand jury. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled that the Speaker's duty to certify contempt citations during adjournments is discretionary, not mandatory, based on legislative history and congressional practice. This discretion was highlighted in Wilson, where convictions were reversed due to the Speaker not exercising his discretion. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled that the U.S. Attorney's function may be discretionary, not mandatory, based on the Speaker's discretionary duty in certifying contempt citations. Congress can turn to civil enforcement if inherent or criminal contempt is not an option, allowing a single house or committee to seek a court declaration for compliance with a congressional subpoena. The U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that civil enforcement can be pursued if inherent or criminal contempt is not an option for compliance with a congressional subpoena. The House has previously used civil enforcement through an authorizing resolution, while the Senate has a specific statute for civil enforcement. The Senate may use civil enforcement to compel compliance with a subpoena or order, with the Senate Legal Counsel typically initiating the process. The Senate can seek a court declaration on the validity of the subpoena before enforcing it. The court will review the subpoena's validity, considering the limited jurisdictional statute and the immunity provided by the Speech or Debate Clause for congressional investigations. Clause immunity protects actions taken as part of congressional investigations. The court's jurisdiction is limited to enforcing a congressional subpoena, without the power to enjoin the proceeding. Compliance with a subpoena can be enforced through summary contempt proceedings if necessary. Civil enforcement has limitations, especially when the subpoena is issued to an officer. The House of Representatives may authorize a committee to seek civil enforcement action to compel compliance with a subpoena issued to a federal government officer. Past precedent includes the 2008 case involving Harriet Miers' refusal to testify before the House Judiciary Committee. This represented the first attempt to seek civil enforcement solely through a resolution of a single house, raising questions about federal court jurisdiction. In 2012, the House authorized a committee to pursue civil action in federal court to enforce a subpoena issued to an executive branch official. This came after holding Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress for not fully complying with subpoenas related to Operation Fast and Furious. The House approved a resolution authorizing the committee to initiate a civil lawsuit to enforce the outstanding subpoenas. The House authorized a committee to pursue civil action in federal court to enforce outstanding subpoenas issued to an executive branch official. The lawsuit seeks a declaratory judgment directing the Attorney General to comply with the subpoenas. The court rejected the DOJ's motion to dismiss and ordered the DOJ to provide a list of withheld documents. The court has yet to address the executive privilege question. Authorization by resolution of the full House is required for House committees to seek civil enforcement of subpoenas. The courts will not entertain civil motions without this authorization. If an authorizing resolution by the House is obtained, there is a likelihood that the court will allow civil enforcement of subpoenas or committee orders. The DOJ prefers properly authorized procedures for enforcing subpoenas. The executive branch has consistently argued that Congress cannot enforce a subpoena against an executive official through inherent contempt or criminal contempt procedures. The Attorney General has directed U.S. Attorneys not to pursue criminal contempt prosecutions in such cases. This position is supported by DOJ opinions from the 1980s and actions taken in contempt proceedings against officials like Anne Gorsuch Burford and Harriet Miers. The House approved contempt citations against executive branch officials like Anne Gorsuch Burford and Harriet Miers, but the DOJ declined to prosecute for criminal contempt. This has led Congress to rely on civil enforcement through federal courts to enforce subpoenas when executive privilege is invoked. The 2014 case of Lois Lerner suggests a broader use of criminal contempt against executive officials, as she was held in contempt for refusing to testify. Ms. Lerner was held in contempt for refusing to testify about her involvement in the IRS targeting of conservative groups. Despite the House approving the citation, the DOJ has not pursued a criminal case against her. The branch official refused to comply with a subpoena citing executive privilege, but Ms. Lerner's refusal was based on her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. The DOJ's decision not to pursue criminal contempt charges against executive branch officials in this case goes beyond situations involving executive privilege. Lessons from past disputes suggest that Congress faces challenges in enforcing subpoenas against the executive branch. Enforcing a subpoena against an executive branch official through criminal contempt statute faces obstacles. Courts affirm Congress's authority to issue subpoenas, but punishing noncompliance may be ineffective. DOJ may not prosecute if the President endorses noncompliance, citing prosecutorial discretion. Challenges exist in enforcing subpoenas against the executive branch. The criminal contempt provision may be effective in punishing executive officials who disregard congressional subpoenas to protect personal interests. However, the executive branch may choose not to prosecute, either due to viewing the contempt citation as without merit or to avoid setting a precedent for Congress's authority. Enforcing a subpoena through a declaratory civil action may not adequately protect congressional prerogatives against executive officials. The Miers case highlighted the challenge of protecting congressional prerogatives when enforcing a subpoena. Despite receiving a favorable court decision, the committee was unable to enforce it before the end of the Bush Administration. The resulting litigation would likely involve a lengthy appeals process, as seen in the Miers case which was dismissed after 19 months without a final decision. Although the committee obtained some information, the change in administrations and time passing diminished their ability to effectively utilize it for oversight. Congress may face challenges in enforcing subpoenas against executive branch officials, as relying on the executive branch or civil enforcement through the judicial branch may not always lead to a prompt resolution. Despite practical limitations, Congress can still enforce subpoenas through inherent contempt."
