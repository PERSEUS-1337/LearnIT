    "content": "This report examines recent laws and congressional proposals regarding gun regulation in the District of Columbia. Key statutes and bills include federal provisions, the D.C. Firearms Control Regulation Act, the Second Amendment Enforcement Act, and the District's Firearms Control Amendment Act. Congressional proposals often coincide with discussions on voting rights for the District. The report analyzes congressional proposals to amend DC's gun laws, focusing on Title II of S. 160 from the 111th Congress and H.R. 645 from the 112th Congress. It discusses the impact of these proposals on DC firearms laws post the FCAA and IPAA, following the Supreme Court's decision in District of Columbia v. Heller. The Supreme Court's decision in District of Columbia v. Heller affirmed an individual's right to possess a firearm for self-defense within the home and declared unconstitutional three provisions of the District's Firearms Control Regulation Act. After the Supreme Court's decision in District of Columbia v. Heller, the DC Council enacted emergency legislation to comply with the ruling while considering permanent legislation. The Firearms Control Emergency Amendment Act of 2008 was met with criticism for not fully complying with Heller. In response, H.R. 6691, the Second Amendment Enforcement Act, was introduced in Congress to potentially overturn the DC Council's actions. In the 110th Congress, H.R. 6691, introduced by Representative Travis Childers, aimed to change DC's gun laws. It was later incorporated into H.R. 6842, which passed in the House but not in the Senate. In the 111th Congress, Senator John Ensign introduced S.Amdt. 575 to S. 160, based on H.R. 6842, which was approved but faced delays. The DC Council enacted emergency legislation while permanent legislation was stalled. The Firearms Control Amendment Act of 2008 and the Inoperable Pistol Amendment Act of 2008 were passed and later upheld in court. The United States District Court for the District of Columbia adopted language from a bill introduced in the 110th Congress for Title II- S. 160. H.R. 645 seeks to amend firearms provisions in the DC Code, limiting the District's ability to regulate firearm possession and repealing the registration scheme. Federal firearms laws establish minimum standards. Federal firearms laws set minimum standards in the US for regulations. States and territories can add more restrictive laws, as long as they align with the Supreme Court's decision in District of Columbia v. Heller. The District of Columbia has authority to create its own laws under the Home Rule Act. The District of Columbia has the authority to regulate firearms under the Home Rule Act, allowing them to make necessary regulations. Congress can still legislate for the District and impose limits on its legislative authority. The District of Columbia can regulate firearms under the Home Rule Act, but Congress can impose limits on its authority. Congressional acts may restrict the District's ability to amend or repeal them. For example, H.R. 645 and S. 160 limit the District's power to regulate firearms. The District of Columbia is restricted from enacting laws that discourage private ownership or use of firearms for legitimate purposes. The proposed language emphasizes that the Council cannot create laws related to firearms regulation, even with authority granted under the DC Code or other provisions of law. The proposed language restricts the District of Columbia from enacting laws that discourage private ownership or use of firearms. It limits the District's ability to create stricter provisions beyond federal firearms laws. The proposed language restricts the District of Columbia from enacting laws that discourage private ownership or use of firearms. It limits the District's ability to create stricter provisions beyond federal firearms laws, including regulating the carrying of firearms but not explicitly prohibiting individuals from carrying firearms altogether. The District of Columbia could argue for a ban on open or concealed carry despite congressional provisions, but it may not have the authority to do so under the language of H.R. 645. The DC Code's definition of \"machine gun\" prior to Heller included any semiautomatic weapon capable of shooting more than 12 shots without manual reloading. Under the District's old definition, a \"machine gun\" was any semiautomatic weapon capable of shooting more than 12 shots without manual reloading. The NFA defines a \"machine gun\" as a weapon that can shoot automatically more than one shot with a single trigger function. The FCAA amended the District's definition to align with the federal definition. The District amended its definition of \"machine gun\" to align with the federal definition, allowing semiautomatic firearms to be registered. However, a list of prohibited firearms, similar to California's laws, has also been enacted. If H.R. 645 passes, the definition of \"machine gun\" would revert to its pre-Heller state. The DC Code previously prohibited registration of certain firearms, including sawed-off shotguns and machine guns. The District now allows the registration of pistols for self-defense under the FCAA, aligning with the federal definition of \"machine gun\" to include semiautomatic handguns. The FCAA also includes exemptions for temporary possession of registered firearms for self-defense in the home. Amendments have been made to the qualification and information requirements for firearm registration. The FCAA sets qualifications for firearm registration, including prohibitions for those with certain criminal histories or violent behavior within five years of applying. Applicants must complete a firearms training course and pass a competency test. The Chief of Police is required to submit registered pistols for ballistics identification and is limited to registering one pistol per person every 30 days. H.R. 645 would repeal the registration requirement for firearms in DC, eliminating the need for a registration certificate. H.R. 645 would eliminate the registration certificate requirement for firearms in DC, removing the need for ballistics testing and limiting the number of pistols an individual can register per month. The bill would also remove restrictions on the purchase of handguns per month. Section 5 of H.R. 645 eliminates the need for ammunition certificates and tracking by licensed dealers, allowing the transfer of ammunition to any person, including DC residents. It also addresses the interstate purchase of firearms, along with Title II- S. 160, which permits such purchases in a different manner. H.R. 645 proposes an amendment to allow federal licensees in Maryland or Virginia to sell handguns to District of Columbia residents, with compliance to both DC and local jurisdiction laws. The District of Columbia's trigger lock requirement, previously declared unconstitutional, has been amended under the FCAA to mandate that firearms in lawful possession be unloaded and secured by a trigger lock. This policy prohibits storing loaded firearms on premises under one's control. The FCAA prohibits storing loaded firearms on premises under one's control unless securely locked, with penalties for negligent storage. H.R. 645 creates penalties for allowing minors access to loaded firearms resulting in injury. H.R. 645 imposes penalties for negligent storage of loaded firearms leading to injury, with fines and possible imprisonment. Exceptions include securely locked containers or trigger locks without informing minors of access. The negligent storage of firearms leading to injury can result in penalties under H.R. 645, with exceptions for securely locked containers or trigger locks. Exceptions also apply if the minor was not informed of the location of the key or combination, the firearm was stored on the person's body, the minor gained access unlawfully, the minor was acting in self-defense, engaged in supervised hunting or target shooting, or if the firearm is in possession of a law enforcement officer on duty. Under DC law, a violation of the registration scheme for unregistered possession of a firearm in certain areas can result in a fine or imprisonment. H.R. 645 aims to repeal this provision and remove criminal penalties for selling firearms to minors. The District also amended definitions for firearms like \"machine gun\" and \"sawed off shotgun.\" The FCAA and IPAA aim to harmonize definitions of firearms between Titles 7 and 22 of the DC Code. H.R. 645 continues this harmonization by addressing terms like \"firearm,\" \"machine gun,\" \"pistol,\" \"place of business,\" \"sawed off shotgun,\" and \"shotgun.\" The IPAA allows DC to restrict possession of firearms on its property and private property owners to do the same, with exceptions for law enforcement. Section 10 of H.R. 645 also addresses property owners' rights to restrict firearms on their premises. Section 10 of H.R. 645 allows private property owners in the District of Columbia to restrict firearms on their premises, with exceptions for law enforcement. The District also has the authority to prohibit firearms on public property, including buildings or areas under its control with implemented security measures. The proposed language in H.R. 645 allows private property owners in the District of Columbia to restrict firearms on their premises, with exceptions for law enforcement. It applies to buildings or structures under the District's control with security measures in place, but it is unclear if the District can regulate firearms on other real property under its control. The language also exempts lessees occupying residential or business premises from these restrictions. The District of Columbia has authority over lessees in buildings under its control, but it is unclear if this extends to all buildings or only those with security measures. The IPAA repealed the Chief's authority to issue licenses for concealed firearms. H.R. 645 would repeal the provision that prohibits carrying rifles or shotguns in the District of Columbia, allowing the Chief to issue licenses for concealed carry. States can also impose their own laws on carrying firearms. The District currently permits registered firearm owners to carry their firearms at home, for recreational purposes, at their place of business, or as otherwise permitted by law. H.R. 645 would modify the provision granting authority to carry firearms without a license in certain circumstances, such as in a person's dwelling house, place of business, or while engaged in lawful recreational activities. H.R. 645 would restore the Chief's authority to issue concealed carry licenses, allowing firearm owners to carry their weapons outside specific circumstances. The bill also maintains provisions for lawful transportation of firearms, permitting individuals to transport firearms for any lawful purpose as long as it complies with the law. The IPAA made a technical change to the District Code by including toy and antique pistols as types of firearms that are prohibited from being used to commit a violent or dangerous crime, and violators are subject to certain criminal penalties. H.R. 645 would provide jurisdiction to the Office of Administrative Hearings to hear cases pertaining to the denial or revocation of firearms dealer licenses. The FCAA granted the Office of Administrative Hearings jurisdiction over firearm registration certificates, but this may be unnecessary if H.R. 645 repeals the registration scheme. Amendments to the DC Code under the FCAA and IPAA would be repealed by H.R. 645, restoring previous laws. The DC Code's provisions on dealer licenses and firearm transfers depend on registration certificates. The FCAA created new requirements for obtaining a dealer's license and registration certificate for firearms. H.R. 645 would repeal the District's registration scheme, allowing qualified individuals to apply for a dealer's license and engage in firearm transactions without certain reporting duties. The federal GCA prohibits certain categories of persons from possessing firearms, including those convicted of certain crimes, fugitives, drug users, individuals with mental health issues, illegal immigrants, dishonorably discharged military personnel, and others. Under the federal GCA, certain categories of persons are prohibited from possessing firearms, including those convicted of crimes, fugitives, drug users, individuals with mental health issues, and illegal immigrants. The FCAA imposes new eligibility requirements for transferring firearms in DC, requiring compliance with federal law and additional DC law eligibility criteria. Non-licensed persons can only sell or transfer firearms to licensed dealers under DC law, meaning private sales between non-licensed individuals must go through a licensed dealer, a provision that remains unchanged in H.R. 645. Under H.R. 645, licensed dealers would still be prohibited from transferring firearms to individuals prohibited by federal or DC law. The bill would remove registration requirements under the DC Code, making only federal law disqualifications applicable. Additionally, the assault weapons ban under the FCAA would be impacted, defining assault weapons based on specific characteristics and including semiautomatic firearms. The definition of \"assault weapon\" includes shotguns with a revolving cylinder, but excludes those designed for .22 caliber rimfire ammunition. The Chief can designate any firearm as an assault weapon if it poses a similar threat. Antique firearms and certain pistols for Olympic target shooting are not considered assault weapons. The new definition applies to the Assault Weapon Manufacturing Strict Liability Act of 1990, holding manufacturers, importers, or dealers strictly liable for damages resulting from the discharge of an assault weapon. The FCAA in the District of Columbia prohibits possession of large capacity ammunition feeding devices, which are defined as devices capable of holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition. This restriction remains in place despite the allowance for residents to register and possess semiautomatic firearms. Under the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, licensed dealers are prohibited from transferring firearms without a background check through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). Once approved, the licensee may transfer the firearm unless a state imposes a waiting period. Non-licensed persons are not required to undergo background checks. The DC Code imposes a 48-hour waiting period for the transfer of pistols or handguns, but under the IPAA, the waiting period for all firearms is now 10 days. The IPAA defines a firearm as any weapon designed to expel a projectile by explosive action. Title II- S. 160 would not have changed the waiting period, which would still apply to pistols only. If the IPAA is repealed, the waiting period for obtaining a handgun would revert back to 48 hours. The FCAA adds provisions for microstamping on semiautomatic pistols manufactured after January 1, 2011. It requires manufacturers to provide the Chief with specific information about the pistol when presented with a recovered cartridge code. New Section 504 of the FCAA prohibits the manufacture, sale, transfer, or possession of pistols not on the California Roster in DC as of January 1, 2009. Residents can only sell or transfer such pistols through licensed firearms dealers. The Chief must review the California Roster annually for updates. The Chief is authorized to revise the roster of handguns determined not to be unsafe annually. Discharging a firearm without a permit is unlawful, except for legitimate self-defense. The District can prohibit possession of firearms on its property and private property owners can do the same, except for law enforcement personnel. These provisions would be repealed if H.R. 645 became law."
