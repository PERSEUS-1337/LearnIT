    "content": "Deep learning models use word embeddings like word2vec or GloVe to represent words as continuous vectors, enabling easier integration with neural layers. Storing and accessing embedding vectors for all words requires a lot of space, which can strain systems with limited GPU memory. To address this, word2ket and word2ketXS methods inspired by quantum computing were proposed for efficient storage during training and inference. These methods achieve a significant reduction in space needed for embeddings without sacrificing accuracy in natural language processing tasks. Modern deep learning approaches for natural language processing rely on word vector representations to convert human language into a continuous space suitable for neural networks. One-hot representation maps each word to a row in an identity matrix, but word embedding methods like word2vec and GloVe use smaller vectors to represent words, capturing semantic relationships efficiently. The embeddings in deep learning models capture semantic relationships between words, with vocabulary sizes reaching up to 10^5 or 10^6. The d x p embedding matrix is a significant part of the model's parameter space, with dimensions ranging from p = 300 to p = 1024. Storing this matrix in GPU memory is essential for efficient training and inference. In classical computing, information is stored in bits, while in quantum computing, a qubit is described by a two-dimensional complex unit-norm vector. A qubit in quantum computing is represented by a two-dimensional complex unit-norm vector from set C2. Entanglement allows interconnected qubits in a register to have exponential state space dimensionality. Unlike classical bits, entangled qubits cannot be decomposed into individual states. Quantum registers can be approximated classically by storing vectors of size m using O(log m) space. The paper introduces two methods, word2ket and word2ketXS, inspired by quantum computing, for efficiently storing word embedding matrices in NLP machine learning algorithms. These methods operate independently or jointly on word embeddings, offering high efficiency in storage. Empirical evidence from NLP tasks shows that the new word2ket embeddings are effective despite the loss of representation power. The new word2ket embeddings offer high space saving rates with minimal impact on downstream NLP model accuracy. A tensor product space V \u2297 W is constructed using ordered pairs v \u2297 w, where v \u2208 V and w \u2208 W, with defined addition and multiplication properties. The inner product between v \u2297 w and v \u2297 w is the product of individual inner products v, v and w, w. The Hilbert space V \u2297 W consists of equivalence classes of pairs v \u2297 w, where equivalent vectors can be written in different ways. In a tensor product space, vectors are often called tensors. Orthonormal basis sets {\u03c8 j } and {\u03c6 k } in spaces V and W form an orthonormal basis {\u03c8 j \u2297 \u03c6 k } in V \u2297 W. The dimensionality of V \u2297 W is the product of dimensionalities of V and W. Tensor product spaces can be created by multiple applications of tensor product. In Dirac notation, a vector u \u2208 C 2 n is written as |u and called a ket. In quantum computing, a vector u \u2208 C 2 n is represented as |u, called a ket, with a countable orthonormal basis. The tensor product space contains vectors of the form v \u2297 w and their linear combinations, some of which cannot be expressed as \u03c6 \u2297 \u03c8. In tensor product spaces, coefficients a, b, c, d are constrained to specific values for entanglement. Tensors of rank greater than one are entangled. The maximum rank in higher-order tensor spaces is unknown. A word embedding model maps word identifiers to a real Hilbert space to capture semantic information. In word embedding models, individual words are represented as vectors in a matrix. The embedding of a single word is represented as an entangled tensor with specific dimensions. The tensor has a rank and order that determine its space complexity. It is important to choose a suitable dimension for the tensor to avoid unnecessary space usage. If downstream computations involve inner products of embedding vectors, the q n-dimensional vectors do not need to be explicitly calculated. The calculation of inner product between word embeddings in word2ket takes O (rq log q log p) time and O (1) additional space. In applications, a small number of embedding vectors are needed for processing through neural network layers. The total space requirement for a batch of b words is O (bp + rq log q log p). Reconstructing a single word embedding vector from a tensor of rank r and order n takes O (rn log 2 p) arithmetic operations. The tensor product space is arranged into a balanced tensor product tree for parallel processing. The proposed word2ket representation involves parallel processing of word embeddings using a balanced tree structure, reducing sequential processing time to O(log2n). To address high Lipschitz constant in gradient calculations, LayerNorm is used at each node in the tensor product tree. The text discusses the use of LayerNorm in a word embedding model involving linear operators and tensor products. It explains how linear operators map vectors from one space to another and how tensor products of linear operators work in a finite-dimensional case. The model is represented as a linear operator that maps one-hot vectors to word embedding vectors. The text discusses the efficient representation of word embeddings using linear operators and tensor products. It explains how a matrix can represent the linear operator mapping one-hot vectors to word embedding vectors, achieving space efficiency through tensor product-based exponential compression. The text discusses the efficient representation of word embeddings using linear operators and tensor products, achieving space efficiency through tensor product-based exponential compression. Lazy tensors are used to reconstruct rows of the embedding matrix efficiently. The proposed space-efficient word embeddings were evaluated in three NLP tasks: text summarization, language translation, and question answering. In text summarization experiments, the proposed space-efficient embeddings were evaluated using a bidirectional RNN encoder-decoder architecture with attention-based RNN decoder. The models were trained for 20 epochs with a dropout rate of 0.2 and results were reported using Rouge 1, 2, and L metrics. The study evaluated space-efficient embeddings using Rouge scores and tested different dimensionalities. Word2ket achieved a 16-fold reduction in parameters with a slight drop in Rouge scores. Word2ketXS was more space-efficient, offering a 34,000 fold reduction in parameters with minimal score reduction. The focus shifted to word2ketXS for NLP tasks, including German-English machine translation using the IWSLT2014 dataset. The study explored space-efficient embeddings using different dimensionalities and models for NLP tasks. Results showed a drop in BLEU score with reduced parameter space. The DrQA model was used for the Stanford Question Answering Dataset, achieving a test set F1 score. The study investigated space-efficient embeddings with a vocabulary size of 118,655 and dimensionality of 300. By increasing the tensor order in word2ketXS to four, significant space savings were achieved with a slight drop in F1 score. Training times increased with higher tensor orders, reaching 9 hours for order-4 tensors on a single NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU. The study explored space-efficient embeddings with a vocabulary size of 118,655 and 300 dimensions. Training times increased on a machine with 2 Intel Xeon Gold 6146 CPUs and 384 GB RAM, but the dynamics of model training remained consistent. Significant reductions in memory usage were observed in the word embedding part of the model, particularly in the input layers of sequence-to-sequence models. Transformer models like BERT, GPT-2, RoBERTa, and Sparse Transformers require millions of parameters to function effectively, with a notable portion dedicated to word embeddings. In RoBERTa BASE, 30% of parameters are allocated to word embeddings. Additional memory is needed during training to store activations in all layers for gradient calculations. Various methods have been proposed to reduce memory requirements for word embeddings, such as dictionary learning, word embedding clustering, and bit encoding. Various approaches have been proposed to compress models for low-memory inference and training, including pruning, quantization, sparsity, and low numerical precision methods. Fourier-based approximation methods have also been used for approximating matrices. However, none of these approaches can match the space-saving rates achieved by word2ketXS. Bit encoding methods are limited to a space-saving rate of at most 32 for 32-bit architectures. Other methods like parameter sharing or PCA offer higher saving rates but are limited by vocabulary size and embedding dimensionality. Tensor product spaces have been used for document embeddings by sketching n-grams in the document."
