    "title": "SB 1325",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 25247 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to require the department to review and approve plans submitted under Section 25246 if they comply with regulations and state/federal laws. Approval may be delayed until certain conditions are met, including approval under the Water Code or if immediate approval is necessary for public health or safety. The department must review and approve hazardous waste facility postclosure plans in compliance with state laws. Plans can be imposed through enforcement orders, agreements, or permits, and must comply with the California Environmental Quality Act. Before approving or modifying a hazardous waste facility postclosure plan, the department must allow for public involvement, including notice and comment opportunities. The department determines a \"significant modification\" as a change that would require a class 3 permit modification for hazardous waste facilities. Factors considered include similarity to class 3 modifications in regulations and public concern. The department has the authority to order necessary actions at a facility to protect public health or safety, without limiting or delaying such actions. If the department requires a hazardous waste facility postclosure plan through an enforcement order or agreement instead of a permit, the owner must pay a specified fee or enter a cost reimbursement agreement. The fee is due at the start of the postclosure period. The department may enforce a postclosure plan through various actions, including filing an injunction, requiring corrective action, and assessing civil penalties for violations. This does not apply to plans with permits issued before December 31, 2003, unless mutually replaced with an enforcement order or agreement. The department must adopt regulations by January 1, 2018, to impose postclosure plan requirements. If deemed necessary, the department can replace an enforcement order with a postclosure permit for a hazardous waste facility. This section does not limit the department's authority to take action to protect public health, safety, or the environment. Section 25247 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to require the department to review and approve plans submitted under Section 25246 if they comply with regulations and state/federal laws. Approval may be delayed until certain conditions are met, including approval under the Water Code or if immediate approval is necessary for public health or environmental protection. The department must review and approve hazardous waste facility postclosure plans in compliance with state laws, including the California Environmental Quality Act. Enforcement orders, agreements, or permits may be used to impose these requirements on facility owners or operators. Before approving or modifying a hazardous waste facility postclosure plan, the department must allow public involvement, including notice and comment opportunities. A \"significant modification\" for a hazardous waste facility permit is determined by the department based on similarity to class 3 modifications in regulations and public concern. The department has the authority to order actions to protect public health or safety at a facility. If a hazardous waste facility postclosure plan is imposed, the owner must enter into a cost reimbursement agreement and pay the required fee at the start of the postclosure period. The department has the authority to enforce postclosure plans through various actions, including injunctions, corrective actions, and civil penalties for violations. This does not apply to plans with permits issued before December 31, 2003, unless mutually replaced with an enforcement order or agreement. The department must adopt regulations by January 1, 2018, for postclosure plan requirements. If needed, a postclosure permit can replace an enforcement order or agreement. The department retains authority to order actions for public health or safety. Section 1.5 of the bill includes amendments to Section 25247 of the Health and Safety Code, contingent on the enactment of Assembly Bill 1611 or Senate Bill 839 by January 1, 2017. If this bill is enacted last, the amended Section 25247 will only be operative until the effective date of this bill."
