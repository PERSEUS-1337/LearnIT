    "content": "Under the CRA, agencies must submit a report to Congress and the GAO before a rule can take effect, including a summary of the rule, designation of whether it is \"major,\" and proposed effective date. Major rules require additional time for Congressional review, with GAO assessing the agency's compliance. Congress can use expedited procedures to overturn a rule by submitting a resolution of disapproval. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) allows Congress to use expedited procedures to overturn a rule by submitting a resolution of disapproval. The expedited procedures include a Senate committee being discharged from further consideration with a petition signed by 30 Senators, a nondebatable motion to proceed to consider the disapproval resolution requiring a simple majority, up to 10 hours of debate, and a simple majority vote for passage. If both houses pass the joint resolution, it is sent to the President for signature or veto. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) allows Congress to overturn a rule by submitting a resolution of disapproval. If the President vetoes the resolution, Congress can vote to override the veto. If a joint resolution of disapproval is signed by the President or Congress overrides the veto, the rule is deemed not to have had any effect. The CRA also prohibits the issuance of a rule in substantially the same form as the disapproved rule without specific authorization by a subsequent law. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) allows Congress to overturn a rule by submitting a resolution of disapproval. The CRA governs \"rules\" promulgated by a \"federal agency,\" using the definition of \"agency\" provided in the APA. The more difficult interpretive issue is what types of agency actions should be considered \"rules\" under the CRA. The CRA adopts a broad definition of the word \"rule\" from the APA, but then creates three exceptions to that definition. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) allows Congress to overturn agency rules through a resolution of disapproval. The definition of \"rule\" under the CRA is broad, encompassing agency statements that implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy. The CRA narrows this definition by excluding rules of particular applicability. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) allows Congress to overturn agency rules through a resolution of disapproval. The definition of \"rule\" under the CRA is broad, encompassing agency statements that implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy. Determining whether agency action is a rule subject to the CRA involves a two-part inquiry: first, determining if it qualifies as a rule under the APA definition, and second, determining if it falls within any exceptions to the CRA's definition of rule. This section of the report provides a detailed explanation of these two elements. Courts have distinguished agency rulemaking actions from adjudicatory and investigatory functions. To qualify as a rule under the APA, an agency statement must be of general applicability, have future effect, and be designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy. The CRA exempts rules of particular applicability, rules relating to agency management or personnel, and any rule of agency organization, procedure, or practice that does not substantially affect non-agency parties' rights or obligations. Both inquiries are fact-specific. The CRA defines the word \"rule\" by incorporating the APA's definition. Cases interpreting the APA's definition of \"rule\" may provide guidance for interpreting the CRA. The APA distinguishes different types of agency actions, separating rules from orders and investigatory acts, which may be relevant when determining if an agency action is subject to the CRA. An agency action subject to the CRA is defined as a rule under the APA. The APA distinguishes between rules and orders, with orders resulting from agency adjudication. Courts determine if an action is a rule or order based on its substance, not just its label. Adjudications resolve specific disputes, while rulemaking affects broad classes of individuals. Rulemaking is prospective and has a definitive effect on individuals after the rule is applied. Courts distinguish rules from agency investigations, with some investigative actions not subject to rulemaking requirements. However, some actions related to investigations may qualify as rules, as observed in a federal court of appeals case. The APA defines a \"rule\" as a statement with general applicability, future effect, and designed to implement law or policy. Courts differentiate rules from orders by their prospective nature, intended to guide future conduct. The APA defines a \"rule\" as a statement with general applicability, future effect, and designed to implement law or policy. Courts differentiate rules from orders by their prospective nature, intended to guide future conduct. Some argue that not every agency statement with future effect should be considered a rule under the APA, only those that authoritatively answer an underlying issue. The APA defines a \"rule\" as a statement with general applicability, future effect, and designed to implement law or policy. Some argue that only agency statements that authoritatively answer an underlying issue should be considered rules. However, there are unanswered questions regarding the interpretation of \"future effect\" in the APA definition of a rule. This includes the distinction between a binding agency statement and the requirement for notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures. The legal effect test for notice-and-comment rulemaking determines if a rule binds an agency, while the future effect inquiry tests if an agency action is considered a \"rule\" under the APA. These tests are tied to different statutory provisions and should not both rely on whether a rule is legally binding. This is especially relevant for interpretive rules that may not require notice-and-comment but are still considered \"rules\" within the APA. The APA defines interpretive rules as \"rules\" exempt from notice-and-comment procedures. Agency actions must implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy to be considered APA rules. Merely restating existing law or policy does not qualify as a rule under the APA. The APA outlines rulemaking procedures for agencies to follow when formulating, amending, or repealing rules. Notice-and-comment rulemaking requires agencies to publish proposed rules in the Federal Register and allow public comment. However, certain agency acts like interpretative rules, general policy statements, or organizational rules are exempt from these procedures. The APA's rulemaking procedures do not apply to agency management or personnel matters. Agency statements like guidance documents or procedural rules may not need notice-and-comment rulemaking but can still be considered APA \"rules.\" Courts often exempt agency guidance documents from rulemaking requirements, categorizing them as interpretative rules or general policy statements. Interpretive rules clarify existing legal obligations without imposing new ones, while general policy statements describe how an agency will exercise enforcement discretion without being binding. The distinction between \"legislative\" rules and general policy statements lies in whether the agency action binds private parties or the agency itself with the 'force of law.' General policy statements are not legally binding and do not require notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures. Some cases suggest that general policy statements may not be considered \"rules\" under the APA definition if they do not bind the agency to a particular legal position. The APA distinguishes between \"legislative\" rules and general policy statements based on their binding effect. General policy statements, while not legally binding, may still be considered APA rules. The CRA incorporates the APA definition of \"rule\" and should be interpreted in line with judicial constructions of that definition. Some courts apply APA's rules vs. orders distinction to CRA interpretation. CRA may not apply to agency orders or investigatory acts. Debate on using CRA to revoke agency guidance documents. Definition of \"guidance document\" not clear under CRA or APA. Agency statements labeled as guidance may still qualify as \"rules\" under CRA. The CRA's definition of \"rule\" includes agency guidance documents, which may not be exempt from CRA requirements even if labeled as guidance under the APA. The CRA's definition of \"rule\" includes agency guidance documents, which may not be exempt from CRA requirements even if labeled as guidance under the APA. Consequently, agency guidance documents subject to the CRA may not have significant legal effect, but the CRA was intended to encompass a broad range of agency actions beyond those subject to APA's notice-and-comment rulemaking requirements. The CRA's definition of \"rule\" under subsection 804(3) is broad and includes agency policy statements, interpretive rules, and certain rules of agency organization. There is ambiguity regarding whether non-binding statements are considered rules under the APA and therefore under the CRA. The CRA's definition of \"rule\" is broad and includes agency policy statements. GAO has concluded that general policy statements should be considered \"rules\" under the CRA, even if they are not rules under the APA definition. The CRA exempts certain rules from its definition, such as rules of particular applicability or relating to agency management. The CRA contains exemptions for rules related to monetary policy by the Federal Reserve, rules with \"good cause\" exceptions, and rules for hunting, fishing, or camping activities. These exemptions allow agencies to determine when rules take effect, despite CRA requirements. The CRA exempts rules of particular applicability, which are directed at specifically named parties. GAO has stated that for a rule to be generally applicable under the CRA, it does not need to apply to the population as a whole, but must have general applicability within its intended range. For example, GAO found that an agency decision to counter decreased river flows in a specific river basin was not of particular applicability, despite its geographic specificity. The CRA exempts rules of particular applicability, which are directed at specifically named parties. GAO has stated that for a rule to be generally applicable under the CRA, it does not need to apply to the population as a whole, but must have general applicability within its intended range. Examples of rules of particular applicability include those that approve future rates, wages, prices, services, corporate structures, mergers, acquisitions, accounting practices, and disclosures. IRS private letter rulings and Customs Service letter rulings are cited as classic examples. Courts have also considered agency actions designating specific sites under environmental laws as rules of particular applicability. The CRA exempts rules of particular applicability, such as those covering specific sites under environmental laws. The second exemption excludes rules related to agency management or personnel, similar to the APA's exemption. Courts have interpreted this exemption to cover internal matters that do not substantially affect parties outside the agency. It is unclear if the substantial-effect requirement developed by courts in the APA context should apply to the CRA. The CRA's second exemption, for rules related to agency management or personnel, may be interpreted more broadly than the APA's exemption, as it does not mention a rule's effect on third parties. This could mean that the CRA's second exemption excludes such rules regardless of their impact on third parties, unlike the APA. Congress may have intentionally created a substantial-effect requirement for the third exemption while omitting it from the second one. This interpretation could displace the ordinary presumption that Congress incorporates case law interpreting similar statutory provisions. The CRA's second exemption may be broader than the APA's, as it lacks a requirement for a rule's effect on third parties. Congress may have added a substantial-effect requirement to the third exemption to clarify ambiguity in interpreting similar provisions in the APA. The APA also excludes rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice from notice-and-comment rulemaking, which courts have interpreted broadly to include agency decisions on how regulated entities comply with investigative requirements. The APA does not explicitly limit exceptions to rules that do not substantially affect non-agency parties. Courts have applied a substantial impact test to determine if agency actions require notice-and-comment procedures, even for procedural rules. The D.C. Circuit has recognized that procedural measures can still have a significant effect on regulated parties. The D.C. Circuit has applied a substantial impact test to determine the effect of procedural measures on regulated parties under the APA. The CRA excludes rules that do not substantially affect non-agency parties, focusing on the impact on rights or obligations. The exclusion under the CRA applies to rules with a minor effect on non-agency parties. GAO uses APA case law to analyze if actions fall under the CRA, but the tests may not directly apply. The CRA mandates agencies to submit rules to Congress and GAO before they take effect, including those from APA procedures and other agency statements. The CRA mandates agencies to submit reports to Congress and the Comptroller General, including a general statement, proposed effective date, and cost-benefit analysis for rules. GAO assesses compliance with additional informational requirements for major rules and includes its assessment in the major rule report. The report must be submitted to House and Senate committees within 15 calendar days. The report agencies must submit to Congress and the Comptroller General, along with the rule, is a two-page form containing required information. OMB provided a standard form for agencies to use in FY1999, as part of guidance on CRA compliance. Notice of final rule submission to Congress is included in daily Congressional sections. Submission of rules to Congress under the CRA is crucial as it triggers expedited procedures for introducing and considering a resolution of disapproval. This allows Members to use special \"fast track\" procedures to consider resolutions if agencies fail to submit rules to Congress. After the enactment of the CRA in 1996, concerns were raised about agencies not submitting their rules as required. In 1997 and 1998 hearings, it was noted that agencies were not fully compliant with the submission requirement. Congress then required OMB to issue guidance to improve agency compliance with the CRA. After the CRA was enacted in 1996, concerns arose about agencies not submitting rules as required. In response, OMB Director Jacob J. Lew issued a memorandum in 1999 outlining where agencies should send their rules and what information to include. GAO began monitoring agencies' compliance by comparing published rules with those submitted. This monitoring was voluntary and not mandated by the CRA. After the Congressional Review Act was enacted in 1996, concerns arose about agencies not submitting rules as required. In response, GAO conducted a review to verify agency compliance with the submission requirement. GAO submitted a list of rules published in the Federal Register but not filed with Congress to OMB's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs for distribution to affected agencies. GAO conducted reviews to ensure agency compliance with rule submission requirements. They sent lists of unsubmitted rules to OIRA for distribution to agencies. GAO criticized OIRA for not being proactive in enforcing filing requirements. GAO continued to track major rules not received after 2012 due to resource constraints. Agencies generally submit rules comprehensively, with some exceptions noted by GAO. GAO has noted exceptions, but agencies are generally comprehensive in submitting rules to Congress and GAO. However, rules not subject to notice-and-comment procedures often lack submission. GAO's tracking of compliance with submission requirements is incomplete, comparing regulations in the Federal Register to those received under the CRA. This method helps identify rules subject to the CRA. Using the Federal Register to identify rules subject to the CRA is helpful, but many agency actions not subject to notice-and-comment requirements are not published in the Federal Register or submitted to GAO. This leads to undetected rules that should have been submitted, resulting in noncompliance with the CRA's submission requirement for agency actions conducted outside the notice-and-comment rulemaking process. The practical difficulty of submitting the substantial number of agency statements that qualify as rules under the CRA could overwhelm Congress and the GAO with filings. Burying Congress in paperwork might divert attention from larger, controversial matters. The CRA's coverage may be unknown to many agencies, leading to potential challenges in identifying actions covered by the CRA beyond notice-and-comment rules. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) disagreed with HHS's position that guidance documents are not considered rules under the Congressional Review Act (CRA). The submission of rules is crucial for Congress to review under the CRA, and the Senate has developed a practice to allow for review even when agencies do not submit rules. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has issued opinions on whether certain agency actions should have been submitted under the Congressional Review Act (CRA), defining the term \"rule\" expansively. In 11 out of 21 opinions, GAO determined that the agency statements in question should have been submitted for review by Congress. These opinions are summarized in a report and listed in an appendix. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has issued opinions on whether certain agency actions should have been submitted under the Congressional Review Act (CRA). The Senate considers a GAO opinion classifying an agency action as a rule as the trigger date for submitting a disapproval resolution. GAO plays a crucial role in determining the applicability of the CRA by allowing its opinion to substitute for the actual submission of a rule. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) plays a key role in determining the applicability of the Congressional Review Act (CRA) by providing opinions on whether agency actions should be submitted under the CRA. GAO's primary statutory requirement is to provide reports on major rules to congressional committees, but it has also voluntarily created a database for non-major rules to facilitate implementation. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) voluntarily created a database for non-major rules to facilitate implementation beyond its statutory requirement. The database allows for searching rules by various elements and contains links to GAO's major rule reports. GAO's determination of agency actions as \"rules\" under the CRA is closely tied to monitoring agency compliance with submission requirements. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) voluntarily created a database for non-major rules to facilitate implementation. GAO's determination of agency actions as \"rules\" under the CRA is closely tied to monitoring agency compliance with submission requirements. GAO's role in congressional hearings on the Tongass Land Management Plan in 1997 highlighted the question of whether certain agency actions should be considered rules under the CRA. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) plays a role in advising Congress and agencies on whether their policy decisions constitute rules under the CRA. Former Senator Larry Craig questioned GAO's role in determining what qualifies as a rule, to which GAO's general counsel stated that the CRA does not specify who decides what constitutes a rule. The GAO's role in advising Congress on whether policy decisions constitute rules under the CRA is not specified by the statute. GAO's opinions are provided in an advisory capacity, and although they have issued 21 opinions on the applicability of the CRA since 1996, Congress's response has varied over time. In 2008, GAO determined that a letter from CMS regarding SCHIP was a rule under the CRA. Senator Rockefeller introduced a resolution to disapprove the guidance, but it was not acted upon due to missed deadlines. The first resolution of disapproval following a GAO opinion was in 2012 when the House passed H.J.Res. 118. The House passed a resolution in 2012 to overturn an information memorandum from the Department of Health and Human Services related to the TANF program. The Senate passed a resolution in 2018 to overturn guidance from the CFPB on auto lending. GAO opinions on whether actions are covered by the CRA are advisory and do not have legal effect. The GAO opinions on agency actions under the CRA are advisory and not legally binding. However, the Senate has treated GAO opinions as decisive in triggering the CRA disapproval process, as seen in cases where a GAO opinion led to the enactment of a joint resolution of disapproval. This indicates that Congress is willing to consider GAO opinions as a substitute for agency submissions of rules to Congress. The GAO opinions under the CRA are used by Congress to trigger the disapproval process for rules not submitted by agencies. These opinions help Congress review rules that should have been submitted under the CRA, and a provision in the CRA prevents judicial review of GAO opinions or congressional determinations regarding rule applicability. The provision in the CRA prevents judicial review of agency actions, leading to the settlement of disputes in the political arena. GAO opinions may serve as the final word on whether a rule has taken effect, as agencies must submit rules to Congress before they become operative. The CRA provision prevents judicial review of agency actions, with GAO opinions serving as the final word on rule effectiveness. Courts have been reluctant to enforce rules not submitted to Congress, suggesting agencies may view them as not subject to the CRA. The GAO opinion on agency actions and the CRA submission requirement may indicate that a rule did not take effect. The term \"effect\" in the CRA may not always refer to legal effect, especially for non-legislative rules. Some courts have found that the CRA can suspend a rule's implementation. Some courts have found that the CRA can suspend a rule's implementation, even if it technically became effective. The GAO has issued 21 opinions on whether certain agency actions qualify as rules under the CRA for disapproval. The opinions are listed chronologically based on the date of issuance. The Emergency Sale Timber Program was established to increase salvage timber sales for forest health. A memorandum from the Secretary of Agriculture regarding the program was deemed a rule under the CRA by GAO. The Department of Agriculture's Forest Service issued the Tongass National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan, which sets management direction for the forest. GAO concluded that the plan was a rule under the CRA and not excepted under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7804(3). President Clinton signed Executive Order 13061 related to the American Heritage River Initiative. The American Heritage River Initiative (AHRI) aimed to support communities in restoring and protecting rivers. President Clinton's Executive Order 13061 designated 10 rivers for the program. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) determined that actions by the President are not subject to the Congressional Review Act (CRA). The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued guidance on investigating Title VI complaints challenging permits, which GAO deemed as affecting non-agency parties and therefore a rule under the CRA. The Farm Credit Administration issued a booklet providing guidance on national charters, which GAO determined to be a legislative rule under the CRA, requiring informal rulemaking procedures. The GAO concluded that the Trinity River Record of Decision (ROD) was a \"rule\" under the CRA due to its policy-setting nature and broad effects on non-agency parties. The ROD outlined actions to restore anadromous fish in the Trinity River by addressing decreased river flows in the basin. The Department of Veterans Affairs issued a memorandum directing network directors to stop certain activities aimed at enrolling new veterans in the VA health care system. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) determined that the memorandum was not a rule under the Congressional Review Act (CRA) as it was considered a statement of agency procedure or practice that did not affect the rights or obligations of non-agency parties. The VA issued a memorandum terminating the Vendee Loan Program, which allowed the VA to make loans for the sale of foreclosed VA-guaranteed property. The memorandum, addressed to directors and loan guarantee officers, announced the discontinuation of financing for the sale of acquired properties. GAO concluded it was not a rule under the CRA as it related to agency management and did not substantially affect non-agency parties' rights or obligations. The VA terminated the Vendee Loan Program, a discretionary management decision that did not affect any party's rights or obligations. In a separate development, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services issued a letter clarifying requirements for the State Children's Health Insurance Program. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) determined that a letter regarding the State Children's Health Insurance Program and an information memorandum about the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program were rules under the Congressional Review Act (CRA). The letter clarified requirements for the SCHIP program, while the memorandum offered waivers for TANF work requirements. The GAO determined that a memorandum regarding the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program was a rule under the Congressional Review Act. It established criteria for states to apply for waivers from TANF requirements. On January 8, 2014, the EPA issued a proposed rule for greenhouse gas emissions from new stationary sources. The GAO concluded that the proposed rule regarding steam generating units and natural gas-fired combustion turbines was not covered by the CRA, as it only applies to final rules. Additionally, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency issued interagency guidance on leveraged lending on March 22, 2013. The GAO concluded that the leveraged-lending guidance was a rule under the CRA due to its future effect and lack of exceptions. The guidance included principles for safe-and-sound leveraged lending activities for agency-supervised institutions. The Forest Service amended the Tongass Land and Resource Management Plan, which outlines forest uses in different areas. The amendment was deemed a substantive rule under the CRA by the GAO, impacting the regulated community. The Bureau of Land Management also issued resource management plans for four areas in Alaska. The GAO concluded that the Eastern Interior Plan was a rule under the CRA due to its general applicability and future effect in implementing law or policy. The plan designated uses by nonagency parties in specific areas and did not fall under the exceptions. On March 21, 2013, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued guidance on indirect auto lenders' compliance with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. The GAO concluded that the bulletin on indirect auto lenders' compliance with fair lending requirements was a rule under the CRA. President Trump released a memorandum on global health assistance funding. The City Policy prohibited assistance to foreign organizations promoting abortion. The Department of State and USAID issued fact sheets to implement the policy. GAO determined these actions were not rules under the CRA as they were implementing the President's decision. The court ruled that agency actions implementing President Trump's policy decision were not subject to review under the APA, citing precedent that the President has broad discretion in foreign affairs. IRS announced it would not accept electronically filed tax returns without ACA reporting requirements for the 2018 tax filing season. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) concluded that the agency statement regarding full-year health coverage and shared responsibility payments is not a rule under the CRA. The Social Security Administration's (SSA) manual outlines how disability benefit claims are processed under the Social Security Act. The SSA manual policy prohibits using Internet information in benefit claim decisions, except for specific procedures. GAO determined these sections are procedural rules exempt from the CRA. IRS issued Revenue Procedure 2018-38 modifying reporting requirements for tax-exempt entities, submitted to Congress under the CRA. Senator Orrin Hatch requested GAO's opinion on the matter. The GAO was asked by Senator Orrin Hatch to determine if the IRS revenue procedure submitted under the CRA was considered a \"rule.\" The IRS argued it was not covered by the CRA, but submitted it for Congress to decide. This was a unique situation as the GAO had to consider the CRA's application after the IRS had already submitted the procedure to Congress. The GAO confirmed that the IRS revenue procedure was available for congressional review under the CRA because the IRS had already submitted it, triggering Congress's oversight powers. GAO's opinion focused on the submission triggering review, stating that there was no impediment to Congress exercising its powers under the CRA. The GAO concluded that the April 2018 memorandum on zero-tolerance for illegal border crossings was not a rule under the CRA as it pertained to agency organization and did not change individuals' rights. This exception was covered by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7804(3)(C). In 2018, the Secretary of Commerce justified adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census in a memorandum to the Under Secretary of Commerce for Economic Affairs. The Census Bureau included the citizenship question in its planned questions for the census after receiving the directive from the Secretary. The GAO determined that the memorandum was not a rule under the CRA, as it was part of the statutory process of informing Congress about census questions. The memorandum justifying the citizenship question on the census did not meet the definition of a \"rule\" under the CRA, as it was part of the process of informing Congress about census questions."
