If the State seizes property forfeited by an individual due to a criminal conviction, they must hold the property until the state agency confirms any child support arrearages. If there are arrearages, the property should be sold to satisfy the claims. After satisfying all other claimants and deducting costs, the remaining proceeds or arrearage amount is paid to the State agency for distribution.
