    "content": "The 9/11 Commission report in July 2004 highlighted that key officials responsible for alien admissions were not fully involved in counterterrorism efforts before September 11, 2001, leading to missed opportunities to intercept the terrorists. The report emphasized the need for intelligence and law enforcement to exploit al Qaeda's travel vulnerabilities, as the hijackers had known ties to the group and exhibited suspicious behaviors during their entry into the United States. The 9/11 Commission issued recommendations related to immigration law and policy, emphasizing the importance of targeting travel to combat terrorism. They called for integrating border security into a larger screening network and implementing a biometric entry-exit system. The 9/11 Commission issued recommendations for immigration law and policy, emphasizing collaboration with other governments to prevent terrorist entry. Proposed reforms in the 108th Congress included bills like H.R. 10 and S. 2845, focusing on immigration law revisions. The National Intelligence Reform Act of 2004, including immigration provisions, faced contention among lawmakers. The compromise bill, the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, was signed on December 17, 2004, incorporating some immigration provisions. The major areas of reform proposals included in these bills are briefly discussed. Following the 9/11 Commission's recommendations, Congress enacted measures to improve the tracking of aliens entering and leaving the United States, including the development of an automated entry and exit data system and the use of biometric identifiers in travel documents for enhanced security. The National Intelligence Reform Act of 2004 faced contention among lawmakers, leading to the compromise bill, the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, which incorporated some immigration provisions. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 required pre-inspection of aliens abroad before their departure to the United States. Proposals in the 108th Congress aimed to improve monitoring of persons entering and exiting the US, including the development of a biometric entry and exit data system integrated with various databases. The 108th Congress proposed measures to enhance security for passengers traveling to and from the United States, including pre-flight passenger record checks against the terrorist watch list, implementing a watchlist for cruise ship passengers, and establishing pre-enrollment programs for expedited entry inspections. Additionally, efforts were made to improve passport and travel document security. The 108th Congress proposed measures to enhance security for passengers traveling to and from the United States, including strengthening security requirements for breeder documents used to obtain passports, encouraging international standards for name translation, expanding pre-inspection programs in foreign countries, and improving visa issuance security through training and establishing an Office of Visa and Passport Security within the State Department. The 108th Congress proposed measures to enhance security for travelers, including developing a strategic plan to disrupt travel document fraud, increasing consular officers, requiring visa applicants aged 12-65 to be interviewed, and authorizing agreements to curb terrorist travel. The 108th Congress proposed measures to enhance security for travelers, including requiring U.S. citizens traveling abroad to have a valid U.S. passport and amending waiver authority for document requirements for arriving nationals from foreign contiguous countries. The 108th Congress proposed measures to enhance security for travelers, including requiring U.S. citizens and foreign nationals from contiguous territories to present biometric passports for travel into the United States. This plan would be developed and implemented in consultation with the Secretary of State and DHS. For more information on related topics, refer to CRS reports on border security, monitoring foreign students, US-VISIT program, visa issuances, and the Visa Waiver Program. The Immigration and Nationality Act establishes admission and removal criteria for foreign nationals entering the United States, including forms of relief from removal like asylum. Congress has expanded grounds for inadmissibility and deportation through various acts, such as the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 and the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. After the 9/11 attacks, Congress expanded terrorism grounds for inadmissibility and removal in response to concerns about immigration law loopholes aiding terrorists. The Supreme Court upholds judicial review of removal decisions, stating that eliminating it would raise constitutional issues. Loopholes and inadequacies in immigration laws allowed terrorists to enter and stay in the US. Proposed changes sought to broaden terror-related activities that would make aliens inadmissible or deportable, and limit relief from removal. This included barring aliens engaged in terrorist activity from withholding removal, expanding grounds for inadmissibility and deportability related to terrorism, and denying relief to aliens involved in terror-related activities like incitement or espousal of terrorism. The proposed changes aim to broaden the scope of activities that would make aliens inadmissible or deportable, including providing support to terrorist organizations, committing acts of genocide or torture, and violating religious freedom. It also clarifies that aliens can be removed to their country of citizenship, birth, or residence unless prevented or prejudicial. The House-passed bill aims to give the Secretary of Homeland Security more discretion in deciding which countries to remove inadmissible or deportable aliens to. It also expands the class of aliens subject to immediate removal without further review, increases the required U.S. physical presence from two to five years, and exempts aliens currently being prosecuted or serving a criminal sentence from immediate removal. Additionally, it eliminates certain judicial reviews for removal decisions. The House-passed bill includes provisions restricting judicial review for immigration cases, such as habeas restrictions and limitations on staying removal orders. It also addresses asylum claims, requiring aliens to demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution based on specific characteristics. The House-passed bill includes provisions to establish more stringent standards for asylum applicants accused of terrorist activities, requiring them to prove that their persecution is based on specific characteristics like race, religion, nationality, or political opinion. The House-passed bill allows for indefinite detention of aliens deemed dangerous to national security pending removal, with periodic reviews by the Secretary of Homeland Security. Concerns have been raised about terrorist aliens obtaining U.S. identification documents to facilitate terrorist activities. The Commission recommended national standards for the issuance of birth certificates and drivers' licenses to prevent fraudulent acquisition by hijackers. This has been a controversial issue, with concerns over these forms of identification being linked to immigration legislation. Congress provided standards for acceptance of state drivers' licenses and birth certificates for federal purposes, leading to allegations of a move towards a national identification card. In response to the 9/11 Commission's recommendations, proposals were made to increase federal oversight and security of identification documents like drivers' licenses and birth certificates. This included barring federal agencies from accepting state-issued IDs unless certain federal security requirements are met. The House and Senate passed legislation to prevent federal agencies from accepting state-issued documents that do not meet national standards for drivers' licenses, identification cards, and birth certificates. This includes requirements for issuance, record-keeping, and identification verification procedures. The House and Senate passed legislation to prevent federal agencies from accepting state-issued documents that do not meet national standards for drivers' licenses, identification cards, and birth certificates. This includes requirements for issuance, record-keeping, and identification verification procedures. The legislation also includes provisions for conducting periodic audits of state compliance, creating electronic birth and death registration systems, and establishing an electronic interface for verifying vital records. The House and Senate passed legislation to improve Social Security card issuance, restrict displaying SSN on driver's licenses, enhance the application process for newborn SS numbers, study photo ID requirements, verify birth records independently, and require specific documents for federal employee identity verification. The Department of Justice enforces immigration laws using specific documents, such as driver's licenses and social security cards. The DHS is responsible for border security and immigration enforcement. The DHS Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) patrols the U.S. border and conducts immigration and customs inspections at ports of entry. The DHS Bureau of Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) investigates immigration and customs violations within the country. Other federal agencies, like the State Department, also play a role in enforcing immigration laws. The 9/11 Commission emphasized the importance of a border security system that can identify individuals entering the United States. Various proposals have called for increased resources to enhance border security in response to the Commission's recommendations. Various proposals have been made to improve border security, including increasing the number of border patrol agents, immigration investigators, and consular officers. Other suggestions involve enhancing training for immigration enforcement officials, deploying technologies for document authentication, and expanding pre-inspection at foreign airports for passengers traveling to the United States. The House and Senate have passed measures to enhance border security, including expediting construction of a barrier at the San Diego border and implementing continuous surveillance with remotely piloted aircraft. Additionally, there are plans for an advanced technology security pilot program on the Northern border of the United States. For more information on border security agencies and practices, refer to CRS reports on the U.S. Border Patrol, inspections, appropriations, immigration detention, and visa policy. The INA outlines rules for aliens entering and staying in the US, with penalties for activities like smuggling and document fraud. S. 2845 aims to increase penalties for violations, including document fraud, alien smuggling, and false claims of US citizenship. For more information, refer to CRS Report RL32480. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 included some immigration provisions from S. 2845, requiring accelerated deployment of a biometric entry and exit system for aliens entering and leaving the US.

It also mandates improvements in technology and training to combat terrorist travel. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 establishes the Human Smuggling and Trafficking Center to counter terrorist travel, requires oversight of DHS's responsibilities, and creates a Visa and Passport Security Program. It also makes aliens deportable for receiving military training from designated terrorist organizations and allows for review of visa revocation in removal proceedings. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act establishes new standards for federal use of birth certificates and addresses issues related to visa revocation in removal proceedings. It also makes aliens deportable for involvement in genocide, torture, extrajudicial killing, or severe violations of religious freedom. Additionally, it mandates a study on weaknesses in the U.S. asylum system that could be exploited by terrorists. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act establishes new standards for federal use of birth certificates, driver's licenses, and identification cards. States may receive grants for implementing these standards. The act also allocates additional resources for enforcement, including increasing consular officers and border patrol agents. ICE investigators and beds for detainees will also see an increase. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act increases penalties for alien smuggling and requires outreach programs to educate the public about the consequences of illegally bringing in and harboring aliens. It also establishes new standards for federal use of birth certificates, driver's licenses, and identification cards, with grants available for states to implement these standards. Additionally, resources for enforcement, including consular officers and border patrol agents, will be increased."
