    "content": "The \"Federal Crop Insurance Fairness Act\" allows for coverage levels exceeding 75 percent of recorded or appraised average yield. Subsection (a) of section 508 of the Federal Crop Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. 1508(a)) is amended to allow the Corporation to insure agricultural producers in the United States against various unavoidable causes of loss for their crops. The Board determines insurance period and coverage for agricultural producers, with a standard yield coverage of 75% of the average yield on the insured farm. The Board may adjust average yields for fairness among farms in the same area. The Corporation offers lesser yield coverage options, including 50% coverage. Adjusted yields are set by the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service for program purposes. Insurance coverage may be provided by the Service for crops with yields greater than the recorded or appraised yield, based on adjusted yield determined by the Service. Additional premiums for increased risk must be paid without subsidies. The Corporation may offer coverage exceeding 75 percent of the average yield if normal yield variations haven't led to losses. The maximum coverage level is subject to certain exceptions. The Corporation may offer coverage up to 75 percent of the average yield, with exceptions for uninsured losses such as neglect, failure to reseed, or not following good farming practices. The price election offered should approximate the projected market price for the commodity. The Board may limit or refuse insurance based on insurance risks. Insurance may not be provided on agricultural commodities in counties where income from the commodity is unimportant, except for producers in local producing areas bordering on a county with a crop-insurance program. The Corporation must report annually to Congress on its operations for each insured commodity. Beginning in 1992, the project market price level will be considered. Beginning in 1992, the Corporation will establish a price level for each commodity on which insurance is offered, not less than the projected market price determined by the Board. Insurance coverage will be available to producers based on a price election set by the Board, quoted in dollars per acre. SEC. 3. LATE PLANTING COVERAGE. Late planting coverage is offered to producers under the Federal Crop Insurance Act, allowing planting after the final planting date for up to 25 days. The yield guarantee is reduced by 1-2 percent per day for delays beyond the normal final planting date. Late planting coverage is provided to producers under the Federal Crop Insurance Act, allowing planting after the final planting date for up to 25 days. Producers have the option to waive this coverage, and if late planting coverage would significantly increase premiums, it can be offered as a separate endorsement. SEC. 4. PREVENTED PLANTING COVERAGE. Section 508 of the Federal Crop Insurance Act is amended to include prevented planting coverage for producers. This coverage allows for 50% of the guaranteed level of coverage if planting is prevented due to excess moisture, drought, or natural disasters. Producers also have the option to plant a substitute crop under this policy. The Federal Crop Insurance Act now includes prevented planting coverage for producers, allowing for 50% of the guaranteed coverage if planting is prevented. Producers can also plant a substitute crop to offset the remaining coverage. SEC. 5. ELIMINATION OF PENALTY FOR DE MINIMIS YIELDS. The Corporation will establish a procedure where producers with disaster losses won't have deductions from indemnity payments if the market value of the production is lower than harvesting costs. SEC. 6. YIELD AVERAGES. Section 508A(b) of the Federal Crop Insurance Act is amended to include provisions for yield coverage based on a producer's actual proven crop yields over 4 to 10 years. The Corporation will establish a minimum insurance protection level for producers with reduced yields due to natural disasters. Transitional yield data can only be used to establish yields. Producers can use transitional yield data to establish yields on a farm if actual production history is not established for the first 4 crop years. Once actual production history is set, yield coverage will be based on that history. If producers operate on new land, they can choose to use previous yield history for crop insurance purposes. The Corporation will adjust Nonstandard Classification procedures to address yield declines from natural disasters. Transitional yield data, based on countywide averages, can be used if no actual production records exist for producers on a farm. The Corporation will adjust Nonstandard Classification procedures to address yield declines from natural disasters by using transitional yield data based on countywide averages if no actual production records are available for producers on a farm."
