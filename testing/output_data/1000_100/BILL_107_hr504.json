    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Community Access to Health Care Act of 2001\" and its purpose is outlined. The \"Community Access to Health Care Act of 2001\" aims to assist communities and health care providers, including those in rural areas and American Indian/Alaska Native entities, in developing or strengthening integrated health care delivery systems. This includes coordinating services for uninsured and underinsured individuals, developing infrastructure for effective collaboration among providers, and providing new Federal resources without supplanting existing funding. The curr_chunk focuses on funding for Federal categorical programs supporting services for low-income populations. The curr_chunk introduces a new subpart called the Community Access Program under the Public Health Service Act, providing grants to enhance services for the uninsured and underinsured. The Secretary may grant funds to develop integrated health care systems serving uninsured and underinsured individuals, expanding services and improving efficiency. Eligible entities include public or nonprofit entities like Federally qualified health centers or qualifying hospitals. The curr_chunk discusses the criteria for entities eligible to receive grants for providing coordinated health care services to specific communities. This includes serving uninsured individuals and families, public health departments, and consortiums of providers representing a broad range of health care services. Entities eligible for grants must serve the community by providing care to uninsured and underinsured individuals without regard to their ability to pay. Preference is given to health care providers identified in the criteria. To receive a grant, eligible entities must define a community of uninsured and underinsured individuals. Entities eligible for grants must serve the community by providing care to uninsured and underinsured individuals in a specified geographical area or population. They must identify participating providers and their contributions to patient care, describe proposed activities, and demonstrate the ability to enhance the current system for serving uninsured and underinsured individuals. The consortium applying for grants must involve providers who traditionally offer care to the community, develop coordinated systems of care, involve the community in program development, and ensure participants are enrolled in eligible public insurance programs. The grant application must include a plan for leveraging other revenue sources, evaluating program activities, demonstrating fiscal responsibility, and committing to serving the community regardless of ability to pay. The grant application must prioritize applicants with a consortium including public hospitals, Federally qualified health centers, and providers serving uninsured individuals. The grant application prioritizes applicants who serve uninsured and underinsured individuals in the community, expand preventive and primary care services, improve coordination between healthcare and social service providers, collaborate with government entities, utilize non-Federal contributions, and demonstrate sustainability beyond the grant period. A grantee may use funds provided under this section for direct expenses associated with planning, developing, and operating a health care delivery system that provides a broad range of services, including primary, secondary, and tertiary services, substance abuse treatment, and mental health services, as well as for direct patient care and service expansions. The grant funds can be used for various purposes within an integrated delivery system, such as increasing outreach activities, improving case management, coordinating transportation to health care facilities, developing provider networks, recruiting and training personnel, acquiring technology, and identifying and closing gaps.
