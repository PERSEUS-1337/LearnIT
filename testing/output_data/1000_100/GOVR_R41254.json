    "content": "The Department of Defense was funded by continuing resolutions until FY2011, with restrictions on new programs. In April 2011, an omnibus funding bill for FY2011 provided $659.9 billion for DOD activities, a reduction of $18.2 billion from the President's request. H.R. 1473 provided $17.8 billion for the military construction budget, a reduction of $2.2 billion from the President's request. The bill incorporated $4.4 billion worth of reductions to specific programs, including cuts to DOD funds from prior fiscal years, Operations and Maintenance, Procurement, Research and Development, civilian pay, and federally funded research and development corporations. H.R. 1473 made significant cuts to major weapons programs in the President's DOD budget, including $1.7 billion from the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, $473 million from a new ground combat vehicle for the Army, and $325 million from a new mid-air refueling tanker for the Air Force. The bill also added funds for various programs such as Navy strike fighters, equipment for the National Guard, medical research, innovative research, and Israeli missile defense. The FY2011 National Defense Authorization Act allocated funds for various programs, including innovative research, Israeli missile defense systems, and the Military Career Advancement Account. The House version authorized $725.9 billion, while the Senate version authorized $725.7 billion, with cuts from the Administration's request. The Senate did not act on the bill due to opposition to a provision. The Senate rejected a provision in the bill that would have repealed the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy. A compromise version of the bill (H.R. 6523) was passed without this provision and signed into law on January 7, 2011. Both versions of the bill generally supported the Administration's budget request. The House and Senate supported the Administration's budget request in the FY2011 bill, H.R. 6523. Key issues included a 1.4% increase in military personnel pay and funding for an alternate engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The President's FY2011 budget request included $485 million for the alternate engine for the F-35. The budget for the \"national defense\" function totaled $738.7 billion, with $733.3 billion in discretionary spending and $5.3 billion in mandatory spending, including funds for military retirees. The FY2011 budget request for the Department of Defense included $548.9 billion for regular operations and $159.3 billion for ongoing military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, totaling $708.3 billion. An additional $33 billion was requested for FY2010 war costs to cover the deployment of 30,000 troops to Afghanistan, bringing the total amount appropriated for war costs to $162.6 billion. The Administration's FY2011 budget request for the Department of Defense included $548.9 billion for regular operations and $159.3 billion for ongoing military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, totaling $708.3 billion. An additional $33 billion was requested for FY2010 war costs, bringing the total amount appropriated for war costs to $162.6 billion. The budget request reflected a shift in emphasis from operations in Iraq to those in Afghanistan, with additional funding allocated for humanitarian relief operations in Haiti after the devastating earthquake. The FY2011 budget request includes a 3.4% increase in the DOD base budget, providing real growth in spending for security agencies. The Administration requested $719.2 billion for security agencies and $386.4 billion for non-security agencies, a 5.2% and 1.5% change from FY2010 appropriations, respectively. The Administration requested $386.4 billion for non-security agencies, a 1.5% decrease from FY2010 appropriations. The $548.9 billion requested for the FY2011 DOD base budget is $18.2 billion higher than the previous year. This increase would provide a 1.8% real purchasing power growth after adjusting for inflation. The requested FY2011 base budget continues the upward trend since FY1998, being the third largest since the end of the Korean War. The Administration projects annual increases in the DOD base budget falling short of the 2% real growth rate needed, as stated by Defense Secretary Robert Gates. Secretary Gates proposed reducing DOD's overhead costs by $10 billion annually to bridge the gap between sustaining the current force and future budgets. Real growth in the defense budget ranging from two to 3% above inflation is required to sustain the current force structure, but achieving these growth rates is highly unlikely. Secretary Gates proposed shifting funds within the budget to increase spending on combat forces while reducing costs for administrative and support activities. This strategy aims to cut overhead costs and transfer savings to force structure and modernization, equivalent to a 2-3% real growth rate. Secretary Gates proposed shifting funds within the budget to increase spending on combat forces while reducing costs for administrative and support activities. This strategy aims to cut overhead costs and transfer savings to force structure and modernization, equivalent to a 2-3% real growth rate. Gates announced initiatives to reduce the cost of DOD's headquarters and support bureaucracies, including a 10% reduction in funding for service support contractors, a decrease in the number of generals, admirals, and senior DOD civilians. Secretary Gates announced initiatives to reduce costs for administrative and support activities, including a 10% reduction in funding for service support contractors, a decrease in the number of generals, admirals, and senior DOD civilians, and the elimination of certain DOD entities. Additionally, he introduced contracting and acquisition initiatives to increase efficiency in DOD's spending on goods and services. Some Members of Congress are concerned about the Administration's projected budget increases for the Department of Defense, stating that the planned budgets may force DOD to scale back acquisition programs. Representative Howard P. \"Buck\" McKeon highlighted that a 1% real growth in the defense budget over the next five years would actually result in a net cut for investment and procurement accounts. Additionally, some Members object to exempting DOD from the budget freeze on discretionary spending. Representative Barney Frank calls for reductions in the DOD budget to terminate unnecessary weapons programs and overseas military deployments. President Obama's deficit reduction plan exempts the military budget, leading to potential cuts in federal programs. The FY2011 DOD base budget request remains at 3.6% of GDP, marking a leveling off from the post-9/11 upward trend. The FY2011 DOD budget request reflects the strategy outlined in the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) and continues initiatives from previous budgets. The QDRs show a shift in DOD strategic thinking away from Cold War-era tactics towards modern defense priorities. The 2010 QDR emphasizes the need for U.S. forces to be prepared for a variety of missions, with a focus on ongoing campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan. Recommendations include increased funding for helicopters, UAVs, intelligence capabilities, counter IED technologies, and AC-130 gunship aircraft. The 2010 QDR emphasizes the need for U.S. forces to be prepared for various missions, focusing on ongoing campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan. Recommendations include increased funding for helicopters, UAVs, intelligence capabilities, counter IED technologies, and AC-130 gunship aircraft. The report also suggests converting one heavy Army brigade combat team into a Stryker brigade, with the possibility of converting more in the future as resources allow. The report assumes that adversaries in the next 10-20 years are unlikely to directly confront U.S. conventional military capabilities, instead opting for asymmetric tactics and technologies. The 2010 QDR emphasizes the importance of U.S. forces using unconventional tactics and technologies to exploit limitations. It challenges the idea of a conflict spectrum and highlights the use of advanced technologies by low-end terrorist groups and near-peer competitors. The report stresses the need for military effectiveness in cyberspace and calls for strengthening cyber-network defense capabilities. The 2010 QDR emphasizes the need for a comprehensive approach to DOD operations in cyberspace, greater cyber expertise within DOD, centralized command of cyber operations, and collaboration with other agencies for enhanced cyber security. It also highlights the importance of U.S. forces being able to handle multiple missions globally, including stabilizing other countries, deterring aggressors, and conducting medium-sized operations. The 2010 QDR emphasizes preparing U.S. forces to deal with asymmetric threats like \"anti-access, area-denial\" capabilities developed by China and other potential adversaries. These capabilities could target U.S. forward bases and naval forces, crucial for projecting power in regions far from the U.S. homeland. The 2010 QDR highlights the importance of U.S. power projection capabilities in Europe, Asia, and other regions, despite their high cost. These capabilities are vulnerable to various attacks, including ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, submarines, smart mines, and small explosive-laden boats. The QDR suggests measures to counter these threats. The 2010 QDR emphasizes the need to counter anti-access strategies, recommending increased reliance on long-range strike weapons and submarines. Measures include developing offensive electronic attack capabilities and investing in missile defense to protect forward deployed forces. The FY2011 budget request includes funding for 1.43 million active duty personnel in the regular components. The FY2011 budget request includes funding for 1.43 million active duty personnel in the regular components, representing a 4.7% increase over the end-strength of 1.38 million in FY2000. This increase follows a reduction in active-duty manpower that began in FY1987 and accelerated during the 1990s. The end strength of the Army and Marine Corps rebounded to 562,400 and 202,100, respectively, meeting goals three years earlier than planned. Congress authorized an additional temporary increase in the Army's active duty strength in 2010, reflected in the FY2011 request for an Army end-strength of 569,400. The FY2011 budget request included nearly $1 billion for a 1.4% raise in military personnel's basic pay, matching private-sector pay increases. The Basic Allowance for Housing was also set to increase by 4.2% in FY2011. Congress has typically approved military pay raises higher than the Employment Cost Index increase to address past pay disparities. DOD officials argue that service members are currently better paid than 70% of private sector workers with similar experience and responsibility. The FY2011 DOD funding bills provided a vehicle for legislative initiatives by supporters and opponents of President Obama's decision to revise a 1993 law and DOD regulations that bar openly homosexual individuals from military service. Military advocacy groups argue for a higher pay increase to close the \"pay gap\" between military personnel and their civilian peers. Some Members of Congress argue that openly homosexual personnel in combat units could undermine cohesion and combat effectiveness. Critics oppose changing the policy due to stress from deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan. Two bills in the 111th Congress aimed to repeal the 1993 law on sexual orientation discrimination. President Obama called for nondiscrimination against same-sex orientation in his 2010 State of the Union Address. DOD launched a study on the potential impact of changing the law. DOD launched a study on the implementation of a potential change in the law regarding openly homosexual individuals in the military. Secretary Gates opposed repeal of the 1993 law until the study is completed. Changes were made to enforcement procedures, requiring high-ranking officers to initiate investigations and third-party information to be given under oath. Senators and a Representative proposed an amendment to repeal the legislation after the DOD review is finished. The DOD study on repealing the ban on openly homosexual individuals in the military has been completed. The President, Secretary of Defense, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff have certified to Congress that policies are in place for implementation. The Administration supports the draft amendment proposed by Senators and a Representative, despite Secretary Gates preferring to wait for the DOD review to finish. Secretary Gates prefers to wait for the Defense Department review to be completed before any legislation to repeal 'don't ask, don't tell.' However, he can accept the language in the proposed amendment. A federal judge ruled the 1993 law unconstitutional, leading to an injunction against enforcing it. The Ninth Circuit temporarily stayed the injunction while the appeals process is ongoing. Under Secretary of Defense Clifford Stanley limited the authority to discharge service members for homosexual behavior to five senior officials. The FY2011 budget request for the DOD health care system included $50.7 billion. The system serves 9.5 million eligible beneficiaries through various medical facilities. The cost of the medical program is projected to increase annually at a rate of 5-7% through FY2015. DOD officials attribute the steady increase in military health care costs to several factors. The Bush and Obama administrations proposed increasing TRICARE fees and copayments, but Congress passed legislation to prohibit the fee hikes. The DOD health care system budget for FY2011 was $50.7 billion, serving 9.5 million eligible beneficiaries. Military health care costs are projected to increase annually at a rate of 5-7% through FY2015. The FY2011 budget proposal aimed to increase funding for weapons and equipment procurement, with a shift in budget allocation towards procurement and away from research and development. This included a significant appropriation for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. The Congress considered balancing cost increases for military health care with the need to control expenses. The FY2011 budget proposal allocated $11.2 billion for weapons programs, with $2.3 billion for R&D and $9.0 billion for procurement. The budget did not include funds for additional C-17 jets or an alternate F-35 engine, which Congress had previously added funding for in 2009. Some Members of Congress questioned the Army's Brigade Combat Team Modernization program. The Army's Brigade Combat Team Modernization program, with a requested $3.2 billion in FY2011, has faced scrutiny for the design of the proposed Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV). This program replaced the Future Combat System (FCS) and its manned ground vehicle (MGV) component was cancelled in 2009 by Secretary of Defense Gates. The Army replaced the Future Combat System (FCS) with the Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV) program due to unanswered questions in the FCS vehicle design strategy. The GCV program aims to field a family of fighting vehicles by 2015-2017 based on mature technologies. The Army cancelled the existing competition for the GCV development contract in August 2010, raising concerns about rushing the development and potential risks. The Army restarted the GCV competition in November 2010, incorporating elements of the FCS program into the Army's Modernization program. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) noted that the effectiveness of the FCS components planned for deployment has not been demonstrated in field exercises. The Navy's FY2011 budget requested funding for nine new battle force ships. The Navy's FY2011 budget included funding for nine battle force ships, part of a 30-year shipbuilding plan that aims to grow the fleet to 315 ships by FY2020. The plan falls short of the 313-ship goal in the long run, with projections showing a peak of 320 ships in FY2024 before declining. The Navy's 30-year shipbuilding plan aims to reach 313 ships by FY2027, dropping to 288 ships by FY2032-FY2033, and then increasing to 301 ships by FY2039-FY2040. The plan faces challenges as the attack submarine and cruiser-destroyer forces are projected to fall below required levels. The Navy estimates an average annual cost of $15.9 billion in constant FY2010 dollars, while a Congressional Budget Office report suggests it would require $19.0 billion per year. If funding remains at current levels, the Navy may not be able to afford all planned purchases. The Navy's proposed FY2011 budget includes plans for 12 next-generation ballistic missile submarines, known as SSBN(X)s, to replace the current Ohio-class submarines. The program received funding in FY2010 and requested additional funding in FY2011. The Navy plans to procure the first SSBN(X) in FY2019, with estimated costs of $6-7 billion each. The Navy's SSBN(X) program, costing roughly half of the Navy's annual ship procurement budget, raises concerns about affordability and potential impact on other shipbuilding programs. Procuring 12 SSBN(X)s from FY2019-FY2033 could lead to reduced procurement rates for other Navy ships. Options to mitigate costs and impacts include procuring fewer SSBN(X)s or reducing the program's scope. The Navy's SSBN(X) program raises concerns about affordability and impact on other shipbuilding programs. Options include procuring fewer SSBN(X)s, reducing the program's scope, and adjusting the Navy's shipbuilding budget. The FY2010 budget proposed ending procurement of Zumwalt class destroyers and resuming procurement of Arleigh Burke class Aegis destroyers. The Navy's FY2011 budget called for procuring two DDG-51s in FY2011 and six more in FY2012-FY2015. The Navy's FY2011 budget proposed procuring two DDG-51s in FY2011 and six more in FY2012-FY2015. The budget also included plans to terminate the CG(X) cruiser program and instead build an improved version of the DDG-51, called the Flight III version, starting in FY2016. Flight III DDG-51s will carry a smaller version of the new Air and Missile Defense Radar (AMDR). The proposed budget requested $228.4 million for AMDR research and development. The Navy's Aegis cruisers and destroyers are equipped for ballistic missile defense (BMD) operations, with plans to increase the number of BMD-capable ships from 20 to 38 by FY2015. Concerns arise over the growing demand for BMD-capable Aegis ships, potentially straining the Navy's ability to fulfill non-BMD missions. The Aegis BMD program is mainly funded by the Missile Defense Agency (MDA), with additional support from the Navy's budget. The Navy's budget includes additional funding for BMD-related efforts, with the proposed FY2011 budget requesting $2,161.6 million for the Aegis BMD program. The Navy also requested $457.0 million for BMD-related efforts. FY2011 issues for Congress included decisions on the Flight III DDG-51 design, funding for the Aegis BMD program, and providing direction to MDA or the Navy. Additionally, the FY2011 budget requested $1.59 billion for two Littoral Combat Ships. The Navy planned to buy two different versions of LCS designed by Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics, but later decided to select a single design for all LCSs procured in FY2010 and beyond. The winning contractor would build 10 LCSs over five years, with a second competition to select a second shipyard to build up to five additional LCSs to the same design in FY2012-FY2014. The Navy initially planned to buy two different versions of LCS but later decided on a single design for all LCSs procured from FY2010 onwards. They would build 10 LCSs over five years, with a second competition for a second shipyard to build up to five additional LCSs in FY2012-FY2014. Navy officials sought approval to buy 10 ships from each competing industry team for FY2015 and beyond. There are concerns about a fighter aircraft shortfall due to budgetary limits on replacement fighters. The Air Force and Navy are facing fighter aircraft shortfalls, with projections of up to 800 aircraft for the Air Force by 2024 and over 100 aircraft for the Navy-Marine Corps by 2018. Congress is concerned about the affordability of modernizing tactical aircraft, especially with the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter being key to DOD's plans. There are worries that budget constraints may lead to a \"train wreck\" in tactical aircraft acquisition. The F-35 program plans to acquire 2,443 JSFs at a cost of $238 billion in constant dollars. It is the largest weapon procurement program for the DOD. Allies are also purchasing additional F-35s. The FY2011 budget requested $11.3 billion for the program. Concerns exist about the affordability of the F-35s in the planned quantities due to constrained DOD resources. The F-35 program faces challenges in acquiring the planned quantities due to budget constraints. The British government announced a reduction in the number of F-35s they plan to buy, citing budget cuts. The \"B\" model of the plane, intended for Britain's Royal Navy, faced challenges due to budget constraints. Congress rejected proposals to terminate the program for the General Electric/Rolls-Royce F136 engine as an alternative to the Pratt & Whitney F135 engine. Approximately $2.5 billion has been provided for the alternate engine program, with an estimated additional $2.9 billion needed for completion by 2017. Critics argue that terminating the F136 alternate engine was driven by immediate budget pressures rather than long-term considerations. They believe engine competition saved money and increased reliability. Supporters of termination claim single-source contracts are the norm for engine production and promote long-term affordability. Cancelling the F136 raises concerns about operational risks, fleet grounding, impact on the defense industrial base, and U.S. relations. The termination of the F136 alternate engine raises concerns about its impact on the U.S. defense industrial base, relations with allied countries, and the efficiency of the acquisition system. It also raises issues regarding the F-35 acquisition program, potential reduction in the number of F-35s acquired, outyear costs, and operational challenges of supporting two different engines in the field. The Administration's proposed FY2011 defense budget includes funding for the KC-X mid-air refueling tanker program. The Department of Defense released a Request for Proposals for a program to build 179 new KC-X aerial refueling tankers for the Air Force, valued at $35 billion. Boeing and Northrop Grumman/EADS competed with tanker designs based on the 767 and A330 airliners respectively. Bidding closed with three offerors submitting bids. The Department of Defense awarded the new tanker contract to Boeing for the KC-X program, valued at $35 billion. EADS decided not to challenge the decision. The history of previous attempts to acquire a new tanker is important context for the competition. The Obama Administration dropped the plan to deploy a modified BMD system in Poland and the Czech Republic in favor of the Phased Adaptive Approach (PAA) using BMD-capable Aegis ships to defend against potential ballistic missile attacks from Iran. $2.27 billion was requested in FY2011 for PAA programs. In FY2011, $2.27 billion was allocated for PAA programs, including $712 million for unique development efforts and $1.56 billion for the Aegis ship-borne BMD system. The FY2011 base budget for military construction and family housing decreased by nearly 20% compared to FY2010, mainly due to reduced spending on new facilities for units relocating from BRAC Commission decisions. Military family housing budget also decreased from $2.3 billion in FY2010 to $1.8 billion in the FY2011 request. The military family housing budget decreased from $2.3 billion in FY2010 to $1.8 billion in the FY2011 request due to privatization policies. The Basic Allowance for Housing has increased over the past decade, covering a larger proportion of service members' housing costs. The FY2011 DOD bills allowed Members of Congress to oppose the Navy's plan to move a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier to Mayport, FL. The 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review endorses the Navy's plan to establish Mayport as a second Atlantic Fleet carrier home port in Florida. This move would require new nuclear support facilities and shift economic activity from Norfolk to Mayport. Members of Congress from Florida support the proposal to homeport an aircraft carrier at Mayport to mitigate risks. The DOD and Navy argue that the benefits of moving a CVN to Mayport outweigh the costs, totaling $589.7 million. Some Members of Congress from Virginia are skeptical, suggesting that the funding could be better spent on other Navy priorities. The Administration's budget includes $139 million for facilities on Guam for Marines and their families. The Department of Defense plans to relocate 8,000 Marines and additional military personnel to Guam from Okinawa and the United States by 2014-2016. Guam's population of 178,000 is expected to increase by as much as 56,000 due to the influx of military personnel, families, DOD personnel, and contractors. Analysts estimate that 25,000 temporary workers will be needed for construction, raising concerns about Guam's transportation infrastructure. The Administration's budget supported the creation of the U.S. Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) to centralize command of DOD networks and coordinate their protection and operation. The reorganization of cyber forces integrated responsibility for offensive and defensive cyber operations under one organization. The consolidation of DOD cyber operations under U.S. Cyber Command in 2009 marked a departure from historical segregation, with responsibility for offensive and defensive cyber operations. The NSA director was nominated to lead the new command while retaining the NSA directorship. Some argue that this militarizes cyberspace and threatens civilian privacy, while others believe centralized command will improve organization and standardization of DOD cyber practices. The Administration's FY2011 budget request for Air Force Operations and Maintenance included $139 million to stand up U.S. Cyber Command, responsible for defending DOD networks. The budget increase would fund temporary facilities at Ft. Meade, MD. The FY2011 DOD budget request aimed to \"rebalance\" roles of DOD and State Department in providing foreign assistance. The FY2011 NDAA legislation excluded two programs previously funded by DOD, as the Administration requested these controversial items in the Department of State budget. The State Department's FY2011 budget request includes funding for various programs such as the Section 1207 program, the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund, and Iraq police training. The Department aims to rebalance roles between DOD and State Department in providing foreign assistance. The Administration is reviewing the division of security assistance authorities, with the Senate Armed Services Committee welcoming this review. Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates emphasized advising and mentoring foreign security forces as a key military mission. Secretary Gates emphasized the importance of advising and training partner nations' security forces, aligning with recommendations from the Quadrennial Defense Review. Adm. Mullen also highlighted the need for military power to be considered alongside diplomacy. Lawmakers were urged to enhance civilian capabilities in conflict prevention and resolution. The Administration's FY2011 DOD budget request emphasizes the importance of defense and diplomacy complementing each other in international relations. The budget includes funding for security assistance programs like the \"Section 1206\" program, Combating Terrorism Fellowship Program, Defense Institution Reform Initiative, and a program for legal assistance to foreign defense ministries. The FY2011 DOD budget request includes funding for security assistance programs like the \"Section 1206\" program, Combating Terrorism Fellowship Program, and Defense Institution Reform Initiative. It also includes funding for legal assistance to foreign defense ministries and a Stability Operations Fellowship Program. Secretary Gates emphasized the need for defense and diplomacy to complement each other in international relations. Congress has considered a pooled fund for security assistance, but is awaiting the Administration's proposal. The FY2011 National Defense Authorization Act passed by the House and Senate authorizes funding for DOD and defense-related activities, with slight reductions from the Administration's request. The Senate version was set aside due to opposition to repealing the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy. The FY2011 National Defense Authorization Act, H.R. 6523, was passed by the House and Senate with slight reductions from the Administration's request. The bill dropped the provision related to the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy and was signed into law on January 7, 2011. The bill authorized lump-sum totals for appropriations but did not include funding tables for specific programs. The FY2011 National Defense Authorization Act, H.R. 6523, authorized a total end-strength of 1.43 million members for the active-duty components of the armed services, with a 1.4% increase in military basic pay. The final bill did not include provisions for increasing monthly allowances for married personnel or those at risk of hostile assignments. The Senate Armed Services Committee directed the Government Accountability Office to assess DOD's use of cash incentives for recruiting and retaining highly qualified individuals in essential specialties. They also directed GAO to review the process for identifying specialties for incentives and assess the housing allowance determination process for service members. The FY2011 defense authorization act did not include a controversial provision for increasing monthly allowances for personnel at risk of hostile assignments. The House and Senate considered repealing the 1993 legislation banning openly homosexual individuals from military service. The House passed an amendment to repeal the ban after certain conditions were met, including certification from top military officials. The Senate Armed Services Committee voted on a provision to repeal the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy, but the motion to invoke cloture failed. The final bill did not include this provision. The enacted version of the bill did not include provisions from the Senate committee version that would have repealed a law prohibiting military facilities from performing abortions. It also did not include a House-passed provision for a pilot program allowing officers to pursue varied mid-career educational programs outside of their service. The final version of the bill included provisions from a congressionally chartered DOD commission on sexual assault in the military, establishing the position of director of DOD's Sexual Assault Response and Prevention office. It did not include provisions for repealing a law on military facility abortions or a pilot program for mid-career educational programs. H.R. 6523 requires improved protocols for medical care of military sexual assault victims, access to victim advocates, and evaluation of legal assistance feasibility. It does not guarantee confidentiality of victim communications or establish a hotline for reporting assaults. The bill authorizes most of the Administration's $50.7 billion budget request for DOD's health care. The House-passed H.R. 5136, the Senate Armed Services Committee's S. 3454, and the final enacted version of the authorization bill (H.R. 6523) all contain provisions prohibiting increases in TRICARE fees and pharmacy copayments. TRICARE beneficiaries can now extend coverage to dependent children up to age 26, similar to private health insurance programs under the Affordable Care Act. The enacted version of bill H.R. 6523 in April 2010 did not include a provision for a unified medical command under the Defense Health Agency. It did include a requirement for proper documentation of training programs for medical corps officers in response to the Fort Hood incident. The final version of the authorization bill did not include provisions from the House-passed H.R. 5136 related to incidents at Fort Hood and a recruiting station in Little Rock. It would have provided special compensation for those affected and required the Secretary of Defense to allocate funds for implementing recommendations from a panel analyzing the Fort Hood incident. The House and Senate bills supported the Administration's ballistic missile defense activities, authorizing slightly more than the $10.3 billion requested. Both bills included additional funding for missile defense, with H.R. 5136 adding $361.6 million and S. 3454 adding $349.1 million. H.R. 6523 specifically authorized $205 million for Israel's \"Iron Dome\" system. The bill H.R. 6523 does not specify funding allocation for specific missile defense programs, including the \"Iron Dome\" system for Israel. The bill affirms that the New START treaty with Russia would not restrict U.S. missile defense programs. The Administration requested $2.27 billion in FY2011 for missile defense programs. The Administration requested $2.27 billion in FY2011 for missile defense programs, including the Phased Adaptive Approach (PAA) for defending Europe against long-range ballistic missiles. The final version of the authorization bill requires a DOD report on the PAA and places restrictions on its deployment until technology is proven effective through realistic flight tests. The final version of the bill includes restrictions on BMD deployments until necessary agreements are ratified and a report on alternative BMD systems for Europe is received by Congress. The Secretary of Defense can waive these provisions for national security interests. Additionally, the bill authorizes a shared ballistic missile early warning system with the Czech Republic. The final version of the bill includes restrictions on BMD deployments until necessary agreements are ratified and a report on alternative BMD systems for Europe is received by Congress. The Secretary of Defense can waive these provisions for national security interests. Additionally, the bill authorizes a shared ballistic missile early warning system with the Czech Republic. The authorization bill does not include provisions in the House bill that would have barred the reduction of U.S. nuclear weapons below the limits set by the New START Treaty until 180 days after a joint report justifying the proposed cuts is submitted to Congress. The final version of the authorization bill approved the $15.7 billion requested for Navy shipbuilding, including funding for two DDG-51 Aegis destroyers, two Virginia-class attack submarines, two Littoral Combat Ships, a high-speed troop and cargo carrier, and an oceanographic research ship. The bill also expressed concerns about the Administration's Nuclear Posture Review weakening U.S. security by ruling out the use of nuclear weapons in response to a catastrophic attack using chemical or biological weapons. The request included funding for the U.S.S. Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier, an LHA-class helicopter carrier, and the U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt carrier. Incremental funding is common for expensive ships, with aircraft carriers allowed to be funded over four years. H.R. 6523 includes a provision for funding the helicopter carrier over two years. The House-passed bill included provisions on exceptions to the \"full funding\" rule for amphibious assault ships and a report on the Navy's shipbuilding requirements impacted by using cruisers and destroyers with the Aegis anti-missile system for regional missile defense. The final authorization bill did not include provisions to prevent fleet size decline, such as blocking the retirement of helicopter carriers without replacements and limiting ship retirements. The Senate committee's report on the Navy's shipbuilding schedule noted concerns about the fleet size and its impact on commercial shipyards. They directed assessments on how the Navy's plans would affect the Marine Corps's ability for amphibious landings. Navy and Marine Corps leaders aim for a fleet of 38 amphibious landing ships to support assault landings. The Senate committee expressed concerns about the Navy's shipbuilding plan, particularly regarding the cost and delays in reaching the goal of 33 amphibious ships. The FY2011 defense authorization bill did not address the Navy's plan to replace Ohio-class submarines with the expensive SSBN(X) submarines, which could impact future shipbuilding budgets. The final version of the bill for FY2011 approves a lump-sum authorization for Navy R&D without specific program allocations. It does not include a provision to limit Navy spending on SSBN(X) development. The bill also does not authorize funds for C-17 production, despite previous budget additions for it. The Administration has warned of a veto if additional C-17s are funded. The final bill for FY2011 included provisions to address cost overruns and delays in the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. It required DOD to create a detailed progress plan for Congress to assess. The bill authorized $11 billion for F-35 development and procurement of 42 planes, rejecting a request for an additional $205 million for another F-35. The Administration requested an additional plane to replace a lost fighter during combat operations. The House Armed Services Committee suggested using another fighter for the same purpose. The House bill allocated $485 million for an alternate jet engine for the F-35, while the Senate bill did not provide extra funds. The final bill did not take a specific stance on the additional funding. In May 2010, Secretary Gates stated his intention to recommend a veto on any defense bill funding the alternate F-35 engine, citing concerns about program disruptions and production delays. The House and Senate Armed Services Committees raised issues about potential reductions in carrier-borne fighters due to F-35 program delays. Both bills proposed additional funding to address the \"strike fighter gap.\" The House-passed and Senate committee-reported bills did not specify the number of F/A-18E/F model fighters to be authorized. The enacted bill includes a provision for the Navy to report on addressing the strike fighter gap. Both bills allocated funding for the development of the KC-X mid-air refueling tanker, with EADS and Boeing competing for the contract. The House adopted an amendment to H.R. 5136 requiring DOD to consider unfair competitive advantages in bids for the KC-X tanker. The provision was based on findings of government subsidies for EADS by the World Trade Organization. DOD later selected Boeing's tanker design, the KC-46A. Boeing's tanker design, the KC-46A, was selected over EADS' design. The House and Senate Armed Services Committee would deny authorization for part of the Army's Brigade Combat Team Modernization program. The authorization bill would also deny funding for the Non-Line of Sight missile program. The House and Senate committees made significant cuts to the Army's Brigade Combat Team Modernization program, with the House cutting an additional $347.4 million and the Senate cutting $29.7 million. The enacted authorization did not specify funding for the program, which aimed to develop a new family of Ground Combat Vehicles. The House committee recommended a less technologically ambitious approach, focusing on vehicles that meet basic requirements and can be upgraded later. The House and Senate committees made cuts to the Army's Brigade Combat Team Modernization program, reducing funding for the development of new Ground Combat Vehicles. The House recommended upgrading the current fleet to meet basic requirements before developing new vehicles. DOD reduced its FY2011 GCV funding request to $461 million, which was fully funded in the enacted authorization bill. The bill did not include a provision to prevent funds from being used to plan and design structures at the Naval Station in Mayport, FL for a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier. The House Armed Services Committee directed the GAO to assess the costs of homeporting a carrier in Mayport and explore other options for using the naval facilities. H.R. 6523 authorized funds for military construction on Guam, including the redeployment of Marine Corps units from Okinawa. The bill approved funds for improving access roads and wharves in Guam but denied funding for construction of a Marine base and aviation facilities on the island. The final version of the bill did not authorize $70.0 million for Guam's military hospital but approved $50.3 million for Air Force projects and $19.0 million for a National Guard Readiness Center. It did not include a provision to transfer funds for Guam's municipal services. The bill also requires a report on military facilities needed for force redeployment. The final version of the bill includes provisions for military facilities needed for force redeployment and a report on civil infrastructure improvements. It also prohibits the transfer of Guantanamo Bay detainees to U.S. territory or foreign governments without certain conditions being met. The final version of the bill waives restrictions on detainee transfers if ordered by a competent court or military tribunal. It also prohibits funds from being used to build or modify facilities for Guantanamo detainees elsewhere. Additionally, it requires the Secretary of Defense to report to Congress on the costs and risks of transferring detainees to alternative sites. The House-passed version of the bill would increase funding for the \"Global Train and Equip\" program and extend its funding ceiling. The House bill increased Section 1206 funding to $500 million, extended program authorization through FY2012, and allocated $75 million for Yemeni counterterrorism forces. The House Armed Services Committee recognized Yemen as a strategic partner in combating Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. The Senate committee-reported bill aimed to expand the Section 1206 program to support Yemen's Ministry of the Interior counterterrorism unit with $75 million for operations against Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. The bill did not increase the $350 million cap on Section 1206 funding. The final version of the authorization bill does not increase the $350 million ceiling on Section 1206 funding, as requested by the Administration. It authorizes an additional $75 million for Yemeni Interior Ministry units, approved by the Senate committee. The bill also allows the Secretary of Defense to use up to $150 million of Army funds to assist the Task Force for Business and Stability Operations in Afghanistan. The final version of H.R. 6523 aims to promote stability and economic normalcy in Afghanistan through strategic business and economic activities, including private investment, industrial development, banking, agricultural diversification, and energy development. It includes provisions related to cybersecurity, such as directing the Secretary of Defense to report to Congress on cyber warfare policy and implementing continuous monitoring of DOD computer networks for security and FISMA compliance. The final version of the authorization bill did not include a provision for a National Office for Cyberspace with government-wide responsibility for coordinating information security programs. The House adopted a one-year cap on discretionary spending, leading to the House Appropriations Committee setting allocations for each subcommittee. The Defense Subcommittee received $523.9 billion, $7 billion less than requested. The Senate approved a budget resolution for FY2011, but it was never considered or adopted. The Senate did not adopt an overall ceiling on FY2011 discretionary spending like the House. The Senate Appropriations Committee set \"discretionary guidance\" for its subcommittees, with the Defense Subcommittee allocated $522.8 billion, $8.1 billion less than the President's request. The House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee approved a bill for consideration by the full committee, providing a total of $671.0 billion for FY2011 DOD appropriations, with $513.3 billion for the base budget and $157.7 billion for war costs. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved a FY2011 DOD Appropriations bill with a total of $669.9 billion, including $512.2 billion for the base budget and $157.7 billion for war costs. This represented a reduction of $8.1 billion to the President's base budget request and $254 million to the request for war costs. The subcommittee did not release the text of the bill or a detailed report, only providing a summary table and a statement by then subcommittee Chairman Representative Norm Dicks. The House passed a bill (H.R. 1) to fund federal agencies for the rest of FY2011, including a detailed defense appropriations bill with $505.2 billion in discretionary budget authority. The Senate debated H.R. 1 but laid it aside on March 9, 2011, after failing to close debate. An alternative funding measure was also rejected during the debate. The Senate rejected an alternative funding measure proposed by Senator Inouye with a vote of 42-58, which would have provided $503.1 billion for base budget programs. The President signed an omnibus funding bill (H.R. 1473) for the rest of FY2011, incorporating a detailed DOD appropriations bill similar to Inouye's amendment. The enacted H.R. 1473 allocated $502.4 billion for the base budget and $677.7 billion for all DOD funding, including military construction and war costs, representing a $20.1 billion reduction from the President's initial request. The FY2011 DOD appropriations bill (H.R. 1473) included $4.4 billion in reductions to the President's request, cutting funds from various DOD programs and projects. This was part of a larger omnibus funding bill that allocated $502.4 billion for the base budget and $677.7 billion for all DOD funding. The FY2011 DOD appropriations bill (H.R. 1473) included cuts to the President's DOD budget, partially offset by additions to the request. There were 226 instances of added funds, which is fewer than previous years. The bill included earmarks for various defense programs, such as funding for Navy strike fighters, National Guard equipment, medical research programs, and Israeli missile defense systems. Additionally, $523.0 million was allocated for innovative research and procurement projects. The House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee included $523.0 million for innovative research and procurement projects in the FY2011 DOD appropriations bill (H.R. 1473). The bill also added $162 million for Military Career Advancement Accounts (MyCAA), a tuition assistance program for military spouses. The Senate committee bill would add $447.0 million to the Defense Health Program, with increases for research programs targeting breast cancer, psychological health, and prostate cancer. It also cut $425.0 million for THAAD missile deployment and added $205 million for the Israeli Iron Dome system. Planned THAAD production has been delayed pending additional tests. The bill provided additional funding for the Israeli Iron Dome system and made minor reductions in Navy shipbuilding funds. It also reduced the budget for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighters program by $1.38 billion. The bill funded the purchase of 35 out of 43 requested Strike Fighters and cut funding for the development of a mid-air refueling tanker. It also denied funding for the Non-Line of Sight Missile program and made reductions in the F-35 Joint Strike Fighters program. The bill cut $473.3 million from the Ground Combat Vehicle program, which aims to replace the Army's Bradley armored troop carrier. The Army canceled the competition to design the new vehicle on August 25, 2010, but restarted it on November 30, 2010."
