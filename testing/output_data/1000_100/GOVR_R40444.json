    "content": "Eligibility for health benefits under CHIP is available to different groups through various federal authorities and mechanisms, including children, pregnant women, parents, and childless adults. Title XXI defines a targeted low-income child as someone under 19 without health insurance and not eligible for Medicaid under pre-CHIP rules. States can set income levels for targeted low-income children up to 200% of the federal poverty level. States have the authority to expand eligibility for all children under 19. CHIPRA reduces federal payments for higher-income CHIP children by using the regular Medicaid FMAP rate for those with family income over 300% of poverty. States can cover these children under Medicaid or create a separate CHIP program. Title XXI rules apply when states provide Medicaid coverage to low-income children, with federal CHIP funds covering program costs. States with approved CHIP plans receive federal allotments based on a set formula. Medicaid expansion under CHIP entitles children to benefits, while separate CHIP programs do not offer individual entitlements. States have the flexibility to cover low-income children through Medicaid expansion or separate CHIP programs. States have the option to cover low-income children through Medicaid expansion or separate CHIP programs. Medicaid expansion can be done by creating a new eligibility group or liberalizing financial rules for existing Medicaid categories. Some states choose to cover low-income children under existing Medicaid pathways to reduce administrative burden. Alternatively, states can establish separate CHIP programs to provide coverage for targeted low-income children. Title XXI allows states to determine eligibility for CHIP based on factors such as geography, age, income, resources, residency, disability status, access to other health insurance, and duration of CHIP eligibility. Prior to CHIPRA, states could cover adult pregnant women through waivers, CHIP state plan amendments, or a family coverage option. In October 2007, 17 states offered pregnancy-related services to adults using CHIP funds. 6 states used the \u00a71115 waiver authority, and 12 states extended coverage to unborn children of adult pregnant women through unborn child SPAs. Nearly half of the 364,161 unborn children enrolled in CHIP in FY2008 were in California. CHIPRA added a new state option to cover pregnant women under CHIP through a state plan amendment. CHIPRA added a new state option to cover pregnant women under CHIP through a state plan amendment, with certain conditions to be met by states. Pregnant women must meet eligibility restrictions similar to CHIP children, with coverage extending through the postpartum period. Presumptive eligibility allows temporary enrollment for up to two months. The CHIPRA law allows pregnant women to be covered under CHIP through a state plan amendment, with eligibility determined through presumptive eligibility. Benefits include all services available to CHIP children, prenatal, delivery, and postpartum care. Infants born to these women are eligible for Medicaid or CHIP up to age one, with eligibility redetermined at that point. States can also offer postpartum services and cover legal immigrants after a five-year bar if they meet eligibility requirements. The law requires sponsors' income and resources to be considered for immigrants, ensuring they don't become a public charge. CHIPRA allows states to waive the five-year bar for pregnant women and children eligible for Medicaid or CHIP. The CHIP state plan option is available for states that elect it under Medicaid, providing assistance for pregnant women. The provision under CHIPRA allows states to extend coverage for pregnant women without deeming the cost of care against the sponsor. Individuals eligible under this provision must provide further documentation if their initial legal residence documentation expires. Section 1115 of the Social Security Act gives HHS the authority to modify aspects of CHIP programs, including expanding eligibility to populations not typically eligible. Certain states have covered adults with CHIP funds through waivers, initially effective for five years and subject to renewal every three years. Waiver renewals for adult coverage have not been approved since 2007 in some states, leading to the transition of adult populations out of CHIP coverage. As of January 7, 2009, 4 states have CMS authority to extend coverage to childless adult populations and 7 states have authority to cover parent populations. CHIPRA terminates CHIP coverage of nonpregnant childless adults by the end of 2009. States with existing waivers for childless adults can apply for Medicaid waivers to continue coverage, tied to budget neutrality standards. Coverage of parents is permitted for states with CHIP parent coverage waivers, with spending subject to set-aside amounts from a separate allotment starting in 2012. In FY2013, states meeting coverage benchmarks will receive an amount between regular and enhanced FMAPs for parents. CHIPRA prohibits waiver spending for parents with family income exceeding eligibility thresholds. CHIPRA also authorizes $100 million in outreach and enrollment grants for Medicaid and CHIP, with allocations for a national campaign and outreach for Native American children. CHIPRA allocates 20% of $100 million outreach and enrollment grants for Native American children, while the remaining 80% goes to state and local governments and community-based organizations for outreach campaigns in rural areas and underserved populations. Grant funds target proposals addressing cultural and linguistic barriers to enrollment. CHIPRA also requires states to describe procedures to reduce administrative barriers to Medicaid and CHIP enrollment, with an option to rely on \"Express Lane\" agencies for facilitation. The provision in CHIPRA allows states to use Express Lane eligibility determination for Medicaid and CHIP enrollment, with the option to rely on reported income from state tax records. States must inform families of potential eligibility for lower premiums or more comprehensive coverage under Medicaid. CHIPRA simplifies Medicaid and CHIP application processes by removing the need for signatures under penalty of perjury and providing an alternative for citizenship documentation using Social Security Numbers verified by the SSA. It also adds a requirement for citizenship documentation in CHIP. (SSNs do not denote citizenship for all individuals). Table 1 displays each state's CHIP program type, upper-income eligibility, and enrollment data by population group. New Jersey has the highest upper income eligibility limit for children in CHIP at 350% of the FPL. CHIP coverage above 250% FPL is available in 11 states, the District of Columbia, four counties, and for certain children up to age two in California. Enrollment in CHIP reached nearly 7.4 million children in FY2008, with about 5.3 million covered in separate state programs and 2.1 million targeted low-income children under Medicaid. Waiver authority under CHIP has been used to expand coverage for adults. In FY2008, waiver authority under CHIP was used to expand coverage for adult populations, with about 335,000 adults enrolled in CHIP. Most of these adults were parents, while some were childless adults or pregnant women. The number of CHIP-enrolled adults decreased from previous years due to waivers not being renewed or scaled back. Michigan, New Mexico, and Minnesota reported more adult CHIP enrollees than children in FY2008. States have the flexibility to cover targeted low-income children under their Medicaid program when designing their CHIP programs. States have the option to cover low-income children under Medicaid, create a separate CHIP program, or use a combination of both. Medicaid-expansion CHIP programs must offer mandatory Medicaid benefits and optional services. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 allows states to enroll children in new benchmark benefit plans. These plans are similar to separate CHIP programs. The EPSDT Program provides benefits to low-income children, including well-child care, immunizations, and other screening services. States can choose from three benefit options for separate CHIP programs: benchmark benefit package, benchmark equivalent coverage, or any other approved health benefits plan. The three plans for health coverage options include the standard Blue Cross/Blue Shield preferred provider option plan, state employee health coverage, and the largest HMO in the state. Benchmark-equivalent coverage must include basic benefits like hospital services, physician services, lab services, and well-child care with immunizations. Benchmark-equivalent coverage for age-appropriate immunizations must include at least 75% of the actuarial value of coverage under the benchmark plan for additional services like prescription drugs, vision, and hearing services. Abortions are only covered in cases of rape, incest, or to save the mother's life. All 50 states, the District of Columbia, and five territories have CHIP programs, with various approaches in place. CHIPRA made changes to mental health and substance abuse coverage under CHIP, ensuring that financial requirements and treatment limitations for these benefits are no more restrictive than those for medical and surgical benefits in state CHIP plans. No separate cost-sharing or treatment limitations can apply only to mental health or substance abuse benefits. CHIPRA also made modifications to dental care under CHIP, making dental services a required benefit under separate CHIP programs. These services include preventive care, restoration of oral health, treatment of emergency conditions, and can be provided through benchmark dental benefit packages. Additionally, the law includes provisions for dental education for parents of newborns and dental services through federally qualified health centers. States must report on their dental services provided. The CHIPRA law made dental services a required benefit under separate CHIP programs, including preventive care, restoration of oral health, and treatment of emergency conditions. It also includes provisions for dental education for parents of newborns and dental services through federally qualified health centers. States must report detailed information on children's dental care in their annual reports and for EPSDT reporting purposes. The GAO is conducting a study on children's access to dental care under Medicaid and CHIP, with recommendations for addressing barriers to care and using mid-level providers to improve access. CHIPRA allowed states to offer dental-only supplemental coverage to children in group or employer plans who meet CHIP eligibility criteria. States can provide dental coverage based on new benchmark benefits plans or CHIP cost-sharing protections, with an income limit set up to their CHIP programs. However, states must meet certain conditions, including implementing the highest income eligibility, not limiting applications or imposing enrollment restrictions, and providing benefits to all children. States may offer dental-only supplemental coverage to children meeting CHIP eligibility criteria without imposing waiting periods. They must adhere to specific conditions, such as providing benefits to all children and not favoring dental coverage for certain groups. Additionally, states can use CHIP funds for employer-based plan premiums if they do not substitute coverage for low-income children. Under Medicaid, states can implement a premium assistance program for children enrolled in employer plans if the plan meets certain criteria. This includes ensuring that the employer plan is comprehensive and cost-effective for the state. States must also provide coverage for Medicaid services not included in the private plans to meet the comprehensiveness test. States can offer premium assistance for Medicaid and CHIP-eligible children and/or parents with access to employer-sponsored insurance if the employer plan meets specific criteria. This includes providing coverage for services not included in the private plans to ensure comprehensive benefit coverage. Many states use waivers to operate CHIP or Medicaid premium assistance programs to overcome restrictions. CHIPRA introduced a new state plan option for premium assistance and required states to provide outreach, education, and enrollment assistance for eligible families. Under CHIPRA, states can offer premium assistance for Medicaid and CHIP-eligible individuals with access to employer-sponsored insurance that qualifies as \"creditable coverage.\" Individuals can choose to enroll in regular CHIP instead of the premium assistance program. The subsidy covers the difference in out-of-pocket premiums for the child's coverage. A wrap-around is required for employer plans that do not meet CHIP benefit requirements. No cost-effectiveness test is needed for private coverage using premium assistance compared to regular CHIP coverage. CHIPRA allows states to provide premium assistance for Medicaid and CHIP-eligible individuals with access to employer-sponsored insurance. A separate test is established for family coverage, where the subsidy can cover the entire family's premium if it is less than regular CHIP coverage for the eligible individual(s). States offering premium assistance must conduct outreach, and can establish employer-family premium assistance purchasing pools. The new premium assistance provisions under Medicaid apply to children in a Medicaid-expansion CHIP program, and coordination between Federal laws is streamlined. CHIPRA amends Federal laws to streamline coordination between public and private coverage, including making the loss of Medicaid/CHIP eligibility a \"qualifying event\" for purchasing employer-sponsored coverage. Health plan administrators must disclose benefit package information to states upon request for evaluating wraparound coverage. Cost-sharing in health insurance includes out-of-pocket payments like premiums, deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance. States can impose cost-sharing for some CHIP beneficiaries and services, following Medicaid's nominal cost-sharing rules for low-income children. The DRA provided states with new options for premiums and cost-sharing for low-income children under CHIP Medicaid-expansion programs. Premiums and cost-sharing vary based on family income levels, with higher income families facing higher cost-sharing percentages. The DRA allows states to impose cost-sharing up to 20% of the cost of services, with a total aggregate limit of 5% of family income. Preventive services for children are exempt from cost-sharing. Special rules apply to prescription drugs and emergency room copayments. States can condition Medicaid eligibility on premium payments. Providers may deny care for failure to pay cost-sharing. Premiums for CHIP programs depend on family income, with a maximum limit for low-income families. For families with incomes under 150% FPL enrolled in state programs, premiums are limited by federal Medicaid regulations. Cost-sharing is capped at nominal amounts for lower-income families and slightly higher amounts for those with income between 100%-150% FPL. Families above 150% FPL may face cost-sharing up to 5% of family income, with equal cost-sharing for all children. States must inform families of these limits and provide a way to stop payments once reached. Preventive services are exempt from cost-sharing for all CHIP families. Preventive services, including newborn visits, physical exams, immunizations, and dental care, are free for all CHIP families. CHIPRA 2009 aimed to enhance data collection and reporting for CHIP and Medicaid, developing child health quality measures and standardized reporting formats. The Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (CHIPRA) of 2009 aimed to improve data collection and reporting for CHIP and Medicaid by implementing quality measures, standardized reporting formats, and encouraging states to voluntarily report on pediatric care quality. It also added reporting requirements to states' annual CHIP reports, established the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission (MACPAC) to review policies affecting children's access to benefits, and mandated regular reports to Congress with recommendations for improving access and quality of care for children. The Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (CHIPRA) of 2009 mandated a federal evaluation of 10 states with approved CHIP plans to assess outreach strategies, cost-sharing effects, disenrollment factors, and retention of children. Federal financing of CHIP includes total appropriations, reallocation of unspent funds, and other components. The Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) funding allocation varied annually from FY1998 to FY2007, starting at $4.2 billion and dropping to under $3.2 billion in FY2002-FY2004 before increasing again. The \"CHIP dip\" in funding during FY2002-FY2004 was due to budget constraints. The 110th Congress passed two bills to reauthorize CHIP. The 110th Congress passed two bills to reauthorize CHIP funding for FY2008 through FY2012, but both were vetoed by President George W. Bush. In response, the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007 appropriated funds for CHIP allotments for FY2008 and FY2009. CHIPRA provided a national appropriation totaling $68.9 billion from FY2009 to FY2013 for CHIP allotments. The annual federal CHIP appropriation increased from $10.562 billion in FY2009 to $17.406 billion in FY2013. The allotment among states is determined by a formula set in law, based on the number of low-income uninsured children. The territories received 0.25% of the national appropriation prior to CHIPRA. The state's CHIP allotment is calculated based on state survey estimates and is available for two years starting from FY2009. Payments are taken from the earliest active account until fully expended, then the state can draw from the next available allotment. The FY2009 federal CHIP allotments for states are determined by a formula using the state's FY2008 federal CHIP spending multiplied by a growth factor. The state's FY2009 federal CHIP allotment is calculated based on three factors: the state's FY2008 federal CHIP spending, FY2008 federal CHIP allotment, and state's projections for FY2009. The largest amount is increased by 10% and will serve as the state's FY2009 allotment. For FY2010, the allotment is calculated based on four amounts, including FY2009 CHIP allotment and spending from previous years. In FY2009, funds were provided to states based on prior year spending. Allotments for FY2011 and FY2013 will be \"rebased\" using growth factors. Unspent funds are redistributed to other states after the period of availability. BBA 97 stipulated rules for redistribution of unspent funds. In FY2006, Congress appropriated additional funds to cover projected federal CHIP shortfalls in 12 states. Illinois and Massachusetts experienced shortfalls totaling approximately $100 million, with most from Illinois. In FY2007, unspent FY2004 allotments were redistributed to states based on funding shortfalls for that year. States faced monthly funding shortfalls in fiscal year 2007, with projections indicating delays until the end of March. The CHIP provisions of NIHRA allowed for redistribution of unspent FY2005 funds to delay shortfalls further. This required states to have double their projected spending in federal CHIP funds for FY2007 to access additional funds, providing an extra $138 million for shortfall states. In May 2007, P.L. 110-28 allocated $650 million to cover federal CHIP fund shortfalls in 10 states for the remainder of FY2007. For FY2008, MMSEA redistributed unspent FY2005 allotments to shortfall states and appropriated up to $1.6 billion for remaining shortfalls. Actual funding provided in FY2008 was just under $1 billion. In FY2008, actual shortfall funding totaled just under $1 billion. MMSEA redistributed unspent FY2006 allotments to states facing shortfalls in FY2009 and appropriated up to $275 million for remaining shortfalls. CHIPRA increased FY2009 allotments to prevent federal CHIP funding shortfalls. A Child Enrollment Contingency Fund was created to prevent states from experiencing federal CHIP fund shortfalls. The Contingency Fund prevents states from federal CHIP fund shortfalls by providing direct payments for CHIP children above target enrollment levels. Payments cannot exceed 20% of the national allotment amount and are reduced proportionally if necessary. CHIP is a federal-state matching program with an enhanced FMAP, lowering a state's share of expenditures by 30%. The enhanced FMAP for CHIP ranges from 65% to 83.09%, with a ceiling of 85% and a floor of 65%. Federal spending for CHIP administrative expenses is capped, including a 10% limit on state non-benefit expenses. Under CHIP, states can use federal funds for benefits and non-benefit costs, with a 10% limit on non-benefit expenses. CHIPRA provides bonus payments to states that increase Medicaid child enrollment and implement specific outreach activities, funded by an initial appropriation and unspent allotment amounts."
