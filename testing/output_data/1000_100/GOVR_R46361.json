    "content": "The report provides an overview of the FY2020 Defense Appropriations Act (P.L. 116-93) and summarizes the budgetary context of the legislation. The Trump Administration requested $750.0 billion for national defense activities, with $718.3 billion allocated to the Department of Defense. The FY2020 Defense Appropriations Act, enacted as Division A of H.R. 1158, provides a total of $687.8 billion for DOD, with $689.5 billion falling within the scope of the annual defense appropriations bill. Additionally, $1.1 billion is allocated for certain expenses of the intelligence community. The bill does not include funding for military construction and family housing, which is provided by a separate appropriations bill. The FY2020 Defense Appropriations Act provides $687.8 billion for DOD, $2.86 billion less than requested by President Trump. DOD's budget includes funds for base activities and Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) since 2009. The OCO designation has gained significance since the Budget Control Act of 2011. The FY2020 Defense Appropriations Act allocated $687.8 billion for DOD, $2.86 billion less than requested by President Trump. OCO funding, designated for emergency requirements, is exempt from spending caps and was used to avoid exceeding the defense budget cap. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 raised the defense spending cap for FY2020 to $666.5 billion. The FY2020 defense appropriations bill allocated $666.5 billion, with separate versions passed by the House and Senate committees. A compromise version was incorporated into H.R. 1158 and passed by both chambers. House Appropriations Committee Chairman Nita Lowey provided an Explanatory Statement in the absence of a formal conference report. The enacted version of H.R. 1158 reflects a shift in strategic emphasis towards countering threats from China and Russia, in line with the 2018 National Defense Strategy. This marks a change from past U.S. national security policies focused on containing communism and regional aggressors. The U.S. military was trained and equipped to deal with regional aggressors like Iraq, Iran, and North Korea, while also recalibrating relations with China and Russia. Following the 9/11 attacks, the focus shifted to countering terrorism and insurgencies in the Middle East, as well as addressing North Korean and Iranian nuclear programs. The 2014 Russian invasion of Crimea and China's militarization of the South China Sea raised concerns about aggressive regimes in Moscow and Beijing. China's militarization of islands in the South China Sea highlights the importance of competing with other great powers in the U.S. national security agenda. Adversaries are collaborating to achieve shared objectives, using social and economic tools to advance their agendas. Non-state proxies are also being utilized to blur the lines between conventional warfare. The Trump Administration's National Security Strategy and National Defense Strategy focus on great power competition with China and Russia, emphasizing the need to bolster U.S. military capabilities that have eroded in recent decades. The security environment is complex, with adversaries blurring the lines between conventional and irregular conflict. The National Defense Strategy (NDS) acknowledges the erosion of U.S. military capabilities in recent decades compared to Chinese and Russian threats. It prioritizes countering China and Russia over violent extremist organizations, following a \"2+3\" strategy to address the five main threats to U.S. interests. The \"2+3\" strategy aims to counter two primary challenges (China and Russia) and three additional challenges (North Korea, Iran, and terrorist groups). Federal spending has increased significantly since the end of U.S. military involvement in Vietnam, with mandatory spending for entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid growing the fastest. The Budget Control Act of 2011 established annual limits to reduce discretionary federal spending. The Budget Control Act of 2011 established annual limits to reduce discretionary federal spending through FY2021 by $1.0 trillion. Sequestration automatically cancels previous appropriations to meet the spending caps, with exceptions for emergency or OCO funding. Despite repeated legislation to raise the caps, the national defense spending cap for FY2020 remained at $576 billion, $71 billion lower than the revised cap for FY2019. The Administration's FY2020 base budget request adhered to the defense cap to prevent a significant spending cut. However, it also included $165 billion in OCO funding, with $98 billion intended for base budget purposes. The House and Senate Committees treated all funding for base budget purposes as part of the base budget request. P.L. 116-93 approved a modest increase in active-duty military personnel but reduced the Army's end-strength by 7,500 due to not meeting previous goals. The FY2020 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 116-93) funds a 3.1% increase in military basic pay and appropriates $61.7 million for DOD's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (SAPRO). Additionally, $35.0 million is allocated for the Special Victims' Counsel (SVC) program, providing legal counsel to alleged victims of sexual assault. $3.0 million is also provided for a pilot program for treating military personnel with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder related to sexual trauma. The FY2020 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 116-93) includes funding for DOD's childcare program, adding $110 million to the $1.1 billion requested. This program is the largest employer-sponsored childcare program in the United States, serving 23,000 employees and nearly 200,000 children. The act also requires a detailed report on DOD's childcare system and supports the Administration's FY2020 budget request for modernization of nuclear and long-range strike weapons. The Trump Administration's FY2020 budget prioritizes modernizing nuclear and long-range strike weapons, including ballistic missile-launching submarines, long-range bombers, and land-based ICBMs. The development of hypersonic weapons, capable of traveling at speeds five times the speed of sound and maneuvering throughout their flight trajectory, is a key focus for the Department of Defense. Funding for hypersonic weapons development has been ongoing since the early 2000s. The Department of Defense has prioritized hypersonic weapons development in its budget requests since FY2019 due to concerns about China and Russia's advancements in this technology. Congress has supported funding for the U.S. hypersonic program, including defenses against hypersonic missiles. The enacted FY2020 defense appropriations bill allocated additional funds for a Joint Hypersonics Transition Office to coordinate R&D programs across DOD. The FY2020 defense bill supported the Administration's proposals to strengthen missile defenses against various threats. The budget request aligned with the Missile Defense Review and allocated funds for defending against ICBMs. House and Senate negotiators expressed concerns about duplication of effort and cost increases in hypersonic weapons development. The FY2020 defense bill provides funding for missile defense against ICBMs, including $515.0 million for an improved interceptor missile to replace the Ground-Based Interceptors (GBIs). Additionally, $285 million is allocated for additional GBI missiles and support equipment, and $180 million for R&D to improve GBI reliability. Congress also approved funding for military space satellites and satellite launches, as well as $40.0 million for the operation of the newly created Space Force. The FY2020 defense bill allocated $40.0 million for the operation of the newly created Space Force, which was 44% less than the requested amount. The bill also supported upgrades to the Army's ground-combat vehicles, including providing 30% more funding than requested to increase the firepower of the Stryker wheeled troop-carrier. The enacted bill provides less funding than requested for upgrades to Army ground-combat vehicles, including Bradley fighting vehicles and CH-47 Chinook helicopters. This decision impacts the Army's strategy for developing new combat capabilities by reallocating funds from existing systems to new programs. The enacted appropriations bill provides less funding than requested for Bradley upgrades, with $223.0 million cut as \"excess to need.\" However, it nearly triples the amount requested for Chinook upgrades, allocating $46.2 million instead of $18.2 million. The bill challenges the Army's plan to forego CH-47 fleet upgrades and reins in efforts to develop a replacement for the Bradley vehicle. The enacted appropriations bill provides funding for the Optionally-Manned Fighting Vehicle program, which was later cancelled and restarted with new design parameters. The bill generally supports the budget request for major aviation programs but challenges the Army's plan to forego CH-47 fleet upgrades. The Army plans to curtail programs to free up funds for modernization, including truncating the procurement of improved \"Block II\" CH-47s. The FY2020 defense bill provided $46.2 million for the program, while $985.5 million was allocated for eight F-15s to address Air Force fighter strength gaps. The FY2020 defense bill shifted funds for two F-15 aircraft to the Air Force's Research and Development account for testing purposes. It also supports the Navy's plan to increase the fleet size to 355 ships, including construction of unmanned surface and subsurface ships. The FY2020 defense bill allocated funds for weapons and sensors, including $3.2 billion for Virginia-class submarines. $1.4 billion was added to the budget for two subs to incorporate the Virginia Payload Module. Additionally, $1.2 billion was provided for specialized ships and a landing craft to support Marine Corps amphibious landings.
