    "content": "The Act titled \"High Performance Schools Act of 1999\" is established for the purpose of improving school performance. The Congress finds that American K-12 schools spend over $6 billion annually on energy costs, more than on books and computers combined. Educators and students perform best in a comfortable, healthy, and well-lit environment. Over half of the nation's K-12 schools are over 40 years old and need renovation for efficiency. 6,000 new schools will be needed in the next 10 years to accommodate the growing student population. Inefficient water use in older schools can impact student performance. Adopting a whole building approach in school design leads to high performance buildings and lower life-cycle costs. Systematic energy conservation in school construction can save costs and improve indoor air quality by using renewable energy sources and environmentally preferable products. Many school districts lack knowledge of cutting-edge design and technologies for optimal implementation. The legislation aims to assist school districts in constructing high performance, energy-efficient, and environmentally sound school buildings. Congress is considering a bill to support new school construction and renovations.

The High Performance Schools Program is established in the Department of Education to provide grants to school districts for energy efficiency improvements beyond 30% of the 1998 International Energy Conservation Code levels. The High Performance Schools Program provides grants to school districts for energy efficiency improvements. Grants are given to districts with demonstrated need for responding to increasing school enrollments or renovating facilities, lacking adequate funds without assistance, and committed to developing high performance school buildings. Additionally, grants can be used for evaluating compliance with program requirements. The High Performance Schools Program grants can be used for distributing information, organizing programs, obtaining technical services, and collecting data for high performance school buildings. Grants aim to promote participation in the program. Grants under the High Performance Schools Program can be used for promotional activities, facilitating financing, working with school administrations, and coordinating public benefit programs. School districts must develop feasible plans in consultation with state offices to receive grants. The state agency will encourage qualifying districts to supplement grant funds. The High Performance Schools Program grants encourage school districts to supplement funds for plan implementation. SEC. 4. ALLOCATION OF FUNDS. Governors of the States will receive funds for implementing the Act, and they will decide which State agency will administer the assistance program to school districts. Funds allocated under section 5 will be divided as follows: 70% for grants under section 3(b)(1), 15% for grants under section 3(b)(2), and 15% for grants under section 3(b)(3). The Secretary of Education may retain funds to assist State agencies in coordinating and implementing the Program. The funds allocated under the Act may be used to develop reference materials for high performance school buildings. SEC. 5. Authorization of appropriations for grants under section 3(b) includes $200,000,000 for fiscal year 2001, increasing annually to $230,000,000 for fiscal year 2004, with additional funding for the following 6 years. SEC. 6. Definitions. The Act defines \"elementary school\" and \"secondary school\" as per the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. It also defines \"high performance school building\" as one that maximizes renewable energy use, is cost-effective, uses environmentally friendly materials, and enhances indoor quality. Renewable energy includes solar, wind, geothermal, hydropower, and biomass power."
