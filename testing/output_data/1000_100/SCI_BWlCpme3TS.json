A novel transformer variant with convolutional encoder blocks outperforms the standard transformer, showing faster convergence and more robust character-level alignments. Character-level models offer a more memory-efficient approach compared to word or subword-level models. Self-attention models are suitable for character-level translation, offering a more compact language representation and mitigating OOV problems. Multilingual training can improve performance without increasing model complexity. Models based on self-attention have shown excellent performance in various tasks. This study investigates the suitability of self-attention models for character-level translation. The study evaluates the performance of self-attention models for character-level translation, comparing a standard transformer with a novel convtransformer variant. Results show that self-attention models work well for character-level translation, with the convtransformer outperforming the standard transformer and requiring fewer parameters. The convtransformer model outperforms the standard transformer for character-level translation, converging faster and producing more robust alignments. Lee et al. (2017) introduced a model combining convolutional layers with max pooling and highway layers for character-level translation, showing promising results for multilingual translation. Training on multiple source languages improved performance without architectural modifications. Character-level models can outperform subword-level models in NLP tasks, as they offer greater flexibility in processing and segmenting input and output sequences. The transformer model, using self-attention instead of recurrence, has achieved state-of-the-art performance in sequence modelling tasks. The convtransformer is a modification of the standard transformer architecture that aims to facilitate character-level interactions. It includes feedforward layers based on self-attention and is designed to investigate the effectiveness of the transformer on character-level bilingual and multilingual translation tasks. The convtransformer is a modified version of the standard transformer, incorporating additional sub-blocks in each encoder block inspired by Lee et al. (2017). It uses parallel 1D convolutional layers with different context window sizes to capture character interactions at various levels. The output dimensionality remains unchanged, unlike Lee et al. (2017), with the addition of a residual connection for flexibility. Experiments are conducted on two datasets. We experiment with two datasets: WMT15 DE\u2192EN and United Nations Parallel Corporus (UN). For the UN dataset, we randomly sample one million sentence pairs from FR, ES, and ZH parts for training. Multilingual experiments are conducted using UN due to its large parallel sentences from six languages in the same domain. The study evaluates models trained on various input languages and tested on English using different test sets. Bilingual and multilingual scenarios are explored without language identifiers. Chinese data is latinized for character vocabulary consistency. Testing is done on original UN test sets for each language pair. In a study comparing character-level architectures trained on the WMT dataset, it was found that character-level transformers achieve strong performance, outperforming other models. Despite being slower due to longer sequence lengths, character-level training is competitive with subword-level training. Transformers perform competitively with BPE models, requiring fewer parameters. The convtransformer variant matches the standard transformer's performance. Multilingual experiments show the convtransformer outperforms the transformer by up to 2.6 BLEU on multilingual translation. Training on similar input languages leads to improved performance for both languages. The convtransformer is slower to train but reaches comparable performance in fewer epochs than the transformer. Distant-language training is only beneficial when the input language is closer to the target translation language. Character alignments in multilingual models are analyzed to understand their performance. The study compares bilingual and multilingual models in learning alignments. Bilingual models are found to have greater flexibility in learning high-quality alignments. Canonical correlation analysis is used to quantify alignments by sampling sentences from different languages and analyzing alignment matrices. The analysis is conducted on transformer models. The study compares bilingual and multilingual models in learning alignments using transformer and convtransformer models. Results show strong positive correlation for similar source and target languages, but a drop in correlation when introducing a distant language like ZH. The convtransformer is more robust to distant languages compared to the transformer. The study tested standard transformer and convtransformer models for character-level translation, finding self-attention to perform well with fewer parameters. Training on multiple similar languages improved performance, but distant languages showed a drop in accuracy. Future work will include more diverse languages and improving training efficiency for character-level models. The study compared bilingual and multilingual models for translation, showing sharper weight distribution in convtransformer for matching characters and words. Multilingual translation of close languages preserved word alignments, with convtransformer producing slightly less noisy alignments. Distant language translation showed a drop in accuracy. The convtransformer model showed sharper weight distribution for matching characters and words in multilingual translation. It was more robust for distant language translation, preserving word alignments better than the transformer model.
