    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"James Campbell National Wildlife Refuge Expansion Act of 2005\". The United States Fish and Wildlife Service manages the James Campbell National Wildlife Refuge to promote the recovery of 4 endangered Hawaiian waterbirds. They lease 240 acres of wetland habitat and are purchasing the land to protect the endangered species and improve Refuge management. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service has identified approximately 800 acres of high-value wildlife habitat owned by the estate of James Campbell for inclusion in the Refuge. The land features coastal dunes, wetlands, and strand that support various threatened and endangered species, including Hawaiian waterbirds, migratory shorebirds, waterfowl, seabirds, plant species, monk seals, and green sea turtles. Expanding the Refuge will provide more opportunities for wildlife-dependent public uses and reduce flood damage in Kahuku by creating a large, ecologically-intact unit with buffer land. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The Director is the Director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, Refuge refers to the James Campbell National Wildlife Refuge, and Secretary is the Secretary of the Interior. SEC. 4. EXPANSION OF REFUGE. The James Campbell National Wildlife Refuge is expanded by approximately 1,100 acres of land. The Secretary has the authority to make minor boundary revisions to achieve Refuge goals or facilitate property acquisition. The map depicting the expansion is available for inspection at a designated office of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. The Secretary will publish a notice in the Federal Register and local publications about the availability of the map for the expansion of the James Campbell National Wildlife Refuge by 1,100 acres. SEC. 5. ACQUISITION OF LAND AND WATER. The Secretary may acquire land described in section 4(a) to become part of the Refuge and be administered according to law. SEC. 6. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Sums necessary to carry out this Act are authorized to be appropriated."
