    "content": "The \"Temporary Emergency Unemployment Compensation Act of 2001\" can be cited as the short title. This act pertains to Federal-State agreements. The \"Temporary Emergency Unemployment Compensation Act of 2001\" allows states to enter agreements with the Secretary of Labor to provide temporary emergency unemployment compensation to individuals who have exhausted all regular compensation rights. (c) Exhaustion of Benefits.--An individual is deemed to have exhausted their rights to regular compensation under a State law when no more payments can be made or when their rights have been terminated due to the expiration of the benefit year. Weekly Benefit Amount for temporary emergency unemployment compensation is based on the regular compensation amount payable under State law for total unemployment weeks. State law terms and conditions apply to claims for both regular and temporary emergency unemployment compensation, except where inconsistent with federal regulations. The Secretary's operating instructions govern the maximum amount of temporary emergency unemployment compensation. States can elect to trigger an extended compensation period for individuals who have exhausted regular benefits. SEC. 3. TEMPORARY EMERGENCY UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION ACCOUNT. Any agreement under this title establishes a temporary emergency unemployment compensation account for eligible individuals. The account amount is 13 times the individual's average weekly benefit amount for the benefit year, with reductions for extended benefits received. The weekly benefit amount is the regular compensation payable to an individual for total unemployment under the State law, including dependents' allowances. SEC. 4. PAYMENTS TO STATES WITH AGREEMENTS FOR TEMPORARY EMERGENCY UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION. Payments to states with agreements for temporary emergency unemployment compensation shall be equal to 100 percent of the compensation paid to individuals under the agreement. States will not receive payment if entitled to reimbursement under other federal laws. Sums payable to states with agreements will be determined accordingly. The Secretary will determine payments to states with agreements for temporary emergency unemployment compensation based on estimated entitlements for each month, adjusted for any over or underpayments in prior months. Estimates can be calculated using agreed-upon methods between the Secretary and the state agency. SEC. 5. FINANCING PROVISIONS. Funds from the extended unemployment compensation account in the Unemployment Trust Fund are used to make payments to States with agreements under this title. The Secretary certifies payments to each State, which are then transferred from the extended unemployment compensation account to the State's account in the Unemployment Trust Fund. Appropriations are made to provide assistance to States. Appropriations are made to assist States in meeting the costs of administering agreements under this title. Funds are appropriated from the general Treasury to the extended unemployment compensation account for payments under specific compensation programs. Amounts appropriated under section 3309(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 do not need to be repaid. SEC. 6. FRAUD AND OVERPAYMENTS. Individuals who knowingly make false statements or fail to disclose material facts to receive emergency unemployment compensation they are not entitled to will be ineligible for further benefits and may face prosecution under federal law. Repayment may be required for those who have received such benefits. Repayment of emergency unemployment compensation may be required for individuals who received benefits they were not entitled to. The State agency can waive repayment if it was not the individual's fault and if repayment would be unfair. The State agency can recover the repayment by deducting from future emergency unemployment compensation or any other federal unemployment benefits. Individuals who received temporary emergency unemployment compensation they were not entitled to may have to repay it. Repayment cannot exceed 50% of the weekly benefit amount and no deductions can be made without a fair hearing and a final determination. Any determination by a State agency under this section shall be subject to review in the same manner and to the same extent as determinations under the State unemployment compensation law, and only in that manner and to that extent. SEC. 7. DEFINITIONS. Terms such as \"compensation\", \"benefit year\", and \"week\" are defined under the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970.\n\nSEC. 8. APPLICABILITY. Agreements under this Act apply to weeks of unemployment starting after the agreement is made and ending within 18 months of the Act's enactment.\n\nSEC. 9. TEMPORARY REDUCTION IN INTEREST RATE FOR STATE UNEMPLOYMENT FUND ADVANCES. The rate of interest paid by a State on advances made under section 1201 of the Social Security Act will be reduced from 10 percent to 5 percent for a period of 18 months after the enactment of the Act."
