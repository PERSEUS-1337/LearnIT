    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Cord Blood Stem Cell Act of 2003\". It includes findings related to cord blood stem cells. The Congress finds that research has shown the feasibility of using cord blood for clinical applications, including bone marrow reconstitution for certain diseases. Cord blood, normally discarded after childbirth, contains stem cells that can be collected as donor tissue without risk. Cord blood contains stem cells that can be collected without risk to the donor, preserved for years, and used for transplantation or research. Advantages of cord blood transplants over bone marrow transplants include reduced risks to the donor, quicker availability of donor cells, and lower risk of complications. Sibling matches are preferred in bone marrow transplants, but only 30% of patients have a match. Finding a fully matched unrelated donor is crucial for successful bone marrow transplantation, especially for patients of ethnic minorities who struggle to find fully matched donors. Partially matched transplants result in high complication rates, including graft versus host disease and mortality. Cord blood stem cell banks offer increased genetic diversity in donor supply, providing more opportunities for fully matched and partially matched transplant units for qualified candidates. An inventory of 150,000 cord blood stem cell units, considering ethnic diversity, can provide matches for 90% of those needing transplants within days. Matching donors from the same ethnic group reduces complications and mortality. Patients with Sickle Cell Anemia, a genetic condition more prevalent in African-American newborns, have a high risk of bacterial blood infections and painful crises. The median lifespan is 42 years, with severe cases rarely living beyond 20 years. Cord blood stem cell transplantation has cured 80% of children with the disease. Cord blood transplants can cure Sickle Cell Anemia or thalassemia, especially beneficial for African American and other ethnic minority patients. An ethnically balanced national cord blood bank of 150,000 units could help 90% of African American patients find suitable donors. Cord blood transplantation complements bone marrow transplants by providing matched units, especially for non-caucasoid patients. Specific systems and expertise are needed for cord blood collection, preparation, storage, and dissemination. Radiation exposure can lead to bone marrow failure, requiring treatment like reconstitution. Recent scientific developments suggest that research on cord blood stem cells may lead to a greater understanding of chronic diseases, potentially improving therapies and even curing diseases like Parkinson's, diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers. These diseases contribute significantly to chronic disabilities and healthcare costs in the United States. The Public Health Service Act is amended to establish a National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network. The National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network is defined by key terms such as Administrator, cord blood unit, donor, donor bank, and human cord blood stem cells. The National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network is a network of qualified cord blood stem cell banks established to contain at least 150,000 units of human cord blood stem cells. The purpose of the donor banks in the network is to acquire, tissue-type, test, and cryopreserve cord blood stem cells. The National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network aims to acquire, store, and distribute donated units of human cord blood for stem cell transplantation and research purposes. Donor banks must comply with regulations, make units available to transplant centers, and allocate a portion for research each year. Eligible donor banks must have necessary licenses and registrations. The National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network requires donor banks to have necessary licenses, registrations, and authorizations to operate. They must implement donor screening and collection practices to protect donors and recipients from infections. Additionally, they must maintain strict confidentiality to protect patient and donor identities in accordance with federal and state laws. The National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network requires donor banks to have necessary licenses, registrations, and authorizations to operate. They must implement donor screening and collection practices to protect donors and recipients from infections. Additionally, they must maintain strict confidentiality for patient and donor identities. Donor banks must also establish systems for encouraging donation by a diverse group of donors, communicate effectively with other stem cell banks and healthcare providers, and educate the public about cord blood donation. The National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network, overseen by a Board of Directors appointed by the Secretary, administers a registry and coordinates donor banks. The Board of Directors overseeing the National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network is composed of representatives from various stakeholders, including transplant centers, birthing hospitals, research community, transplant recipients, family members, social sciences experts, and the general public. The Board of Directors overseeing the National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network includes representatives from transplant centers, birthing hospitals, research community, transplant recipients, family members, social sciences experts, and the general public. Members may serve up to 2 consecutive 3-year terms, except for nonvoting members from the Division of Stem Cell Transplantation and network donor banks. The Board of Directors overseeing the National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network is appointed with staggered terms for continuity. A National Cord Blood Stem Cell Registry is established to identify, acquire, and distribute donated cord blood units for transplant patients. The National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network maintains a database to document the collection, storage, distribution, and transplantation of cord blood units, as well as the clinical outcomes of all related transplantations. The database operates according to standards of consent, disclosure, and confidentiality. The National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network maintains a database to report on safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of activities. The Board of Directors ensures donor banks meet requirements continuously. The National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network and their birthing hospital collection sites are distributed throughout the United States. $15,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2004, $30,000,000 for fiscal year 2005, and additional funds for fiscal years 2006 through 2008 or until the 150,000 unit inventory is acquired."
