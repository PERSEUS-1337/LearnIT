    "content": "The quality of instruction is crucial for student learning, and federal policy emphasizes the importance of good pre-service preparation for teachers. Title II, Part A of the Higher Education Act of 1965 provides financial support and accountability measures to improve teacher preparation programs. This includes a competitive grant program for reforms in select programs and reporting requirements for all teacher preparation programs at the state level. The 115th Congress is considering reauthorization of the Higher Education Act (HEA). H.R. 4508 would repeal all provisions in Title II, while H.R. 6543 would amend and extend Title II. The authorization of appropriations for Title II-A expired in FY2011 but has been funded through various legislation, including P.L. 115-245 for FY2019. The report discusses current programs and provisions in Title II-A under P.L. 115-245 for the Department of Education. It highlights key issues for the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, focusing on traditional and alternative teacher preparation programs. Since the early 20th century, most U.S. teachers have been trained at programs operated by institutions of higher education (IHEs). The growth of teacher preparation programs and schools of education at IHEs was accompanied by the professionalization of teacher educators and the formalized split between pedagogy and subject-matter disciplines. Teachers in schools of education and teacher colleges emphasize the importance of pedagogy courses and passing related tests. The divide between teaching practice and subject-matter expertise has widened with the rise of alternative routes to teacher certification. These alternative approaches focus on candidate's prior knowledge of the subject they will teach and training for classroom instruction and management. The Secretary of Education is required to prepare an annual report on teacher preparation in the U.S., with the most recent data from the 2012-2013 academic year. In the 2015-2016 academic year, 2,106 teacher preparation providers offered 26,459 programs enrolling 441,439 teaching candidates and producing 159,598 program completers. The Secretary's Tenth Annual Report provides detailed national statistics on teacher preparation. In the 2012-2013 academic year, 2,171 teacher preparation providers offered 26,589 programs enrolling 499,800 teaching candidates and producing 192,459 program completers. In the 2012-2013 academic year, there were 2,171 teacher preparation providers offering 26,589 programs. Among the providers, 69% were traditional, 22% were alternative route providers at IHEs, and 9% were alternative route providers not based at IHEs. Additionally, 70% of the programs were traditional, 20% were alternative route programs at IHEs, and 10% were alternative route programs not based at IHEs. Over 89% of the 499,800 teacher candidates were enrolled in traditional programs, while 5% were in alternative route programs at IHEs, and nearly 6% were in alternative route programs not based at IHEs. In the 2012-2013 academic year, states like Texas, New York, California, Pennsylvania, and Illinois prepared 35% of teacher preparation program completers. New York led in traditional program completion, while Texas led in alternative route completers. The Secretary's Tenth Annual report highlighted that traditional programs require 100 hours of supervised clinical experience and 600 hours of student teaching. Traditional teacher preparation programs require 100 hours of supervised clinical experience and 600 hours of student teaching. The two largest programs, Grand Canyon University and the University of Phoenix, enroll over 30,000 prospective teachers, which is 10 times more than the next 10 largest programs combined. The majority of enrollees are white, non-Hispanic, with African-American enrollees making up a smaller percentage. The most common subject areas of program completion are elementary education, special education, early childhood education, English/language arts, and mathematics. The national average scaled score for education programs was 14 percentage points above the average cut score. Over 95% of candidates who took a state assessment passed the test. Title II-A of the HEA includes a competitive grant program and reporting provisions for teacher preparation programs. The Teacher Quality Partnership (TQP) program aims to improve the quality of teacher preparation. The Teacher Quality Partnership (TQP) program aims to improve teacher preparation by enhancing professional development activities for new teachers and supporting traditional pre-baccalaureate or fifth-year teacher preparation programs, as well as teacher residency programs. The program receives annual appropriations of about $42 million, supporting grants to partnerships with different types of teacher preparation programs. In FY2016, 24 grants were awarded, 12 in FY2014, and 28 in FY2009. Eligibility for a TQP award requires a partnership with a high-need local educational agency, a partner institution of higher education, and coordination with other federally funded programs. Grantees must match 100% of their award amount with non-federal funds to implement teacher preparation program reforms. The TQP grants aim to implement reforms in teacher preparation programs and early childhood educator programs. Reforms include curriculum changes, research-based instructional practices, high-quality clinical education, induction programs for new teachers, increased compensation for qualified educators, professional development, and alternative routes to certification. The TQP grants focus on developing effective mechanisms to recruit qualified individuals into teaching, strengthening literacy instruction skills, and implementing teacher residency programs based on successful models. These programs provide rigorous graduate-level coursework, teaching apprenticeships, mentorship, and criteria for selecting effective mentor teachers. Graduates are placed in targeted schools for professional collaboration. The TQP grants aim to develop effective school leadership programs for superintendents, principals, and other school leaders. These programs focus on promoting strong leadership skills, understanding teaching and assessment techniques, using data for evaluation, managing resources, engaging parents and community stakeholders, and fostering professional development for teachers. The TQP grants aim to develop effective school leadership programs for superintendents, principals, and other school leaders. These programs focus on promoting strong leadership skills, understanding teaching and assessment techniques, using data for evaluation, managing resources, engaging parents and community stakeholders, and fostering professional development for teachers. Grant funds must be used to develop a yearlong clinical education program, mentoring and induction programs, and recruit qualified individuals to become school leaders. Title II (Section 205) of the HEA includes provisions to hold teacher preparation programs accountable by requiring states and IHEs to report program performance information. States and IHEs must issue report cards to the state, ED, and the general public. The HEA requires ED to issue an annual report on teacher qualifications using state-reported information. States must evaluate teacher preparation programs based on criteria like teaching skill and pass rates on credentialing assessments. Some states also consider student academic achievement and entry standards for teaching. In 2014, 12 states and Puerto Rico reported low-performing or at-risk teacher preparation programs. This represented less than 3% of total programs. The House Committee on Education and the Workforce ordered reported the Promoting Real Opportunity, Success, and Prosperity through Education. The House Committee on Education and the Workforce approved the Promoting Real Opportunity, Success, and Prosperity through Education Reform Act (H.R. 4508) on a party-line vote. This bill would make amendments to the Higher Education Act (HEA), including the repeal of current provisions in Title II. Additionally, the ranking member introduced the Aim Higher Act (H.R. 6543), a comprehensive HEA reauthorization bill that retains and amends current Title II provisions, such as changes to the TQP program and expansion of accountability provisions for institutions and states. The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions has held hearings on HEA reauthorization but has not introduced a bill amending Title II. President signed a resolution nullifying regulations that would have added clearer guidance on program providers, post-program measures, and penalties. Congress may consider legislation to reauthorize the Higher Education Act, including provisions in Title II such as supporting innovations in teacher preparation programs. Some argue for a greater federal role in teacher preparation, stating that the current program mainly supports demonstration projects. Some argue for expanding the federal role in supporting quality teacher preparation programs, while others believe it should remain a state and local responsibility. There is debate over the optimal mix of activities in the Teacher Quality Partnership (TQP) program, with traditional routes emphasizing supervised clinical practice and assessments, and alternative routes seeking fewer restrictions on TQP partners and more in-service supports. Some argue for expanding federal policy on program quality in the TQP program, advocating for more in-service supports like induction and mentoring for teachers. They believe current reporting and accountability measures are insufficient, with less than 3% of programs identified as low-performing. There is a call for program evaluations tied to student performance outcomes, while others argue against federal accountability requirements, stating that current reporting already burdens state and local administrators."
