    "content": "China maintained a currency peg to the U.S. dollar at an exchange rate of 8.28 yuan to the dollar from 1994 to July 21, 2005. The Chinese central bank controlled the peg by buying or selling dollar-denominated assets to balance demand for the yuan. Despite changing economic factors, the exchange rate remained stable. Economists believe the peg was close to the market value initially, but in later years, the yuan would likely have appreciated under a floating exchange rate system. The Chinese government changed its currency policy on July 21, 2005, allowing the yuan to fluctuate based on market supply and demand. The exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the yuan was adjusted from 8.28 to 8.11, appreciating by about 2.1%. The yuan could fluctuate daily by 0.3% against a basket of currencies, but remained not fully convertible in international markets. Since July 2005, China has allowed the yuan to appreciate steadily but slowly, accumulating foreign reserves rapidly. China's foreign exchange reserves grew from $403 billion in 2003 to $1.7 trillion in March 2008, with a large trade surplus of $262 billion in 2007. The yuan has risen 16% against the dollar since the reforms, indicating a significant shift in the economic environment between China and the United States. The value of the dollar has fallen significantly, causing concerns about the U.S. economy. Despite the increase in the yuan, China is hesitant to make significant changes to its currency policy. This paper reviews the economic issues surrounding China's currency policy, including concerns from the U.S. and China's reluctance to change its fixed exchange rate regime. China's fixed exchange rate regime and economic studies on China's real exchange rate. U.S.-China trade imbalance trends and factors, with a focus on China's currency policy. Economic consequences for both countries, including China's massive foreign exchange reserves and U.S. debt purchases. Policy options for the U.S. to induce China to reform its currency policy, with concerns over the undervaluation of the Chinese currency. China's undervalued currency has led to a significant U.S. trade deficit with China, impacting U.S. production and employment in various manufacturing sectors. Analysts suggest that China's currency policy influences other East Asian countries to keep their currencies weak against the dollar. Pressure is mounting on the Bush Administration to urge China to revalue its currency or allow it to float freely in international markets. President Bush and Administration officials have criticized China's currency policy, advocating for market-determined exchange rates. Initially, they avoided direct pressure on China but later toughened their stance in April 2005, pushing for a more flexible exchange rate. This shift was likely influenced by mounting complaints and concerns about China's currency peg. In response to growing complaints over China's currency policy, the Senate considered imposing a 27.5% tariff on Chinese goods if China did not appreciate its currency. This led to negotiations and the introduction of S. 295 with similar language, threatening to bring the bill up for a vote. Supporters of S. 295 threatened to bring the bill up for a vote on two separate occasions in 2006, but were convinced not to by Administration and Chinese officials. Significant events concerning China's currency policy included import price increases from China, U.S. imports rising by 1.8%, and the yuan appreciating by 15.9% since July 2005. On April 14, 2008, the Bank of China reported that China's foreign exchange reserves reached $1.68 trillion at the end of March 2008. The China Investment Corporation (CIC) was officially launched on September 29, 2007, with an initial capitalization of $200 billion. CIC announced a $5 billion investment in Morgan Stanley on December 15, 2007. China stated on August 13, 2007, that it had no plans to sell off its dollar assets in response to rumors of sanctions over its currency policy. The United States considered imposing sanctions on China for its currency policy, while the IMF defined currency manipulation as policies affecting exchange rates to boost exports. A petition was filed with the U.S. Trade Representative's office over China's currency practices, but it was declined. The Treasury Department declined a petition regarding currency manipulation under the 1988 Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act. The Act requires annual reports on exchange rate policies of countries with large surpluses and trade with the US, aiming to prevent unfair advantages in trade. Treasury has previously cited China for currency manipulation due to its dual exchange rate system. Since 1994, China has not been designated as a currency manipulator. However, the Treasury Department has increased its focus on China's currency policy and reforms in recent years. Despite praising China's currency reforms in July 2005, the Treasury Department noted that China had not fully implemented its commitment to make its exchange rate mechanism more flexible. The new managed float exchange rate regime in China, based on market supply and demand with reference to a basket of currencies, was also criticized for not fully incorporating market forces to determine the yuan's value. The Treasury Department did not cite China as a currency manipulator under U.S. trade law, despite acknowledging that China's currency was undervalued and heavily intervened in currency markets. This decision was based on assurances from Chinese officials regarding market-determined currency flexibility and promoting domestic growth through financial reform. The Treasury Department did not label China as a currency manipulator under U.S. law, despite acknowledging the undervaluation of China's currency. The report emphasized the need for China to accelerate the appreciation of the RMB's exchange rate to minimize risks for the global economy. Many Members criticized Treasury's decision not to cite China as a currency manipulator, calling for legislative changes in the criteria used for such determinations. Chinese officials argue that their currency policy is not aimed at favoring exports or discouraging imports but rather to maintain economic stability and investor confidence. They believe that abandoning the current currency peg to the dollar could lead to an economic crisis, especially impacting export industries during ongoing economic reforms. Additionally, concerns about rural unrest due to income disparities are also evident. The rising rural unrest in China is fueled by income disparities, government land seizures, and corruption. Chinese officials argue that appreciating the currency could harm farmers by reducing their income and causing tensions. They believe that a fully convertible currency could lead to speculative pressures due to the underdeveloped banking system. This combination was a factor in the 1997-1998 Asian financial crisis. Prior to the crisis, Chinese officials were considering currency policy reforms. Chinese officials were considering currency policy reforms, with the idea of gradually making the currency more flexible to maintain stable economic growth. U.S. officials suggest reforms to the financial sector and making the currency more flexible, including allowing faster appreciation of the yuan and decreasing intervention in international currency markets. Fixed exchange rates have a history of use, such as the Bretton Woods system and the international gold standard. China operated under a fixed exchange rate system until July 2005, where the central bank maintained a constant yuan-dollar exchange rate. This system contrasted with a floating exchange rate, like the one the United States has with the Euro area, where market forces determine the exchange rate. When economic circumstances change, the central bank may need to adjust the exchange rate peg to maintain equilibrium. Factors like increased demand for a country's goods and assets can lead to a rise in the currency's value. If China had a floating exchange rate, its currency would likely have appreciated due to factors like productivity improvements and foreign direct investment. Maintaining a fixed exchange rate requires the central bank to adjust the currency supply to match changing economic conditions. The central bank adjusts the currency supply to maintain equilibrium by increasing or decreasing foreign exchange reserves. Net exports and private capital inflows affect the exchange rate peg, requiring an increase in reserves. Excess demand for yuan led to the central bank buying dollars to maintain the peg until 2005. Since 2005, China has been increasing its foreign reserves by buying dollars in exchange for yuan, primarily holding U.S. financial securities. By 2007, China became the world's largest holder of foreign exchange reserves, growing from $75 billion in 1995 to $1.53 trillion in 2007. The central bank continued to accumulate reserves rapidly, surpassing Japan in holdings. China's managed float rate regime has allowed the yuan to appreciate steadily against the dollar since 2005. Despite market forces determining its movement, government intervention slows down the rate of appreciation. The rapid accumulation of foreign reserves suggests that if the yuan were freely floated, it would appreciate more quickly. The Chinese government's accumulation of foreign exchange reserves is not solely to prevent the yuan from appreciating against the dollar. These reserves are also essential for financing international trade and defending against currency speculation. China's rapid increase in foreign reserves has outpaced GDP and imports growth, indicating a potential motive beyond economic expansion. The composition of China's reserves, particularly the share held in U.S. assets, remains undisclosed. The real and nominal exchange rates between the United States and China diverged due to inflation differences from 1994 to 1997, leading to an appreciation of China's real exchange rate. However, from 1997 to 2003, the real and nominal exchange rates converged as China's inflation rate was lower than the U.S., making their exports more expensive and U.S. imports cheaper. In 2003, the Chinese exchange rate reached its lowest level since 1994 in real terms, making exports cheaper. The yuan has since appreciated, almost back to its 1998 level. If demand for Chinese goods increases, the floating yuan would appreciate until trade balance returns to equilibrium. The fixed exchange rate causes the trade surplus with the United States to persist as Chinese exports remain inexpensive. The surplus is equal to the capital flowing from China to the U.S., including purchases of U.S. assets and accumulation of dollar reserves by the Chinese central bank. This increases the supply of yuan, leading to inflation in China. The fixed exchange rate causes the trade surplus with the United States to persist as Chinese exports remain inexpensive, leading to inflation in China. As prices rise, exports become costlier abroad and imports cheaper, returning the trade surplus to equilibrium. Undervaluing a fixed exchange rate does not provide a permanent competitive advantage. Floating exchange rates adjust more quickly to equilibrium values, limiting the use of monetary and fiscal policy to counteract changes in the business cycle. China's fixed exchange rate with the United States leads to a persistent trade surplus and inflation. This limits the effectiveness of monetary policy in countering economic downturns. The loss of monetary autonomy is more significant for countries tied to partners with different business cycles, like the United States and China. China maintains a fixed exchange rate with the United States, leading to a trade surplus and inflation. Despite this, China retains some monetary autonomy through capital controls, allowing flexibility in monetary and fiscal policy. The report evaluates estimates of the yuan's undervaluation, grouped into two methodological categories: the \"fundamental equilibrium exchange rate\" method and the \"purchasing power parity\" method. Many estimates were made when the yuan and China's trade surplus were lower, so the current undervaluation may vary. The fundamental equilibrium exchange rate (FEER) method is used to estimate misalignments in exchange rates based on the belief that current account balances are temporarily out of line with their \"fundamental\" value. This method calculates how much the exchange rate must change to achieve the desired current account adjustment, but its validity is disputed among economists. Ernest Preeg estimated that the yuan was undervalued by 40% in 2003, based on rule-of-thumb estimates. He observed that the increase in Chinese foreign exchange reserves equaled the trade surplus less net foreign direct investment, leading to the conclusion that the trade surplus would be zero without the reserves. Additionally, he noted that a 1% decline in the dollar results in a $10 billion decline in the US trade deficit, suggesting a 40% decline in the dollar would eliminate the deficit. The Institute for International Economics (IIE) estimated that the yuan was 15%-25% undervalued in 2003 and argued that the current account surplus should be reduced by $50 billion to return to equilibrium, resulting in a deficit of 1%-1.5% of GDP in equilibrium. Goldman Sachs estimated the yuan was 9.5%-15% undervalued in 2003, suggesting a revaluation to achieve equilibrium in China's balance of payments and reduce global payment imbalances. They proposed a current account deficit equal to FDI, achievable with a 9.5%-15% revaluation. Virginie Coudert and Cecile Couharde estimate that China has an underlying current account deficit of 1.5% to 2.8% of GDP. They suggest that the yuan was 44%-54% undervalued against the dollar in 2003. These estimates are based on sophisticated analysis and various economic factors. The estimates of the yuan's undervaluation are not based on econometrically estimated economic models but on \"back of the envelope\" calculations using \"rule of thumb\" assumptions. The main source of contention is defining an \"equilibrium\" current account balance, with no consensus on what equilibrium would be. Different authors base their estimates on personal opinions and arbitrary assumptions, making the assumption crucial in determining the yuan's undervaluation. Changing the assumed equilibrium current account balance significantly impacts estimated undervaluation. Some economists argue that the current account balance would be close to zero in equilibrium, but this overlooks countries with different saving and investment rates. Studies suggest China's overall \"equilibrium\" current account position is actually a deficit due to foreign direct investment inflows. If they had chosen balance as their equilibrium benchmark instead of a deficit, estimates of the yuan's undervaluation would have been smaller. Capital controls and net FDI inflows require China to increase foreign reserves to prevent rising foreign indebtedness. Determining the equilibrium current account balance in China is challenging due to capital controls. Maintaining capital controls post-currency reform complicates the situation. If China maintains capital controls after currency reform, the current account balance may remain stable. However, if capital controls are eliminated, the economic situation would change significantly. Private Chinese citizens could engage in persistent borrowing or lending with the rest of the world, leading to trade deficits or surpluses. If private citizens lent as much to the US as the Chinese central bank currently does, the market exchange rate would stay fixed. Excessive private capital outflows could cause the yuan to depreciate. If China maintains capital controls after currency reform, the current account balance may remain stable. However, if capital controls are eliminated, the economic situation would change significantly. Private Chinese citizens could engage in persistent borrowing or lending with the rest of the world, leading to trade deficits or surpluses. Excessive private capital outflows could cause the yuan to depreciate, impacting foreign reserves. China's high internal saving rate may offset FDI inflows with official outflows in the form of foreign reserve accumulation, rather than running a current account deficit. Foreign reserve accumulation should not be seen as proof of undervaluation. Based on estimates from developing economies, China's current account surplus may be larger than reported, leading to an overvalued yuan. The FEER approach suggests that revaluing the yuan could reduce the unsustainable U.S. trade deficit. Some argue that the dollar is incorrectly valued, with estimates showing the yuan as 54% undervalued in 2003. If trade and financial markets are rational, the value of the dollar and trade deficit are sustainable. The U.S. trade deficit is not considered unsustainable in the next few years based on various factors such as its duration, impact on the economy in the late 1990s, and absence of significant dollar declines. Even if China reduces its trade deficit with the U.S., other countries could still lend to the U.S., maintaining the overall deficit. China's trade surplus with the United States may persist even if its overall surplus is eliminated. International experience with other East Asian countries suggests a mixed outcome in achieving equilibrium in the current account balance. Since the Asian financial crisis in 1997, East Asian countries like Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, and Japan have been running large current account surpluses. This trend indicates that the current economic environment may not favor borrowing for developing countries. China's current account balance, although large, is in line with its neighbors, and there are estimates of the yuan's undervaluation based on purchasing power parity theory. The Economist's Big Mac Index estimates China's currency undervaluation by 56% in 2007 based on purchasing power parity theory. However, relying solely on this index has drawbacks as it compares non-tradeable goods like a Big Mac. Li Ong suggests that most of a Big Mac's value comes from associated services, not the burger itself. The value of a Big Mac is influenced by services like employee wages and rent, making purchasing power parity unreliable. Prices are lower in developing countries than in industrialized ones, leading to discrepancies in currency valuation. The PPP approach to estimating currency value has limitations, as it may not accurately predict exchange rates in the short term. Economist Jeffrey Frankel suggests using income levels to determine a country's equilibrium exchange rate based on PPP, estimating that China's currency was undervalued by 36% in 2000. Economist Jeffrey Frankel estimates that China's currency was undervalued by 36% in 2000 and suggests using income levels to determine equilibrium exchange rates. Coudert and Couharde calculate a 41%-51% undervaluation for the yuan in 2003. Frankel acknowledges limitations to this analysis, including the gradual adjustment of exchange rates and the impact on the U.S. trade deficit and employment. Theoretical rationale for linking income levels to exchange rate values includes the \"Balassa-Samuelson\" effect. Proxy indicators like the consumer price index to producer price index ratio have been used to estimate undervaluation of currencies, such as the yuan being undervalued by 18% in 2003 and 47% in 2003 according to different studies. The yuan was found to be undervalued by 47% in 2003 by a panel of G20 countries. However, there are concerns about the accuracy of using a price index proxy for China due to market determination of consumer prices and restrictions on labor and capital mobility. Cheung et al. replicated results showing significant undervaluation of the yuan but noted that the estimates did not meet statistical inference standards, indicating the undervaluation may not be robust. The yuan was found to be undervalued by 47% in 2003 by a panel of G20 countries. Concerns about accuracy arise from using a price index proxy for China due to market determination of consumer prices and restrictions on labor and capital mobility. Additional variables in the PPP model, like trade openness, reduce estimated undervaluation. Changes in the model, like time period or sample country omission, greatly affect estimates. The Treasury Department's report on exchange rates discusses using economic models to estimate currency misalignment. The Treasury Department's report on exchange rates highlights the limitations of economic models in estimating currency misalignment, emphasizing the importance of focusing on serious misalignments, using real effective exchange rates, utilizing multiple models, and considering market-based reasons for misalignment. Critics point out that most models estimate equilibrium exchange rates based on trade flows, neglecting the impact of financial flows. Critics of China's currency peg argue that the yuan is undervalued, leading to a large U.S.-China trade imbalance. However, bilateral trade balances are influenced by structural causes and exchange rate effects. Despite a $256 billion trade surplus with the U.S. in 2007, China's overall surplus was $262 billion, with a small surplus of $6 billion in trade with other countries. This suggests that if the yuan is undervalued against the dollar, it should also be undervalued against other currencies. China's trade deficits with Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan are significant. Despite the U.S. trade deficit with China, U.S. exports to China have been increasing rapidly. In 2007, U.S. exports to China grew faster than to any other major trading partner, making China the third largest U.S. export market. There is strong evidence that a significant portion of imports from China, contributing to the U.S. trade deficit, comes from export-oriented multinational companies, particularly from East Asia. The share of China's exports produced by foreign-invested enterprises (FIEs) has increased significantly over the years, with FIEs accounting for a large percentage of both exports and imports. FIEs import raw materials and components for assembly in China before exporting the final products. China tends to run trade deficits with East Asian countries and trade surpluses with countries like the United States due to being a production platform for foreign companies. The rise of foreign-invested enterprises (FIEs) in China has led to a significant increase in exports and imports, with FIEs playing a major role in the trade relationship between China and the United States. The growth of foreign-invested enterprises (FIEs) in China led to a significant increase in exports and imports, with FIEs having little effect on China's overall trade balance. Foreign multinational companies shifted production to China from other East Asian countries, impacting trade dynamics with the United States. In 2007, Japan's ranking in computer equipment exports fell to 4th with a 7.0% share, while China became the largest foreign supplier to the US with a 51.5% share. Chinese computer production increased significantly due to foreign companies moving manufacturing facilities to China. The undervaluation of the yuan may benefit Chinese exports to the US by making them cheaper. An undervalued currency in China boosts export industries and attracts foreign investment, benefiting Chinese exporting firms but hurting non-exporting ones. This policy may hinder efficient resource allocation in the long run. In the short run, a revaluation of the yuan could reduce aggregate spending in China by raising imports and reducing exports. Some argue that revaluation would help the overheating Chinese economy, while others believe it could disrupt the absorption of underemployed labor in rural areas. China's currency policy limits the government's use of monetary policy for stable economic growth and has led to an economy overly dependent on fixed investment and net exports. China's currency policy has led to an economy overly dependent on fixed investment and net exports, which may not be sustainable in the long run. The policy also increases the risk of non-performing loans in the banking system and attracts \"hot money\" for speculative ventures, limiting the government's ability to use monetary policy effectively. Low interest rates in a booming economy may hinder capital allocation and lead to overproduction. China's large foreign exchange reserves could expedite the move towards a convertible currency but also pose opportunity costs for funding development needs and improving education and social systems. This accumulation may have higher returns than holding U.S. Treasuries or Chinese bonds for exchange rate intervention. China's foreign reserve accumulation affects the yuan's value, making Chinese exports cheaper and U.S. exports to China more expensive. This leads to a rise in the U.S. trade deficit and a decrease in aggregate demand in the short run, particularly impacting the manufacturing sector. China is a major supplier of labor-intensive consumer goods to the U.S., causing a shift in production overseas. Many U.S. industries, including machine tools, hardware, plastics, furniture, and tool and die manufacturers, are concerned about China's competitive challenge due to an undervalued currency. While U.S. producers import capital equipment and inputs from China, an undervalued yuan can lower prices of U.S. products, increasing their competitiveness in global markets. Additionally, many imports from China are produced by U.S.-invested enterprises, benefiting both countries. An undervalued yuan benefits U.S.-invested enterprises importing from China, leading to increased capital investment in the U.S. as Chinese capital flows into U.S. assets, lowering interest rates and boosting aggregate spending in the short run while expanding the economy in the long run. Chinese capital inflow from the trade deficit benefits the U.S. economy by lowering interest rates and increasing household spending on goods. China holds a significant amount of U.S. Treasury securities, which fund federal budget deficits. If the trade deficit with China is eliminated, the U.S. government would need to find other buyers for its securities at higher interest rates. An undervalued yuan can increase U.S. consumption of goods, improve terms-of-trade, and boost purchasing power. The rise of the yuan may impact Chinese product prices in the U.S. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported a 4.1% increase in import prices from China, the largest in 12 months. Critics blame China's currency policy for job losses in the U.S. manufacturing sector, but there is no clear link between job losses and imports from China. Manufacturing output has reached a record high despite the decline in employment. Manufacturing employment has fallen due to productivity growth, not a decline in output. The trade deficit is increasing overall, not just with China. U.S. employment in manufacturing has decreased significantly over the years due to changing technology and comparative advantage. Trade with countries like China, who excel in producing labor-intensive goods, leads to a shift of manufacturing abroad and less in the United States. Alan Greenspan stated that an undervalued yuan does not significantly impact manufacturing activity or jobs in the U.S. Instead, it causes a shift in production towards firms benefiting from lower interest rates in China. The undervalued yuan leads to a shift in production towards firms benefiting from lower interest rates in China, which may not have a significant impact on overall U.S. employment. While the trade deficit with China has widened, the overall unemployment rate has decreased. However, the gains and losses in employment and production may not be evenly distributed across regions and sectors, leading to potential short-term consequences. If output in the trade sector falls faster than U.S. recipients of Chinese capital rise, there could be a temporary decline in aggregate spending and employment. This could lead to a decrease in the inflation rate, which may have varying effects depending on the economic conditions. Government policy adjustments and market forces can help offset any trade sector output decline. The economy could benefit in the long run from a larger capital base due to capital inflow/trade deficit, but U.S. citizens may not directly benefit from Chinese-owned capital. Chinese-owned capital in the United States can lead to higher productivity and wages for U.S. workers. The U.S. has a trade deficit with China due to a domestic imbalance between saving and investment. Despite high productivity growth and economic fundamentals, the U.S. has a low household saving rate. China has a significantly higher gross national saving rate compared to the United States, leading to a trade deficit between the two countries. The U.S. has a low household saving rate and relies on foreign investment to finance profitable opportunities. Foreign-owned capital in the U.S. benefits American labor, while China maintains a higher rate of fixed investment. China has a higher gross national saving rate compared to the United States, leading to a trade deficit between the two countries. The U.S. must borrow from abroad to fund its investment needs, while China has excess saving that it can invest overseas. This results in a current account balance of 9.0% for China and -6.2% for the United States. Both countries would need to make fundamental changes to their saving/investment patterns to reduce the overall U.S. trade deficit and China's overall trade surplus in the long run. Some analysts believe China is moving towards boosting consumer spending to address this issue. The Treasury Department's November 2005 report on International Economic and Exchange Rate Policies noted China's commitment to sustainable domestic growth, modernizing the financial sector. Concerns remain about China's shift from exports to consumption for GDP growth. Economists focus on the overall trade deficit rather than bilateral balances, citing comparative advantage in trade relationships. For instance, the US has a trade deficit with Austria and a surplus with the Netherlands. The United States has a trade deficit with Austria and a trade surplus with the Netherlands, despite both countries using the euro. The US is heavily reliant on foreign financing for its investment opportunities, with a significant amount coming from China. The dollar has depreciated against various currencies, which could stimulate US exports and reduce demand for imports. Some economists are concerned about the potential impact of a gradually declining dollar on economic activity. Some economists fear a sudden plummet in the value of the dollar due to the large trade deficit, leading to potential dislocations in the U.S. economy and financial markets. The dollar has not depreciated rapidly since 2002 due to central banks in China and other developing countries accumulating foreign reserves to prevent their currency from appreciating against the dollar. This commitment to support the value of the dollar has made private investors feel secure investing in U.S. assets despite the large trade deficit. Investors have felt secure investing in U.S. assets despite the large trade deficit. If China and other countries stop intervening in currency markets, the dollar could significantly decline, potentially triggering a currency crisis. The United States has various options to pressure China for further exchange rate reforms, including making the yuan fully convertible, allowing gradual currency appreciation, reducing intervention in currency markets, widening currency fluctuation bands, and implementing financial sector reforms. This has sparked a lively policy debate on the best approach to induce China to reform its exchange rate policies. Options to induce China to reform its exchange rate regime, including proposed legislation, have sparked a policy debate. Some Members of Congress are frustrated with the Treasury Department's failure to designate China as a currency manipulator since 1994. They believe such a designation would increase pressure on China to reform its currency, although Treasury is already negotiating with China on this issue. The complexity of reaching judgments about countries' currency practices and their relationship to currency manipulation makes the designation process challenging. The bills H.R. 782, H.R. 2942, S. 796, and S. 1607 aim to identify \"fundamentally misaligned currencies\" instead of manipulated currencies. S. 1677 would require Treasury to cite a country for currency manipulation regardless of intent. These bills could lead to China being designated, increasing pressure on Treasury to push for currency reform. The decision to label the yuan as misaligned would still be up to Treasury, but direct negotiations with China could be used to persuade reform. The United States has been urging China to reform its exchange rate policy to benefit both economies. High-level talks and forums have been used to pressure China to promote domestic consumption and reduce reliance on exports. China's currency policy has been a major topic in discussions, with the U.S. seeking to bring pressure for reform. The United States has been pressuring China to reform its currency policy, seeking to build consensus within the G-7 or engage in talks with other East Asian economies to address exchange rate issues. Proponents argue that other East Asian countries fear their exports would be uncompetitive if they adjust their currency without China. The US could urge the IMF to work with China on economic risks and promote balanced growth. Negotiations should convince China that currency liberalization benefits its long-term interests. The US may consider trade sanctions to pressure China. Some Members support legislation, such as H.R. 1002, that would impose additional tariffs on imports from China unless it appreciates its currency. Proponents argue that threats of sanctions were effective in moving China to reform its currency policy in 2005 and should be used again. Opponents believe that imposing sanctions would violate WTO rules and may backfire by reducing China's willingness to reform its currency. Some proposals aim to impose sanctions on currency policy without violating WTO rules, such as S. 1607. Some critics charge that China's currency policy violates WTO rules. The United States could file a case before the WTO's Dispute Settlement Body against China's currency peg. If the DSB ruled in favor of the United States, it would direct China to modify its currency policy to comply with WTO rules. The advantage of using the WTO is a multilateral approach, although there is no guarantee of a ruling in favor of the United States. The United States could use a Section 301 case to respond to foreign trade barriers, including violations of U.S. rights under a trade agreement. If the U.S. fails to use WTO dispute resolution procedures, China might file a WTO case against the United States. On May 17, 2007, 42 House Members filed a petition with the USTR's office over China's currency practices, seeking a WTO case. The USTR declined the petition in June, citing doubts about winning the case and potential harm. Several bills propose bringing a case against China over its currency policy and modifying WTO rules regarding currency. The United States is urged to work within the WTO to update rules on currency manipulation for trade advantage. U.S. countervailing laws allow relief from subsidized imports, with a recent case against Chinese paper products resulting in countervailing duties. Some Members argue that China's currency policy is an export subsidy that should be addressed under U.S. countervailing laws. Proposed legislation like H.R. 782, H.R. 2942, S. 364, and S. 796 aims to apply countervailing laws to non-market economies and address currency misalignment. Critics raise concerns about the difficulty of determining the subsidy level from China's currency manipulation. Critics argue that China's undervalued currency acts as an export subsidy, impacting U.S. industries. Proposed legislation aims to factor in currency misalignment when determining antidumping duties, but critics question the feasibility of accurately assessing the extent of undervaluation. The undervaluation of China's currency is seen as an export subsidy that affects U.S. industries. Utilizing U.S. trade remedy laws, such as safeguard provisions, could provide temporary relief for domestic firms impacted by increased Chinese exports. The Bush Administration previously invoked special safeguards to restrict textile and apparel imports from China. The Bush Administration previously invoked special safeguards to restrict textile and apparel imports from China. H.R. 782 and S. 796 would require that exchange rate misalignment by China be considered a factor in making determinations of market disruption under the China-specific safeguard. Some analysts argue against pushing China too hard on its currency policy, as it may not serve U.S. economic interests or be effective. Some analysts argue that U.S. policymakers should address China's currency policy as part of a comprehensive trade strategy to accelerate economic reforms and address U.S. complaints. The Administration's policy in SED talks focuses on urging China to boost domestic consumption and make its currency policy more flexible. U.S. trade policy should press China to comply with WTO commitments, including market access, protection of intellectual property rights, and addressing subsidization of state-owned enterprises by China's banking system. The United States aims to leverage China's WTO commitments to push for economic liberalization and market opening, rather than focusing on currency reform. Concerns have been raised about China's large holdings of U.S. federal debt and the potential use of it as a political tool. China's leaders may be more responsive to international pressure than direct U.S. pressure. Chinese officials from leading government think tanks suggested that China could make the dollar collapse by selling off U.S. Treasuries if the U.S. imposed trade sanctions for yuan revaluation. This raised concerns among U.S. policymakers, prompting Senator Grassley to seek clarification from the Chinese government. The Chinese ambassador reassured that China had no plans to drastically adjust its foreign reserves. The People's Bank of China stated that dollar-denominated assets are important in China's foreign exchange reserves, but it is unlikely for China to liquidate a large portion of these assets. Such a move could lead to a sharp appreciation of the yuan against the dollar, causing capital loss for China and impacting the value of its remaining U.S. assets. It could also reduce economic growth in the United States and increase the cost of exports to the U.S. The Chinese government launched the China Investment Corporation (CIC) in 2007 to manage foreign exchange reserves. There are concerns about China diversifying away from dollar-denominated assets, potentially affecting U.S. interest rates. If the yuan appreciates, it could boost U.S. exports. If the yuan appreciates, it could boost U.S. exports and reduce the bilateral trade deficit. The Chinese central bank would stop purchasing U.S. assets, leading to higher interest rates in the United States. This could decrease spending on interest-sensitive purchases and investment, impacting the long-run size of the U.S. economy. A potential drop in the dollar's value, if China stops purchasing assets to influence the exchange rate, could destabilize the U.S. economy. Rising inflation in the U.S. may lead to increased import prices if the yuan appreciates, adding to inflationary pressures. Moving to a floating exchange rate would involve eliminating capital controls, which currently exist in China and are a reason for their opposition to such a change. China's opposition to moving to a floating exchange rate is due to the fear of a large private capital outflow, which could lead to a depreciation of the currency. This could result in a reduction in output for U.S. exporters and an expansion of the U.S. bilateral trade deficit. One possible solution could be for China to float its exchange rate while maintaining capital controls temporarily to prevent currency depreciation from private capital outflows. One option to address China's fear of a private capital outflow and maintain the exchange rate is to maintain the status quo. The central bank could exchange newly printed yuan for U.S. assets, causing prices in China to rise until the real exchange rate aligns with the market rate. This adjustment would decrease the U.S. trade deficit over time, benefiting U.S. exporters and import-competing firms. However, this process would take time, and pressure on the U.S. trade sector would persist in the meantime. China's high saving rate and the US's low saving rate contribute to their trade imbalances. Despite fluctuations in the exchange rate, China's exports to the US are likely to continue growing due to low-cost labor and productivity gains. The appreciation of the yuan has not reduced the trade deficit. Policymakers are concerned about the growing US trade deficit with China. China's currency policy is closely tied to the U.S. trade deficit with China and the decline in U.S. manufacturing jobs. Despite the yuan's slow appreciation since 2005, the trade deficit has not decreased. There is debate over how a further appreciation of the yuan would impact the U.S. economy. The trade deficit with China has not prevented the United States from reaching full employment. It is unclear to what extent production in certain industrial sectors has shifted to China from the United States, as opposed to other low-wage countries. Foreign multilateral corporations' involvement in China's exports complicates the issue of who benefits from China's trade. The effects of an appreciating yuan can be seen in the context of concerns about the falling dollar. There is debate over policy options to promote U.S. economic interests, as changes could have winners and losers in both the U.S. and China. Chinese officials plan to make the currency more flexible in the near term and eventually adopt a floating currency. They argue for gradual reforms to avoid disruptions to the economy. China's currency policy may be undermining efforts to reform the banking system and reduce non-performing loans by expanding the money supply. This could lead to easy credit policies and more non-performing loans, as government directives rather than market forces limit bank loans. The policy also acts as a subsidy for some export industries but undermines others and prevents the establishment of a market-based financial system. China's currency policy, while benefiting some export industries, undermines others and hinders efficient resource distribution in the economy. U.S. officials believe China's exchange rate reforms are too cautious and are preventing adjustments in global trade imbalances, particularly with the United States. Both countries agree on the need for major economic reforms, with China focusing on boosting domestic consumption and the U.S. on increasing domestic saving. China aims to enhance economic development in rural areas and increase spending on social security, healthcare, and education, but this will likely take many years. The 110th Congress is considering legislation on China's currency policy, including bills that would require the Treasury Department to determine if China has manipulated its currency and impose tariffs accordingly. Another bill would apply U.S. countervailing laws to products imported from non-market economies like China. The bills propose measures to address China's currency manipulation, including imposing tariffs on Chinese goods and applying countervailing laws to products from non-market economies like China. H.R. 2942 and S. 364 propose applying countervailing laws to nonmarket economies like China and making currency manipulation a factor in determining antidumping and countervailing duties. S. 1607 would require the Treasury Department to identify fundamentally misaligned currencies and take action if consultations fail to resolve currency issues. The U.S. would impose penalties on countries that fail to address currency manipulation, including antidumping duties, procurement bans, and financing restrictions. The Treasury Department would identify manipulative countries and take action, potentially filing cases in the WTO. The bill was approved by the Senate Finance Committee. The bill approved by the Senate Banking Committee on August 1, 2007, gives Treasury the authority to file a case in the WTO. S. 2813 (Bunning) requires the Treasury Department to identify currency manipulators, submit an action plan, and consult with the IMF. Several bills in the 109th Congress addressed foreign exchange rate policies, including S.Amdt. 309 (Schumer) imposing a tariff on Chinese goods for currency manipulation. The Senate leadership agreed to allow a vote on S. 295 (similar to S.Amdt. 309) by July 27, 2005, with the condition that no similar amendments would be sponsored during the 109th Congress. Senator Schumer and others delayed consideration of the bill in June 2005 after being briefed on China's currency reforms. Schumer later pushed for the bill's consideration in November 2005, but it was delayed again in March 2006 based on their assessment of China's seriousness about the issue. Senator Schumer expressed disappointment with China's lack of progress on currency flexibility and called for Senate action on S. 295. However, after persuasion from President Bush, Schumer and Senator Graham agreed to delay the vote to give Secretary of Treasury Paulson more time to negotiate with China. H.R. 3283 aimed to address currency manipulation by non-market economies like China and passed in July 2005. The bill passed (255 to 168) on July 27, 2005. A similar bill was introduced in the Senate, S. 1421 (Collins)."
