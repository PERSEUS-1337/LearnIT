    "content": "Ammonium perchlorate is a key ingredient in solid fuel for rockets and missiles, while other perchlorate salts are used in various products. Concerns about the health effects of perchlorate exposure have led to states setting their own drinking water standards, such as Massachusetts at 2 ppb and California at 6 ppb. Multiple states have issued health goals or advisory levels for perchlorate in water. Perchlorate contamination has been found near weapons and rocket fuel manufacturing facilities, military bases, and other sources such as fireworks and construction sites. It can also occur naturally and in organic fertilizer. Detected in drinking water primarily in the Southwest and scattered locations across the country, with groundwater being the most affected. EPA required monitoring for perchlorate in public water systems in 1999. The EPA mandated monitoring for perchlorate in public water systems to assess its presence and levels nationwide. Out of 3,865 systems tested, 4.1% had perchlorate levels exceeding 4 \u00b5g/L, with 14 systems surpassing the EPA's remediation goal. California had 58 systems with elevated levels. Approximately 1.9% of samples collected showed perchlorate detections at 4 \u00b5g/L or higher, with an average concentration of 9.85 \u00b5g/L. California implemented more extensive monitoring efforts. Since 2002, perchlorate has been detected in 241 sources of drinking water in California. EPA found contamination at 65 DOD facilities, 7 federal facilities, and 37 private sites in 2005. Perchlorate was detected at 395 sites overall. FDA tested 500 food samples in 2004, finding perchlorate in 90% of lettuce samples and 101 of 104 bottled milk samples. The FDA began testing all samples in its Total Diet Study in 2005 and found perchlorate in 625 of 1065 samples, with higher levels in some foods like shrimp, tomatoes, spinach, and bacon. Children aged 2 years old had the highest perchlorate intake per kilogram body weight per day. EPA considers non-water exposures when setting standards for contaminants like perchlorate, which is not known to cause cancer. Perchlorate is a contaminant that disrupts iodine uptake in the thyroid, leading to health effects similar to iodine deficiency. It can impair thyroid function in pregnant women, affecting fetal development and learning capacity. Studies show that even low levels of perchlorate can impact thyroid hormone levels, especially in women with iodine deficiency. Perchlorate affects thyroid hormone levels in women with iodine deficiency. EPA evaluates perchlorate for drinking water standards under the Safe Drinking Water Act. In 1997, perchlorate detection methods improved, leading to increased scientific information. EPA listed perchlorate as a contaminant in 1998. In 1998, EPA placed perchlorate on the list of contaminants for potential regulation but deemed information insufficient for a regulatory decision. Further research on health effects and treatment technologies was prioritized, with water systems required to monitor perchlorate levels. By January 2007, EPA had enough occurrence data and determined no further monitoring was necessary for regulatory decisions. EPA had issued draft reference doses for perchlorate exposure in 1992 and 1995. The EPA uses Reference Doses (RfDs) to estimate safe daily oral exposure levels for contaminants like perchlorate. Factors like sensitive populations, study duration, and data gaps are considered in setting RfDs. The draft RfDs for perchlorate range from 0.0001 to 0.0005 mg/kg/day, equivalent to 4-18 ppb in drinking water. The EPA also considers costs, monitoring capabilities, and other sources of exposure when setting drinking water standards. In 1999, the EPA set a human risk benchmark for perchlorate at 0.0009 mg/kg/day, equivalent to 32 ppb in drinking water. In 2002, EPA prepared a draft risk assessment for perchlorate, identifying potential health risks including effects on the nervous system and thyroid tumors based on rat studies. The draft RfD was 0.00003 mg/kg per day, equivalent to a drinking water level of 1 ppb, sparking controversy over cleanup costs and science policy concerns. In 2002, an interagency working group including DOD, EPA, and other agencies convened to discuss perchlorate risk assessment and regulatory issues. The group asked the National Research Council to review the available science to resolve uncertainty over perchlorate's health effects and the draft risk assessment. The National Research Council (NRC) was asked by an interagency working group to review the science on perchlorate and EPA's draft assessment. The NRC committee found limitations in using rat studies to assess human health risks from perchlorate exposure, noting humans have mechanisms to compensate for iodide deficiency and thyroid disorders. They also identified flaws in the design and methods of the rat studies. The NRC found flaws in the design and methods of the rat studies, concluding that the animal data selected by EPA should not be used for risk assessment. The committee disagreed with EPA's risk assessment model for perchlorate toxicity, particularly regarding changes in thyroid hormone production. They recommended using nonadverse effects to assess perchlorate's potential effects. The committee recommended using nonadverse effects, specifically the inhibition of iodide uptake by the thyroid in humans, as the basis for the risk assessment of perchlorate. This led to an RfD of 0.0007 mg/kg per day to protect the most sensitive population, such as fetuses of pregnant women with hypothyroidism or iodide deficiency. The recommendation was supported by various studies. The NRC recommended a reference dose of 0.0007 mg/kg per day for perchlorate based on various studies, with EPA adopting this dose in 2005. The recommended drinking water equivalent level is 24.5 ppb, intended to protect pregnant women and fetuses with thyroid conditions. EPA assumed all exposure would come from drinking water when setting the DWEL. In 2006, EPA's Superfund office adopted the NRC reference dose of 24.5 ppb as the preliminary remediation goal for perchlorate cleanup. The Children's Health Protection Advisory Committee raised concerns that the PRG did not protect infants, who could be exposed through breast milk. They recommended lowering the PRG and developing a standard for perchlorate in drinking water. The Superfund office lowered the PRG for perchlorate cleanup and the Office of Water was tasked with developing a standard for perchlorate in drinking water. In October 2008, EPA announced a preliminary decision not to regulate perchlorate due to low occurrence in water systems. EPA's Science Advisory Board argued that EPA must have a compelling basis to support this decision, given perchlorate's toxicity and occurrence. EPA announced it would seek further advice from the NRC before setting a drinking water standard for perchlorate. The agency replaced the preliminary remediation goal with an interim health advisory of 15 ppb, based on NRC's recommendation to protect fetuses of pregnant women. This advisory level considers exposures from food and water. The EPA considered exposures from food and water when evaluating perchlorate's health effects, but did not address concerns about nursing infants being more exposed than fetuses. The agency decided not to ask the NRC for further review on perchlorate issues to avoid delaying regulatory decisions. Instead, EPA announced a reevaluation of perchlorate's health effects, focusing on infants and young children. EPA published a Supplemental Request for Comments seeking public input on analyzing data for perchlorate regulation. The agency is reevaluating exposure to sensitive life stages and may decide to regulate perchlorate. The DOD has spent over $114 million on research and cleanup efforts for perchlorate contamination. Cleanup efforts are typically driven by drinking water standards, but outside of California and Massachusetts, where standards are set, goals and responsibilities are unclear. In 2006, the EPA established a DWEL for perchlorate, prompting DOD to set 24 ppb as the level of concern for managing perchlorate releases. The DOD policy on managing perchlorate releases directs testing when a release is expected. If levels exceed 24 ppb, a risk assessment is required, and sites prioritized for management if adverse health effects are possible. EPA recommends using a 15 ppb health advisory level for cleanup, which DOD may adopt. Legislation in Congress addresses perchlorate management. Legislation in the 111th Congress addresses perchlorate regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act. H.R. 3206 requires EPA to propose a drinking water regulation for perchlorate within 12 months and finalize it within 18 months. Funding has been allocated for perchlorate contamination remediation, including $1.6 million for cleanup of drinking water wells and $3.5 million for Inland Empire perchlorate remediation. H.R. 2316 and H.R. 4252, titled the Inland Empire Perchlorate Ground Water Plume Assessment Act of 2009, direct the Secretary of the Interior to conduct studies on water resources in California, specifically the Rialto-Colton Basin. The studies include surveying ground water resources, focusing on perchlorate concentrations. H.R. 4252 was passed by the House and ordered reported by the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. Additionally, H.R. 102 authorizes appropriations for the San Gabriel Basin Restoration Fund with a non-federal matching requirement for water districts. During the 110th Congress, perchlorate bills were considered but not enacted. S. 24 was introduced to require water systems to test for perchlorate and disclose it in consumer reports. S. 150 and H.R. 1747 aimed to set a standard for perchlorate. S. 24 and S. 150 were reported by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. H.Con.Res. 347 urged the CDC and FDA to educate the public on iodine intake for protection against perchlorate exposure."
