    "content": "The proposed solution for evaluating mathematical expressions involves a Lego bricks style architecture where small neural networks are trained independently to perform specific operations. Eight fundamental operations are identified and learned using feed forward neural networks, which can be reused to design more complex networks for tasks like n-digit multiplication and division. The proposed solution involves using small neural networks trained independently for specific operations like n-digit multiplication and division. This approach allows for reusability and generalization for computations involving up to 7 digit numbers, including both positive and negative numbers. The success of Artificial Neural Networks lies in their ability to learn and develop internal structures appropriate for tasks, but many ANNs lack generalization and performance degrades on unseen data. The learning process in neural networks is primarily based on memorization, lacking quantitative reasoning and systematic abstraction. In contrast, other living species, like children, demonstrate numerical extrapolation and quantitative reasoning as fundamental capabilities, enabling them to generalize and understand higher digit arithmetic operations. The key to generalization in neural networks lies in understanding and reusing memorized information. By identifying and learning fundamental operations, complex numerical extrapolation and quantitative reasoning can be developed. Fundamental operations like addition, subtraction, and multiplication are learned using simple neural networks, which are then reused to solve more complex arithmetic problems. This work proposes a neural network solution for arithmetic operations like n-digit multiplication and division, including both positive and negative numbers. Unlike previous methods, this solution aims to generalize over unseen data, making the network architecture complex. Previous works have focused on approximating mathematical functions and simple arithmetic operations, but the ability to generalize remains a challenge. Recent works such as Resnet, highway networks, and dense networks have aimed to train networks to generalize over minimal training data. EqnMaster uses generative recurrent networks for arithmetic functions but struggles with generalization. The Neural Arithmetic Logic Unit (NALU) uses linear activations and gate operations to predict arithmetic function outputs, highlighting extrapolation challenges in end-to-end learning tasks. Issues in end-to-end learning tasks persist, with simple Feed Forward Networks unable to efficiently solve arithmetic expressions like multiplication. Optimal Depth Networks using binary logic gates offer a deterministic approach for arithmetic functions, inspired by digital circuits. Research on Digital Sequential Circuits and Simulation of Digital Circuits further explores this concept. Binary Multiplier Neural Networks serve as a foundation for designing neural networks to tackle arithmetic problems. We propose a network that can predict the output of arithmetic functions for both positive and negative decimal integers using multiple smaller networks for different sub tasks. This approach allows for complex arithmetic operations like signed multiplication and division. Our proposed network can predict arithmetic functions for positive and negative decimal integers using smaller networks for different sub tasks. We also introduce a loop unrolling strategy to generalize solutions from 1-digit to n-digit arithmetic operations, such as multiplication and division. Digital circuits implement these operations accurately and can be easily scaled. Previous work has shown neural networks can simulate digital circuits, inspiring our analysis of n-digit multiplication involving 1-digit operations and place value shifting. Division requires subtraction in addition to other operations. The text discusses the design of neural networks for performing fundamental arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It highlights the use of neural networks for complex functions and the basic function of a neuron network as a sum transform. The addition module is implemented using a single neuron. The addition and subtraction modules in the neural network are implemented using single neurons with specific weights. These modules facilitate shift-and-add multiplication by multiplying digits of the multiplier with digits of the multiplicand. The output is then adjusted using a place value shifter and combined to obtain the final result. The modules use fixed weights in the power of 10 for each digit. The proposed feed forward network for single digit multiplication has two input neurons, 1 hidden layer with 30 neurons, and an output layer of 82 neurons. The network computes the absolute value of a single number using a neural network with 2 hidden layers. The process involves addition, subtraction, and maxpooling operations to produce the final output. The maxpool layer involves extracting the sign of an input number using an activation function. The output sign calculator computes the sign of the result from multiplication or division. The process is modeled as a neural network with 2 hidden layers. The network takes sign and magnitude as input and has a soft-sign activation in the output layer. The module assigns a sign to the output of complex operations like multiplication and division. It involves converting numbers to positive integers, performing multiplication using single digit operations, and calculating the sign of the resulting output value. The multiplication operation involves multiplying each token of the multiplicand with the 1st token of the multiplier, adding the results with carry forward, and combining them to form a single number. This process repeats for each token of the multiplier. The final output is assigned a sign using 1-digit sign multiply. The division model separates sign and magnitude during pre-processing, inspired by the long division model. The architecture for division model is inspired by long division, where n-digit divisor is multiplied with single digit multipliers and subtracted from selected n-digit chunk of dividend. The smallest non-negative integer is selected from the outputs using additional layers. The quotient is combined over iterations and the remainder is knitted to the next digit in the divisor. The division model is based on digital circuitry for decimal digits. The division architecture proposed in this paper only implements addition, subtraction, and multiplication. Comparison is made with signed arithmetic operations using Neural Arithmetic and Logic Unit (NALU) implementation. Testing is done on a dataset ranging from 0 to 30 uniform numbers, including negative integers. Results show that the model outperforms recurrent and discriminative networks. The division architecture proposed in the paper implements addition, subtraction, and multiplication. Results show 100% accuracy within the testing range of the dataset. Comparison is made with Neural Arithmetic and Logic Unit (NALU) for arithmetic operations on positive integers. NALU fails drastically outside the range of 10-20. In this paper, the authors propose using smaller neural networks to solve complex tasks by breaking them down into fundamental operations like addition and multiplication. These smaller networks are then combined to tackle more difficult problems like n-digit multiplication and division. One limitation is the use of float operations in the tokenizer, which hinders end-to-end training. The proposed work involves using smaller neural networks for complex tasks by breaking them down into fundamental operations. The use of float operations in the tokenizer limits end-to-end training, but this does not hinder the current work as smaller pre-trained networks are used. A cross product network has been designed and is being tested for accuracy. Future work includes developing a point cloud segmentation algorithm using a larger number of identical smaller networks."
