Reduction of FICA rates through Personal Social Security Savings Program. Employee Contribution: The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to reduce the tax rate on employees for Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance. The reduction in tax rate applies in years following a reduction year where the OASDI rate ratio exceeds 125 percent. The Social Security Personal Savings Guarantee and Prosperity Act of 2004 defines the reduction percentage as the difference between the rate in effect for the reduction year and the rate needed for the OASDI rate ratio to be 125 percent. The OASDI rate ratio is the ratio for any calendar year. The OASDI rate ratio for any calendar year is the combined balance in the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund, divided by the amount paid from the Trust Funds for authorized purposes, with a limitation on reduction. The OASDI rate ratio is calculated based on the combined balance in the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund, with a limitation on tax reduction to ensure a minimum tax rate of 4.95 percent. Employer contributions may be reduced in subsequent years following a reduction year, as defined by section 3101(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The tax rate under subsection (a) cannot be reduced below 4.95 percent. Section 1401 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 allows for a reduction in the tax rate imposed under subsection (a) in subsequent years following a reduction year, as defined by section 3101(d).
