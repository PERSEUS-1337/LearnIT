    "content": "The House and Senate passed the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, containing provisions affecting military personnel. A conference committee resolved differences between the versions, and the final bill was signed into law on December 23, 2016. The report highlights selected personnel-related issues of high congressional and constituent interest. It provides contact information for CRS analysts and references related CRS products for more detailed background information. The authorized active duty end-strengths for FY2001 are also discussed. The September 11 terrorist attacks led to changes in military personnel strength, with increases for the Army and Marine Corps due to wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. However, recent years have seen decreases in end-strengths for the Air Force and Navy. The FY2017 budget proposed lowering end-strengths for all services, with the House bill approving higher numbers than the Administration's request. The House bill approved higher end-strengths for the Army, Marine Corps, and Air Force compared to the Administration's request. The Navy's end-strength was reduced in the House provision but still higher than the Administration's request. The final bill set the minimum end-strengths at a level equal to the authorized end-strengths for FY2017. The overall authorized end-strength of the Selected Reserves has declined by about 6% over the past 15 years. The Administration requested a reduction in authorized Selected Reserves end-strength for four of the seven reserve components for FY2017. The House bill approved higher end-strengths for the Army, Marine Corps, and Air Force compared to the Administration's request. The Army National Guard's end-strength was increased to 350,000 and the Army Reserve's end-strength to 205,000. Concerns about military personnel costs and recruiting high-quality personnel have led to a focus on the military pay raise. The annual increase in basic pay is indexed to the Employment Cost Index, with a 2.1% increase for 2017 unless Congress passes a law to change it. The increase in basic pay for 2017 will be 2.1% unless Congress passes a law or the President specifies an alternative adjustment. Pay raises are typically effective at the start of the calendar year. In the past three years, the President set pay raises below the ECI using alternative pay adjustment authority. The FY2017 President's Budget requested a 1.6% military pay raise, lower than the statutory formula of 2.1%. The House bill aimed for a 2.1% pay raise for all servicemembers, while the Senate bill waived the automatic adjustment to basic pay. The enacted bill waived the automatic adjustment to basic pay specified in 37 U.S.C. \u00a71009 and provided a 2.1% increase, effective January 1, 2017. Reference(s): For more information on military pay raise process, see CRS In Focus IF10260, Defense Primer: Military Pay Raise. The Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) is determined by paygrade, geographic location, and dependency status of servicemembers. The Senate bill proposed changes to calculate BAH based only on paygrade and location, removing dependents as a factor. The Senate bill proposed changes to the Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) by basing it on actual servicemember housing expenditures up to a maximum amount for a given location/paygrade, and adjusting it for servicemembers who share living quarters. The new formula would apply to certain members of the Armed Forces starting January 1, 2018. The Senate bill proposed changes to the Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) by basing it on actual servicemember housing expenditures up to a maximum amount for a given location/paygrade, and adjusting it for servicemembers who share living quarters. Starting January 1, 2018, certain reserve and retired personnel ordered to active duty, and servicemembers entitled to BAH on December 31, 2017, would be affected if they lose eligibility for BAH in a specific housing or overseas area. The enacted bill requires DOD to report on transitioning to a new pay structure by March 1, 2017. The conference report discussed the evolution of Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) as a housing benefit for servicemembers in high-cost areas, emphasizing its tax-free nature and differentiation based on dependency status. The conference report discussed the evolution of Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) as a housing benefit for servicemembers in high-cost areas, emphasizing its tax-free nature and differentiation based on dependency status. The conferees direct the Secretary of Defense to plan for a transition to a salary system aligning the payment of BAH with compensation rather than its intended purpose as an allowance. This is in reference to the military retirement system and changes made in the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2016. The military retirement system will be modernized by reducing the retired pay multiplier, adding a 401k-type defined contribution element, allowing for a partial lump-sum payment of retired pay, and adding continuation pay as a retention incentive. These changes will take effect on January 1, 2018, for servicemembers entering on or after that date and those with 12 years or less of service on that date who choose to enroll in the new system. Concerns have been raised about the services' ability to retain certain occupational specialties at the mid-career point due to reductions in the retired pay multiplier from 2.5% to 2.0% for those joining on or after January 1, 2018. The FY2016 NDAA authorized DOD to provide continuation pay as a retention incentive at the mid-career point, allowing flexibility to pay between 8 to 12 years of service in return for an additional 3-year commitment. This provision aims to manage personnel through targeted continuation pay based on retention trends for specific military specialties. Additionally, Section 633 of the bill amends procedures for calculating continuation pay minimums for active and reserve component members. The Senate bill includes provisions for continuation pay for reserve component members on active duty, a recommendation for default contributions to the TSP to be to a Roth plan, and an amendment allowing certain individuals in inactive duty status prior to January 1, 2018 to receive benefits. Cadets, midshipmen, and reservists in inactive duty status before January 1, 2018, have a 30-day election period for the new retirement system after commissioning or transfer to active duty. Military servicemembers can receive retired pay after 20 qualifying years of service. Congress enacted the Uniformed Services Former Spouses' Protection Act in 1982. The Uniformed Services Former Spouses' Protection Act (USFSPA) allows state courts to divide disposable military retired pay in divorce cases and provides benefits to former spouses. Currently, up to 50% of a servicemember's retired pay can be divided in a divorce. Proposed changes would base the division on pay grade and years of service at the time of the divorce court order. The enacted bill authorizes this change and includes cost-of-living adjustments for spousal support. The Uniformed Services Former Spouses' Protection Act allows state courts to divide disposable military retired pay in divorce cases. Proposed changes would base the division on pay grade and years of service at the time of the divorce court order, with cost-of-living adjustments included for spousal support. This provision does not affect divorce settlements prior to the enactment date. The Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) provides a payment to surviving spouses of servicemembers who have passed away. The payment is usually 55% of the retired basic pay the member would have received. Previously, those who died on active duty received 75% of their basic pay. Reservists who died during inactive-duty training receive a lower payment based on their years of service. Surviving spouses receiving both SBP and Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) have their SBP payments reduced by the amount of DIC, offset by the Special Survivor Indemnity Allowance (SSIA). Sections 642, 643, 646, and 648 address these issues. The enacted bill includes provisions from H.R. 4909 and S. 2943, amending the Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) for reserve and active component members. It allows DOD to withhold SBP payments from Combat Related Special Compensation (CRSC) and extends authority to pay SSIA until May 31, 2018. The bill extends the authority to pay SSIA until May 31, 2018, and requires a report on affected individuals within 90 days. Nearly 65,000 surviving spouses are estimated to receive SSIA in FY2018. The Defense Secretary must conduct an independent assessment of the SBP and submit a report with recommendations to the House and Senate Armed Services Committees. The report will evaluate the effectiveness of the SBP for survivors of servicemembers, compare benefits with other sectors, and explore alternative survivor benefit options. TRICARE is a health benefits program for active duty servicemembers, retirees, and their families. The FY2017 Budget proposed changes to TRICARE, including new enrollment fees and benefit structures. The program would replace TRICARE Prime, Standard, and Extra options with TRICARE Select and TRICARE Preferred options. The FY2017 Budget proposed changes to TRICARE, including new enrollment fees, benefit structures, and increased pharmacy co-pays for retirees and military family members. The proposal aims to reduce TRICARE for Life expenditures by implementing annual enrollment fees for Medicare-enrolled retirees and increasing pharmacy co-pays. The FY2017 Budget proposed changes to TRICARE, including new enrollment fees, benefit structures, and increased pharmacy co-pays for retirees and military family members. The contribution to be paid into the MERHCF by each uniformed service will be $4,252 per active duty servicemember and $1,723 per reserve component member. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that TRICARE proposals would save DOD money through pharmacy co-payment increases and a new TRICARE for Life enrollment fee, while increasing Medicare spending. Section 701 of the enacted bill will establish a new TRICARE Select health plan option and modify the existing TRICARE Prime plan. The proposed changes to TRICARE include establishing tables for enrollment fees, deductibles, and co-payments for retirees joining TRICARE after January 1, 2018. It also requires the Secretary to establish an open enrollment period and limit pre-authorization requirements for referrals under TRICARE Prime. Additionally, a pilot program is required, and an implementation plan must be submitted by June 1, 2017. The Administration proposed changes to TRICARE in its FY2017 budget request, including replacing current health plan options with a consolidated plan, increasing pharmaceutical co-pays, and establishing a new enrollment fee for future TRICARE-for-Life enrollees. The House-passed bill aimed to consolidate TRICARE Standard and Extra into a new TRICARE Preferred plan, while the Senate-passed bill proposed a new TRICARE Choice plan. The enacted bill amends Chapter 55 of Title 10 to specify cost-sharing amounts for active-duty family members and retirees under TRICARE Select and TRICARE Prime. Cost-sharing amounts will be indexed annually to retirement pay increases, with exceptions for disability retirees. TRICARE for Life beneficiaries will not see changes in cost-sharing. A new category for TRICARE Reserve Select and TRICARE Young Adult Program beneficiaries will be created, with premiums calculated as before but with new cost-sharing table provisions applied. Retired TRICARE beneficiaries eligible before 2018 will face a $150 individual or $300 family annual enrollment fee 90 days after a report is submitted to Congress. The report will assess changes in healthcare coverage, appointment access, provider acceptance, and TRICARE Select satisfaction. TRICARE Prime beneficiaries without a referral must get a waiver or pay 50% of the allowed charge. TRICARE Prime beneficiaries without a referral must get a waiver or pay 50% of the allowed charge for outpatient prescriptions filled through military pharmacies, TRICARE mail-order pharmacy, or TRICARE retail network and non-network pharmacies. Active duty servicemembers have no pharmacy co-payments when using military pharmacies, TRICARE Pharmacy Home Delivery, or TRICARE retail network pharmacies. Military pharmacies provide. The 2016 NDAA allowed a one-time $3 increase to pharmacy co-pays and required maintenance drug prescriptions to be filled through mail order or military pharmacies. The Administration's FY2017 budget proposed annual co-payment increases for fiscal years 2017 through 2025, estimated to save $300 million in FY2017. The House-passed bill did not include a provision for a pharmacy co-payment increase. Section 702 of the Senate-passed bill would have allowed beneficiaries to continue receiving drugs at no cost in military medical treatment facilities. No changes would be made to cost-sharing amounts for survivors of members who died on active duty or for disabled retirees and their family members. Section 702 of the Senate-passed bill would have authorized the Secretary of Defense to exclude drugs with little value from coverage and give preferential status to non-generic drugs on the TRICARE formulary. This could have reduced DOD's pharmacy costs by $640 million over 2017-2021 and decreased health care spending for TRICARE for Life beneficiaries by $2.7 billion over 2017-2026. The Senate-passed bill's Section 702 aimed to reduce DOD's pharmacy costs by $640 million over 2017-2021 and lower health care spending for TRICARE for Life beneficiaries by $2.7 billion over 2017-2026. CBO estimated a $1.5 billion reduction in accrual payments into the MERHCF for implementing Section 702. The Defense Health Agency (DHA) was established in 2013 to support Armed Forces medical services, manage shared services, and oversee the TRICARE program. It acts as the market manager for the National Capital Region Multi-Service Market and aims to improve operational medical force readiness and lower management costs. The Defense Health Agency was established in 2013 to support Armed Forces medical services, manage shared services, and oversee the TRICARE program. A streamlined military health system management structure is needed to improve care, lower costs, and drive innovation. The current organizational structure hinders rapid decision-making and stifles innovation. Sections 702 and 703 of the conference bill aim to combine provisions for true reform of the military health system. Section 702 of the enacted bill assigns the Director of the Defense Health Agency responsibility for the administration of Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) starting October 1, 2018. This includes budget, information technology, healthcare management, policy, military medical construction, and other relevant matters. The section also establishes a professional staff within the Defense Health Agency to oversee MTF administration and codifies the roles of the services' Surgeons General as principal advisors to the Secretary on health and medical issues. Section 702 of the enacted bill assigns the Director of the Defense Health Agency responsibility for the administration of Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) starting October 1, 2018. This includes budget, information technology, healthcare management, policy, military medical construction, and other relevant matters. The section also establishes a professional staff within the Defense Health Agency to oversee MTF administration and codifies the roles of the services' Surgeons General as principal advisors to the Secretary on health and medical issues. Additionally, Section 703 adds a new Section 1073d to Title 10 of the United States Code, requiring the Secretary of Defense to maintain medical facilities to support the medical readiness of the armed forces. The provision in the enacted bill assigns the Director of the Defense Health Agency responsibility for Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) administration, including budget, IT, healthcare management, and policy. It also establishes a professional staff within the Defense Health Agency to oversee MTF administration and codifies the roles of the services' Surgeons General as principal advisors to the Secretary on health and medical issues. Additionally, a new Section 1073d to Title 10 of the United States Code requires the Secretary of Defense to maintain medical facilities to support the medical readiness of the armed forces and covered beneficiaries. The current law for reserve component enlistees requires citizenship or lawful permanent residency, with a waiver possible for national interest. The Senate bill aimed to align reserve component enlistment requirements with active component requirements but was not included in the conference bill. Secretary of Defense announced new policies for maternity and parental leave. Carter announced new policies for maternity and parental leave in the DOD, extending maternity leave to 12 weeks and seeking legislative action to extend parental leave to 14 days. Parental leave for servicemembers was first authorized in 2009 and is currently for a maximum of 10 days. Adopting servicemembers are eligible for up to 21 days of leave since 2006. The enacted bill allows up to 12 weeks of total leave for the primary caregiver in connection with the birth of a child and 6 weeks for adoption. Secondary caregivers could receive up to 21 days of leave. The Secretary of Defense will define \"primary\" and \"secondary\" caregivers. Leave must be taken within a year of the event and in one increment. Eligibility is for active or reserve component members. The enacted bill allows up to 12 weeks of total leave for the primary caregiver in connection with the birth of a child and 6 weeks for adoption, with secondary caregivers eligible for up to 21 days of leave. The individual must be a member of the active component or a reserve component performing active Guard and Reserve duty or subject to an active duty recall or mobilization order in excess of 12 months. The Secretary of Defense may prescribe regulations requiring a servicemember to extend their service obligation or incur a reduction in existing leave when taking parental leave. Section 521 of the final bill explicitly prohibits any leave from being awarded to military servicemembers outside of what is authorized by statute. Supporters of paid parental leave argue that it enhances recruitment and retention in the military by making benefits more competitive with the private sector. However, opponents fear that extending maternity and parental leave could harm military readiness. Congress has shown interest in improving the Defense Commissary system, but no changes have been made yet. In FY2016, $1.4 billion was authorized for commissary funding. In FY2016, Congress authorized $1.4 billion in commissary funding, $100 million more than the President's budget request. The President's FY2017 budget proposed $1.2 billion for commissaries, a reduction of $200 million in subsidies for stateside commissaries from FY2016. Authorized patrons include active duty military members, retired personnel and their families, disabled veterans, Medal of Honor recipients, and DOD civilians stationed overseas. The FY2016 NDAA required the Secretary of Defense to submit a report for budget neutrality for DeCA and the military exchange system. The DOD released a report on June 7, 2016, acknowledging that privatization would not replicate the benefits of DeCA while achieving budget neutrality. Critics argue for further evaluation before initiating a pilot program. A subsequent assessment on November 9, 2016, highlighted the lack of a plan to achieve budget neutrality by October 2018. The DOD report on privatization of commissaries and exchanges addressed three of the seven mandated benchmarks but lacked specific metrics for each benchmark. The report also partially discussed four other mandated elements. A pending report on the Commissary Surcharge, Non-appropriated Fund, and Privately-Financed Major Construction Program is required by Section 652 of the FY2016 NDAA. The pending report from the Department of Defense discusses reforms to the commissary system, including allowing DeCA to set prices based on market conditions and accepting the Military Star Card. These reforms aim to maintain benefits while ensuring savings for patrons and support for morale, welfare, and recreational activities. Congressional oversight, common business practices, and private sector initiatives like variable pricing are also part of the proposed changes. The Department of Defense is considering reforms to the commissary system, including allowing DeCA to set prices based on market conditions and accepting the Military Star Card. This would involve the development of private label products and a variable pricing program to offset operating costs. The estimated decrease in direct spending over the next decade is less than $500,000. Additionally, DOD is required to develop a strategy to optimize practices across DeCA and the military exchange network to reduce reliance on appropriated funds without compromising patron benefits or revenue. The Department of Defense is considering reforms to the commissary system, including allowing DeCA to set prices based on market conditions and accepting the Military Star Card. If established benchmarks are met, DOD may convert the commissary agency to a non-appropriated fund entity, ensuring no loss in pay for employees. The Defense Secretary could also contract with grocery industry experts to improve the commissary system. Section 662 of the conference report authorizes acceptance of the Military Star Card at commissary stores. The Department of Defense is considering reforms to the commissary system, including allowing DeCA to set prices based on market conditions and accepting the Military Star Card as a form of payment for goods and services at commissary stores. In the past few decades, Congress has supported servicemembers and veterans with off-duty education, credentialing programs, and transition services. Key programs include the Transition Assistance Program (TAP), Credentialing Opportunities Online (COOL), and the DOD Skillbridge program. Section 561 of a bill eliminates the accreditation requirement for credentialing programs, replacing it with quality assurance benchmarks. Section 561 of the Senate bill eliminates accreditation requirement for credentialing programs, replacing it with quality assurance benchmarks. Sections 567 and 568 require DOD reports on transition initiatives for servicemembers to obtain merchant mariner licenses, assess college credit for military skills, and evaluate JTEST-AI program usage. Section 3590 sets deadlines for TWIC applications for separating military servicemembers. Section 564 mandates DOD to provide TWIC information and applications to separating servicemembers as part of TAP. Sections 562 and 563 require DOD to notify about recoupment of separation. Section 566 of the House bill, which would have authorized DOD to carry out a pilot program to provide job placement/employment services directly to reserve component members, was not adopted. The military hierarchy in the DOD includes the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, chiefs of the military services, and combatant commanders. General and admiral ranks are the highest, followed by lieutenant general, vice admiral, major general, and rear admiral. The number of general and flag officers in each grade is limited by law, with Congress periodically reviewing and revising their roles and compensation. Congress considered a bill to limit the rank of service and functional component commanders under combatant commanders to no higher than lieutenant general. The bill considered by Congress aimed to limit the rank of service and functional component commanders under combatant commanders to no higher than lieutenant general or vice admiral. It also proposed reducing the total number of active duty generals and admirals by 5 and establishing a new unified combatant command for cyber operations led by an admiral or general. Additionally, the bill would have reduced the number of authorized active and reserve general and flag officers by 25%, with a heavier reduction towards higher-ranking officers. The Senate bill aimed to reduce the total number of active duty generals and admirals by 5 and establish a new unified combatant command for cyber operations. It also required the Secretary of Defense to decrease the number of general and flag officers by 110 by December 31, 2022, representing an 11% reduction in authorized positions. The reduction in GFO personnel will be smaller than the reduction in positions. Authorized positions will be reduced for Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps, with an increase for the Marine Corps. The joint pool will see a significant reduction. The Secretary of Defense can adjust these reductions for national security, with notification to the House and Senate Armed Services Committees. Reporting requirements and a global manpower study are also included, with an additional 10% reduction in GFO positions. The study results on the reduction of authorized GFO positions, including an additional 10% reduction, are to be submitted to the House and Senate Armed Services Committees by April 1, 2017. This is in accordance with Chapter 38 of Title 10 U.S.C. which manages active duty officers trained in joint matters. The current qualification requirements for joint officers have sparked debate on whether they lead to officers with the right mix of service and joint experiences. Joint matters encompass unified action by integrated military forces across different domains like land, sea, air, space, and information environment. Becoming a joint qualified officer requires completing specific joint professional training. To become a joint qualified officer, individuals must complete specific joint professional military education requirements and a two-year joint duty assignment. The House and Senate bills aimed to standardize the length of joint duty assignments at two years for all officers to better capture the breadth of duties and positions that comprise joint matters experience. The bills aimed to standardize joint duty assignments at two years to encompass a wide range of joint matters experience. The enacted bill modified the definition of joint matters and joint duty assignments for military officers. The Military Selective Service Act (MSSA) under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7668 requires most males between 18 and 26 in the U.S. to register with Selective Service for potential induction into the Armed Forces. Women are not required to register. Failure to register may result in criminal penalties and loss of eligibility. Recent DOD policy changes have raised questions about the Selective Service registration exemption for women. Some believe women should now register, while others question the need for the registration requirement. A Senate bill proposed expanding registration to women turning 18 after January 1, 2018, but this provision was not included in the final bill. The final bill requires DOD to review the Selective Service System and establish an independent commission to examine its benefits and viability. The commission would include appointees by the Administration and senior members of relevant committees, with funding authorized for 36 months. The final bill requires DOD to establish an independent commission to review the Selective Service System, with $15 million funding authorized for 36 months in FY2017. The issues of sexual assault and harassment in the military have received significant attention in recent years, leading to the implementation of department-wide policies in 2005. The Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (SAPRO) was established in 2005 as a result of the Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act. DOD has implemented strategic initiatives and congressional actions to address sexual assault prevention, victim services, and reporting. SAPRO is required by law to report statistics on sexual assault in the military annually. The Senate and House bills aim to extend reporting requirements for sexual assault in the military, with deadlines moved to March 31 and April 30 respectively. The FY2015 DOD Annual Report on Sexual Assault highlighted concerns about retaliation for reporting incidents. The enacted bill includes provisions to increase training requirements for investigators and address concerns about retaliation in the military. The House bill's burden of proof modification was not adopted, but the conferees remain concerned about reports of retaliation against military personnel. Sections 543 and 545 of the bill adopt Senate provisions to address these issues. The enacted bill includes provisions to address retaliation in the military related to reports of military sexual assault. Concerns have been raised about the character of discharge for veterans who experienced sexual trauma while serving. Other-than-honorable discharges can impact eligibility for veteran's benefits, but servicemembers can appeal these decisions through a discharge review board. Additionally, servicemembers and veterans with PTSD or TBI related to combat have certain medical assessments and enhanced discharge review board consideration. The enacted bill includes provisions addressing retaliation in the military related to reports of military sexual assault. Concerns have been raised about the character of discharge for veterans who experienced sexual trauma while serving. Section 548 of the bill modifies the definition of sexual harassment for investigating complaints by commanding officers. In FY2014, there were 7,676 confirmed cases of child abuse or neglect in military homes, an increase of 10% from the previous year and a 10-year high, raising concerns despite rates being lower than the general population. The Family Advocacy Program (FAP) in the Armed Forces addresses child and domestic abuse through prevention, education, and training initiatives. DOD personnel are required to report suspected instances of abuse to state child welfare agencies. The enacted bill requires an annual Family Advocacy Program report to Congress on child and domestic abuse data. The provision aims to improve reporting and oversight in military families. The Senate bill included a requirement for background checks in DOD domestic schools, but it was not included in the final bill. The Department is directed to work closely with local school districts educating military family members to improve employment screening policies for the safety of military children. A report on identifying shortfalls in screening processes and providing recommendations is required within a year. In 2013, Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel directed a comprehensive review of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) and its implementation, including the Manual for Courts-Martial and service regulations, in response to recommendations from General Martin Dempsey. The General Counsel established the Military Justice Review Group (MJRG) to review the UCMJ and MCM, resulting in the submission of the Military Justice Act of 2016 to Congress. The proposed House bill included comprehensive revisions to the UCMJ, addressing various aspects of military justice. The proposed House bill included comprehensive revisions to the UCMJ, addressing various aspects of military justice such as trial procedure, sentencing, and appellate matters. One significant change was granting the government the ability to appeal a sentence adjudged if it violated the law or was plainly unreasonable, a right previously only available to the servicemember. The bill also proposed reorganizing the punitive articles and creating new offenses. The proposed Senate bill addresses various aspects of military justice, including courts-martial composition, trial procedure, sentencing, and appellate matters. Differences exist between the House and Senate language, such as the government's ability to appeal a sentence adjudged if it violates the law or is plainly unreasonable. The Senate language requires the creation of military-specific sentencing parameters and criteria. The Senate bill proposed changes to offenses related to rape and sexual assault, adding the use of \"position, rank, or authority to coerce the acquiescence of the other person in the sexual act\" as a punishable act. Differences between the House and Senate bills were resolved in conference, resulting in a comprehensive revision of the UCMJ. However, some provisions, such as interim guidance on sentencing parameters and an increase in minimum punishment for sex-related offenses, were not included in the final bill. The Senate bill proposed changes to offenses related to rape and sexual assault, including the use of position, rank, or authority to coerce acquiescence in the sexual act. The Medal of Honor review process has been criticized for being lengthy and bureaucratic, leading to lost records and conflicting evidence. Retroactive awards are limited to maintain the award's integrity. The Medal of Honor review process is criticized for being restrictive, leading to lost records and denied medals. The DOD periodically reviews inquiries and historical records to address these concerns. In 2016, the DOD announced a review of military awards and decorations, including the timeliness of the process and recommendations for actions in Iraq and Afghanistan since 2001. The results of the review are due to the Secretary of Defense in 2017. The final bill includes provisions for waiving time limitations to authorize the President to award certain valor awards during specific contingency operations. The time waiver expires on December 31, 2019, and no medals may be awarded after that date under this authority. The bill authorizes the award of the Medal of Honor to Gary M. Rose and James C. McCloughan for acts of valor during the Vietnam War. It also requires a review of service records for eligible veterans of the Korean and Vietnam Wars of Asian American or Native American Pacific Island descent who were previously awarded certain valor awards. The bill authorizes the award of the Medal of Honor to Gary M. Rose and James C. McCloughan for acts of valor during the Vietnam War. It also requires a review of service records for eligible veterans of the Korean and Vietnam Wars of Asian American or Native American Pacific Island descent who were previously awarded certain valor awards. Island descent veterans who were awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, the Navy Cross, or the Air Force Cross may have the statutory time limitations for the Medal of Honor waived if their service records support it. Congress often requests pilot studies and reports within provisions of the National Defense Authorization Act. The Appendix includes reports on military personnel issues required by the final bill and the National Defense Authorization Act."
