    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 13000 of the Education Code is amended to establish the California Civil Liberties Public Education Act, aimed at educating the public about the exclusion and internment of Japanese Americans during World War II. The federal Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians (CWRIC) was created by Congress in 1980 to review Executive Order 9066's impact on American citizens and recommend remedies. The CWRIC issued reports in 1983 based on hearings with over 750 witnesses, including evacuees, government officials, and historians. The CWRIC concluded that Executive Order 9066 was not justified by military necessity and was driven by race prejudice, war hysteria, and a failure of political leadership. The decisions to exclude, detain, and later release Japanese-Americans were made hastily and without individual review, resulting in a grave personal injustice during World War II. President Ronald Reagan signed the federal Civil Liberties Act of 1988, declaring it a great day for America. Congress also declared the act, acknowledging the grave personal injustice suffered by Japanese-Americans during World War II. \"The Congress acknowledges the grave injustice done to citizens and permanent residents of Japanese ancestry during World War II, apologizing for the violations of civil liberties and constitutional rights.\" \"The Congress apologizes on behalf of the Nation for the violations of civil liberties and constitutional rights of individuals of Japanese ancestry.\" The Legislature aims to establish a state test for eligible aliens to demonstrate their understanding of English, history, and government of the United States under the federal Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. The Legislature intends to create a state test for eligible undocumented foreign nationals to prove their English proficiency and knowledge of U.S. history and government under the federal Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. The Superintendent, in consultation with the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges, will develop a test to measure the English proficiency and knowledge of U.S. history and government for eligible foreign nationals, as required by federal law. The Governor, Superintendent, Chancellor of the California Community Colleges, President pro Tempore of the Senate, and Speaker of the Assembly will seek approval from the US Immigration and Naturalization Service and Attorney General to use a test for eligible foreign nationals to meet requirements under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. The Superintendent will distribute a test to educational agencies for eligible foreign nationals to demonstrate English proficiency and knowledge of US history and government. Test results will be confidential. Test results for eligible foreign nationals shall be confidential and not released without written consent. Results may be transmitted to the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service upon request. Authorized agencies administering the test must follow appropriate security measures. Section 52613 of the Education Code is amended to ensure confidentiality of test results for eligible foreign nationals. Results may be shared with the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service upon request. Authorized agencies must adhere to security measures. Each school district maintaining classes for adults issuing Form I-20AB for nonimmigrant foreign nationals must charge a fee to cover instruction costs, not exceeding the actual cost. The fee must be adopted at least 90 days before classes begin. The Education Code is amended to clarify terms related to adult education, including definitions for the Board of Governors, Chancellor, community-based organizations, Department of Education, and educational outreach activities. The Education Code is amended to clarify terms related to adult education, including definitions for educational outreach activities such as providing information to temporary resident foreign nationals about federal immigration requirements and services available for adjusting resident status. The Education Code is amended to define terms related to adult education, including information provided to newly legalized persons and other immigrants about educational opportunities available to them. An immigrant is defined as a non-U.S. citizen eligible for education services in California or a naturalized U.S. citizen residing in California. A newly legalized person is a foreign national granted lawful temporary resident status under specific sections of the United States Code, or someone who has obtained permanent resident or citizenship status after being granted temporary resident status. The Education Code is amended to define terms related to adult education, including information provided to newly legalized persons and other immigrants about educational opportunities available to them. The \"Services provider\" refers to approved organizations to provide educational services to newly legalized persons. \"SLIAG\" refers to State Legalization Impact-Assistance Grants. The \"Superintendent\" refers to the Superintendent of Public Instruction. Residence rules are outlined in Section 68062 of the Education Code. Residence rules outlined in Section 68062 of the Education Code state that there can only be one residence, which is where a person stays when not elsewhere for work or special purposes. A residence cannot be lost until another is gained, and can only be changed by a deliberate act. Individuals can establish their own residence, and a woman's residence is not dependent on her husband's. The residence of an unmarried minor child is where they live with a parent, or where they last lived with a parent if both are deceased and no legal guardian is appointed. (g) An unmarried minor's residence cannot be changed by their own act, legal guardian appointment, or parent's relinquishment of control. \n(h) Foreign nationals, including unmarried minors, can establish their residence unless prohibited by federal law. \n(i) An unmarried minor foreign national's residence is derived from their parents. Section 68130.5 of the Education Code is amended. Section 68130.5 of the Education Code is amended to exempt certain students from paying nonresident tuition at California State University and California Community Colleges if they meet specific requirements related to high school attendance and graduation in California. Students can be exempt from paying nonresident tuition at California State University and California Community Colleges if they meet specific requirements, including graduating from a California high school or equivalent, being registered at an accredited institution in California since 2001, and filing an affidavit if they have unlawful immigration status. The Board of Governors and Trustees will establish rules for implementation. Student information obtained in the implementation of this section is confidential. Income received as reparation payments for Japanese ancestry interned during World War II shall not be considered in determining financial need. The Superintendent of Public Instruction must certify that certain legislative measures have been enacted before certain sections of the act become operative. These measures involve replacing the terms \"alien\" with \"foreign national\" and \"illegal alien\" with \"undocumented foreign national\" in government expressions. If the Superintendent of Public Instruction certifies certain legislative measures, Section 2 of the act will become inoperative."
