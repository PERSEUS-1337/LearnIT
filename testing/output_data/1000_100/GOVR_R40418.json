Various government departments have expanded their high-containment laboratory capacity to study dangerous pathogens, playing a crucial role in biodefense efforts. The federal government increased funding for biodefense post-9/11 and anthrax attacks, focusing on laboratory capacity for research and diagnostics. Funding rose from $690 million in FY2001 to $5.4 billion in FY2008, supporting academic and industrial researchers. Concerns exist about aging infrastructure and limited capacity, leading to the expansion of high-containment laboratories by non-federal entities. The proliferation of high-containment laboratories internationally has raised new policy questions regarding their optimal size, necessary federal investment, consolidation vs dispersion, coordination of efforts, and balancing benefits with risks. Policymakers are increasingly concerned about the potential risks posed by increasing laboratory capacity and trained scientists. The federal government is urged to tighten oversight of high-containment laboratories due to reports of accidents and noncompliance. This report focuses on biosecurity, biosafety, and federal regulation of these facilities, discussing policy options for congressional consideration. Biosecurity and biosafety are closely related, with biosecurity referring to securing pathogens from theft and biosafety focusing on preventing unintentional infections. The Select Agent Program is the major federal regulatory program addressing biosecurity. The Select Agent Program was established to regulate commerce in pathogens with potential for bioterrorist attacks. Laws like the Antiterrorism Act and the USA PATRIOT Act increased restrictions on possession of select agents after the 2001 anthrax mailings. Entities possessing select agents must have explicit security and biosafety measures in place. Entities possessing select agents must develop security and biosafety plans certified by the federal government. The Select Agent Program regulates possession, transfer, and use of select agents, focusing on individuals with access and facilities where agents are stored. Scientists must register with the DOJ for background checks to handle select agents. Permits are valid for five years and nontransferable. Facilities using select agents must implement security plans to prevent theft or unauthorized access. Plans are submitted to HHS/CDC or USDA. The Select Agent Program regulates possession, transfer, and use of select agents. Entities must develop certified security and biosafety plans reviewed by federal agencies. Inspections are conducted every three years, and non-compliance can result in fines. Approximately 390 entities have certificates to work with select agents, with 15,300 staff approved for access. The federal government has developed a Laboratory Response Network linking state or local public health laboratories to enhance testing and response capabilities following a biological attack. The goal is to establish a capable laboratory in each state for handling dangerous pathogens. Tensions have risen in academia over the Select Agent Program, with some entities finding the regulations too burdensome for research with these pathogens. Approximately 200 entities have either transferred or destroyed their select agent materials. The Select Agent Program has faced scrutiny from agency Inspectors General regarding internal controls, processing applications, and regulatory compliance. Investigations found universities and laboratories not fully complying with regulations, leading to some entities withdrawing their select agent licenses. The USDA also found issues with controls over registered entities. The USDA IG found deficiencies in APHIS controls over registered entities and compliance with select agent regulations. Various organizations, including Texas A&M University, have been cited and fined for violations. Scientists acknowledge the risks of working with dangerous pathogens and have developed best practices to mitigate these risks. The HHS OIG has imposed fines totaling $1,887,000 on 12 organizations for non-compliance with Select Agent regulations. The U.S. government began collecting best practices for handling biological agents in the 1970s and 1980s, issuing guidelines in the publication Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL). The CDC and NIH established four biosafety levels (BSL-1 to BSL-4) with specific protections based on the pathogen's risk to human health. Higher biosafety levels include measures from lower levels, with BSL-3 and BSL-4 labs referred to as high-containment laboratories. The BMBL guidelines define biosafety levels for high-containment laboratories (BSL-3 and BSL-4) to protect workers from specific pathogen risks. Biosafety levels are linked to pathogen-experiment combinations, with primary and secondary infection barriers and standard practices outlined. The BMBL guidelines outline biosafety levels for different laboratories based on pathogen risks and research procedures. Researchers at institutions receiving federal funds must be trained in BMBL procedures before accessing the laboratory. The correct biosafety level depends on the pathogen, its transmission potential, and available treatments. Procedures are categorized into BSL-1 for low-risk, BSL-2 for diseases with treatments available, BSL-3 for serious diseases, and BSL-4 for high-risk aerosol-transmitted diseases. The BMBL guidelines recommend conducting high-risk procedures at BSL-4 and lower-risk activities at BSL-3 or BSL-2 depending on the pathogen and procedure. Some deadly pathogens can be handled at lower biosafety levels for certain experiments. For example, anthrax can be handled at BSL-2 for clinical activities and BSL-3 for production or high concentrations. BSL-4 facilities are necessary for 13 out of 73 select agents and toxins, while 30 others can be studied at BSL-2 depending on circumstances. BSL-4 facilities in the US work with select agents and are regulated, unlike some BSL-3 facilities. BMBL guidelines are widely followed, and compliance is usually voluntary. Compliance with BMBL guidelines is often voluntary but can be mandatory for federal contracts and grants, with noncompliance risking loss of funding. Various laboratories, including those under the Select Agent Program, must adhere to the guidelines. Additionally, health and safety officials in different types of laboratories ensure the proper operation of protective equipment to maintain compliance. The BMBL guidelines are also considered in building design for biosafety. The BMBL guidelines are integrated into building design standards, grant requirements, federal regulations for DNA research, and the Select Agent Program. Federal facilities and those funded by federal money follow design standards based on the BMBL guidelines, which include security requirements. For high-containment laboratories, NIH issues checklists to ensure compliance before occupancy. The NIH has developed a guide for laboratory commissioning, which is also done by other agencies following biosafety guidelines. Agencies often contract out this process, with NIH recommending using companies not involved in the facility's design or construction. The individuals involved in commissioning should be highly specialized and licensed professionals. Individuals overseeing technical aspects should be licensed Professional Engineers with extensive experience in system design, optimization, and testing. Laboratories receiving federal funding must adhere to biosafety guidelines, or risk losing current and future funding. Compliance with regulations may be requested by the awarding office. Grantees must adhere to health and safety standards and provide evidence of compliance if requested. Federal research grants for recombinant DNA research require the establishment of an institutional biosafety committee to oversee compliance with guidelines. The committee has the authority to determine biosafety levels for research activities and enforce specific precautions. Some suggest expanding the committee's oversight to other research with biosafety concerns. The Institutional Biosafety Committees (IBCs) oversee research with biosafety concerns, helping scientists determine protection levels for experiments. Some experts argue that IBCs lack sufficient oversight. The Select Agent Program regulations require compliance with the BMBL guidelines, including security and biosafety plans. The number of BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratories is believed to have increased in recent years. The number of BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratories is believed to have increased in recent years, with a twelve-fold increase in planned or existing BSL-4 space in the United States since 2004. This expansion is due to federal construction, increased funding for research activities, and a focus on public health. The federal government is investing in high-containment laboratories across various departments. The federal government is investing in high-containment laboratories across various departments, including the Department of Defense (DOD) which has maintained a high-containment laboratory infrastructure for many years. These laboratories focus on defensive research, developing countermeasures to protect against biological weapons. President Nixon discontinued the U.S. offensive biological weapons program in 1969. The United States Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) in Frederick, MD, is the main location for this research. The Department of Defense (DOD) is expanding its high-containment laboratory facilities at USAMRIID in Frederick, MD, with a $683 million investment. These laboratories conduct research on infectious diseases, evaluate vaccines, and test for disease outbreaks. The federal government established specialized facilities post-anthrax mailings to analyze pathogens for identifying biological attack perpetrators. President Bush assigned the bioforensic responsibility to the Department of Homeland Security in 2004. The National Bioforensics Analysis Center was established as part of the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center at USAMRIID. Permanent facilities, including BSL-4 and BSL-3 laboratories, are under construction in Frederick, MD. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred the Plum Island Animal Disease Center to DHS due to reaching the end of its usable lifespan. The Department of Homeland Security is establishing the National Bio- and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF) to replace the aging PIADC facility. NBAF will be a BSL-4 laboratory focused on researching animal pathogens and developing countermeasures. The DHS has chosen Kansas as the site for NBAF, which will enhance the research capabilities for high-containment animal pathogens. The construction of two BSL-4 National Biocontainment Laboratories (NBLs) and thirteen BSL-3 Regional Biocontainment Laboratories (RBLs) is underway. These facilities will support research on pathogens for the NIH National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases' biodefense agenda and assist in public health emergencies. The NBLs are being built in Boston, MA, and Galveston, TX, while the RBLs are spread across the United States. They are privately owned and operated, funded through grants. Additionally, the HHS has established the Laboratory Response Network (LRN) to coordinate laboratories in responding to bioterrorism threats. The LRN maintains a network of laboratories for responding to bioterrorism and public health emergencies, including federal and state facilities with BSL-3 capabilities. The USDA is building new BSL-3 laboratories in Ames, IA, and Fort Collins, CO. Academic institutions are also investing in high-containment facilities for various purposes. Universities and private sector companies are constructing high-containment laboratory facilities to enhance research capabilities and compete for federal funding. Examples include the University of Minnesota, Purdue University, and Ohio State University. Pharmaceutical companies use such facilities for medical testing and product development. Some companies opt for in-house laboratories, while others contract with external firms. The expansion of high-containment laboratories has raised issues for policymakers post-2001 anthrax mailings, leading to the decision to construct additional laboratory space. The expansion of high-containment laboratories post-2001 anthrax mailings led to the need for federal investment and support due to high capital and maintenance costs. However, the lack of a national needs assessment has resulted in concerns that the new capacity may exceed national requirements. The absence of information on existing laboratory capacity hinders coordinated planning. The Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases identified 277 domestic BSL-3 laboratories, but their survey had a low response rate. The DHS and HHS estimated 630 BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratories, criticized by experts. The number was based on facilities registered to work with select agents, but not all BSL-3 labs work with select agents. Non-governmental estimates show an increase in high-containment lab capability. The Government Accountability Office couldn't definitively determine the number of BSL-3 labs. The Government Accountability Office was unable to definitively determine the number of BSL-3 laboratories but documented an increase in facilities. A government-wide assessment involving multiple federal agencies may be needed to determine if ongoing construction surpasses future national needs. Congress may need to decide on conducting a survey at the agency level or through an external coordinating body. Increased funding for research, operations, and management will likely be necessary to fully utilize additional capacity in high-containment facilities. An agency increasing its high containment laboratory capacity will lead to higher operations and maintenance costs, even if the new capacity is not fully utilized. Agencies may request larger research budgets to cover these costs. Interagency federal planning efforts could help reduce overcapacity costs, but require agreement on facility prioritization and shared use. Individual agency initiatives may struggle to address synergies or redundancies between agencies. For example, DHS has tried to coordinate homeland security research, but without addressing use of other agency lab assets. The growth of BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratories has raised concerns about pathogen release and biological weapon proliferation. Events like laboratory infections and improper shipping of select agents have led to a reexamination of oversight frameworks. Congress may need to consider central coordination for multi-agency high-containment laboratory use. The current oversight framework for high-containment laboratories is debated, with some calling for more federal regulation while others advocate for enhanced self-regulation with increased training and self-policing by scientists. The expansion of these laboratories allows for more research opportunities but also raises concerns about biosecurity and biosafety measures. The increase in high-containment laboratories raises concerns about biosecurity and biosafety measures. Legislation has been passed to address theft and accidental release of dangerous pathogens, but security weaknesses have been found at some facilities. Additional regulatory focus on compliance with the Select Agent Program may help minimize these risks. High-containment laboratories are designed to minimize accidents, but risks still exist. The GAO testified that each facility has inherent risks, which increase with the construction of more facilities. Factors contributing to risk include accidental releases, subsequent illnesses, and the total number of laboratories. Policymakers may need to rely on estimates for cost/benefit analysis due to limited information availability. An approximate cost/benefit analysis of research in high-containment laboratories considers potential benefits like breakthroughs in biodefense research and potential costs like the loss of infected animals or infection of laboratory workers. Federal policymakers may overlook subtle effects like the development of a national sampling laboratory network. Concerns also include personnel surety and the \"insider threat\" in the expansion of high-containment facilities. The expansion of high-containment laboratories raises concerns about personnel surety and the \"insider threat.\" Trained technicians, scientists, and employees are needed to utilize this capacity, increasing the risk of malicious intent. The increase in high-containment capacity may be perceived internationally as excessive for biodefense and health research, potentially leading to suspicions of offensive biological weapons development by the United States. The United States is expanding its high-containment laboratory capacity, raising concerns about the potential perception of offensive biological weapons development. This could lead to international suspicions and encourage other countries to build similar facilities, increasing the risk of malevolent use of high-containment techniques and information. Differences in biosafety regulations among countries may impact the decisions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, potentially leading to the relocation of research and production facilities. The location of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in different countries could impact national capabilities to respond to bioterrorism or disease outbreaks. Countries relying on foreign production of disease treatments may face restricted access during international crises. Differences in biosecurity regulations have led to reduced international collaborations among U.S. scientists, potentially hindering the scientific process. The construction of high-containment laboratories in the United States has faced varying degrees of local resistance, with some groups supporting the economic benefits and job creation, while others strongly oppose their establishment. Some groups support the economic benefits of new laboratories, while others oppose them due to public health and security concerns. Policymakers have options to either maintain current efforts or increase oversight of facilities and personnel. One scientist highlighted the balance between security controls and research productivity in high-containment laboratories. Policymakers may find current oversight sufficient, as additional measures could hinder scientific progress. Some in the scientific community support existing oversight mechanisms and oppose further action. Securing high-containment laboratories in the United States may provide less security than focusing on identifying and disrupting potential bioterrorists. Additional resources for intelligence on bioterror groups could be more cost-effective than implementing broad regulatory frameworks. Policymakers may defer action to fully understand policy options and impacts. The Bush Administration established expert groups to address biosafety and biosecurity issues since 2005. President Bush established the Working Group on Strengthening the Biosecurity of the United States in 2009, co-chaired by the Secretaries of Defense and Health and Human Services. Congress could endorse the group's activities while awaiting their recommendations, or policymakers may require additional studies. The GAO is investigating the proliferation of high-containment laboratories. The Trans-Federal Task Force on Optimizing Biosafety and Biocontainment Oversight was formed by the HHS in 2007 to review and evaluate existing laws and practices related to biosafety and biosecurity. Recommendations to the President are due in July 2009. The Trans-Federal Task Force on Optimizing Biosafety and Biocontainment Oversight, co-chaired by HHS and USDA, includes staff from various federal agencies. The task force addresses gaps in oversight of high-containment laboratories and will present recommendations to HHS and USDA leadership. The National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity is developing policies for dual-use research, aiming to establish effective oversight and a code of conduct. The National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity is working on policies for dual-use research and oversight of high-containment laboratories. The GAO is expected to release a report in 2009 with recommendations for legislative and executive branch action. Congress may choose to wait for these recommendations or address the issue without delay. Several policy options are proposed to address the issue of determining the number and capacity of high-containment laboratories without waiting for executive branch or GAO reports. Non-federal high-containment laboratories are located in various institutions and a comprehensive inventory may be challenging to compile. A voluntary self-reporting mechanism may not be sufficient to identify all existing laboratories. Efforts to incentivize self-reporting or mandating registration of all high-containment laboratories could help create a comprehensive inventory of existing facilities and their capacity. Industrial competitiveness and reporting burden are barriers that need to be addressed to ensure full participation. The government can gather information on laboratory capacity, distribution, and availability through facility registration. Registration was part of the Select Agent Program, and could be required even without additional security measures. A survey of federal facilities could be limited to determine high-containment laboratories. Federal agencies may need to report their facilities and capacity to Congress. Knowing federal capacity can help plan for use and expansion efficiently. A government-wide needs assessment could also aid in planning. A government-wide needs assessment can help efficiently allocate resources by comparing it with federal capacity. Congress may need to consider the economic costs of surveying high-containment laboratories and the quality of information acquired. Comparing the survey with a needs assessment can maximize benefits, as currently, such assessments are not available across federal agencies. Members of Congress may require specific agencies to submit a needs assessment. Some policymakers suggest a moratorium on new federally funded high-containment laboratories to avoid over-building capacity. Without a government-wide needs assessment, building more labs may lead to redundancy and diminishing returns. Incremental increases in high-containment laboratory capacity may yield greater return than constructing large amounts of new laboratory space. Some agencies argue that existing infrastructure is outdated and not suitable for expansion, citing the need for new facilities like the National Bio- and Agro-Defense Facility. However, without a government-wide assessment, agency-specific needs may overlook synergies or available infrastructure in other agencies. A construction moratorium could impact the federal government's ability to meet national goals. Delays in construction of laboratory facilities may hinder planned research activities and national priorities like establishing a permanent bioforensics capability. Calls for expanding high-containment laboratory facilities could be impeded by a construction moratorium. Some analysts suggest licensing and certifying all high-containment laboratories to ensure compliance with security regulations. One approach to licensing high-containment laboratories is to apply Select Agent Program requirements universally, ensuring a consistent security level. Alternatively, a separate licensing program could offer flexibility based on the presence of select agents. Challenges in implementing and gaining acceptance for laboratory licensing and certification are anticipated. A more comprehensive approach to overseeing laboratories capable of BSL-2 or higher containment is suggested, which would capture all locations with sufficient biosecurity for select agent use. However, this approach would involve overseeing a significantly increased number of facilities, including those handling human-infective pathogens, impacting public health and diagnostic sectors. Some experts suggest expanding the select agent list to include more dangerous pathogens not currently covered, such as SARS, dengue fever, and yellow fever. This would lead to more high-containment facilities being regulated under the Select Agent Program. Scientists have concerns about the construction of the select agent list. Scientists are concerned about the construction of the select agent list, suggesting it may not accurately differentiate between pathogens of concern and similar ones. The NIH has asked the National Academies to explore identifying select agents based on features beyond taxonomy to minimize disruption to research and public health activities. Regulatory impacts would only affect entities using pathogens of concern, not all high-containment facilities. Efforts to enhance personnel oversight at high-containment facilities, including expanding background checks to all personnel using BSL-3 and BSL-4 facilities, have been suggested. The scope of background screening may vary depending on policymakers' evaluation of potential risks associated with accessing high-containment facilities. Efforts to improve personnel oversight at high-containment facilities face challenges, such as potential resistance to government documentation and certification for lab researchers. Some scientists may choose to leave rather than undergo the required clearance. The Department of Defense has extensive personnel oversight programs, but the DOJ noted a DOD scientist was involved in the 2001 anthrax mailings. The Select Agent Program mandates worker training before accessing select agents, with annual retraining required. The regulations require training to address individual needs, work tasks, and risks of select agents. Developing training standards could ensure core competencies for all trainees. Experts suggest expanding biosafety training programs to meet demand, with varying structures from local to federally centralized certification. The impact of such training on reducing laboratory infections is uncertain. Enhancing training for high-containment laboratory workers to include considerations for dual-use pathogens could improve biosecurity. Reporting mechanisms for accidents and near accidents are recommended to facilitate learning from experiences. Criminal penalties may be imposed for events involving select agents. Enhancing the reporting system for events involving select agents is crucial to improve biosecurity practices. Establishing a database of accidents and corresponding remediation could help prevent future incidents. Experts suggest coupling this database with the current reporting requirements under the Select Agent Program. Experts recommend minimizing penalties for reporting accidents to a database affiliated with the reporting entity or anonymous after processing by HHS or USDA. Congress must consider balancing the potential for negligence to go unpunished with existing penalties in the Select Agent Program. Policymakers need to find the optimal balance between increasing oversight and regulatory burden, which may face resistance from scientists and stakeholders. Increased federal oversight could reduce opportunities for misuse of biological weapons. The expansion of the Select Agent Program may hinder public health response and international collaboration by increasing barriers to transferring materials between laboratories. Critics argue that the program's requirements for certification could impede successful collaboration and negatively impact public health response. International collaboration on regulated pathogens may also be hindered due to a lack of comparable standards. The impacts of licensing and certification regimes on regulated entities, including scientists not involved in biodefense activities, could reduce scientific productivity in academic and industrial sectors. Public health laboratories and hospitals may face increased costs from regulatory activities. An increase in regulated facilities would require more federal resources for registration, inspections, and oversight. Identifying the most appropriate oversight agency is a key issue. Policymakers have determined that USDA and HHS have the necessary technical knowledge for biosafety and biosecurity programs. Policymakers have determined that USDA and HHS are appropriate regulators for biosafety and biosecurity programs. With increasing homeland security concerns, another agency like DHS may be considered. Oversight could be performed by the agency with existing statutory authority or new authorities may be developed, leading to a mixture of oversight. The oversight of high-containment laboratories is being regulated under new authority, potentially consolidating oversight into one agency. Limited federal resources have been used for biosafety practices, but expanding the scope may require more resources. The 111th Congress is considering legislation to address issues related to the Select Agent Program and the expansion of high-containment laboratory capacity. H.R. 1225 and S. 485 have been introduced to extend authorization. The bills H.R. 1225 and S. 485 aim to extend the authorization of the Select Agent Program and expand criteria for determining select agents. They require a review by the National Academy of Sciences, mandatory biosafety training, and improvements to monitoring procedures. Additionally, the HHS Secretary must report on capacity evaluation and share best practices across biodefense and infectious disease communities. The Laboratory Surge Capacity Preparedness Act (H.R. 1150) directs the HHS Secretary to establish a Biological Laboratory Incident Reporting System for reporting incidents. It also authorizes DHS to award grants to Regional Biocontainment Laboratories and requires a report on integrating the RBL network and the need for additional BSL-3 laboratory surge capacity. The need for international harmonization in biocontainment technologies to address the threat of high-containment laboratories being the source of bioterror weapons is a key challenge for policymakers. Defining the goal of enhanced oversight of high-containment laboratories is crucial, as it impacts the choice of policies to address security concerns. A registry of existing high-containment laboratory capacity may aid in planning and coordination but may offer limited security benefits. Rigorous oversight programs, including facility and personnel licensure and mandatory training, are essential for addressing security concerns. Rigorous oversight programs, including facility and personnel licensure, mandatory training, and restricted construction of new facilities, may provide security benefits but come with a regulatory burden, increased federal expenditures, and hindered scientific progress in countermeasure research, bioforensics, and public health. Policymakers must balance these competing national needs when considering policy options."
