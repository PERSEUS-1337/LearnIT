    "content": "Irrigation has been crucial for the development and economy of the United States, especially in settling the West and revitalizing agriculture after the Dust Bowl. Technological advancements have modernized irrigated agriculture, but come with costs like infrastructure, federal programs, and potential impacts on water users and the environment. Water withdrawals and consumption are key measurements of irrigation water use. Water withdrawals and consumption from irrigation are important metrics for measuring water use in the United States. While irrigation withdrawals have decreased by 23% since 1980, it is unclear if this has led to a decline in water consumption. Improvements in irrigation efficiency may result in less water returning to water sources. Changes in irrigated land vary by region, with only four western states seeing an increase since 2003. Since 2003, irrigated acres in the United States have decreased in most western states, while several eastern states have seen a significant increase, with seven states doubling irrigation. Farmers have shifted to more efficient irrigation methods, especially in the West, leading to a decline in applied irrigation water despite an increase in irrigated land. The trend of declining irrigation water application began in 1998, with a decrease in on-farm surface water withdrawals and water delivered to farms in the West. Groundwater withdrawals have increased by over 740,000 AF. Irrigation withdrawals remain highest in the western-most portions of the United States, while irrigated land in eastern states has grown by over 8.7 million acres since 1984, primarily relying on groundwater withdrawals. The increased irrigated acres in the East since 2003 have been driven by factors like commodity prices, drought episodes, and easy access to groundwater. This has led to a decline in aquifer levels and raised environmental concerns. Irrigation efficiency refers to the beneficial use of applied water, considering factors like system performance, water application uniformity, and crop response. Evapotranspiration rates are influenced by climate conditions. Efficient irrigation systems are influenced by factors like hours of sunlight, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and canopy development. Water conveyance systems play a crucial role in irrigation efficiency, with poorly constructed canals leading to significant conveyance losses. While efficient systems are believed to save water for downstream use, studies have shown that they may actually increase water consumption in some cases. For example, increasing water conservation subsidies for drip irrigation can lead to higher water consumption, crop yield, and irrigated acreage in certain regions. Microirrigation may be more efficient than gravity irrigation, but gravity irrigation typically consumes less water. Water not lost to evapotranspiration through gravity irrigation is returned to surface or groundwater sources. Efficient irrigation technologies may encourage farmers to grow more profitable, water-intensive crops, potentially offsetting water savings. Adopting more-efficient irrigation technologies may not always reduce overall water consumption. Irrigation systems are classified into pressure and gravity systems, with precision technologies enhancing efficiency. Best management practices for irrigation focus on water management on farms, including conveyance and scheduling methods. The USDA's NRCS identifies select irrigation practices as Best Management Practices (BMPs), which may apply to pressure or gravity systems. BMP success depends on various factors and may require multiple practices. Pressure systems include sprinkler and microirrigation systems for water application to crops. Pressure irrigation systems, such as center pivot, linear move tower, and drip systems, make up the majority of irrigation systems in the United States. These systems are efficient in delivering water directly to the root zone of crops, reducing soil erosion, and maximizing plant growth. While they require low operational labor, the initial investment costs can be high. An irrigation water management plan is essential to manage water application, maintain soil moisture levels, and increase water efficiency. The irrigation plan includes various BMPs like microirrigation, sprinkler systems, and ditch lining to enhance plant growth, reduce energy consumption, and improve water efficiency. Sprinkler systems like center pivot, side roll, and linear move tower irrigation spray water over crops for soil moisture. Microirrigation, with types like surface drip and sub-surface drip, is more efficient than sprinkler systems as it directly applies water to the root zone of crops. LEPA irrigation systems apply water directly to crop root zones through nozzles close to the soil surface, reducing evaporation and energy consumption. Gravity systems, common in the US, flood crops using canals, ditches, and furrows, with controlled methods like basin and furrow irrigation being more efficient than uncontrolled flooding. Gravity systems are generally less efficient than pressure systems, with varying initial and operational costs. Land leveling is reshaping a field to ensure uniform water application without puddles or dry spots. Irrigation ditch lining limits water loss during transit to the crop area. Canal linings increase conveyance efficiency based on soil type. Canal linings, such as concrete, PVC, and polypropylene, improve conveyance efficiency based on soil type. Tailwater recovery systems recycle excess gravity irrigation water to prevent contamination. Irrigation reservoirs store water for crops, with size determined by water availability. Precision technologies can enhance irrigation practices. Precision technologies, like satellite data and drones, have revolutionized the agricultural industry, particularly in irrigation. These technologies increase efficiency, reduce costs, and boost crop yields. Companies are now offering technology and data services to help farmers maximize profits. A collaborative project between NASA and USDA launched the SMAP satellite to gather global soil moisture data without the need for terrestrial sensors. The SMAP project continues using supplemental data and functioning radiometer for informing irrigation decisions. Drones capture aerial imagery combined with software to adjust irrigation. Sensor networks monitor plant water status and soil water content. Data analytics improve decisions for irrigation system automation. Based on data from regional weather networks, crop evapotranspiration, precipitation, and soil moisture data, an accurate irrigation schedule can be established. Remote monitoring systems wirelessly transfer real-time information to adjust irrigation operations, reducing water usage. Poly-pipe in furrow irrigation, optimized with computer software, decreases water runoff. Implementing irrigation BMPs increases efficiency and reduces production costs. Irrigation BMPs improve water application precision, reducing production costs and ensuring even watering. Irrigated yields are double that of non-irrigated crops, allowing for higher value crops and extended growing seasons. Specialty crops benefit from controlled water flow, reducing overwatering issues. Irrigation systems can also apply nutrients and pesticides, enhancing production efficiency. Efficient irrigation systems can reduce costs and provide precise application of synthetic nutrients and pesticides with irrigation water. Implementation choices for irrigation technologies in the United States are influenced by factors such as cost, crop type, climate, soil, labor, technology requirements, and water quality. Adoption of efficient irrigation systems is often driven by potential economic gains rather than water conservation, especially for high-value crop growers who are more likely to invest in drip irrigation systems. Growers of low-value crops may struggle to invest in costly, efficient irrigation systems due to financial constraints. The USDA's 2013 Farm and Ranch Irrigation Survey found that 32% of respondents couldn't afford system improvements, while 25% felt the costs wouldn't be recouped. High-efficiency systems like micro sprinklers and sub-surface drip can be more expensive than gravity systems. Additionally, the cost of developing a water supply, such as drilling wells or building storage facilities, can impact a producer's decision to adopt efficient pressure systems. High-efficiency pressure systems are more common in areas heavily reliant on groundwater due to the higher cost compared to surface water. Growers in drought-prone areas are more likely to adopt efficient irrigation systems, with the type of crop also influencing the choice of system. Perennial tree crops are better suited for drip irrigation to prevent fruit decay, while gravity irrigation is more suitable for close-growing crops like rice. Widely spaced field crops that do not require total soil saturation are less effective with gravity irrigation. Recent survey data in the United States reveals that many farmers face challenges in adopting more efficient irrigation systems due to factors like crop type, physical field conditions, and climate. Local climate conditions play a significant role in the effectiveness of irrigation technologies, with drip and surface irrigation being more suitable in windy conditions, while sprinkler irrigation is subject to high evaporation in arid climates. Soil type in crop production areas also influences the selection of irrigation systems. The type of soil in a crop production area is crucial for selecting an irrigation system. Sandy soils need sprinkler or microirrigation due to high infiltration rates, while clay soils are ideal for gravity irrigation. Soil surveys help in designing irrigation systems. Gravity irrigation can be labor-intensive compared to pressure systems. Highly automated systems like sprinklers and drip irrigation require more technological inputs. Highly automated sprinkler and drip systems require technical knowledge and less labor compared to gravity systems. Water quality can dictate the type of irrigation system used, with sediment-heavy water best suited for gravity irrigation. The Clean Water Act addresses water quality concerns in various bodies of water, benefiting agriculture indirectly. The federal government provides financial and technical assistance to agricultural producers for irrigation BMPs adoption through various USDA agencies and conservation programs like EQIP, CSP, and Agricultural Management Assistance. State water rights laws largely determine the amount of water available for irrigation, with political, legal, and societal factors not discussed in detail in this report. For more information, refer to CRS Report R43910, Water Resource Issues in the 114th Congress. Between 2009 and 2014, federal programs like EQIP, CSP, and AMA provided $1.2 billion in funding for irrigation BMPs, with $564 million going towards sprinkler and microirrigation systems. States in the West, particularly California and Texas, received the highest funding amounts. Increasing irrigation efficiency may impact groundwater recharge and aquifer depletion. A study on groundwater use in the United States found that the High Plains, Mississippi Embayment, and Central Valley aquifers are being depleted at unsustainable rates, accounting for 93% of groundwater depletion from 2000 to 2008. It is unclear if irrigation BMP funding is helping to reduce groundwater depletion or exacerbating the problem. Financial and technical assistance contracts for irrigation BMPs are awarded through the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), which also funds Conservation Activity Plans (CAPs) and Conservation Innovation Grants (CIG) for irrigation water management and conservation programs. The USDA provides funding for irrigation BMPs through programs like the Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) and Agricultural Management Assistance (AMA). CSP awards payments based on conservation performance, including precision technologies for irrigation scheduling. AMA funds similar BMPs as EQIP but is limited to states with low participation in Federal Crop Insurance. Technical assistance for irrigation technologies is provided through various USDA agencies and programs. The USDA provides technical assistance through various agencies and programs to help irrigators adopt conservation plans. Conservation Technical Assistance (CTA) offers this assistance through a national network of conservationists, which can be used to qualify for financial assistance programs. CTA is available to farmers, government units, citizen groups, and professional consultants. The USDA provided over $5.7 billion in technical assistance between 2003 and 2013 to various groups for irrigation. The Agricultural Research Service (ARS) focuses on research related to irrigation BMPs, while the Economic Research Service (ERS) conducts economic and policy studies on irrigation water use and conservation. Recent studies by ARS have looked at improving irrigation management, scheduling, and deficit irrigation, while ERS studies have examined characteristics of irrigated farms and water conservation trends in irrigated agriculture. The National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) administers federal funding for agriculture research at state universities, including programs related to irrigation like the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI) Water for Agriculture Challenge Area. National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) and U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) provide national data on irrigation water use, but comparisons are challenging due to differing methodologies. The National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) conducts surveys of producers every five years to assess irrigated agriculture in the United States. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) produces a water use assessment every five years, evaluating trends in major categories including irrigation. Appendix A and B provide information on irrigation technologies and practice codes. The Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) offers funding for irrigation practices like sprinkler systems. The curr_chunk discusses various irrigation systems such as sprinkler systems, microirrigation, irrigation pipelines, pumping plants, irrigation land leveling, and water wells. These systems are used to provide adequate soil moisture for crops, crop cooling, frost protection, and dust control. The curr_chunk discusses water wells, structures for water control, irrigation reservoirs, and irrigation water management for efficient irrigation practices. These systems help extract groundwater, regulate water flow, store water for irrigation, and manage soil moisture. Irrigation scheduling is crucial for efficient water management. Different irrigation systems like surface and subsurface systems, ditch lining, tailwater recovery, and diversion dams help in conserving water, reducing energy costs, and maintaining water quality. Diversion dam (Code 348) diverts surface water to irrigation canals. Irrigation Field Ditch (Code 388) conveys water to irrigation areas. Irrigation Canal or Lateral (Code 320) efficiently delivers water to irrigation areas. Irrigation Water Management Plan (Code 118) optimizes crop yield and reduces water contamination. Transition to Dryland Farming and Ranching (Code 134) focuses on production in areas with limited precipitation. The text discusses irrigation practices for crop yield sustainability and water conservation. These practices are eligible for funding from the NRCS CSP. Regional weather networks are used for irrigation scheduling by tracking crop evapotranspiration. Irrigation System Automation adjusts water application rates based on field conditions. Irrigation Pumping Plant Evaluation enhances energy efficiency and reduces water consumption. The curr_chunk discusses various practices to reduce energy consumption and water use in irrigation systems. These practices include remote monitoring notification, decreasing irrigation water quantity, mulching for moisture conservation, and high-level irrigation water management. These modifications aim to conserve water supplies and reduce energy use in pumping plants. Water Management practices aim to reduce water and energy use in irrigation systems. This includes removing end gun sprinklers for expanded coverage, converting to low energy precision application systems, and optimizing hole sizes in poly-pipe for furrow irrigation. These enhancements improve water conservation and irrigation efficiency. To optimize hole sizes for poly-pipe in furrow irrigation to reduce water quantity and runoff. Intermittent Flooding of Rice Fields allows fields to \"dry down\" between flooding cycles. Resource Conserving Crop Rotation includes a perennial grass to improve soil fertility and reduce erosion. Improved Resource Conserving Crop Rotation further enhances erosion control and soil fertility. Appendix C and D contain information on Irrigation BMPs Funding."
