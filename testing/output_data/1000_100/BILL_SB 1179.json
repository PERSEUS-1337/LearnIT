    "title": "SB 1179",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 9002 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to define key terms related to public cemetery districts, including \"active militia,\" \"armed services,\" \"board of trustees,\" \"district,\" and \"domestic partner.\" The curr_chunk defines key terms related to public cemetery districts, including \"family member,\" \"firefighter,\" and \"interment right.\" The curr_chunk introduces key definitions related to interment rights in public cemetery districts, including terms like \"nonresident,\" \"peace officer,\" \"principal county,\" and \"voter.\" It also establishes Chapter 5.5 in the Health and Safety Code regarding interment rights. Interment rights in public cemetery districts do not include the right for disinterment without consent. The chapter allows for the removal of remains within the same cemetery under certain circumstances with proper authorization and record-keeping by the cemetery district. The chapter allows for the removal of remains from a cemetery under specific conditions, requiring details such as the date of removal, the person's name and age at death, cemetery and plot information, reinterment details if applicable, and delivery of a complete record to the cemetery district. An interment right in a cemetery provides a transferable property interest to the owner listed in the cemetery district records. The owner can designate who can be interred in the plot and must designate a successor owner at the time of purchase. If the owner of an interment right dies without a valid disposition, the right passes according to intestate succession laws. Compliance with state and local laws and district policies is required for using transferred interment rights. When a public cemetery district transfers ownership rights based on a sworn affidavit, they are not liable for any claims unless they knew the information was false. The successor of an interment right must sign an affidavit confirming their entitlement to the right. The successor of an interment right must meet certain criteria to succeed to the interment right, including being entitled to it, making reasonable efforts to find other claimants, and being unaware of any opposition. Upon the sale of a plot in a cemetery, the district must inform the purchaser about interment rights and the district's policies. The act does not require reimbursement for certain costs incurred by local agencies or school districts related to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes. Reimbursement may be made for other mandated costs determined by the Commission on State Mandates."
