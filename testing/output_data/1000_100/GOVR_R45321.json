    "content": "The Trump Administration requested $76.2 billion for the Department of Transportation (DOT) for FY2019, proposing significant cuts in funding for various programs. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $87.8 billion for DOT, an increase over the Administration's request. The Senate passed a bill providing $86.6 billion for DOT in FY2019. The FY2019 THUD appropriations bill would provide $86.6 billion in new budget authority for the Department of Transportation (DOT), slightly above the FY2018 amount and significantly higher than the Administration's request. Most of DOT's funding comes from mandatory budget authority from trust funds, with expenditures mainly in the form of grants to states and local governments. This funding structure is unique compared to other federal agencies, which mostly rely on discretionary funding. The Department of Transportation (DOT) receives the majority of its funding from mandatory budget authority derived from trust funds, with around one-third to one-fourth coming from discretionary authority. The Highway Trust Fund and the Airport and Airway Trust Fund typically provide around 90% of DOT's annual funding, but this proportion changed significantly in FY2018 due to an increase in discretionary funding. The funding from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund is categorized as discretionary budget authority and is combined with funding from the general fund. The Department of Transportation (DOT) receives funding from trust funds and discretionary budget authority. Approximately 80% of DOT's funding is distributed as grants to states, local authorities, and Amtrak. The Federal Aviation Administration, responsible for air traffic control, has a budget not primarily for grants. Reauthorizations of taxes supporting trust funds and apportionment of budget authority are significant for DOT funding. Highway, transit, and rail programs are authorized through FY2020, while federal aviation programs face reauthorization in 2018. The Department of Transportation's funding programs are set to expire on September 30, 2018, potentially impacting structure and funding levels. In nominal dollars, annual funding has increased from $70 billion in FY2012 to $86 billion in FY2018. However, adjusting for inflation, funding peaked in FY2010 at $87.5 billion and declined until FY2015 before rising again in FY2016. Real funding in FY2016 and FY2017 was similar to FY2006, but lower than FY2007-FY2011. Most federal highway and transit funding comes from the Highway Trust Fund. The Highway Trust Fund, funded by the federal motor fuels excise tax, has been facing a shortfall with annual expenditures exceeding revenues. Congress has transferred funds from the Treasury to keep the trust fund solvent, as the gas tax has not been raised since 1993. The tax is a fixed amount per gallon of fuel sold, contributing 18.3 cents for gasoline and 24.3 cents for diesel. The gas tax value has been reduced by inflation and increasing fuel efficiency, leading to flat gasoline consumption projections through 2024. The Congressional Budget Office expects Highway Trust Fund revenues to fall short of projected expenditures, with Congress providing $1.5 billion for infrastructure grants in FY2018. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $750 million for Transportation grants in FY2018, while the Senate-passed bill would provide $1 billion. The Senate Committee on Appropriations directed the Department of Transportation (DOT) to use the selection criteria from the FY2016 grant process and prohibited the use of an applicant's willingness to create new sources of nonfederal revenue as a criterion for grant selection. The Transportation grant program, originating from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, aims to address criticisms of federal transportation funding distribution. It allows for funding of projects with national or regional impacts, such as Amtrak's Gateway Program. The BUILD program provides grants for transportation projects of national, regional, or metropolitan significance, with a focus on regional and metropolitan projects. The program aims to fund projects like the Gateway Program, which includes the replacement of a deteriorating tunnel under the Hudson River. Funding for the $13 billion-plus project falls on New York and New Jersey. Congress has directed that BUILD/TIGER funds be distributed equitably across geographic areas, with low minimum grant thresholds. The program is oversubscribed, with critics arguing grants disproportionately favor urban areas. Congress has mandated that 20% of funding go to rural projects, in line with the rural population percentage. In FY2018, Congress increased rural funding to 30%. The House report for FY2019 specifies 33% for rural projects, while the Senate bill maintains the 30% from FY2018. Another 33% is allocated for seaport projects, and the remaining 33% for urban areas over 200,000 in population. The BUILD/TIGER grant process has shown a pattern of funding requests and appropriations in recent years. The Essential Air Service (EAS) program is funded through a combination of mandatory and discretionary budget authority, with a mandatory annual authorization of $140 million for FY2019. The Trump Administration requested $93 million in discretionary funding for the EAS program in FY2019. The Trump Administration requested $93 million for the EAS program in FY2019, while the House committee bill recommended $175 million, and the Senate-passed bill also recommends $175 million. This would result in a 10% increase over the FY2018 total funding level. The EAS program aims to maintain air service to small communities by subsidizing unprofitable routes. The program's cost has doubled since FY2008 due to route reductions and new communities being added. Congress made changes to the program in 2012. The EAS program, established in 1978, aims to maintain airline service to small communities by subsidizing unprofitable routes. Changes made in 2012 include capping subsidies, limiting routes, and allowing smaller planes. Supporters argue it promotes economic development, while critics note high subsidy costs and low passenger numbers at some airports. In 2008, Congress directed railroads to install positive train control (PTC) on certain segments of the national rail network by the end of 2015. PTC is a system to prevent incidents caused by operator or dispatcher error. Freight railroads have spent billions to meet this requirement, but most tracks were not compliant by 2015. Congress extended the deadline to 2018, with an option for extension to 2020 with FRA approval. Funding has been provided to help railroads with PTC installation. The Trump Administration did not include funding for PTC implementation in the FY2019 budget. The House-reported bill allocated $150 million for PTC projects, while the Senate-passed bill did not specify an amount but directed DOT to prioritize PTC projects. The Passenger Rail Reform and Investment Act of 2015 reauthorized Amtrak and changed its federal grant structure. The Passenger Rail Reform and Investment Act of 2015 reauthorized Amtrak and established new grant programs for intercity passenger rail development. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $1.9 billion for Amtrak and allocated $800 million for two new grant programs, along with $150 million for the Magnetic Levitation Technology Deployment Program. The Senate bill also proposed $1.9 billion for Amtrak. The Senate bill would provide $1.9 billion for Amtrak and $565 million for new grant programs, prioritizing PTC projects. Congress historically provided little funding for intercity passenger rail development, except for PTC implementation. Funding fluctuated from FY2009 to FY2017, with occasional appropriations for intercity passenger rail grants. Congress allocated $98 million for new intercity passenger rail grant programs, increasing to $863 million in FY2018. The Federal Transit Administration distributes the majority of its $13 billion funding to state and local transit agencies through formula-based programs. The Capital Investment Grants program, also known as New Starts, is the largest discretionary transit grant program, funding new fixed-guideway transit lines and extensions. It has three components: New Starts grants for projects over $300 million seeking over $100 million in federal funding, and Small Starts grants for projects under $300 million. The Small Starts grants are for capital projects under $300 million seeking less than $100 million in federal funding, while Core Capacity grants increase existing system capacity by at least 10%. An Expedited Project Delivery Pilot provides funding for eligible projects with a 25% federal share and public-private partnership support. Grant funds for large projects are disbursed over years, with funding committed to multiyear agreements signed in previous years. The Trump Administration requested $1.0 billion for Capital Investment Grants in FY2019, $1.6 billion less than FY2018. The Trump Administration requested $1.0 billion for Capital Investment Grants in FY2019, which is significantly less than the funding provided in FY2018. Congress has expressed concern about the Administration's approach to the CIG program, as it has shifted towards state and local governments being solely responsible for funding transit projects without federal contribution. The House Committee recommended $2.614 billion, slightly less than FY2018, while the Senate-passed bill would provide $2.553 billion. The Trump Administration has not requested federal funding for new transit projects in FY2018 or FY2019. Congress has provided more funding than requested for the CIG program, directing FTA to advance eligible projects. The Senate Appropriations Committee found that FTA has not complied with congressional directives for program improvements. The FTA is not complying with congressional directives to improve the CIG program, citing lack of funding for new projects. Concerns have been raised about unnecessary delays in project development, with accusations that FTA is deliberately prolonging the review process for transit projects despite receiving funding from Congress. The FTA is facing criticism for alleged delays in project reviews, leading to increased costs for project sponsors. Congressional directives have limited the federal share for New Starts projects, with the FY2019 bill proposing a federal share cap of 50%. Critics argue that this reduction may hinder transit project development compared to highway projects. The federal share for New Starts projects is typically 80% for highway projects, making them more attractive than public transportation projects. Advocates argue that a higher local match allows FTA to support more projects and encourages careful cost estimation. Most federal transportation funding is distributed by mode and to states by formula, posing challenges for funding transportation infrastructure. The federal transportation funding is distributed by mode and to states by formula, making it challenging for states to accumulate funding for major projects. One such project is Amtrak's Gateway Program, specifically the Hudson Tunnel replacement project, aimed at increasing rail service capacity between northern New Jersey and Manhattan. The Gateway Program aims to improve rail service capacity between northern New Jersey and Manhattan by replacing bridges, expanding track capacity, and adding a new rail tunnel under the Hudson River. The estimated cost is at least $24 billion, with the new Hudson River Tunnel alone costing $11.1 billion. Funding for intercity rail projects has been limited, but the new tunnel is eligible for DOT funding from both intercity rail and public transportation programs. Relatively little funding has been available for intercity rail projects in recent years. The largest rail grant program in FY2017 was funded at $68 million, which increased to $593 million in FY2018. The Capital Investment Grants program has $2.6 billion in funding in FY2018, but competition for that funding is intense. In 2016, an agreement was reached between DOT, Amtrak, and the States of New Jersey and New York to share the costs of building the new Hudson Tunnel. The Trump Administration has indicated it does not feel bound by the previous agreement, leaving the decision up to Congress. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees did not mention the Gateway Program or Hudson Tunnel project in their FY2019 THUD committee reports. However, they recommended significant funding for rail and transit grant programs that Gateway projects could be eligible for. Additionally, they suggested $240 million more for Amtrak's Northeast Corridor account than what Amtrak requested for FY2019. The Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 authorized $1.5 billion over 10 years in grants to the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) for maintenance and capital grants, to be matched by funding from DC, Maryland, and Virginia. This funding is in addition to the approximately $310 million WMATA receives under FTA formula programs. The Senate Appropriation Committee's report noted the final installment of the $1.5 billion funding commitment for WMATA in FY2018. The Administration requested $120 million for FY2019, with the House and Senate recommending $150 million. Both committees directed WMATA to work on extending the grant authorization and implementing wireless service throughout the rail system. WMATA is facing maintenance backlog due to inadequate investment. WMATA is dealing with a maintenance backlog due to inadequate investment over the years, leading to safety concerns and fatal incidents. FTA has restricted WMATA's use of federal funds due to mismanagement, assuming oversight of safety compliance in 2015. FTA continues to conduct inspections and direct federal funds towards improving safety. FTA notified jurisdictions of withholding funds until new safety oversight program is established. Metrorail Safety Commission created, but must be operational for funds release. NTSB recommends FRA oversee WMATA's rail operations. Congress may need to act for FRA authority. FTA has the authority to oversee WMATA, but Congress may need to act to give FRA the same authority."
