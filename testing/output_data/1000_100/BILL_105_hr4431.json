    "content": "The \"HIV Partner Protection Act\" is cited as the short title. It amends the Public Health Service Act to include a section on partner notification for HIV health care services. For fiscal year 2000 and subsequent years, the Secretary will not grant funds to a State unless the State complies with partner notification requirements for individuals with HIV disease and mandates reporting of positive test results to the State public health officer by health entities conducting HIV tests. The program for partner notification of individuals with HIV disease includes providing partners with an opportunity to learn about their exposure without revealing the infected individuals' identities. Counseling and testing for HIV are offered to partners and infected individuals, covering modes of transmission and prevention. Counseling and referrals are provided to infected individuals, including information on therapeutic measures and prevention. Notifications are given in person, with no penalties for non-cooperation in identifying partners. The State program allows for reporting of infected individuals without penalties for errors. Civil liability is not imposed for good faith reporting. The State can notify partners without consent of the infected individual. State insurance laws regarding testing are also addressed. State insurance laws prohibit insurers from penalizing individuals who undergo testing for HIV disease. This requirement must be met for States to receive grants under this program. The curr_chunk discusses the definitions related to HIV disease, including terms like 'infected individual' and 'partner'. It also mentions delayed applicability for certain states regarding insurance regulations. The curr_chunk states that if a state's legislature does not meet in fiscal year 1999 or 2000, certain grant requirements will only apply from fiscal year 2001 onwards. The Secretary of Health and Human Services may provide grants to States to assist with the costs of implementing partner notification programs for HIV. $10,000,000 is authorized to be appropriated annually from 2000 to 2004 for this purpose."
