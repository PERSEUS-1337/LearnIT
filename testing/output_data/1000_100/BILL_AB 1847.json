    "title": "AB 1847",
    "content": "The people of California enact the following. The Legislature amended Section 19851 of the Revenue and Taxation Code to address the low participation in the federal Earned Income Tax Credit program. In 2015, California authorized a state EITC to help the poorest working Californians. To alleviate the tax burden on working poor persons and families, enhance their wages and income, and ensure California receives its share of federal Earned Income Tax Credit funds, the state will provide information on the availability of federal and state EITC credits. This will be done through notices from employers and state departments to eligible taxpayers. To ensure eligible Californians claim both federal and state EITC, Section 19852 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to define terms like \"Employer,\" \"Employee,\" \"Federal EITC,\" and \"California EITC.\" The amended section requires state departments and agencies to notify individuals eligible for federal and California EITC through programs like free or reduced-price meals, unemployment insurance, and Medi-Cal. Employers must inform employees about EITC eligibility when providing annual wage summaries. State departments and agencies must notify program recipients annually about potential eligibility for federal and California EITC, either in January through April or during regular contact. Communication can be done through various means to reach eligible individuals indirectly if necessary. The method for providing notice to recipients of federal and California EITC eligibility must contain the same language as described in Section 19854. The employer must provide notification directly to the employee or by mail, including instructions on obtaining IRS and Franchise Tax Board notices. Posting on a bulletin board or sending through office mail does not satisfy the notification requirement. These methods are encouraged to inform all employees about federal and California EITC. The amendments to Section 19854 of the Revenue and Taxation Code regarding notices about federal and California EITC will apply to notices given after the effective date of the act. Based on your annual earnings, you may be eligible for the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) from the federal government. The EITC is a refundable federal income tax credit for low-income working individuals and families. It does not affect certain welfare benefits. You must file a federal tax return to receive the EITC, even if you don't owe federal taxes. Contact the Internal Revenue Service for more information on eligibility and how to obtain necessary forms. The California Earned Income Tax Credit (California EITC) is available starting from the 2015 tax year for low-income working individuals and families. To claim the California EITC, you must file a California income tax return and complete the California EITC form (FTB 3514). Contact the Franchise Tax Board for more information on eligibility and how to obtain the necessary forms. Amendments to this section apply to notices furnished after the effective date of the act."
