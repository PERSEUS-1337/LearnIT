    "content": "The Office on Violence Against Women (OVW) administers programs under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) of 1994, providing financial and technical assistance to improve criminal justice responses to domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking. The Obama Administration's FY2017 request for OVW was $489 million, with proposed increases for grants in various areas. The Obama Administration's FY2017 request for the Office on Violence Against Women (OVW) included funding increases for grants to combat violence on college campuses, abuse against the elderly, and tribal justice systems' response to domestic violence on tribal lands. New initiatives proposed were reducing firearm lethality in domestic violence cases and enhancing colleges' and universities' responses to campus sexual assault. Congress adopted a $326 million transfer from the Crime Victims Fund for OVW in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017, but largely declined to support other proposals. Congress largely declined to support the Obama Administration's proposals for increased funding for grants to combat domestic violence. Funding for STOP grants remained at the FY2016 level in FY2017. The Office of Justice Programs manages various grant programs. The Research, Evaluation, and Statistics account (formerly the Justice Assistance account) funds the operations of the Bureau of Justice Statistics and the National Institute of Justice. The Obama Administration requested a $154 million budget for FY2017, a 32.8% increase from FY2016. This includes funding increases for the Bureau of Justice Statistics, the National Institute of Justice, and new initiatives such as a clearinghouse for evidence-based programs and an incident-based crime statistics program. Congress provided $89 million for this account. The FY2017 funding for the Law Enforcement Assistance account decreased by 23.3% due to Congress reallocating funds. This account supports various grant programs to enhance state, local, and tribal criminal justice systems, including the JAG program, Drug Courts program, SCAAP, and DNA backlog reduction grants. The Obama Administration's FY2017 request for this account was $1.098 billion, 22.1% less than the previous year's appropriation. The Obama Administration proposed significant cuts to various criminal justice programs in the FY2017 budget, including eliminating funding for SCAAP, the Coverdell Forensic Sciences Program, grants for trafficking victims, the John R. Justice program, and tribal assistance. However, they planned to fund grants for trafficking victims through the Crime Victims Fund and support tribal justice programs with 7% of funding from other accounts. Additionally, there was a reduction in funding for the JAG program. The Obama Administration proposed cuts to various criminal justice programs in the FY2017 budget, including eliminating funding for security at Presidential Nominating Conventions, National Criminal History Improvement program, and DNA backlog reduction initiatives. However, they also proposed increasing funding for reentry initiatives, programs for children exposed to violence, grants for substance abuse treatment, and programs for people with mental illness in the criminal justice system. Additionally, new programs were requested, such as funding for the Byrne Incentive Grant program. The Byrne Incentive Grant program proposed supplemental grants for JAG program grantees using evidence-based initiatives, along with funding for the Byrne Competitive Grant program, grants for courts and justice agencies, the Violence Reduction Network, and grants for various programs. Congress reduced funding for the State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance account by 9.1%, or $128 million, for FY2017. Funding for the JAG program decreased from $347 million for FY2016 to $335 million for FY2017. The Consolidated Appropriations Act eliminated funding for tribal assistance programs (-$30 million). Congress authorized DOJ to use up to 7% of the funding available under the State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance, Juvenile Justice Programs, and Community Oriented Policing Services account for tribal justice assistance programs. Additionally, $103 million was provided for an opioid initiative, with funding coming from various existing programs such as Drug Courts, Veterans Treatment Courts, and programs addressing mental illness in the criminal justice system. In FY2016, Congress allocated $13 million for opioid programs authorized by the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016. The Juvenile Justice Programs account received funding for grant programs to reduce juvenile delinquency. The Obama Administration requested a 23.8% increase in funding for the Juvenile Justice Programs account in FY2017. In FY2017, the Obama Administration proposed increased funding for various juvenile justice programs, including the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act, Title V grants, and the Community-based Violence Prevention Initiative. They also requested funding restoration for Juvenile Accountability Block Grants and proposed a Smart on Juvenile Justice Initiative. However, funding for youth mentoring grants, investigation and prosecution of child abuse programs, and missing and exploited children programs were reduced. Congress appropriated $247 million for Juvenile Justice Programs in FY2017, an 8.6% reduction from the previous year. In FY2017, Congress reduced funding for some programs under the Juvenile Justice Programs account, including JJDPA Part B state formula grants, youth mentoring grants, and Title V grants. They also funded the Community-based Violence Prevention Initiative as a set-aside from the Title V grant program. Additionally, Congress declined to fund any new programs proposed by the Obama Administration. The Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) Office awards grants to law enforcement agencies for hiring new officers, training in community policing, purchasing crime-fighting technologies, and testing innovative policing strategies. The Obama Administration requested a $74 million increase in funding for the COPS program in FY2017. Congress appropriated $222 million for the COPS account, with a 4.5% increase compared to FY2016. Funding for the COPS hiring program remained unchanged at $137 million after set-asides. Congress also provided a $3 million increase for the Anti-heroin Task Forces program. In FY2017, Congress allocated funding for the Regional Information Sharing System (RISS) under the COPS account, with a requirement for the funds to be transferred to OJP. Additionally, $8 million was set aside from the COPS hiring program for the POLICE Act of 2016, allowing grants to be used for active shooter training. The Administration requested $500 million for the 21st Century Justice Initiative, a proposed program aimed at criminal justice reform efforts. The Administration proposed the 21st Century Justice Initiative with a focus on reducing crime, reforming sentencing laws, promoting community policing, and providing diversion and reentry services. However, Congress did not allocate funding for this program."
