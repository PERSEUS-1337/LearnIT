The fee for filing a trademark registration application will be $245, effective upon enactment, with any fee adjustments not effective before October 1, 1994. SEC. 5. Interim patent extensions. Section 156 of title 35, United States Code is amended to allow for interim patent extensions if the regulatory review period extends beyond the patent expiration date. The owner or agent can apply for an extension 6 months before the term expires. The application for an interim patent extension must be submitted 6 months before the term expires and should include details such as the product under review, the patent being sought for extension, activities undertaken during the regulatory review period, and any additional information required by the Commissioner. The Commissioner may require patent information. If a patent is eligible for extension, a notice will be published, and an interim extension certificate may be issued for up to 1 year. The owner can apply for up to 4 subsequent interim extensions, except in certain cases where only 1 extension is allowed. Each subsequent application for interim extension must be made within 60 days before the expiration of the preceding extension. The certificate of interim extension will be recorded in the patent file. Any interim extension granted will end 60 days after the product receives permission for commercial use, but can be further extended if additional information is provided within that period. The patent term can be extended for up to 5 years or until the product receives approval for commercial use. During the extension period, the rights derived from the patent are limited to the specific uses or methods under regulatory review. SEC. 6. CONFORMING AMENDMENTS. Amendments are made to Section 156 of title 35, United States Code, including changes to subsections (a), (b), and (e). SEC. 7. PATENT TERM EXTENSIONS FOR AMERICAN LEGION.

SEC. 8. INTERVENING RIGHTS. The renewals and extensions of patents under section 6 will not infringe on any use of the patent's subject matter that began after the patent expired but before the enactment of this Act."
