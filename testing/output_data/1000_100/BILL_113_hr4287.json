    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Independent Innovator and Repurposing Act\" and includes an extension of patent term for the method of using biological products. Extension for Regulatory Delay: A patent claiming a method of using a biological product can be extended for 5 years from the original expiration date if certain conditions are met. The owner of the patent must submit an application for extension, and the patent must not have expired or been previously extended. To apply for a patent extension for a biological product, the owner or agent must submit an application to the Director with specific information about the patent and the product. The application must demonstrate that the patent was issued to an independent innovator, and the owner is either the innovator or a qualified small business with ties to the innovator. Additionally, evidence of an application under section 351(a) of the Public Health Service Act must be provided. The owner of a biological product patent must provide a brief description of activities undertaken during a specific period, including significant dates, to apply for a patent extension. The Director determines patent extension eligibility based on application representations. If approved, a 5-year extension certificate is issued and recorded in the patent file. An interim extension may also be granted. The Director may grant an interim extension of up to one year for a patent if its term would expire before a determination on extension eligibility is made. Definitions include \"biological product\" and \"Director.\" The United States Patent and Trademark Office defines an \"independent innovator\" as a person or entity who obtains a method of use patent for a biological product and is not affiliated with the holder of a marketing application approved for the commercial marketing of the product. The term \"affiliated\" includes relationships of employment, control, or common ownership. The term \"qualified small business\" refers to an entity with fewer than 500 employees, not affiliated with the holder of a marketing application for a biological product. This section will be effective upon the enactment of the Act and applies to any unexpired patent issued before or after that date."
