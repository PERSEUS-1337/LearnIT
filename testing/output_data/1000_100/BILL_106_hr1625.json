    "content": "The \"Human Rights Information Act\" may be cited as the short title of this legislation. The findings section of the Act highlights key information related to human rights. Congress finds that the national and international protection of human rights is a fundamental value of democracy, as enshrined in the Bill of Rights. Federal agencies possess documents on human rights violations abroad, which foreign authorities need for investigation and prosecution. The United States will continue to receive requests for legal assistance on human rights from foreign authorities. The United States receives requests from foreign authorities for legal assistance on human rights violations, including declassification of documents. Recently, a Spanish court magistrate requested information on General Augusto Pinochet. The US follows procedures outlined in Presidential directives and executive orders for declassification requests. Strengthening existing declassification procedures, including the Freedom of Information Act, is crucial for protecting and promoting human rights nationally and internationally. The expedient declassification of human rights documents in compliance with US security interests will protect global human rights, strengthen international rule of law, enhance accountability of Federal agencies, and save Government resources. The US's commitment to promoting human rights globally involves diplomatic, economic, and military efforts to end human rights violations, supported by NGOs and US citizens. The United States promotes human rights and democracy in foreign countries, but these efforts are hindered if there is impunity for human rights violations. It is crucial for newly established democratic societies to investigate and prosecute human rights violations to prevent the need for renewed US engagements in those areas. This can involve creating truth commissions, appointing human rights officers, or conducting national investigations with the involvement of civil society organizations. The United States has played a key role in ending impunity for human rights violations globally by supporting various international war crimes tribunals and ratifying the Convention against Torture. This includes providing assistance in criminal proceedings related to acts of torture. The United States, as a member State of the Organization of American States, should adopt measures to ensure free access to information in investigations of international crimes and human rights violations. The Guatemalan peace accords, supported by the US, included an investigation on human rights violations and acts of violence. The Clarification Commission in Guatemala recommended utilizing all resources to find the disappeared and return their remains to relatives. Two days after presenting an investigation, Bishop Juan Jose Gerardi was assassinated. President Clinton acknowledged the wrongs of supporting military forces involved in repression in Guatemala and pledged to support peace efforts. The National Commissioner for Human Rights in Honduras has been seeking US documentation on human rights violations since 1993, with some aspects still pending. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"human rights record\" refers to information on gross violations of human rights post-1944 held by US Government. \"Agency\" includes entities handling foreign policy or intelligence. The term \"gross violations of internationally recognized human rights\" is defined in section 502B(d)(1) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. SEC. 4. IDENTIFICATION, REVIEW, AND PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF HUMAN RIGHTS RECORDS REGARDING GUATEMALA AND HONDURAS. The Act governs the declassification and public disclosure of human rights records by agencies, specifically focusing on activities in Guatemala and Honduras after 1944. Agencies must identify, review, and organize these records for declassification within 120 days. The President must report to Congress on agency compliance within 150 days. Grounds for postponement of public disclosure of records are outlined in section 5. An agency can delay public disclosure of a human rights record if it poses a serious threat to national security, such as revealing the identity of an intelligence agent or a method used by the government. The public disclosure of a human rights record can be delayed if it would interfere with intelligence activities, impair national security, reveal the identity of a confidential informant, or constitute an unwarranted invasion of privacy. The postponement of disclosing a human rights record can be justified if it would compromise intelligence activities, national security, or confidentiality agreements, outweighing the public interest. It is not a valid reason to delay disclosure if an individual was an intelligence asset, unless specific criteria are met. The term \"intelligence asset\" refers to a covert agent as defined in the National Security Act of 1947. SEC. 6. REQUEST FOR HUMAN RIGHTS RECORDS FROM OFFICIAL ENTITIES IN OTHER COUNTRIES. When a US agency receives a request for human rights records from certain international entities or countries investigating human rights violations, they must review and disclose the records according to the standards in this Act. SEC. 7. REVIEW OF DECISIONS TO WITHHOLD RECORDS. The Appeals Panel reviews agency determinations to postpone public disclosure of human rights records. They direct disclosure unless there is clear evidence the record is not a human rights record or qualifies for postponement. The Appeals Panel reviews agency decisions to postpone disclosure of human rights records. If the Panel agrees with the agency's decision, they will determine alternative forms of disclosure, such as disclosing a portion of the record after deletion or providing a substitute record. Upon completion of its review, the Appeals Panel notifies the agency head of its determination and publishes it in the Federal Register within 14 days. The Panel also informs the President with a written justification, including an explanation of the standards applied. The Appeals Panel publishes guidelines for adjudicating appeals in the Federal Register. The President has the authority to review Panel determinations based on set standards and must provide a written certification of the decision within 30 days. The President's decision on disclosure postponement must be based on set standards outlined in section 5. The Appeals Panel will publish any materials related to the postponement in the Federal Register. SEC. 8. The Information Security Policy Advisory Council will report to Congress on declassifying human rights records of other countries after reviewing Guatemala and Honduras records. SEC. 9. The Act does not limit the right to file requests or seek judicial review under the Freedom of Information Act. SEC. 10. Creation of positions. SEC. 10. Creation of 2 additional positions in the Appeals Panel for individuals with substantial human rights expertise appointed by the President with recommendations from human rights organizations."
