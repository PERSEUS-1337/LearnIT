    "content": "This report outlines the Department of Defense's alternative fuel initiatives, including testing, evaluation, and certification of alternative fuels for military use. The Navy plans to promote domestic biofuel production with a $170 million investment. The services have collectively spent $48 million on alternative fuels and continue to invest in testing and demonstrations. The report provides an overview of the Department of Defense's alternative fuels policy, including purchases and testing platforms for alternative fuel blends. It also discusses the Navy's biofuel production initiative under the Defense Production Act and recent legislative actions related to DOD alternative fuels efforts. Section 314 of the FY2012 National Defense Authorization Act assigned oversight of DOD's alternative fuels initiatives to the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Operational Energy Plans and Programs, providing specific responsibility at the DOD-wide level. The Assistant Secretary is required to lead DOD's alternative fuel activities, oversee investments, and make recommendations for development. For more details on the Navy Biofuel Initiative and DOD's operational energy efforts, refer to CRS Report R42568 and R42558 respectively. The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Operational Energy Plans and Programs oversees DOD's alternative fuel investments, issues guidelines to streamline investments, and encourages collaboration with other federal agencies. The goals of DOD's alternative fuels policy are to ensure military readiness, improve battlespace effectiveness, and increase fuel source diversity. Specific considerations include resilience against supply disruptions and mitigating the impact of petroleum price fluctuations. The DOD's alternative fuels policy aims to increase resilience against supply disruptions, mitigate petroleum price volatility, and enhance expeditionary effectiveness. Alternative fuels must be \"drop-in,\" cost-competitive, and available in sufficient quantities. Other criteria include non-food crop feedstock production and lower lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions. DOD investments in alternative fuel activities must be certified as part of the annual operational energy budget process. The DOD's alternative fuels policy aims to increase resilience against supply disruptions, mitigate petroleum price volatility, and enhance expeditionary effectiveness. Alternative fuels must be \"drop-in,\" cost-competitive, and available in sufficient quantities. DOD investments in alternative fuel activities must be certified as part of the annual operational energy budget process. The annual operational energy report must now incorporate alternative fuels initiatives, including descriptions, funding, and expenditures. Future investments in alternative fuels will be subject to a \"rigorous, merit-based evaluation.\" DOD alternative fuels development initiatives will generally follow three phases: Certification, Field Demonstration, and Implementation. The DOD's alternative fuels policy aims to increase resilience against supply disruptions, mitigate petroleum price volatility, and enhance expeditionary effectiveness. Alternative fuels must be \"drop-in,\" cost-competitive, and available in sufficient quantities. DOD investments in alternative fuel activities must be certified as part of the annual operational energy budget process. The annual operational energy report must now incorporate alternative fuels initiatives, including descriptions, funding, and expenditures. Future investments in alternative fuels will be subject to a \"rigorous, merit-based evaluation.\" Each military service has set goals for alternative fuels, with the Army aiming to increase the use of renewable/alternative energy as outlined in the Army Energy Security Implementation Strategy. The Air Force aims to increase the use of renewable/alternative energy sources by setting specific goals for power generation and fuel requirements. By 2028, they plan to have 25% of energy for power generation and 50% of fuel for the tactical mobility fleet derived from alternative sources. They also aim to acquire 50% of domestic aviation fuel requirements from alternative fuel blends by 2016. Additionally, they plan to test and certify all aircraft and systems on a 50:50 alternative fuel blend by 2012. The Navy has set ambitious goals for alternative fuels, including deploying a \"Great Green Fleet\" by 2016 and meeting 50% of energy consumption from alternative sources by 2020. The fleet includes nuclear-powered and biofuel-run ships and aircraft. The Navy plans to reduce liquid fuel usage to 38 million barrels per year, with nuclear power providing 11 million barrels by 2020. The Department of Defense aims to replace 8 million barrels of petroleum with alternative fuels by 2020 to meet the goal of 50% alternative energy consumption. DLA Energy has procured 1.9 million gallons of alternative fuels for the Army, Navy, and Air Force since 2007, totaling $48 million in purchases for testing engine performance and certification. The services have purchased various types of alternative fuels, including Fischer-Tropsch fuels and biofuels, to meet their energy needs. The Department of Defense has purchased various types of alternative fuels, including hydrotreated jet and diesel biofuels, alcohol-to-jet fuels, direct-sugar-to-hydrocarbons fuels, and fuels created via the Fischer-Tropsch process. Section 526 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 prohibits federal agencies from entering into contracts for alternative fuels with high greenhouse gas emissions. This excludes coal-to-liquid fuels, which have significantly higher emissions than conventional petroleum fuels. The Department of Defense has purchased alternative fuels with high greenhouse gas emissions, excluding coal-to-liquid fuels. DOD's position is that EISA section 526 does not apply to fuel purchases without specified sources in the contract. The Army, Navy, and Air Force are testing alternative fuel blends for fleet-wide use, including Fischer-Tropsch synthetic paraffinic kerosene and hydrotreated renewable jet. The Army aims to certify these fuels by 2014 and is working on Air Force certification for H-60 Black Hawk helicopters. The Army and Air Force are testing alternative fuel blends for fleet-wide use, including Fischer-Tropsch synthetic paraffinic kerosene and hydrotreated renewable jet. The Army aims to certify these fuels by 2014 and is working on Air Force certification for H-60 Black Hawk helicopters. Army intends to complete testing of tactical ground equipment systems for alternative fuels by the end of FY2014. Air Force has certified Fischer-Tropsch fuel blends for its fleets and is testing biofuels and alcohol-to-jet fuels. The Air Force conducted the first flight powered by an ATJ-conventional fuel blend in June 2012. The Navy has tested HEFA 50:50 biofuel blends for aircraft and ships, with certification expected in early 2013. Testing of Fischer-Tropsch fuels is set to be completed by the end of 2013, while other alternative fuels will continue to be tested in the future. In June 2011, the Navy, Energy, and Agriculture signed a MOU to support a sustainable biofuels industry. The MOU aims to overcome economic challenges and competitive barriers in the crude oil market by investing in advanced drop-in biofuel production. The initiative will be funded with $340 million under the Defense Production Act. The Navy, Energy, and Agriculture plan to fund a biofuels production initiative with $510 million over three years, with equal cost-sharing from industry. The Defense Production Act will be used to support this project, with additional funding from the Department of Agriculture. The Funding Opportunity Announcement for this initiative was released in June 2012 with an initial government funding amount of $210 million. The government funding for biofuels production facilities was announced in June 2012, totaling $210 million. The initiative includes two phases: Phase 1 involves planning and preliminary designs with awards of up to $6 million each, while Phase 2 includes construction and testing with awards of up to $70 million each. Successful proposals require 50% cost share, domestic production of advanced biofuels, compliance with regulations, use of renewable feedstock, production of drop-in fuel, cost-competitiveness with petroleum-based fuels, and a production capacity of at least 10 million gallons. The FOA funding level of $210 million includes $100 million from DOD, $70 million for the Navy's biofuels production initiative, and $40 million from DOE. It does not include $171 million of USDA funding for bio-based jet fuel production. The USDA and the Commodity Credit Corporation have the authority to increase the use of agricultural commodities without specific congressional appropriations. Legislative activity in 2012 focused on DOD's alternative fuels efforts, including proposals to expand or limit DOD's ability to purchase alternative fuels. H.R. 4310 contained provisions exempting DOD from certain requirements related to alternative fuels. The Senate passed S. 3254 without restrictions on DOD's purchase of alternative fuels. Amendments restricting DOD's abilities were removed during floor debate. Section 315 of H.R. 4310 states the amounts available to DOD for fiscal year 2013. The Defense Production Act of 1950 restricts funds for biofuels production until matching contributions are received from the Department of Energy and Department of Agriculture. The Navy and Department of Energy requested $70 million and $40 million for a joint biofuels production initiative in FY2013. The USDA portion of the funds would come from the Commodity Credit Corporation. The Navy requested $70 million for advanced drop-in biofuels production in FY2013, but the House Appropriations Committee declined to fund it. The Senate recommended funding the overall Defense Production Act Fund at $100 million over the budget request, totaling $189 million, with no specific mention of biofuel production. The Department of Defense, Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 includes $63.5 million in DPA funding. The Defense Production Act Fund received $223.5 million in appropriations under H.R. 933 / P.L. 113-6, with $60 million allocated for advanced drop-in biofuels production and $20 million for coal to liquid fuels research in the Air Force. The House and Senate explanatory statements reduced biofuel production funding by $10 million. The Energy Independence and Security Act provision was not included in the final bill. The conferees allocated $20 million for research to improve emissions of coal to liquid fuel in the Air Force, aiming to make it a competitive alternative energy resource. The Secretary of the Air Force must inform congressional defense committees before using these funds. The Department of Energy requested to transfer $40 million to the Defense Production Act Fund in FY2013. The Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act (H.R. 5325) passed on June 6, 2012, does not authorize the Department of Energy to transfer funds to the Defense Production Act Fund. In contrast, the Senate version (S. 2465) allows for up to $100 million transfer from Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy funds. The Department of Energy funding under the Department of Defense, Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 (H.R. 933/P.L. 113-6) was approximately $1.8 billion. The DOD and services' alternative fuels initiatives raise oversight questions for Congress. The curr_chunk raises oversight questions for Congress regarding alternative fuels, including benefits over conventional fuels, funding for testing efforts, coordination between services, and the impact of a $510 million investment in the biofuel industry. It also questions whether biofuel investment should be left to private industry or other government agencies. The curr_chunk raises questions about the coordination and oversight of alternative fuel goals within the military services and potential overlap with other federal agencies. The curr_chunk discusses the FY2012 Department of Defense Appropriations Act, which included $150 million for DPA Title III funding. The Act supported DOD biofuels initiatives and encouraged longer contract terms for biofuels procurement. The FY2012 Department of Defense Appropriations Act supported DOD biofuels initiatives and encouraged longer contract terms for biofuels procurement, including multi-year contracts with purchase periods up to 15 years to maximize efficiencies of scale for the best purchase price. The conferees aim to position the Department of Energy to benefit from advancements in energy technology, suggesting extended multi-year contracts for biofuel products to maximize efficiencies. The FY2013 Department of Energy Appropriations Act includes provisions for transferring funds to support pilot-scale projects for larger-scale production. The House Appropriations Act, FY2013, did not authorize DOE to transfer money into the Defense Production Act Fund. The Committee recommended $203,000,000 for Biomass and Biorefinery Systems R&D, directing the Department to focus on technologies for producing fuels and electricity from biomass and crops. The budget request proposed funding for a joint initiative with the Navy and Department of Agriculture to develop commercial biofuels. The Department of Energy has not justified funding for a Defense initiative to develop biofuels with the Navy and Department of Agriculture. The recommendation includes no funding for the proposed initiative. (p. 85-86) In FY2013, the Senate Appropriations Committee Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act provides for potential transfer of funds to the Defense Production Act Fund for Department of Energy activities. The report (S.Rept. 112-164 of April 26, 2012) supports the joint biofuel production initiative by the DOD, DOE, and USDA for military use. The collaboration aims to develop innovative technologies for jet and diesel fuels, with the Department of Defense as an early adopter to encourage wider marketplace acceptance. Two provisions of H.R. 4310 affect the Department of Defense's procurement and production of biofuels: exemption from alternative fuel procurement requirement and limitation on funds for procurement of alternative fuel in fiscal year 2013. The cost of producing or purchasing alternative fuels may exceed traditional fossil fuels for the same purpose. The Secretary of Defense can purchase limited quantities of alternative fuels for fleet certification. S. 3254 does not restrict the Department of Defense's ability to procure biofuels. The Senate passed amendments to strike provisions limiting the Department of Defense's ability to purchase alternative fuels with higher costs than traditional fossil fuels from S. 3254. Senator Mark Udall sponsored one amendment, and Senator Hagan sponsored another, both of which were passed by the Senate. The Senate Armed Services Committee adopted amendments to prohibit the Department of Defense from entering into contracts for biofuels refinery infrastructure without specific authorization. Senator Inhofe and Senator McCain sponsored the amendments, which were approved by votes of 13-12. Another amendment by Senator Inhofe, which would have exempted the Department of Defense from a provision prohibiting the purchase of alternative fuels with higher greenhouse gas emissions, failed in a tie vote of 13-13. This was similar to a provision in H.R. 4310 passed by the House. The House Armed Services Committee reported and passed two stricken sections related to the limitation on funds for procurement of alternative fuel. The sections specify that funds for the Department of Defense in fiscal year 2013 cannot be used for alternative fuel if its cost exceeds that of traditional fossil fuel for the same purpose, with an exception for limited quantities necessary for specific purposes. The Secretary of Defense is authorized to purchase limited quantities of alternative fuels for engine or fleet certification using competitive procedures to ensure the best price. Construction of biofuel refineries by the Department of Defense is prohibited unless specifically authorized by law. The House Armed Services Committee recommends a provision to limit funds for procurement of alternative fuel if its cost exceeds that of traditional fossil fuel, with exceptions for specific purposes. The committee recommends prohibiting the use of funds for the production or purchase of alternative fuels if the cost exceeds that of traditional fossil fuels, except for testing purposes. The Department of Defense made a significant biofuel purchase to demonstrate the capability of using alternative fuels. The committee supports Department of Defense initiatives to reduce fuel demand through new technologies, citing the impact of fuel costs on readiness accounts. They express concern about budget pressures and emphasize the need for affordable, fuel-efficient technologies. The committee is concerned about the use of operation and maintenance funds for biofuels in defense budgets. They direct the Secretary of Defense to provide guidance on the difference between using alternative fuels operationally versus for research. Additionally, there are limitations on using Defense Production Act funds for biofuel refinery construction. The Department of Defense may not use funds for biofuel refinery construction until matching contributions are received from the Department of Energy and Department of Agriculture. $70,000,000 is allocated for advanced drop-in biofuel production in the 2013 fiscal year. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommends no funding for the Defense Production Act account in fiscal year 2013, urging the Secretary of Defense to request it in future years when it can be executed in a timely manner. Additionally, the Committee provides an extra $100 million for the DPA fund in FY2013, recognizing its importance in strengthening U.S. defense. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommends no funding for the Defense Production Act account in fiscal year 2013, urging the Secretary of Defense to request it in future years when it can be executed in a timely manner. The Committee increases funding for DPA by $100,000,000 over the budget request, directing that the additional funding be competitively awarded to new initiatives and giving priority to completion of DPA projects initiated in prior years. The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics is directed to inform the congressional defense committees 30 days prior to any obligation or expenditure of these funds. The Department of Defense, Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 appropriates $223,531,000 for the Defense Production Act Fund, an increase of about $134.3 million. The Defense Production Act Fund received $223,531,000 in funding, an increase of $134.3 million over the amount requested. The funding for advanced drop-in biofuels was reduced by $10 million, with an appropriation of $60 million. Additionally, $20 million was allocated for research into lowering emissions of coal to liquid fuels in the Air Force's Research & Development. The conferees did not include a provision regarding the Energy Independence and Security Act but provided $20 million for research to improve emissions of coal to liquid fuel. The Air Force received $20 million for research to improve emissions of coal to liquid fuel, aiming to make it a competitive alternative energy resource. The Secretary of the Air Force must inform congressional defense committees before using these funds."
