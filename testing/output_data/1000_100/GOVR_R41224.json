Issues of consolidation and industry concentration are prominent, leading to public workshops by the USDA and Department of Justice to address competition and antitrust enforcement. A workshop focusing on the dairy industry is scheduled for June 25, 2010, in Madison, WI. This report offers insights into the structure of the U.S. dairy industry, financial challenges faced by dairy farmers, and the historical evolution of the industry. The dairy industry in the U.S. is facing consolidation and concentration issues, leading to financial stress for dairy farmers. In 2009, the federal government spent over $1 billion to support the industry through various programs, with an additional $350 million granted in supplemental payments. Antitrust laws and recent activity aimed at the dairy industry are also outlined. Despite government support and program payments, the number of U.S. dairy farms decreased by 3% in 2009 to 65,000 farms. This led to a decline in dairy cows and milk production, but an increase in milk prices to $15.10 per hundredweight in March 2010. Dairy farmers still face financial concerns due to lost equity and high feed prices. The financial stress of 2009 and similar episodes have prompted the dairy industry and Congress to reconsider options for handling fluctuations in milk prices and income for farmers. The evolution of the U.S. dairy industry over the last 100 years has led to a national market, with advancements in milk marketing playing a significant role. Government intervention has also shaped the industry's history, with ongoing concerns about consolidation and concentration. The dairy industry in the U.S. has evolved over the last century, leading to a national market. Government intervention and the formation of cooperative associations have played a significant role in shaping the industry. The Capper-Volstead Act of 1922 provided limited exemption from antitrust liability to farmer cooperatives, leading to the implementation of \"classified pricing\" for milk. During the Great Depression, demand for milk dropped sharply, causing the breakdown of the classified pricing system. Federal milk marketing orders (FMMOs) were established to stabilize the market and ensure adequate milk supplies at reasonable prices. Import quotas on dairy products were enacted to protect producers from foreign competition. The government began supporting milk prices in the late 1940s to prevent price declines. Advancements in milk marketing have transformed the U.S. dairy industry over the past century. In the early 20th century, raw milk was transported to processing plants by truck or rail, with milk primarily bottled for home delivery. Various dairy programs, such as the Dairy Product Price Support Program (DPPSP), Dairy Export Incentives Program (DEIP), and Milk Income Loss Contract (MILC), have been implemented to protect against price declines and support dairy producers. In the early 20th century, milk was primarily bottled for home delivery, but advancements in transportation and packaging led to a shift towards retail sales in stores by the 1970s. Improved roadways and larger trucks allowed for national distribution of milk and dairy products, moving away from the historical local production and consumption model. The dairy industry has faced challenges in the relationship between farm and retail prices, with a decrease in the farm value share causing concern among Congress. Factors such as increased productivity, demand for value-added products, and changes in food marketing have contributed to a declining farm share of the retail food dollar. The farm share of the retail food dollar for all farm products was 41% in 1950, decreasing to 18.5% in 2006. Milk and dairy products have a farm share of approximately one-third of the retail dollar, higher than the all-food average due to lower processing. The trend for milk and dairy products remained flat between 2000 and 2008. The trend for milk and dairy products was generally flat between 2000 and 2008. Farm-share trend was flat for whole milk, butter, and ice cream, with a slight uptrend for cheddar cheese. In 2008 and early 2009, there was a decline in the farm-value share of retail product values and a widening of the marketing margin. Retailers reduced prices in 2009 amid lower costs for farm milk and other inputs. In 2009, retailers lowered prices due to decreased costs for farm milk and inputs, leading to a sharp decline in the farm-to-retail price difference for milk. Retail prices respond slowly to farm price changes, with adjustments to higher farm prices happening faster than decreases. Commodity prices rise rapidly but fall back slowly when they recede. Consumer behavior, store preferences, and inventory management can limit retail price adjustments to farm price movements. Competition effects of supermarket services can attract less price-sensitive consumers, leading to higher prices for certain products like milk. This can create a disconnect between farm and retail prices for agricultural products. Consolidation in agriculture, including the dairy sector, has led to fewer and larger operations along the production and marketing chain. Larger operations have lower costs, leading to increased competitiveness and market share. As a result, fewer dairy farms are needed to produce the same amount of milk. The number of operations at the farm level continues to decline, albeit at a slower pace in recent years. Cooperative and processor consolidation has also followed a similar trend to offset costs. Concentration in the dairy industry has been increasing, with a small number of firms controlling most of the sales. The number of dairy farms has significantly decreased over time due to increased dairy cow output and advancements in technology. Despite the decline in farms, productivity has increased, resulting in a steady rise in total milk production. The number of dairy farms and cows has declined, leading to a steady increase in total milk production. Domestic demand for milk products has grown slowly, with a rise in cheese consumption offsetting a decrease in fluid milk consumption. Exports of dairy products have reached record levels. Farm numbers have varied based on size, with smaller farms seeing declines and larger farms increasing due to lower production costs. In 2009, the largest portion of U.S. milk output (47%) was produced on farms with 1,000 head or more, while small farms (fewer than 100 head) accounted for only 16% of the total. Larger dairy farms enjoy \"scale economies\" from automation and modern buildings, reducing costs. The structure of dairy farms varies by region, with large farms in western states like California and smaller farms in Wisconsin. Operating costs are affected by feed prices, with large farms purchasing feed and smaller farms producing their own. Overhead costs tend to be lower for large farms due to economies of scale. Dairy cooperatives, owned by farmers, manage milk distribution and product manufacturing. The number of cooperatives has decreased since the 1940s due to mergers for economic benefits. In 2007, the number of dairy cooperatives decreased to 155, but their market share increased to 83%. Consolidations and alliances have helped cooperatives serve large retail customers more efficiently. By 2008, the top four cooperatives accounted for 40% of U.S. milk production. The National Milk Producers Federation, representing milk producer cooperatives, emphasizes the importance of the Capper-Volstead Act for farmers to cooperate. Cooperatives have historically improved farmers' bargaining power with milk handlers and influence federal milk marketing orders. Some producers argue that cooperatives may not always act in their best interests. The dairy processing industry includes processing milk for consumption and manufacturing dairy products like butter and cheese, facing various challenges in recent decades. In recent decades, changes in demand and technology have impacted dairy processors and manufacturers. The number of dairy firms has decreased, with larger plant sizes to meet the needs of high-volume retailers. The number of dairy manufacturing plants in the US has stabilized around 1,100 facilities, operated by companies with 9 to 81 plants. Concentration trends in the industry mirror those in other food sectors. In 2002, the dairy processing industry had a four-firm concentration ratio of 35% for cheese processing and 43% for fluid milk processing. Compared to other food processing industries, dairy processing had a lower mean industry concentration ratio of 49%. However, local or regional markets may have higher concentration levels, raising concerns for farmers and policymakers. The fluid milk industry saw an increase in concentration following a merger between Suiza, Inc., and Dean Foods in 2001. The merger in 2001 between Suiza, Inc. and Dean Foods led to changes in the retail sector for food products, with increased competition from nontraditional retailers. This resulted in consolidation in the U.S. grocery retailing industry, with the top four firms accounting for 17% of national sales in the early 1990s, increasing to 17% by 2005. The four-firm concentration ratio in the retail food sector increased to 36% by 2005 due to acquisitions and mergers by large grocery retailers like Kroger Co., Albertson's, Ahold USA, and Safeway. Local-level concentration in specific market areas averaged 74% in 2003, with shares ranging from 63% to 85% in different cities. This local-level concentration is more important for food product suppliers negotiating terms of product sales with retailers. The consolidation and concentration in the food retail sector have led to larger dairy processors and manufacturers increasing market share. Concerns arise about reduced competition and market power, but efficiency gains may result in lower retail prices for consumers. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that concentration in the processing and retail sectors has not adversely affected agricultural commodity or retail food prices. Most studies reviewed showed no evidence of market power, with efficiency effects outweighing market power effects. However, experts predict increased concentration in the future, raising concerns about market power and price manipulation. The GAO report reviewed studies on dairy processing and retail milk markets, finding that concentration in dairy processing had little impact on prices. Efficiency gains were seen as beneficial, with market power effects offset by dairy cooperatives. Evidence of market power was found in regional retail milk markets, with noncompetitive behavior observed in some metropolitan areas. The GAO report reviewed studies on dairy processing and retail milk markets, finding that concentration in dairy processing had little impact on prices. Experts predict increased concentration in retail outlets, potentially leading to fewer buyers and sellers. Large retail firms may be pressuring food processors to consolidate, which could further concentrate the food processor level. Concerns include how concentration affects price transparency in dairy product markets. The dairy industry's move towards a more integrated market with fewer transactions on the spot market, like the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, has weakened price discovery. This shift reduces the efficiency of market operations by limiting the information available to market participants about demand, supply, and prices. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) is used by sellers to establish wholesale price contracts nationwide, with premiums and discounts based on factors like quality and transportation. Some dairy producer groups criticize the CME for being thinly traded, lacking transparency, and creating a volatile market that harms producers. A 2007 GAO study found the CME spot cheese market susceptible to manipulation due to a small number of trades and traders. However, industry participants believe any manipulation would be short-lived. Some industry participants claim that any manipulation in the cheese and dairy market would be short-lived as large players are prepared to counteract it. The CFTC and CME monitor for price manipulation, with past instances resulting in penalties. There are no current proposals to increase trading volume on the CME, but efforts are made to prevent price manipulation. The CME recently introduced new futures and options contracts for skimmed milk powder as a global dairy risk management tool. Some stakeholders aim to enhance dairy price transparency by expanding USDA's mandatory price reporting system for dairy products. U.S. antitrust laws focus on market competition and illegal mergers, with courts determining legality based on individual cases. The Sherman Act and the Clayton Act are the two main antitrust laws in the United States, enforced by the DOJ or FTC. They prohibit activities that restrain trade and monopolization. Violations can result in fines up to $1 million for individuals and $100 million for corporations. The Clayton Act prohibits mergers or acquisitions that may lessen competition, with fines of up to $1 million for individuals and $100 million for corporations. It also allows for premerger notification to examine potential transactions before consummation. The \"Merger Guidelines\" issued by DOJ and FTC are being updated to reflect actual practices. The premerger remedies DOJ/FTC might seek for a proposed merger include legal action to stop the merger or conditioning federal approval on modifications to address antitrust concerns. The Capper-Volstead Act provides an exemption for farmer cooperatives from antitrust liability for joint processing and marketing of agricultural products. In April 2009, Dean Foods purchased two plants from Foremost Farms, a cooperative in Wisconsin. The Department of Justice filed an antitrust suit against Dean Foods, alleging that the acquisition violated the Clayton Act by reducing competition in the milk market. The Department of Justice filed an antitrust suit against Dean Foods for purchasing two plants from Foremost Farms, reducing competition in the milk market. The lawsuit aims to force Dean Foods to sell the acquired dairy processing plants. Dean Foods now holds 57% of the processed milk market in northeastern Illinois, Wisconsin, and upper Michigan. Dean Foods acquisition in compliance with antitrust laws benefits dairy farmers by providing stable outlet for milk. Deal resulted in cost savings, benefiting consumers and spurring competition. Case highlights consolidation in U.S. dairy industry. Class action antitrust complaint filed against major firms in Northeast dairy market. A lawsuit has been filed in the U.S. District Court for Vermont on behalf of Northeast dairy farmers against Dairy Farmers of America, Inc., Dairy Marketing Services, Dean Foods, and HP Hood. The lawsuit alleges that the defendants have conspired to control the supply of fluid milk in the Northeast, leading to lower prices for farmers. Producers must now affiliate with either DFA or DMS due to exclusive supply agreements with dominant processors in the region. The lawsuit alleges that Dairy Farmers of America and Dairy Marketing Services, along with Dean Foods and HP Hood, have used their market power to harm dairy farmers in the Northeast. DFA claims to have helped increase returns for farmers through cost-saving efficiencies. Another ongoing case from 2008 involves multiple class action lawsuits in the southeastern United States. Determining the net effect of market concentration may take years to resolve. The net effect of market concentration on the dairy industry is complex, as it involves market power and efficiency gains, influenced by factors like product differentiation and technology changes. Economic events and government policies also play a role in influencing commodity prices, making it challenging to determine the exact impact of concentration."
