    "content": "This report analyzes annual appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for FY2020, comparing enacted FY2019 appropriations, the Trump Administration's FY2020 budget request, and the enacted appropriations measures. It also provides additional informational resources on DHS appropriations and lists CRS policy experts for consultation. The suite of CRS reports on homeland security appropriations tracks legislative action and congressional issues related to DHS appropriations, focusing on discretionary funding amounts. The curr_chunk discusses specialized budgetary concepts related to appropriations legislation for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). It explains terms such as budget authority, obligations, outlays, discretionary and mandatory spending, offsetting collections, allocations, and adjustments to discretionary spending caps. For a more detailed explanation, readers are referred to additional resources like CRS Report R42388 and the Government Accountability Office's Glossary of Terms Used in the Federal Budget Process. The curr_chunk provides details on the federal budget process for homeland security appropriations, using unrounded data for accuracy. It includes information on FY2019 appropriations from P.L. 116-6 and supplemental appropriations from P.L. 116-20 and P.L. 116-26. The curr_chunk discusses FY2020 appropriations for homeland security, including funding for natural disasters and security at the U.S.-Mexico border. Data is sourced from various congressional reports and the enacted levels from P.L. 116-93. The scoring methodology is consistent and developed with Congressional Budget Office (CBO) methodology. The curr_chunk provides an overview of the legislative process for FY2020 appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security, starting from the Administration's budget request to the enactment of annual appropriations in P.L. 116-93. The data is sourced from congressional reports and does not compare with OMB data due to scoring differences. The Trump Administration's FY2020 budget request for the Department of Homeland Security was delayed due to FY2019 appropriations. The request included $51.68 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority, a 4.6% increase from FY2019. Additionally, discretionary funding was requested that does not count against spending limits set by the Budget Control Act. The Administration requested additional funding for FEMA and the Coast Guard in the FY2020 budget. The House Appropriations Committee marked up H.R. 3931, including $52.80 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority, which was above the Administration's request and the enacted level for FY2019. The House committee bill included $14.08 billion in disaster relief-designated funding, reflecting the level in the Administration's modified request. The initial CBO scoring of the bill exceeded the subcommittee allocation by more than $3 billion, later revised to $1.9 billion. The Senate Appropriations Committee marked up S. 2582, including $53.18 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority, $1.50 billion above the Administration's request. The Senate Appropriations Committee marked up S. 2582, including $53.18 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority, $1.50 billion above the Administration's request. The bill also included $17.35 billion of disaster relief-designated funding, $3.28 billion more than the Administration's modified request, and $190 million in OCO-designated funding for the Coast Guard. Congress passed a continuing resolution (CR) on September 27, 2019, temporarily extending funding at the FY2019 rate for operations. The continuing resolution (CR) (P.L. 116-59) temporarily extended funding at the FY2019 rate for operations through November 21, subsequently extended through December 20. P.L. 116-59 included provisions addressing DHS needs under a CR, such as special apportionment of funds for Secret Service expenses related to the FY2020 presidential campaign and accelerated apportionment for the Disaster Relief Fund. It also extended the authorization for the National Flood Insurance Program and allowed funds to be allocated for a planned restructuring of some DHS management activities. Section 101(6) extended immigration provisions linked to the appropriations cycle. On December 16, 2019, the House Rules Committee released text and explanatory statements for two consolidated appropriations bills. One bill, using H.R. 1158 as a legislative shell, included the FY2020 DHS annual appropriations measure with $50.47 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority. This was $1.22 billion below the Administration's request and $1.06 billion above the FY2019 enacted level. The bill also allocated $17.35 billion for FEMA in disaster relief funding and $190 million for the Coast Guard in Overseas Contingency Operations designated funding. The FY2020 DHS annual appropriations bill, signed into law as P.L. 116-93, allocated funding to the Coast Guard through Overseas Contingency Operations. Discretionary appropriations provide the majority of funding for DHS operations, with the remainder coming from fee revenues, trust funds, and mandatory spending. Annual appropriations for DHS are typically organized into five titles, with the first four focusing on thematic groupings of components and the fifth providing general direction to the department. When DHS was established in 2003, components of other agencies were brought together over a matter of months, with resources provided through existing account structures. In 2014, DHS began working on a new Common Appropriations Structure (CAS) to standardize appropriations format. Operating with over 70 different appropriations and programs has hindered transparency and decision-making. DHS implemented its first budget request in the CAS for FY2017, converting legacy appropriations structures to a four-category structure: Operations and Support, Procurement, Construction, and Improvements, Research and Development, and Federal Assistance. This new structure provides resources for operating expenses, asset deployment, technology development, and grant funding managed by DHS components. Some components of DHS have specific appropriations like Procurement, Construction, and Improvements (PC&I) and Research and Development (R&D). The Federal Protective Service and USCG's Retired Pay have unique funding mechanisms with a net-zero impact on total discretionary spending. The Guard's Retired Pay appropriation covers USCG retired personnel entitlements, including pensions, Survivor Benefits Plans, and medical care. It is categorized as appropriated mandatory spending and does not count against discretionary allocation. FEMA receives a separate appropriation for disaster relief activities authorized under the Stafford Act, allowing for consistent tracking of spending and transparency into fund availability. The National Flood Insurance Program is funded through a mix of mandatory and discretionary appropriations, with certain costs covered by fees collected by the government. Prior to FY2017, appropriations included specific conditions on how the budget could be spent. In FY2017, appropriations included specific conditions on how budget authority could be used. Provisions within appropriations and general provisions provided directions to components. Changes in administrative and general provisions are tracked compared to the prior year's enacted measure. These changes may occur due to various reasons such as the passage of time or enactment of permanent legislation. The report discusses the appropriations provided for the Department of Homeland Security by type of component, grouping them into Law Enforcement Operational Components, Incident Response and Recovery Operational Components, Support Components, and Headquarters Components. The Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office Headquarters Components include the Office of the Secretary, Executive Management, Departmental Management Directorate, Analysis and Operations, and Office of Inspector General. Funding for law enforcement operational components like U.S. Customs and Border Protection is generally provided in Title II of the annual DHS appropriations act. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) includes agencies like Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Transportation Security Administration (TSA), U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), and U.S. Secret Service (USSS) responsible for various security and law enforcement functions within the U.S. The U.S. Secret Service (USSS) protects the President, Vice-President, their families, past Presidents, national and world leaders, designated buildings, and special events. They also investigate counterfeiting and financial crimes. Budget breakdown is provided in Table 1. H.R. 3931 had 31 administrative provisions, dropping eight from the previous year, including provisions related to ICE, TSA, and USCG funding. The U.S. Secret Service protects high-profile individuals and investigates financial crimes. H.R. 3931 had 31 administrative provisions, dropping eight from the previous year. S. 2582 included various provisions for agencies like USCG and TSA, including a pilot program for screening services at non-terminal locations. The FY2019 act had 33 administrative provisions in Title II, with one provision dropped and one modified. P.L. 116-93, Div. D, includes 36 administrative provisions in Title II, with two provisions dropped, four modified, and six new provisions added. Funding for operational components, including FEMA, is typically found in Title III of the annual DHS appropriations act. Title III of the annual DHS appropriations act includes funding for disaster programs under the Stafford Act, the National Flood Insurance Program, and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). CISA, formerly known as the National Protection and Programs Directorate, focuses on promoting information sharing for cybersecurity and infrastructure resilience. FEMA, under Title III, leads efforts to protect the U.S. from various hazards. The curr_chunk discusses the breakdown of budgetary resources for FEMA and the impact of transfers in discretionary funding. H.R. 3931 had eight administrative provisions in Title III, with five unchanged from FY2019. The curr_chunk discusses changes in administrative provisions for FEMA's budget, including dropped, modified, and added provisions in Title III. The Senate Appropriations Committee removed three provisions from S. 2582, including one related to costs for countermeasures and another for wildfire assistance. The FY2019 act included three administrative provisions in Title III, with two dropped and two modified. No new provisions were added. Changes in funding for support components in the annual DHS appropriations bill may appear more significant due to the small size of some appropriations. USCIS administers U.S. immigration laws. The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) provides technical training for law enforcement professionals from various agencies. The Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) leads research and development for DHS, while the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office (CWMD) focuses on defending against weapons of mass destruction. Budgetary resources for these components are controlled through appropriations legislation. H.R. 3931 and S. 2582 included administrative provisions in Title IV, with some provisions dropped and new ones added. P.L. 116-93, Div. D, also included administrative provisions. P.L. 116-93, Div. D, includes seven administrative provisions in Title IV, with sections 402 and 408 dropped from the FY2019 act. One new provision was added. Funding for headquarters components is typically in Title I of the annual DHS appropriations act. OSEM provides central leadership, DM offers mission support services, and A&O includes the Office of Intelligence and Analysis. The Office of Inspector General (OIG) is an independent body that reports on DHS efficiency and effectiveness, working to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse. Budgetary resources for DHS components are controlled through appropriations legislation, with separate lines for Management Directorate components funded outside Title I. Total annual appropriations are provided for each component. The table reflects the impact of transfers in discretionary funding and budgetary resource totals for DHS headquarters components. Changes in administrative provisions for funding in H.R. 3931 (Title I) include dropping two provisions and adding one for an Immigration Detention Ombudsman. Senate Appropriations Committee-reported S. 2582 retained all six previously enacted provisions in Title I. The Senate Appropriations Committee retained all six previously enacted provisions in P.L. 116-93, Div. D, without substantive modifications. No new provisions were added, and the House Appropriations Committee bill included a new provision for an Immigration Detention Ombudsman with minor modifications. The annual DHS appropriations act contains general provisions in its fifth title, which may impact the entire department or focus on specific activities. Most general provisions remain unchanged from year to year, providing guidance or structure to DHS appropriations. H.R. 3931 carried 36 general provisions as reported by the House Appropriations Committee. H.R. 3931, reported by the House Appropriations Committee, included 36 general provisions. Four provisions were added during full committee markup, with modifications to four FY2019 provisions. Six provisions from the FY2019 act were not retained in the House committee version, including restrictions on Guantanamo Bay detainee transfers and funds for financial systems modernization. The Senate Appropriations Committee's bill, S. 2582, included 36 general provisions in Title V, with modifications to some provisions from the previous year. Three provisions reducing budget authority for DHS were modified, while three others were dropped, including funding for financial systems modernization and grants for local law enforcement costs for Presidential protection. P.L. 116-93, Div. D, included 40 general provisions in Title V, with some provisions dropped and others modified. The last four provisions included rescissions of various funds, such as $233 million for CBP and $202 million in unobligated balances across DHS. No new policy-related provisions were added. In FY2019, funding was included in Title V for the Financial Systems Modernization initiative and a grant program for Presidential Residence Protection costs. H.R. 3931 included funding for Presidential Residence Protection Cost Grants but not for Financial Systems Modernization. S. 2582 did not include additional appropriations for any DHS activities in Title V. P.L. 116-93, Div. D, included $41 million for Presidential Residence Protection Cost Grants in Title V. The curr_chunk discusses rescissions of prior-year appropriations, including $657 million in rescissions from other appropriations in H.R. 3931 and S. 2582. The largest rescission comes from CBP's PC&I appropriation for FY2019, reducing it by $601 million. The Trump Administration approved $62 million in provisions for border security infrastructure in S. 2582, with the largest reduction being $33 million in administrative costs by DHS. P.L. 116-93, Div.

The federal government spending process involves budget authority enacted by Congress, funds obligated by agencies, and payments made to liquidate obligations. Budget authority is determined through appropriations acts or direct spending legislation, with the Antideficiency Act prohibiting agencies from obligating more funds than authorized. Congressional clients can consult CRS experts for guidance on DHS appropriations. Budget authority enacted by Congress can be indefinite in amount and available on a one-year, multiyear, or no-year basis. Obligations are incurred when federal agencies engage in transactions, creating a legal requirement for the government to pay. Outlays are the funds actually spent during the fiscal year. Multiyear and no-year budget authorities allow funds to be obligated for spending over a specified period or indefinitely. Budget authority enacted by Congress allows federal agencies to incur obligations and authorize payments from the Treasury. It consists of discretionary and mandatory spending, with discretionary funds appropriated yearly by Congress. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 defines discretionary appropriations as budget authority provided in annual appropriations acts, excluding entitlements. Mandatory spending, also known as direct spending, consists of budget authority provided in laws other than appropriations acts. Some mandatory entitlement programs must be appropriated each year. Within DHS, Coast Guard retirement pay is an example of appropriated mandatory spending. Offsetting Collections are funds collected by the federal government as part of a business-type transaction and are not considered federal revenue. They are counted as negative outlays. The DHS net discretionary budget authority is composed of discretionary spending minus any fee or fund collections that offset it. The DHS budget includes mandatory entitlement programs like the Secret Service and Coast Guard retired pay accounts, funded by permanent or annual appropriations. The DHS budget includes mandatory entitlement programs like the Secret Service and Coast Guard retired pay accounts, funded by permanent or annual appropriations. Additionally, the DHS budget contains offsetting Trust and Public Enterprise Funds, which are not appropriated by Congress but are included in the President's budget to calculate the gross budget authority. The maximum budget authority for annual appropriations, including DHS, is determined through a two-stage congressional budget process involving 302(a) allocations. The 302(a) allocations are discretionary totals available to the Committees on Appropriations for annual appropriations bills. The appropriations committees then allocate the 302(a) discretionary funds among their subcommittees for each bill, known as the 302(b) allocations. These allocations must not exceed the 302(a) allocation to enforce budget discipline. Adjustments to the 302(b) allocations can be made during the year as appropriations bills progress. Table A-1 shows comparable figures for the 302(b) allocation for FY2020. The 302(b) allocation for FY2020, based on the adjusted net discretionary budget authority, saw amendments in the House markup that exceeded the allocation by $3.066 billion, later revised to $1.9 billion. These provisions were not included in the final FY2020 DHS appropriations act. The Budget Control Act established enforceable discretionary limits for defense and nondefense spending from FY2012 through FY2021, with subsequent legislation amending these limits. The Budget Control Act established discretionary spending limits for defense and nondefense, with subsequent legislation amending the caps. Most of the DHS budget is nondefense spending, with allowances for adjustments for overseas contingency operations, emergency spending, disaster relief, and other specific purposes. The Office of Management and Budget determines the limit on disaster relief funding using a formula that includes a rolling average of spending over the last ten years. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 amended the formula to allow for a larger adjustment by adding 5% of emergency-designated funding for major disasters. OMB estimated a $17.5 billion adjustment for FY2020, the second-largest on record. The Office of Management and Budget estimated a $17.5 billion allowable adjustment for FY2020, the second-largest in history. This estimate includes the 10-year average, 5% of emergency-designated spending since 2012, and carryover from the previous year. The final adjustment for FY2020 may still vary from this estimate."
