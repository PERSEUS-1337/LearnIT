    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Business Supply Chain Transparency on Trafficking and Slavery Act of 2015\". The findings and sense of Congress are outlined in the Act. Congress finds in 2014, the Department of Labor identified 136 goods from 74 countries made by forced labor and child labor. The United States, as the largest importer, faces increasing demands for information on human rights impact of products. Consumers lack standing to enforce the prohibition on goods made with forced or convict labor under the Smoot Hawley Tariff Act of 1930. The United States faces challenges in preventing and punishing forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor in supply chains. Federal laws have limited scope and lack information on tainted goods. The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act and Trafficking Victims Protection Act allow for the termination of Federal contracts with contractors involved in these crimes. The Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2005 allows for the termination of Federal contracts with contractors engaged in severe forms of trafficking or forced labor. Executive Orders also prohibit the acquisition of products produced by forced or child labor in Federal contracts. Federal contractors, subcontractors, and their employees are prohibited from engaging in trafficking-related activities such as charging labor recruitment fees, confiscating passports, and using fraudulent recruitment practices. They must maintain an anti-trafficking compliance plan with a complaint mechanism and procedures to prevent subcontractors from engaging in such activities. The sense of Congress is that forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor are severe abuses for profit. Legislation is needed to prevent these practices and provide consumers with information on products free of such labor. Businesses should disclose their efforts to prevent these abuses. Through publicly available disclosures, businesses and consumers can avoid promoting or sanctioning crimes by ensuring that raw materials, goods, and finished products in the supply chains are not tainted. SEC. 3. DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION RELATING TO EFFORTS TO COMBAT FORCED LABOR, SLAVERY, TRAFFICKING, AND CHILD LABOR. Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is amended to require covered issuers to disclose efforts to combat forced labor, slavery, trafficking, and child labor in their annual reports. Regulations will be promulgated within a year of the enactment of the Business Supply Chain Transparency on Trafficking and Slavery Act of 2015. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 amendment mandates covered issuers to disclose measures taken to address forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor in their supply chains. This includes policies to identify and eliminate these risks, along with actions taken in response. The covered issuer must disclose their policies on prohibiting employees from engaging in commercial sex acts with minors, efforts to address risks of forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor in the supply chain, and actions taken to eliminate these risks. The covered issuer must disclose whether the evaluation was conducted by a third party, if consultation with independent labor organizations or workers was included in the process, and the extent of such consultation. The covered issuer must specify the extent of the process covering entities within the supply chain, including upstream entities and across product lines. Efforts must be made to ensure audits of suppliers investigate working conditions, labor practices, and risks of forced labor, slavery, and human trafficking. The covered issuer must ensure suppliers comply with laws on forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor in their supply chain. They should require suppliers to attest to compliance and maintain internal accountability. The covered issuer must maintain internal accountability standards, supply chain management, and procurement systems for entities failing to meet standards on forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor. Training on these issues should be provided to employees and management responsible for supply chain management. The covered issuer must ensure that labor recruitment practices comply with policies to eliminate exploitive labor practices contributing to forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor within the supply chains of products. This includes conducting audits of labor recruiters and disclosing the audit results. The covered issuer must take action to address forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor in their supply chain, providing support to victims and implementing programs to prevent recurrence. Information on these efforts must be disclosed on the company's website. The covered issuer must disclose measures taken to address forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor in their supply chain on their website. The Commission will also list covered issuers and compile the information submitted on their website. The term 'covered issuer' refers to companies with annual global receipts exceeding $100,000,000. 'Forced labor', 'slavery', and 'human trafficking' are defined as labor practices violating national and international standards. The term 'remedial action' refers to activities or systems implemented by an issuer to address non-compliance, and 'supply chain' includes labor recruiters, suppliers, and raw materials used in manufacturing. The term 'the worst forms of child labor' refers to child labor that violates national and international standards, including International Labor Organization Convention No. 182."
