    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Vaccine Accessibility for Children and Seniors Act of 2005\" or the \"VACS Act of 2005.\" The Congress finds that vaccines are a significant public health advance, saving lives and preventing disabilities. They are available for preventing childhood diseases like polio and measles, as well as diseases among adults like influenza and pneumonia. Vaccines reduce medical costs and benefit the community by reducing disease exposure. The threat of litigation and high manufacturing costs have led to a decrease in the number of companies producing vaccines in the United States. In 1967, there were 26 companies making vaccines, but now only 4 companies produce the majority of vaccines, leading to limited access. The Secretary of Health and Human Services cited costly liability lawsuits as a factor in a flu vaccine shortage in 2004. Congress intervened in 1986 to address these issues. The Congress created the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program in 1986 to lower legal risks for vaccine manufacturers, ensure a stable vaccine supply, and compensate injured patients. Individuals can file claims for vaccine-related injuries in the United States Court of Federal Claims and receive economic damages for medical expenses, rehabilitation, lost earnings, and pain and suffering (capped at $250,000). Over $1.5 billion has been paid out for vaccine-related injuries and complications. $1.5 billion allocated for vaccine-related injuries and complications under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, with awards exceeding $1 million and some as high as $7.5 million. Despite the program's intent to lower legal risks for vaccine manufacturers, companies still face costly litigation due to individuals opting out and pursuing lawsuits in State and Federal courts. Trial attorneys often try to bypass the program by claiming certain vaccines are not covered or that the program does not apply. To ensure valid scientific evidence and protect public health policy, litigation involving vaccines, preservatives, ingredients, and components outside the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program must be exclusively in US district courts. This allows individuals ineligible for the program to pursue civil litigation. The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program ensures fair compensation for injured patients through US district courts following Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. guidelines. The Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Attorney General, with the Advisory Commission on Childhood Vaccines, must study and report recommendations to Congress within a year. The Act aims to expedite compensation for legitimate claims and reduce adversarial processes. The Act aims to establish legal reforms to facilitate vaccine manufacture, ensure litigation is based on valid scientific evidence, discourage frivolous lawsuits, and provide rapid and fair compensation for injured patients.

Federal Court Remedy. The Public Health Service Act is amended to include a Federal cause of action for vaccine-related injuries or deaths occurring after October 1, 1988. This cause of action is the exclusive remedy for such cases, with substantive law derived from the Act and state laws where the vaccine was administered. The Public Health Service Act amended to provide a Federal cause of action for vaccine-related injuries or deaths after October 1, 1988. District courts have jurisdiction over actions for damages related to vaccine injuries, except for cases in the United States Court of Federal Claims. The State court does not dismiss the action, it can be removed to the district court of the United States before final judgment by any defendant. State causes of action for vaccine-related injuries or deaths after October 1, 1988 are preempted. The term 'vaccine' is defined to include any preservative, ingredient, or component of a vaccine, preempting state causes of action for vaccine-related injuries or deaths after October 1, 1988. Sanctions for frivolous vaccine litigation and a 3-strikes rule for suspending attorneys who commit multiple Rule 11 violations. Mandatory Suspension: A district court must suspend an attorney from practicing law for 1 year if they violate Rule 11 in connection with a vaccine suit three or more times, with the option for additional suspension. An attorney has the right to appeal a suspension under Rule 11. During the appeal process, the suspension is put on hold. To be reinstated to practice law in a district court after a suspension, the attorney must petition the court following its procedures. SEC. 5. TRIAL PROCEDURE. Section 2123 of the Public Health Service Act is amended to include a new subsection (b) regarding causation in fact in civil actions related to vaccine injuries or deaths. Subsections are redesignated, and the number of years for filing a claim is extended from three to four. The Public Health Service Act is amended to change the numbering of subsections related to vaccine injury causation. Additionally, a conforming amendment is made to section 2122(b)(2) by updating a reference. Transition rules are outlined in Section 6. The Act allows plaintiffs with pending State law claims for vaccine-related injuries to elect to treat them as Federal law claims within 30 days of enactment. Failure to file notice within the specified period will result in dismissal of the claim with prejudice. If a notice is filed within 30 days for a claim pending in State court, it can be removed to the district court of the United States by any plaintiff or defendant. The notice of removal must be signed according to Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and include a brief statement of the grounds for removal, along with all relevant documents. The removing party must inform all other parties and file a copy of the notice promptly. If a case is not properly removed within 40 days, it will be dismissed with prejudice. The State court must stop proceedings once a notice of removal is filed, and the case can only proceed in accordance with federal laws. An order remanding the action is appealable. SEC. 7. STUDY AND REPORT. The Congress intended the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program to be a flexible, no-fault system to handle claims quickly and avoid traditional litigation. Recent reports suggest delays, increased adversarial nature, and a drift towards full-blown litigation, contrary to Congress' intent. The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program was intended by Congress as a no-fault system to quickly handle claims and avoid traditional litigation. Recent reports show a drift towards full-blown litigation, contrary to Congress' intent. The Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Attorney General are required to submit a report to Congress within a year with recommendations to ensure injured patients are compensated in a less adversarial manner."
