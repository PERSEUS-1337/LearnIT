    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Equity in Government Compensation Act of 2010\". Congressional findings are also included in the Act. The Congress found that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, privately owned but publicly chartered government-sponsored enterprises, were central to the 2008 financial crisis, leading to the deepest economic decline since World War II and the loss of 7,500,000 jobs. In 2008, the Treasury Department, Federal Reserve Board, and FHFA placed the two GSEs in conservatorship, a form of nationalization. The Obama Administration took significant steps to support Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac during the financial crisis, including establishing a $200 billion facility to purchase senior preferred stock in the enterprises. This commitment was later raised to $400 billion, and limits on the use of Federal funds to cover losses were removed in 2009. As a result, taxpayers now own at least 80 percent of the two GSEs. The Obama Administration supported Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac during the financial crisis by purchasing senior preferred stock. Taxpayers now own at least 80 percent of the two GSEs, which are expected to be a long-term burden due to government mandates and market conditions. Compensation packages for the chief executive officers were approved despite these liabilities. The Treasury Department and FHFA approved multi-million dollar compensation packages for top executives at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2010, including $6,000,000 for each CEO with $2,000,000 in incentive pay. This was significantly higher than the compensation of the President and Cabinet Secretary. Additionally, in 2008, FHFA decided that no executive officer at the GSEs would receive cash bonuses or long-term incentive awards. The FHFA's Strategic Plan for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac emphasizes safe and sound operations. Section 1318(c) of the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act allows the FHFA Director to withhold executive compensation for review. SEC. 3. REASONABLE COMPENSATION.
