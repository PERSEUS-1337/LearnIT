    "content": "The research paper proposes a unified architecture using Recurrent Neural Networks for multi-time-horizon solar forecasting, addressing the non-stationarity of solar power and reducing prediction errors. The method achieves lower root-mean-squared prediction errors compared to previous models, enabling real-time multi-horizon forecasts. The proposed method allows for multi-horizon forecasts with real-time inputs in the evolving smart grid, addressing challenges posed by higher renewable penetration, storage device deployment, and active loads. Real-time observability and improved renewable generation forecast accuracy are crucial for enhancing resiliency and sustainability in the dynamic modern grid. ISOs with high renewable penetration face uncertainties from short-term forecasting errors, as seen with California ISO doubling its frequency regulation service requirements in 2016. The increased grid penetration levels of solar pose problems with grid reliability and operating costs due to short-term forecasting errors. Integrating wind and solar forecasts into unit commitment could result in $5 billion savings per year. Solar forecast accuracy is crucial for effective Unit Commitment, as very-short-term errors can strain the grid. Clouds can lead to sudden changes in PV plant outputs, causing strain on the grid. Solar power generation forecast is crucial for effectively incorporating solar energy resources into the grid. Improving forecast accuracy is a cost-effective method for integrating solar energy. The paper reviews current forecasting approaches and introduces a unified architecture and novel algorithm to enhance forecasting techniques. The paper introduces a unified architecture based on RNN for solar forecasting. It discusses the proposed algorithm, evaluation metrics, and results. The future research avenue is also identified. Various forecasting methods for renewable generation include regressive methods and AI techniques like Artificial Neural Networks. Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), k-nearest neighbors, fuzzy logic systems, and hybrid models like neuro-fuzzy systems, are used for solar radiation forecasting. NWP models have limitations in predicting cloud fields accurately due to coarse spatial resolution and inability to resolve micro-scale physics. NWP models have limitations in predicting cloud fields accurately due to coarse spatial resolution. Regional NWP models are downscaled for improved site-specific forecasts. Satellite-based irradiance measurement is useful in areas without ground-based measurements. Satellite sensing records radiance impacted by atmospheric conditions. The limitations of satellite sensing for solar irradiance forecasting include the need for ground-based solar data for statistical algorithms and the reliance on empirical or statistical algorithms. This has led to a shift towards using statistical models and AI techniques for short-term solar forecasting research. Statistical techniques for solar forecasting include linear stationary models, nonlinear stationary models, and linear nonstationary models. These conventional methods have advantages over NWP and sensing methods but are limited by strict assumptions. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) can model complex non-linear behaviors in higher dimensional settings, especially when considering exogenous variables like humidity, temperature, and pressure. The process of solar forecasting involves using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to model complex relationships with Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI). Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have proven effective in various fields. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) have not been explored for solar forecasting yet. RNN captures sequence dynamics using feedback connections. Feedforward neural networks assume independence among data points. Recent advances in parallelism, network architectures, optimization techniques, and GPUs have enabled successful large-scale learning with RNNs for solar forecasting. Traditional limitations have been overcome, and RNNs can predict irradiance for the next time step by considering input from previous time steps. Previous methods for solar forecasting were limited to specific time horizons, with no single model performing well for multi-time-horizon prediction. The paper proposes two RNN-based approaches for solar forecasting, capable of predicting irradiance for different time horizons. The models can provide real-time forecasts based on live data, offering value for industrial applications with high penetration of solar energy. The RNN architecture enables the network to utilize past information in sequential data. Input sequences are represented by real-valued vectors, with targets being sequences or single values. The input of the RNN has three dimensions: Mini-batch Size, Number of columns per time-step, and Number of time-steps. Mini-batch size refers to the sample length in the time-series. The RNN architecture utilizes past information in sequential data. Input sequences are represented by real-valued vectors with targets being sequences or single values. The number of time-steps is the differentiating factor of RNN, unfolding the input vector over time. In a multilayer feedforward neural network, the input vector is fed to neurons at the input layer, multiplied by the activation function to produce the intermediate output, which becomes the input to the next layer. The net input to the next layer is the weight on connections multiplied by the previous neuron's output with the bias term. The proposed RNN architecture utilizes Rectified Linear Units (ReLU) as the activation function and backpropagation through time (BPTT) for training. Mean Squared Loss (MSE) is used as the loss function to minimize errors between target and predicted outputs. Gradients are computed using back-propagation-through time and stochastic gradient descent optimizer updates weights. RMSE is calculated for benchmarking. The motivation for using RNN is to learn complex relationships in sequential data. The RNN is used to identify complex relationships between sequences of exogenous variables impacting solar irradiance, including atmospheric conditions. The algorithm's lower prediction RMSE compared to other approaches is attributed to recognizing non-linear contributing factors. Input features include various solar and thermal measurements. The algorithm was trained and tested on data from NOAA's SURFRAD BID30 sites. The study analyzed various solar and thermal measurements at SURFRAD sites, finding that global downwelling solar measurements best represent Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI). Clear Sky GHI and global downwelling solar showed a positive correlation, as depicted in Figures 3 and 4. The Bird model was utilized for calculations. The Bird model is used to calculate clear sky GHI BID29, with a positive correlation between clear sky GHI and global downwelling solar measurements. The algorithm utilizes Mean Squared Error (MSE) to measure the difference between target and output values in a neural network. The Root Mean Squared Error is then calculated for benchmarking. The Unified Recurrent Neural Network Architecture algorithm is divided into three main blocks. The algorithm, divided into three main blocks, merges site-specific data with clear sky GHI values from the Bird Model. The dataset is split for training and testing, and a clear sky index parameter is created. Missing values are replaced, outliers are eliminated, and a Recurrent Neural Network model is defined with specified architectural parameters. The algorithm is trained using data from SURFRAD observation sites in various locations. The model is trained and tested based on a pre-set number of epochs, with the RMSE used to evaluate performance. If RMSE is not satisfactory, hyperparameters are tuned and the model is retrained. The algorithm terminates when a satisfactory RMSE is achieved. The test year for each site is 2009 for benchmarking against previous results. The proposed RNN architecture and algorithm predict for 1-hour, 2-hour, 3-hour, and 4-hour time horizons at seven SURFRAD sites. Results show lower RMSE values compared to other machine learning algorithms. One model per site makes predictions for all four time horizons in parallel. The proposed RNN architecture predicts for 1 to 4-hour time horizons at SURFRAD sites, achieving lower RMSE values compared to other methods. The model can make multi-time-horizon predictions simultaneously, showing its relevance for industry applications. Short-term solar forecasting using real-time data fed to RNN allows for predictions across multiple time horizons, optimizing smart grid operational efficiencies. Various methods have been developed for solar forecasting with some success, but limitations exist in temporal and spatial resolution specificity. Recent advances in AI, particularly deep neural networks, benefit from increased data availability due to lower sensor and measurement equipment costs. This trend is expected to continue in the future. The proposed Unified Recurrent Neural Network Architecture leverages AI for high-fidelity solar forecasting across different time scales. It outperforms traditional Machine Learning methods in forecast quality and real-time inference speed. Deep neural networks, while having more capacity, may lead to reduced generalization power for this specific problem. The proposed method for high-fidelity solar forecasting can be enhanced through hyper-parameter tuning and architectural changes. Future research could explore extending the architecture with LSTM cells and intra-hour forecasting horizons."
