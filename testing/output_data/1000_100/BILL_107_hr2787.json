    "content": "SECTION 1. REFERENCE. This Act amends sections of the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990. SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. Congress makes findings related to mothers in the workforce, children with disabilities, early intervention services, and special education preschool services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. The General Accounting Office also reports on the supply of infant care and care for special needs children.
