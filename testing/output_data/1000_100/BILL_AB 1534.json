    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature in California declares the importance of county assessors following state laws for consistent and accurate assessment practices. They aim to protect taxpayers by ensuring decisions on property exemptions and ownership changes are made by certified staff. Implementation of education and certification requirements should be done efficiently with the advice of the State Board of Equalization. Section 674 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to require competitive bids for appraisal work contracts. Contractors must maintain confidentiality of assessee information as per specified sections. A contractor requesting information from an assessee must have written authorization from the assessor. They cannot share appraisal data with assessors from other counties. Contractors must not retain confidential information after the contract ends and must return it within 90 days. The contractor must return all assessee records and provide a written declaration of compliance. Contracts must include provisions from the State Board of Equalization. A contractor is defined as a person not employed by the state, county, or city who performs appraisal work. Article 8.5 is added to the Revenue and Taxation Code, introducing Assessment Analyst Certificates. Article 8.5 introduces Assessment Analyst Certificates, requiring assessors to hold a valid certificate for making decisions on changes in ownership and property tax exemptions. The board administers examinations for assessment analyst certificates, in collaboration with the Department of Human Resources. Exams are prepared by the board with input from a committee of assessors. A passing grade is required to demonstrate competency in making ownership change or exemption decisions. Applicants denied a certificate have the right to a review under the Administrative Procedure Act. Chapter 5 of the Government Code governs the administration of examinations for assessment analyst certificates. The board administers examinations for assessment analyst certificates. Certified analysts must complete 24 hours of board-approved training annually to maintain their certification. Excess training hours can be carried over for up to three years. The board requires certified assessment analysts to complete annual training to maintain certification. Failure to complete training may result in certificate revocation. Advanced assessment analyst certificates are available for those with three years of experience who have completed advanced study or passed an advanced examination. To retain a valid advanced assessment analyst certificate, holders must complete 12 hours of training annually. Excess training hours can be carried over for up to two years. To maintain an advanced assessment analyst certificate, completion of annual training is required. Failure to do so may result in certificate revocation following procedures outlined in the Administrative Procedure Act. Applicants must disclose financial interests in legal entities at the time of certification and annually thereafter. The board may issue a temporary certificate to a newly elected or appointed assessor or a person newly employed by the county assessor's office for up to one year to allow them to apply for an examination. The temporary certificate cannot be renewed. The board may issue an interim certificate to a current assessor or county assessor's office employee for up to four years to allow them to apply for an examination. The certificate cannot be renewed. The article does not prevent assessors from efficiently managing staff resources, as long as noncertificated staff do not make exemption or ownership decisions. This article applies in counties or cities that have passed a resolution upon the assessor's recommendation to require certification."
