    "content": "The Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA), amended by the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA), regulates \"federal election activity,\" including voter registration drives, voter identification, get-out-the-vote drives, and public communications that refer to federal candidates. Public communications are defined as various forms of media communications to the general public. Candidate and party committees can only use regulated federal funds, also known as \"hard money,\" to pay for general public political advertising. Internet communications were initially exempted from federal campaign finance regulation, but after a lawsuit by Representatives Shays and Meehan, regulations were challenged to include regulation of Internet activities. The plaintiffs argued that the FEC's lack of regulation of Internet activities allowed for circumvention of campaign finance laws, contrary to Congress's intent in enacting BCRA. In Shays v. FEC in 2004, the U.S. District Court overturned the FEC's regulations on political communications online, stating that excluding Internet communications from the definition of \"public communication\" was inconsistent with the BCRA. The court found that the FEC failed to provide legislative history to justify this exclusion. The court in Shays v. FEC overturned the FEC's regulations on political communications online, stating that excluding Internet communications from the definition of \"public communication\" was inconsistent with the BCRA. The court left it to the FEC to determine what constitutes \"general public political advertising\" on the Internet and found that the FEC's 2002 NPRM did not provide adequate notice to the public. The court also noted that exempting Internet communications from the definition of \"public communications\" could allow for coordination with political parties or candidate campaigns. The court in Shays v. FEC overturned FEC regulations on political communications online, stating that excluding Internet communications from \"public communication\" was inconsistent with the BCRA. This decision could allow for coordination with political parties or candidate campaigns, leading to a remand of the case to the FEC for further action. The FEC requested comments on proposed rules to include paid Internet advertisements in the definition of \"public communication.\" They also sought feedback on related definitions, disclaimer regulations, and exceptions for certain Internet activities. The proposed rules aimed to ensure proper financing and disclosure of political committee Internet communications without hindering individual citizens' freedom of speech online. In June 2005, a public hearing was held regarding Internet regulations. In March 2006, the FEC approved new regulations, citing the 2004 Shays v. FEC court decision. The regulations aim to exempt blogs maintained by individuals from FECA regulation if not done for a fee. The FEC recognized the importance of preventing corruption and promoting the Internet as a forum for free speech. The FEC proposed regulations to treat paid Internet advertising as \"public communication\" but exclude most Internet communications from this definition. The regulations only apply when money is exchanged for campaign ads online, subjecting them to FECA limitations and reporting requirements. Key aspects of FEC regulations include the regulation of paid Internet ads as \"public communications,\" requiring disclaimers on political committee websites and paid Internet ads advocating for federal candidates. The FEC regulations require disclaimers on political committee websites and paid Internet ads advocating for federal candidates. Disclaimers are not needed on individual or group emails unless they are political committees sending more than 500 similar emails in a 30-day period. Payments to bloggers by candidates must be disclosed on candidate statements, and coordinated internet ads with a candidate or party committee are considered in-kind contributions subject to FEC rules.

Payments to bloggers by candidates must be disclosed on candidate statements, and coordinated internet ads with a candidate or party committee are considered in-kind contributions subject to FEC rules. Media exemption under FECA coverage includes news stories, commentaries, and editorials distributed through broadcasters, newspapers, and periodicals that are also distributed over the Internet. Individual or volunteer activity on the Internet to influence a federal election is excluded from FECA regulation. The subject of communications over the Internet was discussed during House consideration of H.R. 417 (Shays-Meehan) in the 106th Congress, but not addressed during Congress's consideration of BCRA in 2001 and 2002. During the 109th Congress, bills were proposed to exempt Internet communications from BCRA regulation under FECA. H.R. 1606 (Online Freedom of Speech Act) failed to pass with a 225-182 vote. The bill was later ordered reported favorably by the House Administration Committee but postponed pending FEC regulatory action. During the 110th Congress, bills were introduced to address concerns about the Online Freedom of Speech Act potentially allowing FECA circumvention. H.R. 4194 (Shays-Meehan) aimed to exclude Internet communications from FECA regulation, while H.R. 4900 (Allen-Bass) sought to exempt most individual online communications from regulation. However, House floor action was postponed indefinitely following new FEC regulations in 2006. H.R. 894 (Price, NC) proposed extending disclaimer requirements to Internet communications. H.R. 5699 (Hensarling) aimed to exempt uncompensated Internet services from being considered contributions or expenditures, specifically for individuals and corporations primarily engaged in Internet activities. Blogs and other online publications would also be exempted from expenditure regulations. The bill aimed to exempt Internet services from being considered contributions or expenditures, including blogs and online publications. The legislation has not been introduced in the 111th Congress yet."
