    "content": "The \"Oil Company Accountability Act\" includes a section on Energy Tax Rebate, which adds a new section to the Internal Revenue Code for energy tax rebates. The Energy Tax Rebate section of the \"Oil Company Accountability Act\" provides a $500 payment against the tax imposed for the 2006 taxable year to eligible individuals, with exceptions for certain income levels and entities. The Secretary is required to remit the payment within 30 days of enactment. Section 1324(b)(2) of title 31, United States Code, is amended by inserting a reference to the Oil Company Accountability Act. The table of sections for subchapter B of chapter 65 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is updated with a new item. \"Sec. 6430. Energy tax rebate. The amendments made by this section shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act. Revaluation of LIFO inventories of large integrated oil companies.\" The taxpayer, if classified as an applicable integrated oil company for the last taxable year ending in 2005, must increase the value of historic LIFO inventories of petroleum products and decrease the cost of goods sold for that year. If the increases exceed the cost of goods sold, the gross income will be adjusted accordingly. The term \"layer adjustment amount\" is defined for this purpose. The term \"layer adjustment amount\" refers to the product of $18.75 and the number of barrels of crude oil represented by the historic LIFO layer. This adjustment does not constitute a change in accounting method and no addition to tax is required for underpayments of estimated tax. For applicable integrated oil companies, no addition to tax will be made for underpayments of estimated tax related to this section. An applicable integrated oil company is defined as having specific production and gross receipts criteria. For tax purposes in the year 2005, all related persons are treated as one entity. Short taxable years follow specific rules under the Internal Revenue Code. MODIFICATIONS OF FOREIGN TAX CREDIT RULES FOR LARGE INTEGRATED OIL COMPANIES WHO ARE DUAL CAPACITY TAXPAYERS. The Internal Revenue Code is amended to include special rules for large integrated oil companies that are dual capacity taxpayers regarding taxes paid to foreign countries or possessions of the United States. If the foreign country or possession does not impose a generally applicable income tax, or if the amount paid exceeds a certain limit, it will not be considered a tax. The special rules for dual capacity taxpayers of large integrated oil companies pertain to the amount of tax paid exceeding a limit set by regulations. This excess amount should not be considered a tax if it goes beyond what would be paid under the generally applicable income tax of the foreign country or possession. The term 'dual capacity taxpayer' refers to a person subject to a levy of a foreign country or possession who receives a specific economic benefit from that country. 'Generally applicable income tax' is defined as an income tax imposed under the laws of a foreign country on income derived from a trade or business within that country. The term 'large integrated oil company' is defined as an integrated oil company with gross receipts exceeding $1,000,000,000 and an average daily worldwide production of at least 500,000 barrels of crude oil. The amendments made by this section apply to taxes paid in taxable years beginning after the enactment of this Act, except where contrary to any U.S. treaty obligations."
