    "content": "The \"Voting Restoration Act\" is the short title of this Act, which aims to restore voting rights. The Voting Restoration Act aims to restore voting rights by addressing disparities in voting eligibility standards for ex-felons across different states. Congress asserts its supervisory power over federal elections to ensure voting rights are not denied based on race, sex, color, or previous servitude. Approximately 2 percent of the adult population, or 3,900,000 Americans, are currently ineligible to vote due to felony convictions. The process to regain voting rights varies by state, with some requiring a pardon or order from the Governor, while federal offenders must obtain a Presidential pardon. The number of incarcerated individuals has increased significantly in recent years, partly due to strict drug policies. The prison population has grown due to harsh drug policies, with 1 in 4 inmates in 1998 incarcerated for drug offenses. Drug offenders made up 58% of Federal prison inmates in 1998, with a significant number being nonviolent. Racially disparate sentencing laws have led to African-Americans being disproportionately convicted for drug charges. Minorities are disproportionately impacted by these laws. Minorities, especially African-American men, are disproportionately affected by laws that strip felons of their voting rights. Congress should address these disparities to ensure all Americans have the right to vote in Federal elections. The purpose of the Act is to restore voting eligibility to individuals who have completed their criminal sentences and promote their participation in civic life. The Act aims to protect the right to vote and register to vote in federal elections. The Act protects the voting rights of individuals with felony convictions, allowing restrictions only during custody or supervision. Violations can be reported to state election officials for corrective action within 90 days. The Act allows aggrieved persons to bring a civil action for declaratory or injunctive relief within specific time frames after receiving a notice of violation. If the violation occurs within 30 days of a Federal election, notice to the chief election official is not required to bring a civil action. Compensatory damages may be requested in a civil action for violations of the Act within 3 days of a Federal election. The Attorney General can also take legal action for declaratory or injunctive relief to address violations of the Act.
