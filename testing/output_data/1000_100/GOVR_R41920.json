    "content": "Both House and Senate bills competing to become the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2012 address issues related to detainees at Guantanamo Bay and hostilities against Al Qaeda. H.R. 1540 passed the House on May 26, 2011, focusing on counterterrorism matters. Senate bills S. 1253 and S. 1867 also address detainee provisions, with S. 1867 passing the Senate on December 1, 2011. The House and Senate bills for the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2012 address detainee provisions and counterterrorism matters. The White House has criticized aspects of both bills and threatened to veto any legislation that limits its intelligence collection and detainee transfer authorities. This report provides a background on the issues, analyzes the bills section by section, and compares their approaches to key issues. The House and Senate bills for the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2012 address detainee provisions and counterterrorism matters, aiming to confirm or expand the detention authority granted to the President post-9/11. The Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) authorized the President to use force against those involved in the 9/11 attacks to prevent future terrorism. Many captured individuals have been placed in preventive detention during U.S. operations in Afghanistan and elsewhere. In 2004, the Supreme Court ruled in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld that the President can detain enemy combatants captured while fighting U.S. forces in Afghanistan, including U.S. citizens, for the duration of hostilities. The decision left lower courts to define the scope of detention authority under the AUMF, including the detention of members or supporters of Al Qaeda or the Taliban apprehended outside Afghanistan. The D.C. Circuit has been handling numerous habeas petitions by Guantanamo detainees challenging their detention under the AUMF. Court rulings have mostly favored the government's position on detention authority. Congress has not passed any laws to clarify the scope of detention authority granted by the AUMF. The D.C. Circuit has looked to post-AUMF legislation on military commissions for guidance. In 2010, the D.C. Circuit court concluded that the government had authority under the AUMF to detain persons associated with Al Qaeda or the Taliban, as well as those who support them in hostilities. Most detainees were picked up during military operations in Afghanistan or abroad and held at Guantanamo Bay. The CIA initially held \"high value\" Guantanamo detainees at other locations for interrogation. A U.S.-operated facility in Parwan, Afghanistan, holds a larger number of detainees captured in Afghanistan. Persons arrested in the U.S. for terrorist activity have not been placed in military detention but prosecuted in federal court. The Bush Administration transferred some U.S. citizens arrested in the U.S. into military custody as \"enemy combatants.\" The detainees, one a U.S. citizen arrested for alleged Taliban involvement in Afghanistan and the other a legal resident accused of being an Al Qaeda \"sleeper agent,\" were transferred to civil authorities for trial when the Supreme Court considered their habeas petitions. There is ongoing debate on how to handle suspected terrorists in U.S. custody. The ongoing debate revolves around whether suspected terrorists should be held in military custody and tried before a military commission, transferred to civilian law enforcement for trial in an Article III court, or have decisions left to executive discretion based on individual cases. This disagreement is common in high-profile cases involving suspected terrorists. Congress passed funding restrictions in 2011 and 2012 that prohibited the transfer of Guantanamo detainees, including Khalid Sheik Mohammed, into the United States for trial in civilian courts. This effectively limited prosecution options to military commissions for the foreseeable future. The controversy surrounding the prosecution of Guantanamo detainees has led to debates over whether suspects should be tried in civilian courts or military commissions. Instances like the case of Ahmed Abdulkadir Warsame, who was brought to the US for terrorism-related charges, have sparked discussions on the appropriate handling of terrorist suspects by US authorities. Some argue for military custody abroad, while others advocate for immediate transfer to civilian custody. Similar debates arose with the arrests of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab and Faisal Shahzad, with differing opinions on whether they should have been detained and interrogated by military authorities. The 2012 NDAA may address the handling of persons apprehended in the conflict with Al Qaeda, including provisions on detainee operations and restrictions on transfers. H.R. 1540 passed by the House of Representatives contains provisions reaffirming the conflict, imposing restrictions on detainee transfers, and setting conditions for Guantanamo detainee releases. The 2012 NDAA addresses detainee operations and restrictions on transfers, including provisions on the handling of persons apprehended in the conflict with Al Qaeda. H.R. 1540 passed by the House imposes restrictions on detainee transfers and sets conditions for Guantanamo detainee releases. The White House criticized detainee provisions in the bill and threatened to veto any version challenging executive branch authority. S. 1253 from the Senate Armed Services Committee would have authorized detention of certain persons and required military detention for some, regulating status determinations and periodic review proceedings for persons held under the AUMF. The Senate passed S. 1867 on December 1, 2011, with revised detainee provisions despite objections from the White House and the Department of Defense. The bill made permanent funding restrictions related to Guantanamo detainee transfers and addressed detainee issues in the conflict with Al Qaeda. The Senate passed S. 1867 in 2011 with an amendment clarifying detainee provisions related to the conflict with Al Qaeda. The bill replaced the original language in H.R. 1540 and differences between the House and Senate versions will be discussed in conference. The sections address U.S. policies and legal authorities on detainee matters in the FY2012 NDAA. The first section covers detention authority under the AUMF, and the following section outlines current practices for initial status determinations. The current practice regarding initial status determinations and periodic reviews of detainee cases is discussed, along with concerns about recidivism and restrictions on transferring detainees from Guantanamo. The AUMF is the primary legal basis for detainment, but its scope is subject to differing interpretations. The Obama Administration's detention authority under the AUMF is outlined in a court brief from March 13, 2009. The President has the authority to detain persons who were part of, or supported, Taliban or al-Qaida forces engaged in hostilities against the US. The inclusion of \"associated forces\" raises questions about exceeding the AUMF's mandate. The Supreme Court in Hamdi interpreted detention authority with reference to law of war principles. The government's detention authority under the law of war is unclear, particularly regarding the criteria for \"substantial support\" to a belligerent force. Recent court decisions have not provided clarity on this issue. Recent court decisions have not shed much light on the \"substantial support\" prong of the test to determine detention eligibility, with cases relying on proof that a detainee was part of Al Qaeda, the Taliban, or an associated force. The executive branch has included \"associated forces\" in its detention authority since 2004, after the Supreme Court held in Hamdi that the AUMF authorized the detention of enemy combatants. The full parameters of detention authority conferred by the AUMF are still being defined by lower courts. In Afghanistan, private armed groups trained and fought alongside al-Qaida and the Taliban. The United States has authority to detain individuals to prevent future terrorism acts. The D.C. Circuit rejected the government's claim that affiliation with ETIM made one an \"enemy combatant.\" The parameters of detention authority under AUMF are still being defined by lower courts. The court accepted the government's test for membership in an \"associated force\" linked to al Qaida or the Taliban, but did not find evidence to support it. The government argued that ETIM is covered by the AUMF due to its close association with al Qaida or the Taliban. The court did not find sufficient evidence to establish that ETIM is closely connected to Al Qaeda to be considered an \"associated force\" as defined by the government. The government's definition of \"associated forces\" may need further development through application to specific cases. In habeas cases, the term \"associated forces\" has been interpreted to cover armed groups assisting the Taliban or Al Qaeda in Afghanistan. Groups like \"Zubayda's militia\" and Hezb\u2013i\u2013Islami Gulbuddin (\"HIG\") have been considered \"associated forces\" under the AUMF. The D.C. Circuit also affirmed the detention of a person engaged with the 55th Arab Military Brigade. The Administration has suggested that groups outside of Afghanistan may also be considered \"associated forces.\" The AUMF may authorize the use of force against members of groups considered \"associated forces\" outside of Afghanistan. There is uncertainty about the detention authority under the AUMF for persons captured outside of Afghanistan, especially U.S. citizens or those with ties to the U.S. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit believes the AUMF allows detention of individuals functionally part of Al Qaeda, even if captured outside of Afghanistan. The AUMF allows for the military detention of individuals captured in the United States, including U.S. citizens and resident aliens designated as enemy combatants. The legality of such detentions remains uncertain, as detainees are often transferred to civilian law enforcement custody before the Supreme Court can review the cases. Combatant Status Review Tribunals (CSRTs) were established by the Pentagon in response to Supreme Court decisions in 2004 to determine the enemy belligerency status of detainees brought to Guantanamo. Detainees brought to Guantanamo are subject to detention based on enemy belligerency status. Combatant Status Review Tribunals (CSRTs) determine the status of detainees, with 539 confirmed as enemy combatants between 2004 and 2009. The CSRT process has been largely inactive since 2007 due to fewer detainees at Guantanamo. Any new detainees would likely go through a CSRT process. This process has only been used for Guantanamo detainees, not those held in Afghanistan. Non-citizen detainees held at Guantanamo have more rights than those held in Afghanistan. While Guantanamo detainees can challenge their detention in federal court, the same privilege does not extend to detainees in Afghanistan. President Obama created task forces to study detention policies, putting Guantanamo proceedings on hold. The Obama Administration implemented a new review system for detainees at Bagram Theater Internment Facility in Afghanistan. President Obama issued Executive Order 13567 in 2011 for periodic review of Guantanamo detainees' continued detention. The executive order establishes a Periodic Review Board (PRB) to assess the continued detention of individuals at Guantanamo. If detention is not warranted, efforts will be made to transfer detainees outside the US. A review must occur within a year, allowing detainees to challenge their detention. The executive order establishes a Periodic Review Board (PRB) to assess continued detention at Guantanamo within a year of issuance. Detainees subject to continued detention will have periodic reviews. Concerns about released detainees engaging in terrorist activities have led to limits on transfers. Statistics on post-release activities of Guantanamo detainees are limited. The post-release activities of Guantanamo detainees remain classified, with some engaging in terrorist activities after release. Debate surrounds the significance of these activities and the policy implications, with differing views on transferring or detaining remaining prisoners without trial. In 2007, the Pentagon reported that 30 former detainees had engaged in militant activities or anti-U.S. propaganda, a number challenged by researchers. Researchers at Seton Hall University School of Law challenged the Pentagon's data on Guantanamo detainees, disputing the classification of their post-release activities as \"recidivism\" or \"reengagement.\" They pointed out discrepancies in the data and suggested that some detainees may have been radicalized during internment. The study did confirm cases of individuals engaging in deadly activities after leaving Guantanamo. In 2008, the Defense Intelligence Agency reported that 36 ex-Guantanamo detainees were confirmed or suspected of returning to terrorism. In 2009, the Pentagon reported that 74 out of 534 transferred prisoners engaged in terrorism or militant activity. The Intelligence Authorization Act for FY2010 required the Director of National Intelligence to release a report on recidivism rates of Guantanamo detainees. The report in 2010 stated that 13.5% of transferred detainees engaged in terrorism. The Intelligence Community assesses that 81 detainees transferred out of Guantanamo are confirmed and 69 are suspected of reengaging in terrorist activities. Of the 150 confirmed or suspected recidivist detainees, 13 are dead, 54 are in custody, and 83 remain at large. Since Executive Order 13492, 2 detainees are confirmed and 3 are suspected of participating in terrorist activities. The accuracy of these numbers has been challenged, with estimates suggesting a lower threat posed by released detainees. The Intelligence Community assesses that a small percentage of detainees transferred out of Guantanamo have reengaged in terrorist activities. The discrepancy between the report's estimate of detainee recidivism numbers and publicly available sources remains unexplained. There is agreement that the number of detainees engaging in terrorism post-release has increased. Section 1031 of H.R. 1540 defines \"individual detained at Guantanamo\" as non-U.S. citizens or non-U.S. Armed Forces members in Department of Defense custody. The provision in Section 1031 of H.R. 1540 defines \"individual detained at Guantanamo\" broadly to cover detainees held at Guantanamo under the effective control of the Department of Defense, regardless of their legal status or custody arrangements. The provision in Section 1031 of H.R. 1540 broadly covers detainees at Guantanamo, including foreign nationals brought for non-hostility reasons. Section 1033 amends the Military Commissions Act to allow guilty pleas in capital cases before military commissions. Section 1033 of H.R. 1540 amends the Military Commissions Act to allow the death penalty in cases where the accused has pled guilty, with unanimous approval from military commission panel members. Section 1034 clarifies the armed conflict with Al Qaeda and grants the President authority to detain captured belligerents. Section 1034 of H.R. 1540 clarifies the armed conflict with Al Qaeda, granting the President authority to detain captured belligerents, including those supporting or engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners. The controversial provision in H.R. 1540 clarifies the armed conflict with Al Qaeda, allowing the President to detain captured belligerents. Supporters argue it confirms the conflict's evolution since the 2001 AUMF, while opponents fear it expands the conflict to any new terrorist group associated with Al Qaeda. The AUMF was never limited in terms of geography or time, giving the President discretion to use force against various parties. Section 1034 expands the identification of belligerent parties beyond Al Qaeda and the Taliban to include any entities supporting hostilities against the US. This raises concerns about the broadening scope of the conflict. The AUMF allows the President to use force against parties engaging in or supporting hostilities against the US, including entities beyond Al Qaeda and the Taliban. There are concerns about the broad scope of the conflict and the potential implications for targeting decisions or other operations. The legislative history of H.R. 1540 suggests that Section 1034 reaffirms the current interpretation of the AUMF in habeas litigation involving wartime detainees. The House Armed Services Committee notes the evolving terrorist threat from Al Qaeda, the Taliban, and associated forces, emphasizing the ongoing grave threat to U.S. national security. The committee supports the Executive Branch's interpretation of the Authorization for Use of Military Force, affirming the authority to address evolving threats from Al Qaeda, the Taliban, and associated forces. This interpretation aligns with Congress's scope of authorities, but H.R. 1540 Section 1034 may not permit the expansion of force authorization as defined by the courts. The language in H.R. 1540 Section 1034 paragraphs (1) and (2) could potentially expand the authority to use force beyond the current Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF). The term \"associated\" is not clearly defined, which may lead to differing interpretations in court cases. Paragraph (3) mirrors language used in Combatant Status Review Tribunals at Guantanamo, allowing for the detention of individuals associated with Taliban or al Qaida forces engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners. The White House strongly objects to section 1034 of H.R. 1540, arguing that it could recharacterize the scope of the conflict and create confusion. Section 1036 requires a review process for Guantanamo detainees to determine the necessity of continued military detention for national security. The review process under Section 1036 for Guantanamo detainees involves military officers on the initial panel, strict criteria for detention assessment, and limited assistance from private counsel. The Secretary of Defense must report to Congress within 180 days on establishing a periodic review process for detainee detention. The review process for Guantanamo detainees involves a panel of military officers conducting reviews every three years, with limited reviews annually. Detainees not undergoing trial or ordered released may participate, with a 21-day minimum before a full review. Detainees have the right to a military representative, present statements and evidence, and respond to questions during the review. The review process for Guantanamo detainees involves a panel of military officers conducting reviews every three years, with limited reviews annually. Detainees not undergoing trial or ordered released may participate, with a 21-day minimum before a full review. The panel allows written or oral statements, introduces evidence, responds to questions, and calls \"reasonably available\" witnesses. The detainee is provided with an unclassified summary of information, and the detainee's personal representative receives a copy of the government's submission. Outside parties, including the detainee's private counsel, may provide a written submission if authorized. The review process for Guantanamo detainees involves a panel of military officers conducting reviews every three years, with limited reviews annually. Detainees not undergoing trial or ordered released may participate, with a 21-day minimum before a full review. The panel considers new information regarding the threat posed by the individual, including mitigating information, for a full review by a military panel if warranted. Factors considered include the likelihood of the individual resuming terrorist activity if transferred or released, reestablishing ties with hostile organizations, behavior in military custody, and information reviewed by officials. The review process for Guantanamo detainees involves a panel of military officers conducting reviews every three years, with limited reviews annually. Factors considered include the likelihood of the individual resuming terrorist activity if transferred or released, reestablishing ties with hostile organizations, behavior in military custody, and information reviewed by officials. Section 1036 requires the establishment of an interagency review board to review the military panel's full review for clear error and can reject recommendations by majority vote. The interagency review panel identifies a suitable country for transferring detainees based on various factors. Rejected recommendations can be reevaluated or forwarded to the Secretary of Defense for approval. Detainees do not have the right to seek redress. The detainee does not have the right to seek redress or enforcement in any U.S. court. The White House expressed concerns about Section 1036 of H.R. 1540, stating that it could lead to a presidential veto due to its impact on the periodic review process and interference with DOD's detention operations. Section 1039 also limits detainee transfers. Section 1039 limits the transfer or release of non-citizen detainees held abroad in U.S. military custody into the United States. It prohibits the use of funds to transfer or release Guantanamo detainees into the country, aiming to restrict executive discretion in closing the detention facility. The 2012 Minibus funding limitations prohibit the transfer of Guantanamo detainees into the United States for any purpose, including criminal prosecution. These restrictions were motivated by plans to transfer detainees for trial in civilian courts, making military commissions the only viable forum for prosecution until the end of FY2012. Section 1039 of House-passed H.R. 1540 broadens the detainee category covered by funding restrictions for FY2012. Section 1039 of House-passed H.R. 1540 expands funding restrictions for FY2012 to include non-citizen detainees held by military authorities at foreign locations other than Guantanamo. Unlike the 2012 Minibus restrictions, which apply to all federal agencies, H.R. 1540 specifically targets the Department of Defense (DOD) and limits the transfer or release of wartime detainees into the United States. These restrictions are set to expire at the end of FY2012. H.R. 1540 includes provisions that would expire at the end of FY2012, but some, like the permanent bar on prosecuting enemy belligerents in Article III courts, extend beyond that. The White House opposes Section 1039, arguing it interferes with executive discretion on prosecuting detainees. This is seen as a challenge to the Executive branch's authority on national security matters. The White House opposes provisions in H.R. 1540 that restrict the transfer or release of Guantanamo detainees, arguing it hinders national security efforts. Section 1037 of the bill prohibits the use of funds for constructing facilities in the US to house detainees. The funding restrictions in Section 1040 of H.R. 1540 prevent the transfer or release of Guantanamo detainees to foreign countries, except in cases where a court order mandates the detainee's release. These restrictions aim to address concerns about detainee recidivism. The funding restrictions in Section 1040 of H.R. 1540 aim to prevent the transfer or release of Guantanamo detainees to foreign countries, with arguments on both sides about their effectiveness in reducing terrorist activity. No detainee has been transferred or released since the restrictions went into effect in 2011. Transfers require certification from the Secretary of Defense that the destination country is not a sponsor of terrorism and can effectively control the detainee. The curr_chunk discusses the requirements for a country to accept a transferred detainee from Guantanamo, including ensuring the detainee does not pose a threat, sharing relevant information with the United States, and allowing access to the individual if requested. These requirements are similar to those for determining continued detention of Guantanamo detainees. The certification requirements for transferring Guantanamo detainees to foreign entities, as outlined in Section 1040, include allowing U.S. authorities access to the transferred individual. The White House has criticized these requirements, stating they interfere with the executive's foreign policy and national security decisions. Section 1035 of the legislation requires the Secretary of Defense to submit a detailed national security protocol for Guantanamo detainees within 90 days of enactment. The protocol must outline limitations and privileges for detainees regarding legal representation, communications, contraband, and enforcement measures, while also including monitoring procedures to protect national security and detainee privileges. Section 1038 prohibits DOD funds in FY2012 from allowing family visits to Guantanamo detainees. Section 1043 restricts rights for detainees repatriated to certain countries under the Compact of Free Association. Repatriation refers to returning a person to their home country, not applicable to former detainees resettled elsewhere. Section 1043 restricts rights for detainees repatriated to certain countries under the Compact of Free Association, excluding former Guantanamo detainees resettled in other countries like Palau. Section 1042 mandates consultation before prosecuting non-citizens for offenses that could be tried by military commission. Section 1042 mandates consultation before prosecuting non-citizens for offenses that could be tried by military commission in a U.S. district court or before a military commission. The White House opposes this provision, stating it could undermine existing interagency coordination in terrorism-related prosecutions. Section 1046 requires foreign nationals engaged in terrorism-related conduct to be tried only by military commission. The provision applies to individuals involved in terrorist attacks against the US or its personnel abroad, subject to trial by military commission. However, it lacks clarity on defining terms like \"terrorist attack\" and its applicability to prospective attacks. The case of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab may provide insight into its application. The provision applies to individuals involved in terrorist attacks against the US or its personnel abroad, subject to trial by military commission. The criteria for jurisdiction include the attack taking place within the United States or involving U.S. government property or personnel. The offense related to the attack must be one that can be tried by military commission under the MCA, and the accused must be subject to the jurisdiction of such a commission. The attempted use of an explosive device to bring down a civilian aircraft could fall under criminal prohibitions within military commission jurisdiction. The jurisdiction of military commissions requires the offense to be committed in the context of hostilities. The accused must not be a US citizen and must be an unprivileged enemy belligerent. This includes individuals who have engaged in hostilities against the US or supported hostilities. The bill outlines criteria for determining unprivileged enemy belligerents, including those who have supported hostilities against the US or its coalition partners. Military commissions and Article III courts may make jurisdictional determinations. It is unclear how the bill will impact cases involving terrorism charges. The provision applies to foreign nationals engaged in relevant conduct. The provision in the bill applies to foreign nationals engaged in relevant conduct, potentially complicating extradition and trial efforts for terrorism suspects. It may not require government action unless challenged through habeas corpus, allowing for trials in Article III courts. The provision in the bill applies to foreign nationals engaged in relevant conduct, potentially complicating extradition and trial efforts for terrorism suspects. It may not require government action unless challenged through habeas corpus, allowing for trials in Article III courts. If \"offense\" is understood by reference to the statute defining its elements, the provision may be avoidable by framing the offense as one under a terrorism-related provision of title 18, U.S. Code rather than one subject to military commission jurisdiction. Section 1042 suggests broader discretion among executive branch officials over prosecutorial decisions than Section 1046 permits. If a federal criminal offense is charged, a defendant could challenge the Article III court's jurisdiction based on the provision's language. Section 1032 extends the authority to provide rewards for information or assistance in military operations against terrorism for two years, with a maximum of $5 million. Section 1041 mandates the Secretary of Defense to provide certain information. Executive branch officials have criticized limitations on prosecuting detainees in military courts. Section 1041 requires the Secretary of Defense to provide quarterly briefings to Congress on global Department of Defense counterterrorism operations, including authorities, legal issues, and limitations. Section 1044 shows Congress's support for DOD anti-terrorism efforts. Section 1045 focuses on improving interagency strategic planning to deny safe havens to Al Qaeda and affiliated groups, requiring the President to issue planning guidance and identify areas of concern. The President must submit guidance documents to Congress within 15 days of completion, with agencies required to enter into a memorandum of understanding. Senate bill S. 1867 addresses \"Detainee Matters\" and was passed with revisions to address Administration concerns. The Senate passed H.R. 1540 with provisions replaced by S. 1867, affirming the AUMF authority to detain \"covered persons\" related to 9/11 attacks. Covered persons are defined as those involved in the attacks. The Senate passed H.R. 1540 with provisions replaced by S. 1867, affirming the AUMF authority to detain \"covered persons\" related to 9/11 attacks. Covered persons are those involved in or supported terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, or associated with al-Qaeda, the Taliban, or enemy forces engaged in hostilities against the United States. The earlier version of Section 1031 in S. 1253 authorized the Armed Forces to detain covered persons captured in hostilities authorized by the AUMF as unprivileged enemy belligerents. The White House objected to this language. The White House objected to language in the Senate-passed S. 1867 regarding the detention of persons under the AUMF. Section 1031 allows for various dispositions under the law of war, including detention without trial, trial by military commission, or transfer to another court or country. It does not specify if U.S. citizens or lawful residents are considered \"covered persons.\" The revised provision of S. 1867, as reported out of committee, seemed to leave the application of the Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF) to U.S. persons in an unsettled position, particularly for those arrested in the United States. The committee-modified version removed references to \"captured during the course of hostilities\" and disavowed any intent to modify the detention authority under the AUMF. The committee-modified version of S. 1867 aimed to reinforce the executive branch's detention authority under the AUMF. There was significant debate on the potential application of Section 1031 to U.S. citizens and residents. An amendment to bar U.S. citizens from long-term military detention was rejected, but a proviso was added to clarify that Section 1031 does not affect existing detention laws for U.S. citizens and resident aliens. Section 1031 does not clarify the circumstances for detaining U.S. citizens and resident aliens, which has been a subject of controversy and lacks definitive resolution in the courts. The Supreme Court's decision in Hamdi allowed for the military detention of individuals captured in Afghanistan, but the rules for those captured elsewhere remain unclear. The AUMF does not definitively clarify the circumstances for detaining U.S. citizens or others captured in the United States. Section 1031 lacks additional clarification on terms like \"substantial support\" or \"associated forces,\" potentially allowing for a broadening of conflict scope. The revised provision in S. 1867 requires the Secretary of Defense to brief Congress on how the provision applies to \"covered persons,\" including defining \"associated forces\" and \"substantial support.\" The Administration has concerns about codifying existing authorities related to military detention, particularly in Section 1031. Future legislative action must ensure that express military detention authority does not have unintended consequences. Section 1032, which requires military custody for certain Al Qaeda members and \"associated forces,\" has sparked controversy. The provision of mandatory detention applies to captured individuals associated with Al-Qaeda or its affiliates during authorized hostilities, excluding U.S. citizens but including resident aliens. Persons associated with al-Qaeda or its affiliates must be detained by military authorities if they have participated in planning or carrying out attacks against the US or its coalition partners. They can be held in military detention, tried before a military commission, transferred for trial by another court, or transferred to a foreign government, subject to certain requirements. Section 1032 of S. 1867 establishes criteria for detention of members of associated forces acting in coordination with or under the direction of al-Qaeda. The provision does not mention the Taliban explicitly, suggesting that only those associated forces closely coordinating with al-Qaeda may be subject to mandatory detention. The question arises whether all members of an associated force would be detained, or only those involved in coordinating activities with al-Qaeda. The criteria for detention of members of associated forces acting in coordination with or under the direction of Al Qaeda is established in Section 1032 of S. 1867. The provision does not explicitly mention the Taliban, indicating that only associated forces closely coordinating with Al Qaeda may be subject to mandatory detention. The determination of whether an individual should be detained can be based on their involvement in planning or engaging in attacks with Al Qaeda. The application of Section 1032 does not extend to \"lone wolf\" terrorists without ties to Al Qaeda or any associated force. The definition of what constitutes an \"attack against the United States coalition partners\" is not clearly defined. The provision in Section 1032 of S. 1867 allows for the military detention of individuals captured during hostilities against armed forces. The term \"attack\" may encompass terrorist acts, but the application of the law of war in such cases is uncertain. The reference to lawful resident aliens being detained for conduct in the US supports a broader interpretation of \"attack.\" The mandatory detention requirement is linked to hostilities authorized by the AUMF and may not apply to insurgents carrying out attacks. S. 1867 includes a new requirement for the President to submit to Congress, within 60 days of enactment, a report describing the procedures for implementing the provision, including designating who is authorized to determine a covered person and preventing interruption of ongoing surveillance. The bill includes procedures for determining the status of detainees, with provisions to prevent interruptions during interrogation sessions and allow for waivers to transfer individuals from third countries. It is unclear how these procedures will interact with those required under Section 1036, which also addresses detainee status determinations. The bill includes procedures for determining detainee status, with provisions to prevent interruptions during interrogation and waivers for transfers from third countries. It does not preclude multiple processes for determining covered persons subject to military detention or the use of a single procedure for both detainee status and disposition under the law of war. Any process adopted would likely involve constitutional due process requirements, especially for detainees in the United States. The Obama Administration opposes Section 1032 of the bill, as it could complicate prosecution and limit counterterrorism tools. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta doubts its advantages for national security and criticizes its lack of clarity on limiting scope to persons captured abroad. The Obama Administration strongly opposes Section 1032 of the bill, calling it an unnecessary restriction on the President's authority to defend the nation from terrorist threats. The White House views the extension of transfer certification requirements to those covered by Section 1032 as inappropriate and doubts that revisions to the provision will address its fundamental problems. The revised text of Section 1032 directs the President to develop procedures to address the problems of mandating military custody, rather than fixing the fundamental defects or removing it entirely. Section 1033 extends restrictions on transferring Guantanamo detainees to foreign countries for the fiscal year. Section 1033 of the 2011 NDAA and CAA, as well as H.R. 1540, prohibits DOD funds for detainee transfers from Guantanamo to foreign countries without certification from the Secretary of Defense, Secretary of State, and Director of National Intelligence. The Senate bill requires certification from the Secretary of Defense for detainee transfers to foreign countries to prevent terrorism and ensure information sharing with the United States. Unlike H.R. 1540, access to transferred individuals by U.S. authorities is not mandated. The Senate bill mandates certification from the Secretary of Defense for detainee transfers to foreign countries to prevent terrorism and ensure information sharing with the United States. Transfers from Guantanamo to foreign countries are generally prohibited if there is a confirmed case of a detainee engaging in terrorist activity after transfer, but exceptions exist for pretrial agreements or court orders. The certification requirement and recidivism bar can be waived by the Secretary of Defense, Secretary of State, and Director of National Intelligence if alternative actions address the purpose of the measures. The Secretary may issue a waiver for detainee transfers if alternative actions mitigate the risk of recidivism. Transfers must be in the national security interests of the United States, with a submission to congressional defense committees 30 days prior including the basis for the transfer, reasons for not certifying all risks eliminated, and a summary of alternative actions. The Senate bill's transfer restrictions apply to individuals detained at Guantanamo, excluding U.S. citizens or servicemembers. It may also cover foreign refugees intercepted at sea and brought to Guantanamo. The White House opposes these transfer restrictions. The White House and Department of Defense disapprove of transfer restriction provisions in the 2012 NDAA. Section 1034 prohibits the use of DOD funds to house Guantanamo Bay detainees in the US without congressional authorization. Similar restrictions were in previous NDAA and CAA bills. Funding limitation in Section 1034 is similar to H.R. 1540. The Senate bill, unlike the House-passed version of the 2012 NDAA, does not prohibit transferring Guantanamo detainees to the US. It allows transfers to civilian law enforcement for prosecution and does not prevent releasing cleared detainees into the US. The only restriction in the Senate bill is on transfers from Guantanamo. The Senate bill allows for transferring Guantanamo detainees to the US for civilian law enforcement purposes, with the only restriction being on transfers for continued military detention. Section 1035 clarifies procedures for detainee reviews at Guantanamo, focusing on determining ongoing security threats rather than legality of detention. The Senate bill addresses the transfer of Guantanamo detainees to the US for civilian law enforcement purposes, with a focus on ongoing security threats. It clarifies procedures for detainee reviews at Guantanamo and shifts responsibility to the Secretary of Defense for final decisions on detainee release or transfer. The Administration objects to this provision as it changes the collaborative review process to be Defense Department-led. The Senate bill requires the Secretary of Defense to submit a report on procedures for determining the status of detained persons under the AUMF. It is unclear if this refers to determining if a person is a \"covered person\" under Section 1031 or their disposition under the law of war. For long-term detention of unprivileged enemy belligerents, a military judge must preside over status determination proceedings, and the belligerent may be represented by military counsel. The Senate bill requires the Secretary of Defense to submit a report on procedures for determining the status of detained persons under the AUMF. For long-term detention of unprivileged enemy belligerents, a military judge must preside over status determination proceedings, and the belligerent may be represented by military counsel. This provision may provide detainees in Afghanistan with greater privileges during status determination hearings, but its impact on Guantanamo detainees and habeas challenges is unclear. The implications of Section 1036 on Guantanamo detainees may depend on whether it applies to all detainees in U.S. custody designated for long-term detention under the AUMF or only to those detained after the Senate bill's enactment. The provision does not clarify how to determine if a detainee is subject to special requirements for long-term detention before a status hearing. The bill allows for the detention of enemy belligerents during hostilities, with implications for Guantanamo detainees. It is unclear if special requirements for long-term detention apply to all detainees or only those detained after the bill's enactment. The provision does not specify how to determine a detainee's status before a hearing. The bill allows for the detention of enemy belligerents during hostilities, with implications for Guantanamo detainees. The status review process under Section 1036 may only apply to detainees designated for long-term detention, leading to potential conflicts with existing administrative review processes. The White House disapproves of this provision, citing onerous requirements and conflicts with established detainee review procedures. Section 1037 of the bill allows plea agreements in capital cases under the MCA, similar to a provision in House-passed H.R. 1540. It does not amend existing code references to capital cases."
