AMENDMENTS TO THE COLORADO UTE INDIAN WATER RIGHTS SETTLEMENT ACT OF 1988. After the enactment of the Colorado Ute Settlement Act Amendments of 1998, the Secretary is required to construct a reservoir with a storage capacity of 260,000 acre-feet as part of the Animas-La Plata Project. This project also includes a pumping plant, reservoir inlet conduit, and allocations of municipal and industrial water. The water allocations for various entities are as follows:\n- Southern Ute Tribe: 16,525 acre-feet annually\n- Ute Mountain Ute Indian Tribe: 16,525 acre-feet annually\n- Navajo Nation: 2,340 acre-feet annually\n- San Juan Water Commission: 10,400 acre-feet annually\n- Animas-La Plata Conservancy: unspecified amount The Animas-La Plata Conservancy District is allocated 2,600 acre-feet of water annually. Construction costs for the Navajo Nation and other tribes' water allocations are nonreimbursable. Nontribal water capital repayment obligations will be covered by specific entities upon full payment. The Animas-La Plata Project involves cost-sharing obligations between the District, the State of Colorado, and Tribes for water allocations. Nonreimbursable costs include those for recreation, environmental compliance, cultural resources, and fish/wildlife mitigation. Tribal water allocations are specified for municipal and industrial use. The Secretary will pay the operation, maintenance, and replacement costs for industrial water allocated to a Tribe from the Animas-La Plata Project or the Dolores Project until the water is used by the Tribe. The Tribe is not required to reimburse these costs. Repayment of the Tribe's pro rata share will occur as the water allocation is utilized by the Tribe or according to a water use contract. The Tribe will repay its share of construction costs for the Dolores Project and bear annual operation, maintenance, and replacement costs. The Secretary will provide necessary actions for water supplies to the Animas-La Plata Water Conservancy District or La Plata Conservancy District upon request. After the Colorado Ute Settlement Act Amendments of 1998, water allocations are provided to the Animas-La Plata Water Conservancy District of Colorado and the La Plata Conservancy District of New Mexico. The Secretary will allocate additional water depletions consistent with the Endangered Species Act of 1973. The Secretary will transfer water rights to New Mexico beneficiaries of the Animas-La Plata Project to fulfill project purposes. The April 1996 Final Supplement to the Final Environmental Impact Statement and the February 19, 1996 Final Biological Opinion are considered adequate for meeting requirements under various environmental acts for the Animas-La Plata Project. The Colorado Ute Indian Water Rights Settlement Act Amendments of 1998 include provisions for the construction of specific facilities and the depletion of 57,100 acre-feet of water as approved in a biological opinion. The final settlement is outlined in the legislation. The Colorado Ute Indian Water Rights Settlement Act Amendments of 1998 provide final settlement of tribal claims to water rights on the Animas and La Plata Rivers. The Tribes retain rights on other streams and rivers, can participate in the Animas-La Plata Project, receive dedicated water amounts, and acquire water rights under Colorado law. The Attorney General of the United States will take action in the District Court. The Attorney General of the United States will file necessary instruments with the District Court, Water Division Number 7 in Colorado to amend the final consent decree as per the amendments made under the Colorado Ute Settlement Act Amendments of 1998.

The Department of the Interior Appropriations Acts of 1994 and 1995, along with the treatment of the uncommitted portion of Colorado's cost-sharing obligation, are addressed in this section. The uncommitted funds can be used for components of the Animas-La Plata Project after the specified payment date.
