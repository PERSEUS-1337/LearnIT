The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will establish a program to provide peer outreach, support, counseling, and mental health services to veterans of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom, as well as education and support to their immediate family members. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will establish a program to provide education, support, counseling, and mental health services to assist veterans in readjusting to civilian life, recovering from injuries or illnesses incurred during deployment, and helping their families readjust following their return. The program will involve contracts with community mental health centers and qualified entities in areas not adequately served by other VA health care facilities. The Department of Veterans Affairs will require contracting community health centers or entities to employ veterans, use telehealth services, participate in training programs, comply with VA protocols, and submit annual reports. The Department of Veterans Affairs requires community health centers or entities to provide mental health services to veterans, submit clinical summary information, and meet additional requirements as specified by the Secretary. Veterans are also trained to provide peer-outreach and peer-support services as part of the program. The Secretary will contract with a national mental health organization to train veterans to provide peer-support services. Additionally, clinicians at community mental health centers will undergo training to provide services tailored to veterans who served in Operation Iraqi Freedom or Operation Enduring Freedom. The Secretary will submit reports to Congress on the implementation of a program to provide peer-support services for veterans, including training for clinicians at mental health centers. The report to Congress on the program for veterans' peer-support services includes information on the number of veterans served, types of services provided, evaluation of service provision, and a list of national mental health organizations offering services. The report to Congress includes an evaluation of the training provided under subsection (d)."
