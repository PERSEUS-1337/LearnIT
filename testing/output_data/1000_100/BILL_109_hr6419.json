The \"Nuclear Terrorism Prevention Act of 2006\" defines terms like the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and nuclear weapons as devices using atomic energy for weapon purposes. SEC. 3. FINDINGS. Congress finds that the threat of terrorists acquiring and using a nuclear weapon is urgent and poses a significant risk to national and global security. Efforts to secure nuclear stockpiles and prevent nuclear terrorism have made progress, but additional measures are necessary to further reduce this threat. The White House's 2006 National Strategy for Combating Terrorism highlights the grave danger of weapons of mass destruction in the hands of terrorists, and the United Nations Secretary-General has warned about the catastrophic impact of a nuclear terror attack. United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540 (2004) emphasizes the need to prevent non-state actors from acquiring and using nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons for terrorist purposes. It directs countries to adopt and enforce laws prohibiting these activities to maintain international peace and security. The Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency warns of the urgent need to prevent terrorist attacks using nuclear weapons. SEC. 4.

A comprehensive approach is needed to reduce this danger, including efforts to eliminate terrorist groups seeking nuclear weapons, secure nuclear weapons worldwide, and prevent terrorist efforts to manufacture or transport nuclear explosives. The President must prioritize preventing nuclear terrorist attacks and secure nuclear materials worldwide. The International Atomic Energy Agency should be adequately funded to coordinate international efforts in protecting nuclear materials. Legislation sponsored by Senator Richard Lugar is crucial in this effort.
