    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Personal Health Investment Today Act\" or the \"PHIT Act.\" Congress finds that almost 20 percent of American children aged 2 to 19 are overweight or obese, leading to increased healthcare costs. Research shows that investing in physical activity can significantly reduce medical expenses, and offering financial incentives can motivate more Americans to be physically active. The purpose of this Act is to promote health and prevent disease, particularly related to obesity, by encouraging healthier lifestyles, providing financial incentives for healthy behavior, and increasing access to physical fitness activities. The United States ranks last in reducing preventable deaths from obesity-related chronic illnesses, and engaging in physical activities at a young age can have a significant impact on long-term health. Certain amounts paid for physical activity, fitness, and exercise are treated as amounts paid for medical care. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include qualified sports and fitness expenses as amounts paid for medical care, including membership at a fitness facility, participation in physical exercise programs, and equipment for such programs. The amendment includes a $1,000 limit ($2,000 for joint returns or heads of household) on qualified sports and fitness expenses for physical exercise programs and equipment. A fitness facility is defined as a place offering physical exercise programs. The amendment limits qualified sports and fitness expenses to $1,000 ($2,000 for joint returns or heads of household) for physical exercise programs and equipment at fitness facilities that do not offer golf, hunting, sailing, or riding facilities and comply with anti-discrimination laws. Videos, books, and similar materials are also included in this treatment. Amounts paid for sports and fitness equipment must be used exclusively for fitness, exercise, sports, or physical activity programs, not including apparel or footwear. The amendment allows for a tax deduction on sports equipment purchases up to $250 and includes programs with physical exercise along with other components. The effective date for these changes is for taxable years after the enactment of the Act."
