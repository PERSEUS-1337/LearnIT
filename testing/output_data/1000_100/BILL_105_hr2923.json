    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Early Hearing Loss Detection, Diagnosis, and Intervention Act of 1997\". The Act aims to establish early detection, diagnosis, and intervention networks for hearing loss in babies. It mandates screening for all newborns in hospitals or within 3 months of birth, with timely diagnostic testing and referral for treatment before 6 months of age. All newborn hearing screening programs should ensure linkage to diagnosis and early intervention services. Public policy should be based on research and consider the unique needs of deaf or hard-of-hearing infants and children. STATEWIDE EARLY DETECTION, DIAGNOSIS, AND INTERVENTION NETWORKS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will award grants to develop statewide networks for early detection, diagnosis, and intervention for newborn hearing loss. This includes developing state capacity, monitoring hearing detection in birthing hospitals, and ensuring effective screening and referral services. The curr_chunk focuses on collecting data on statewide early detection, diagnosis, and intervention for newborn hearing loss for research and policy development. The curr_chunk focuses on technical assistance, data management, and applied research related to newborn hearing loss. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will provide grants for technical assistance to State agencies for infant hearing detection. This includes data collection, standardized procedures, cost-effectiveness studies, and identifying causes of congenital hearing loss. The National Institutes of Health, through the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, will conduct research on the causes of congenital hearing loss and the effectiveness of early detection and intervention programs. Data sharing with State-based monitoring programs will help identify unknown causes of hearing loss. The Act aims to conduct research on new screening techniques and technology, including clinical trials and studies on intervention efficacy. SEC. 5. COORDINATION AND COLLABORATION. In carrying out programs under this Act, the Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration, the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Director of the National Institutes of Health shall collaborate with other agencies, state and local agencies, consumer groups, individuals who are deaf and hard-of-hearing, professional personnel proficient in deaf or hard-of-hearing language, health and education professionals, and third-party payers. The Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration, the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Director of the National Institutes of Health collaborate on policy recommendations for early hearing detection, diagnosis, and treatment. They also assist States in establishing early detection, diagnosis, and intervention networks. States are required to establish early detection, diagnosis, and intervention networks and develop a data collection system. SEC. 6. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Authorization of appropriations for statewide early detection, diagnosis, and intervention networks is set at $5,000,000 for fiscal year 1999, $8,000,000 for fiscal year 2000, and as needed for fiscal years 2001 through 2003. Additionally, funding for technical assistance, data management, and applied research includes $5,000,000 for fiscal year 1999, $7,000,000 for fiscal year 2000 for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and $3,000,000 for fiscal year 1999, $4,000,000 for fiscal year 2000 for the National Institutes of Health. Authorization of appropriations for statewide early detection, diagnosis, and intervention networks is set at $5,000,000 for fiscal year 1999, $8,000,000 for fiscal year 2000, and as needed for fiscal years 2001 through 2003."
