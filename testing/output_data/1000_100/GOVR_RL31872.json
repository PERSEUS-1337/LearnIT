    "content": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones, are defined by the Department of Defense as powered aerial vehicles that do not carry a human operator, can fly autonomously or be piloted remotely, and can carry a lethal or nonlethal payload. They are different from RPVs as they are designed to fly autonomously. UAVs can be a single air vehicle or part of a UAV system (UAS) consisting of multiple air vehicles, a ground control station, and support equipment. Military use of UAVs has been prominent in recent conflicts such as Iraq and Afghanistan. The military use of UAVs in recent conflicts has highlighted their advantages and disadvantages. UAVs offer benefits such as eliminating pilot risk and having aeronautical capabilities not limited by humans. They can also be cheaper to procure and operate than manned aircraft. However, there are concerns about UAVs crashing more frequently and the dangers of unmanned vehicles sharing airspace with manned assets. The use of UAVs has grown due to advancements in technology, despite concerns about sharing airspace with manned assets. UAVs have a long history in aviation, with the AQM-34 Firebee being used in surveillance during the Vietnam War. The Israeli Air Force pioneered UAVs in the late 1970s and 1980s, which were later integrated into the US UAV inventory. This led to increased UAV funding in the Reagan Administration's FY1987 budget, marking the transition of UAVs in the US from experimental projects to acquisition programs. The Pioneer UAV, acquired from Israel, provided valuable intelligence during Operation Desert Storm. Following the Gulf War, military officials recognized the value of UAVs. The Air Force's Predator quickly gained new capabilities and debuted in the Balkans conflict, performing surveillance missions. Operations in Afghanistan featured the Global Hawk and armed reconnaissance missions for the Predator. There are currently five major UAVs in the U.S. inventory. Investment in UAVs has been increasing annually, with funding totaling over $1.1 billion in FY2003. The Pentagon has requested $1.6 billion for UAVs. The Pentagon has requested $1.6 billion in funding for UAV procurement and development for FY2006, with concerns from Congress about the future path of UAV technology. Congress has played a proactive role in UAV program management, advocating for joint program offices and a UAV roadmap. In 1996, Congress supported legislation to weaponize the Predator and Hunter UAVs, despite opposition from the DOD. The scope of Congress's support for UAV technology is evident from a prediction that one-third of U.S. military deep strike aircraft will be unmanned within ten years. The pace of UAV development has accelerated, raising questions about cost-efficiency, effectiveness, and interoperability. Congress may need to assess DOD's UAV efforts to ensure alignment with congressional direction and investment priorities as the balance between manned and unmanned capabilities shifts. The oversight responsibilities of Congress include assessing DOD's UAV efforts to ensure they align with new investment goals and strategies. UAVs, traditionally used for reconnaissance and surveillance, are now being utilized in unforeseen roles. Analysts suggest that unmanned aircraft could potentially replace a significant portion of manned aircraft. The defining characteristic of UAVs is their unmanned nature, leading to the possibility of a large-scale introduction into the military. The potential impact of widespread UAV deployment on military personnel, recruitment, retention, and industrial base issues is a concern as defense companies focus more on developing unmanned aircraft. The debate over whether UAVs will replace manned aircraft in the future raises questions about the skills and technologies needed for both types of aircraft. Additionally, as U.S. companies compete in the international UAV marketplace, concerns about proliferation and the need for control measures may arise. The growing use of UAVs raises questions about the need for control measures to prevent their spread to dangerous groups or countries. Congress may need to assess the development and management of UAV technologies, including whether the Department of Defense has a suitable plan for incorporating UAVs into military capabilities. Various UAV programs, from combat-tested to untested, are being developed with a wide range of sizes and capabilities. The sizes and ranges of UAVs vary greatly, from the small Wasp Micro UAV with a combat radius of 5 nautical miles to the large Global Hawk with a combat radius of 5,400 nm. The inventory of UAVs has significantly increased, including 2nd generation derivatives like Predator B and I-Gnat-ER, as well as non-traditional vehicles like Snow Goose, Onyx, and Neptune. The DoD's UAV inventory has increased due to rising demand for conducting various missions beyond ISR applications. Predator B has strike capability, while Predator As have been modified for weapons. J-UCAS targets air defenses. The DoD's UAV inventory has expanded to include roles such as mine detection, border patrol, and medical resupply. Research and development funding for UAVs has increased significantly, indicating continued growth in UAV acquisition. Despite this growth, manned aircraft still make up 95% of all DoD aircraft inventories. The DoD's UAV inventory has expanded to include various roles, with research funding indicating continued growth. Manned aircraft still dominate DoD inventories, but there are plans to accelerate UAV introduction and expand operations in the Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve. Former Air Force Chief of Staff, General John Jumper emphasized the need for faster production of UAVs, specifically the Predator, urging General Atomics to maximize production. Congress has pushed for a quicker pace of UAV development, with goals set for unmanned deep strike aircraft acquisition. In 1996, the House Armed Services Committee supported legislation to weaponize the Predator and Hunter UAVs, despite DoD opposition. Some in the 109th Congress advocated for increased UAV procurement for non-military roles. Congress expressed concerns about DoD's enthusiasm for UAVs potentially leading to unclear future paths, affecting product quality and acquisition efficiency. Critics worry that an overly ambitious pace could hinder congressional oversight and lead to cost overruns or program deviations. Oversight challenges in UAV programs may lead to cost overruns and deviations from design objectives. Representative Curt Weldon warns against prematurely fielding new vehicles and emphasizes the need for common standards in operations. Some services are purchasing UAVs with unauthorized funding, reducing congressional oversight by including UAV projects in larger program requests. The Global Hawk program faces challenges due to a crowded production schedule and aggressive funding strategy, leading to technology immaturity. A deceleration in pace and management changes are recommended to maintain quality and efficiency. Some argue that the rapid production of other UAVs shows that a fast pace can be effective. Many in Congress want assurances that tax-payer dollars are well-spent on UAV programs, with Section 142 of the FY2006 Defense Authorization Act requiring written approval for new unmanned aerial vehicle systems procurement by the military services. Congressional focus includes evaluating DoD's administrative processes and lines of authority for effective UAV development and acquisition. The management of DoD's development and acquisition programs has been a key concern in recent Congresses. The 108th and 109th Congresses have scrutinized the acquisition process of the Department of Defense, particularly regarding the procurement of UAVs. There are concerns about potential duplication of effort in acquiring UAVs, leading to calls for centralized acquisition authority. However, centralization may stifle competition and innovation. Cost growth issues similar to manned aircraft procurement have also been observed in UAV development. The Global Hawk program, once considered a cost-effective alternative to manned aircraft, is now facing significant cost growth issues. The program is estimated to cost $6.5 billion to purchase 51 aircraft, with a unit acquisition cost of $128 million per UAV. Factors such as mission creep and inconsistent management practices have contributed to the cost increases, with additional sensors driving up costs by requiring larger wings and more powerful engines. The Global Hawk program is facing cost growth issues due to factors like mission creep and inconsistent management practices. The requirement for additional sensors has led to the need for larger wings and more powerful engines, increasing costs. The Joint Unmanned Combat Air System (JUCAS) has also seen cost increases, with over $1 billion cut from its budget and management shifted from DARPA to the Air Force. These changes may reduce the number of aircraft procured but can raise the cost per aircraft. The management of UAV programs has seen frequent changes in responsibility, from military services to a Navy-run Joint Program Office (JPO) to the Defense Airborne Reconnaissance Office (DARO) and back to the services. Little progress has been made in establishing a comprehensive UAV management system, with Congress expressing serious reservations about the JPO's management in 1992. A comprehensive review of the joint project office is recommended. The Defense Airborne Reconnaissance Office (DARO) was created in 1993 to manage DoD's airborne reconnaissance programs, including UAVs. DARO faced criticism and was disbanded in 1998. Since then, there has been no single procurement focal point for DOD UAV efforts, with oversight authority in the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence (OASD(C3I)). The OSD established the Joint UAV Planning Task Force in 2001 to coordinate UAV programs across services. The task force standardizes payload development, interfaces, and future efforts. Dr. Glenn Lamartin stated that the task force is empowered to meet joint needs and provide structure. Three UAV Roadmaps have been published to achieve a common UAV vision. The OSD established the Joint UAV Planning Task Force in 2001 to coordinate UAV programs across services. Three UAV Roadmaps were published in April 2001, December 2002, and August 2005. Congressional concerns with UAV acquisition management persisted despite the task force's creation. Additional management mechanisms were initiated, including the U.S. Joint Forces Command leading UAV interoperability experimentation and the creation of the UAV Interoperability Working Group in 2003 for joint-service and international cooperation in UAV programs. The Joint Requirement Oversight Council (JROC) established a UAV Special Studies Group to advise on UAV issues. In 2005, OSD considered appointing a service as the executive agent for UAV programs, but later opted for two smaller organizations focusing on interoperability. The Joint UAV Overarching Integrated Product Team (OIPT) and the Joint UAV Center of Excellence work together to address interoperability and enhance UAV applications. Recent management initiatives aim to increase system uniformity and interoperability, but organizational changes have raised concerns about UAV management. The DoD has yet to establish a final UAV development and oversight structure to meet military needs. The recent establishment of the Joint UAV OIPT and Joint UAV COE is seen as a step in the right direction towards addressing UAV management concerns highlighted by the GAO. The DoD is working towards creating an oversight body to guide UAV development efforts and investment decisions. Air Force Major General Stephen M. Goldfein described the UAV Center of Excellence as a one-stop shop for exploring common operating systems and optimal UAV usage. Questions may arise regarding final management authority within these bodies or the services. Congress may need to address these issues in the future. The Joint UAV Task Force has released roadmaps outlining the future of UAS until 2030. The UAV Roadmap was released in 2001 and 2002, followed by the 2005-2030 UAS Roadmap in 2005. The purpose was to provide guidance on future roles, technological progress, opportunities, and investment needs for UAVs. The 2005 UAS Roadmap reiterated the need for oversight and guidance in areas such as standards development and interoperability solutions, without authorizing specific UAS or prioritizing requirements. The UAV Roadmap and the 2005 UAS Roadmap provide guidance on future UAV development paths and approaches, without establishing an authoritative blueprint. The discrepancy between the DoD's approach and the GAO's vision may lead to significant debate on future UAV management. Congress may revisit GAO recommendations to evaluate the Roadmap mandate for integrating UAVs into warfighting capabilities. Developing a coordinated, DOD-wide UAV investment strategy is crucial to avoid duplication and maximize scarce resources. Congress plays a key role in arbitrating between competing UAV investments and impacting DOD's overall investment plan. Key questions include how UAV cost is quantified, the balance between spending on UAVs and manned aircraft, and how to balance cost with capability. Quantifying UAV cost efficiency is complex but essential for maximizing UAV capabilities. The cost efficiency of UAVs can be measured by flyaway cost and program acquisition unit cost (PAUC). Flyaway cost includes prime mission equipment, systems engineering, program management, and allowances for engineering changes. PAUC is the total acquisition-related appropriations divided by the total quantity of fully configured end items. The difference between Global Hawk's PAUC and flyaway cost demonstrates a wide cost discrepancy. The cost of individual remotely piloted vehicles can be misleading as they are part of a system that includes ground control stations, ground crews, communication links, and other elements. Analysts comparing UAV costs to manned aircraft need to consider the cost of supporting elements and operational infrastructure. Budgeting conventions can complicate monitoring UAV costs, as they may be found in different accounts in budget documentation. The Army includes UAV funding requests in \"Other Procurement, Army,\" which contains a variety of items. UAV costs are sometimes covered in the Intelligence budget, complicating cost analysis. Congress may need to balance spending between UAVs and manned aircraft. The DoD is projected to spend over $18 billion on UAVs by 2010. The Department of Defense is projected to have spent over $18 billion on UAVs from 2001-2010, far exceeding the previous decade's spending. Funding for UAVs is expected to increase, with the Joint Unmanned Combat Air System budget breaking $1 billion by FY2011. UAV funding will remain under 10% of total military aviation spending from FY2006 to FY2011. The funding for UAVs from 2001-2010 exceeded $18 billion, with projections for continued increase. UAV funding remains under 10% of total military aviation spending, with cost savings being a debated advantage over manned aircraft. Critics question the actual savings considering the expenses of ground control stations and training for UAV operators. The cost of training and maintaining UAV pilots may not always be lower than manned aircraft pilots. UAVs have higher attrition and lower reliability rates, leading to potentially higher operation and maintenance costs. However, UAV ground control stations can manage multiple UAVs simultaneously, partially offsetting the cost advantage. Congress has acknowledged that while individual UAV acquisition costs may be low, the overall investment can rival larger weapon systems. Studies have shown that replacing manned helicopters with UCAVs may not result in significant procurement cost savings. The DoD studied comparative costs of manned vs. unmanned aircraft in their UAV Roadmap 2000, finding development costs were similar but a cost savings in procurement costs for unmanned combat aerial vehicles. The OSD faces challenges balancing cost with capability, especially with rising prices of some UAVs. Concerns have been raised about the cost growth of high-tech UAVs like Global Hawk and JUCAS, as well as less technologically ambitious UAVs. Members of Congress question at what point an \"expendable\" UAV becomes too costly to lose. The cost of UAVs is increasing due to the rising prices of sensors, which make up a significant portion of the vehicle's cost. The lack of competition in the UAV sensor market is driving up costs, prompting suggestions to equip UAVs with self-protection measures. The rising costs of sensors in UAVs have led to recommendations for self-protection measures. Two approaches for UAV employment are proposed: one advocates for many smaller, less expensive UAVs connected through a network, while the other suggests fewer, more expensive UAVs with less networking. The Global Hawk, a high altitude surveillance platform, operates independently from other UAVs. Programs at both ends of the UAV spectrum have faced delays and funding cuts due to management issues. Key areas for investment in UAVs include interoperability, reliability, autonomy, and engine systems. The slow advancement of interoperability in UAVs is a major concern, with the lack of communication between UAVs and ground components hindering mission effectiveness. The Department of Defense emphasizes the need for seamless communication and compatibility to prevent potential pitfalls in UAV usage within larger battlefield operations. Advancing UAV interoperability is crucial for better situational awareness and mission effectiveness. The Department of Defense aims to establish inter-communication between UAVs to facilitate interoperability among different categories, including situational awareness, surveillance data transfer, and weapons interface. The House of Representatives version of the FY2006 Defense Authorization Act (H.R. 1815, House Report 109-89) included a clause requiring all tactical unmanned aerial vehicles to be equipped with the Tactical Common Data Link for real-time situational awareness and sensor data transfer. The 2005 Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Roadmap aims to field the Common Data Link communications systems for all large UAVs to achieve interoperability. The finite bandwidth for military aircraft may hinder UAV applications, but the need for bandwidth grows with each war. Increased UAV use in the Iraq war highlights the importance of wideband data link for real-time situational awareness and targeting data. The use of UAVs in the Iraq war shows the need for a more robust information transfer system due to limited bandwidth, hindering the effective use of multiple UAVs. The Transformation Satellite Communications (TSAT) project aims to address bandwidth concerns for connecting UAVs to ground operators. The project, also known as \"the internet in the sky,\" is expected to provide unlimited communication capabilities for the U.S. armed forces by 2015-2016. Additionally, a more autonomous UAV could reduce bandwidth requirements by processing more data onboard. Global Hawk, an autonomous UAV, is the most aggressive bandwidth user. One solution to the bandwidth problem is operating UAVs from a manned stand-off aircraft, reducing reliance on satellites for communication. This approach also addresses pilot manpower and retention issues. Experimentation is ongoing, with a focus on controlling UAV sensor payload from the air and investing in reliability upgrades. The Defense Science Board highlighted high UAV mishap rates as a potential obstacle to widespread UAV deployment. Compared to manned aircraft, UAV mishap rates are notably higher. The DSB's study emphasized the need for advancements in system design, weather durability, and reliability to reduce mishap rates, noting that most UAVs have significantly fewer flight hours than the 100,000-hour benchmark used for calculations. The mishap rate of UAVs is a concern, especially in their early flight hours. Some UAVs like Predator and Global Hawk were rushed into combat before being fully developed. The DSB's report suggests that investing in upgrades and emerging technologies could reduce mishap rates. The 2005 UAS Roadmap proposes investments in self-repairing systems, auto take-off and recovery instruments, and heavy fuel engines. The incorporation of advanced materials and technologies such as flight control systems, auto take-off and recovery instruments, and heavy fuel engines aim to enhance UAV reliability. Innovations like enabling one ground operator to pilot multiple UAVs simultaneously are a key priority in the industry to reduce operator workload. Currently, most UAVs require at least two ground operators, but the goal is to have multiple vehicles controlled by one operator. The goal for UAV manufacturers is to reduce the operator-vehicle ratio to 2:1 and increase autonomy. This advancement could allow one operator to control multiple vehicles, enhancing combat capability. Significant investments in control technologies are needed to achieve this goal. The goal for UAV manufacturers is to reduce the operator-vehicle ratio to 2:1 and increase autonomy. Significant investments in control technologies are needed to achieve this goal. The Global Hawk, considered the most autonomous UAV, currently maintains an ACL of approximately 2.5, below the required level of eight for maximum use by a single pilot. J-UCAS plans aim to improve combat capabilities. The UAV industry aims to increase autonomy and reduce operator-vehicle ratio. Plans for J-UCAS include improving combat capabilities and achieving autonomous flight levels of six. Collaboration with FAA and DoD is focused on developing \"see and avoid\" technology for UAVs. Inter-UAV communication and interoperability are crucial for autonomous operations. Automation of sensor capabilities could enable one operator to control multiple drones. The Air Force has already tested a Predator upgrade allowing one operator to pilot up to four UAVs. The Multi-Aircraft Control (MAC) system allows one ground pilot to control the flight plan of four Predator UAVs. The goal is to consolidate the tasks of the four mission payload operators into one or fewer operators. The development of heavy fuel engines (HEF) is a top priority for UAV investment, as outlined in the OSD's 2005-2030 Unmanned Aviation System Roadmap. The Defense Science Board recommends investing in heavy fuel engines for Predator, Shadow, Hunter, and Fire Scout drones. Enrique J. Enriguez, President of Locust USA, Inc., testified about the military's need for heavy fuel engines for UAVs like Predator, Shadow, Hunter, and Fire Scout. The incorporation of heavy fuel engines could improve UAV performance, reduce servicing time, and enhance reliability. The use of heavy fuel engines in UAVs like Predator, Shadow, Pioneer, and Fire Scout could improve performance, reduce maintenance costs, and enhance reliability. However, there are challenges in designing lighter engines for smaller UAVs. An alternative being considered is a modified fuel cell by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, which could offer double the efficiency. Supporters of fuel cells believe they can double the efficiency of mid-sized UAVs, reduce their detectability, and lower their thermal signatures. The Air Combat Command is sponsoring a project to use fuel cells in smaller UAVs with a flight test expected in 2010. Questions arise about the DoD's plan for UAV roles and applications, including whether new roles are being explored aggressively enough and if there are alternative missions or platforms to consider. Most UAVs are traditionally used for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions. There has been a diversification of UAV missions with a rapid growth in overall programs. Concerns arise about unnecessary duplication with the production of numerous aircraft for the same basic mission. The development of UAVs for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions may face challenges due to potential duplication and service-specific requirements. Congress questions the need for new UAVs when existing ones like the Global Hawk have similar sensors but differ in altitude, range, endurance, and procedures. Future decisions by Congress may determine the justification for new UAV programs to avoid duplication. The comparison of ISR-capable UAVs in the OSD 2005-2030 UAS Roadmap shows that most UAVs have similar performance specifications. Critics question the need for producing different UAVs with similar capabilities, suggesting a consolidated inventory of key platforms could fulfill the same duties. However, proponents argue that basic performance capabilities alone do not justify the necessity of diverse UAVs. In recent years, the role of UAVs in combat missions has significantly increased, with various UAV models being equipped with different munitions. The necessity of UAVs is determined by factors such as landing/takeoff capabilities, durability, storage requirements, and cost, in addition to their basic performance capabilities. The UAV combat landscape has evolved, with Predator A and B UAVs armed with Hellfire missiles, while other models like Maverick, I-Gnat-ER, Fire Scout, and Hunter are undergoing armament evaluations. The J-UCAS program aims to create advanced UAVs for combat operations. The J-UCAS program aims to create the first UAV designed for offensive applications, with UAVs being used to deliver air-to-ground munitions. Cost and effectiveness comparisons between manned and unmanned aircraft are necessary to determine the attractiveness of using UAVs for combat operations. The MQ-9 Predator B costs $11.7 million, while the F-16 Falcon costs $35.5 million, with the F-16 able to carry four times the payload of the Predator B. This results in a cost per pound of munitions delivered of $4,680 for the Predator and $3,302 for the F-16. The F-16 is a versatile combat aircraft that can perform missions the Predator B cannot. Manned aircraft may be more cost-effective for air-to-ground combat, while UAVs excel in niche circumstances. UAVs are useful for electronic attack, psychological operations, and delivering medical supplies. UAVs are commonly used in foreign theaters, with a growing focus on homeland defense. One of the most discussed new mission areas for UAVs is homeland defense and security. The Coast Guard and U.S. Border Patrol plan to deploy UAVs like the Eagle Eye for coastal waters and border patrol. Congressional support exists for using UAVs like the Predator for border security. Interest is growing in using UAVs for domestic roles, such as long-duration law enforcement surveillance. The U.S. Department of Transportation has studied security roles for UAVs. The U.S. Department of Transportation has studied security roles for UAVs, including following trucks with hazardous cargo and using UAVs for relief efforts after disasters like Hurricane Katrina. The GoldenEye 100 UAV is expected to serve as a small-package transport for law enforcement during civil unrest. UAVs have also been used in agricultural purposes in countries like South Korea and Japan. The FAA is working to reconcile regulations for UAVs to play a role in homeland security. Upgrading collision avoidance capabilities is crucial for safe UAV operations in crowded airspace. Collaboration with the Department of Defense is key in reaching common ground for UAV-airspace operations. The integration of UAVs into the national airspace is a contentious issue, with the Defense Science Board emphasizing the urgent need for unencumbered access. However, NASA's decision to cancel funding for Access 5, a partnership for UAV incorporation, has raised concerns among advocates about hindering UAV development and global applications. Additionally, there is potential for large UAVs to take on aerial refueling tasks currently performed by tanker aircraft. The potential for large UAVs to take on aerial refueling tasks currently performed by KC-10 and KC-135 tanker aircraft is being explored by DOD. UAVs have demonstrated the ability to fly missions analogous to aerial refueling, and there are experiments to equip them for air-to-air combat missions. The Predator UAV has engaged in air-to-air combat with an Iraqi fighter aircraft, launching a Stinger missile before being shot down. This marks a significant step towards UAVs taking on more aggressive missions. Other options for these roles include manned aircraft, blimps, and space satellites, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. Some defense contractors are developing unmanned blimps that can float for months at 70,000 feet, carrying 4,000 pounds of payload. The OSD's 2005 UAS Roadmap includes lighter-than-air blimps for various roles like psychological operations and border monitoring. These platforms could offer border surveillance services with lower fuel dependency, but they lack maneuverability compared to UAVs like the Global Hawk. UAV manufacturers aim to have operational systems by 2010 for diverse missions. The goal is to develop an operational system by 2010 for homeland security missions using space satellites, which offer benefits but have limitations such as cumbersome tasking and limited capacity. Some satellites lack loitering capability and high costs of space launches are prompting consideration of UAVs like Global Hawk for communication relays. Concerns about mass UAV production include fears of replacing manned aircraft and degrading pilot skills. The Air Force is facing challenges with mass UAV production, as it may degrade pilot skills and tactical flexibility. There is a shift towards encouraging rated pilots to fly UAVs and offering incentives for them to do so. Retention implications are being considered, with efforts to redefine concepts of operations. The impact of increased UAV use on recruitment and retention in the military is complex. While some believed that recruitment would suffer due to preference for manned aircraft, the situation varies among services. The Air Force and Navy are actively reducing uniformed personnel, so reduced enlistments from increased UAV use may not have the anticipated impact. The central question is the qualifications required to operate UAVs, with the Air Force currently requiring Predator and Global Hawk. The Air Force currently requires Predator and Global Hawk operators to be pilot-rated officers, while other services do not have this requirement. This difference means there is no competition between manned and unmanned aircraft for pilots in other services. The increased use of UAVs may attract individuals who are not physically qualified to fly manned aircraft or who have no desire to do so. Additionally, flying armed UAVs may be more appealing to personnel inclined to fly manned aircraft. Flying UAVs could be seen as a compromise for those who want to \"fly\" but may not experience all the excitement of flying a manned aircraft. The Air Force believes that flying UAVs from control stations in the United States will be attractive to some Reservists and Guardsmen who may already be disinclined to experience an active duty lifestyle consistent with flying manned aircraft. UAVs like Global Hawk do not require a pilot and are more technologically sophisticated, but a trained pilot is still needed for effective operation. As UAV autonomy advances, the policy of requiring pilot-rated officers may be reviewed. Increased use of UAVs could potentially boost enlistment in other specialties if perceived as effective. Congress faces defense industrial base issues like foreign dependency, subsidies, consolidation, and competition. Should steps be taken to protect U.S. defense industries? The pursuit of UAVs by the Department of Defense raises concerns about potential impacts on the defense industrial base, particularly in relation to funding for manned aircraft programs and the erosion of technical expertise. Some argue that the ability to produce world-class combat aircraft is a crucial U.S. advantage that needs to be protected, while others believe that the industrial base is naturally evolving towards advanced UAV production. Some argue that the future of UAVs is overrated and there will still be a demand for manned aircraft post-JSF. They believe that focusing solely on unmanned aircraft design could lead to a loss of crucial skills and technologies, potentially causing a decline in U.S. dominance in tactical aircraft design. However, others believe that pursuing UAVs does not jeopardize critical manned aircraft design skills, as there is commonality between manned and unmanned combat aircraft in terms of technology and requirements. Major defense contractors are shifting towards unmanned aircraft design to stay competitive as UAVs play a prominent role in warfare. Companies like Boeing and Northrop Grumman are looking towards unmanned bombers and fighters for growth opportunities. The skills and technologies required for building manned aircraft are also applicable to unmanned aviation design. The global UAV market is growing rapidly, with estimates showing expenditures doubling from $2.1 billion in 2005 to $5 billion in 2014. While the combat aircraft market is larger, the UAV market is projected to see significant growth. It is crucial for U.S. companies to compete in this market to avoid losing market share to other countries like European, Russian, Israeli, Chinese, or South African companies. Capturing this new business and developing expertise in UAV technology areas is essential for maintaining a healthy defense industrial base. The global UAV market is rapidly growing, with expenditures doubling from $2.1 billion in 2005 to $5 billion in 2014. To keep U.S. industry competitive, nurturing expertise in UAV challenge areas is crucial. The proliferation of UAVs raises policy concerns, as controlling their components is difficult, making them accessible for covert programs. Congressional hearings have addressed the policy dimensions of UAV and cruise missile proliferation. The proliferation of UAVs and cruise missiles is a growing concern due to their accessibility for covert programs and potential military effectiveness in the wrong hands. Foreign companies are also increasingly involved in this technology. Foreign companies are gaining access to key technologies for UAVs, raising concerns about potential proliferation of critical UAV technologies. Policy makers may need to address issues related to UAV exports and military aid to allies. U.S. allies, including UAVs, raise concerns about proliferation of these weapon systems. UAVs used for ISR can positively identify enemy combatants, reducing accidental targeting of friendly forces. Overseers must weigh benefits of reducing collateral damage against potential acquisition of UAVs by enemy groups. Revisions to non-proliferation accords like MTCR may be needed to control UAV spread. Tighter controls on UAVs could impact industry. This section discusses program status and funding of prominent DoD UAV programs competing for congressional attention. The section focuses on small, man-portable UAVs that are not weaponized and do not receive as much congressional attention as larger UAV programs like Predator or Global Hawk. These UAVs are popular with ground forces but lack detailed cost and budget documentation. They are likely to increasingly compete with major UAV programs. The MQ-1 Predator, developed by General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, is a highly recognizable UAV with integrated surveillance and armament capabilities. It has enjoyed accelerated development schedules and increased procurement funding due to its high-profile use in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Predator is a medium-altitude, long-endurance UAV, roughly half the size of an Air Force F-16 Falcon, with a 27 feet long, 7 feet high body and a 48-foot wingspan. The MQ-1 Predator is a UAV with long, thin wings and a tail like an inverted \"V\". It operates at 10,000 to 15,000 feet, with a maximum altitude of 25,000 feet. The Air Force's Predator fleet is operated by the 11th, 15th, and 17th Reconnaissance Squadrons. The primary function of the Predator is reconnaissance and target acquisition with a 450-lb surveillance payload. The CIA also operates several Predators. The MQ-1 Predator is equipped with a 450-lb surveillance payload, including electro-optical and infrared cameras, a Multi-Spectral Targeting System (MTS) sensor ball, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), and satellite communications for beyond line-of-sight operations. It can also carry two Hellfire missiles for engaging targets directly. The addition of anti-tank ordinance allows the MQ-1 Predator to launch precision attacks with minimized sensor-to-shoot time. The Air Force changed the Predator's military designation to MQ-1 for multi-mission capabilities. The MQ-9 Predator B is a follow-on to the MQ-1, optimized for surveillance, target acquisition, and armed engagement with improved capabilities and larger dimensions. The Predator B drone is longer and has a larger wingspan than its predecessor, with a more powerful engine allowing for higher altitude, speed, endurance, and range. It can carry up to 16 Hellfire missiles or a mix of other weapons, making it comparable to the Army's Apache helicopter or an F-16 in terms of payload capacity. Additionally, it features an upgraded camera gimbal for extended range surveillance. The Mariner, a hybrid UAV combining features of the Predator B and NASA's Altair UAV, was developed by General Atomics for the Navy's BAMS program. It features an 86 ft. wing from the Altair, increased fuel capacity, and can operate at altitudes of 50,000 feet with a flight endurance of 49 hours. General Atomics partnered with Lockheed Martin to integrate a maritime radar for advanced surveillance capabilities. General Atomics is developing the Mariner UAV for the Navy's BAMS program, aiming to compete with Northrop Grumman's Global Hawk. They are also working on the Predator C, a third-generation UAV with a turbo-jet engine for long-endurance surveillance missions. Additionally, the Army uses the I-Gnat-ER as a temporary replacement for the RQ-5 Hunter during overhauls. The I-Gnat-ER is a medium altitude, long-endurance surveillance and reconnaissance platform developed by General Atomics as a downsized version of the Predator UAV. It has similar performance characteristics to the MQ-1 Predator A but with a shorter flight radius and lacks SAR and Beyond-Line-Of-Sight capabilities. The Army owns three I-Gnat vehicles for ER/MP CONOPS development. The Army is set to receive Predator UAVs equipped with SATCOM data links, MTS sensor/target designators, and Hellfire missiles by the end of 2005. The cost for a Predator A system in FY2005 was $18.0 million, while a Predator B system cost $46.8 million. The Air Force currently has 57 MQ-1 Predators and plans to increase the inventory of MQ-9 Predator Bs to 46 by FY2011. Predators are considered valuable assets for the Air Force. The Air Force plans to increase the inventory of MQ-9 Predator Bs to 46 by FY2011. The initial operation capability of the Predator B has been delayed to FY2009 to ensure proper infrastructure and strategies are in place. Congressional funding for Predator R&D and Procurement was increased in FY2005 and FY2006. Senate Authorizers supported research on integrating \"Viper Strike\" munitions on the Predator. The Predator UAV has gained distinction for its service to the Navy, Army, and Marine Corps since 1986. It was used during Operation Desert Storm in 1991 for reconnaissance and gun spotting missions. The Pioneer UAV was used by the Navy during Operation Desert Storm in 1991 for reconnaissance and gun spotting missions. The Navy passed its assets to the Marine Corps at the end of FY2002, and the Marine Corps plans to use the RQ-2 until 2010 or until a Vertical Take off and Landing UAV (VTUAV) is ready. The Pioneer is known for its durability and has undergone performance upgrades. It is 14 feet long, half the size of the MQ-1 Predator A UAV, with a maximum altitude of 15,000 feet and a flight range of 100 nautical miles. It can achieve flight through rocket-assisted takeoff, catapult launcher, or traditional runway takeoff. The Pioneer UAV, with a flight range of 100 nautical miles and a propeller-driven engine, has been used for real-time intelligence and reconnaissance missions since 1986. It has a 75 lb payload including an E-O/IR camera and can be recovered using a retrieval net. The Navy had planned to retire the Pioneer in 2004 but it continues to support operational commanders with over 36,500 flight hours. The Navy planned to retire the Pioneer UAV in 2004 but gave the systems to the Marine Corps instead. The Marine Corps aims to keep them operational for another 10 years through upgrades. Current procurement funds focus on post-production support, with no new system procurement. The Pioneer system, costing $17.2 million in FY2004, includes five vehicles, a ground control station, and launch/recovery devices. The Marine Corps currently operates 35 Pioneer UAVs from various locations. Northrop Grumman's RQ-4 Global Hawk is the largest and most expensive UAV in operation for the Department of Defense, with advanced surveillance capabilities. Despite its success in demonstrations and battlefield operations, concerns over cost and the complexity of adding intelligence systems have hindered its development progress. Pentagon officials and Congressional members have slowed down the program until cost issues are addressed. Global Hawk, a large UAV, has a 48-foot long airframe and can fly at 65,000 feet for up to 35 hours. Originally designed for autonomous operation, it now requires frequent intervention by remote operators. NorthropGrumman redesigned the Global Hawk, increasing its length to 48 feet and wingspan to 132 feet, allowing it to carry an additional 1000 lbs. of surveillance payload. The UAV provides persistent high-quality imagery for military commanders, with sensors including SAR, MTI, E-O digital camera, and IR sensor. The payload was expanded to create a multi-intelligence air vehicle. Northrop Grumman redesigned the Global Hawk to increase its payload capacity, creating a multi-intelligence air vehicle. The RQ-4B is equipped with an open-system architecture for multiple payloads like SIGINT and ELINT sensors. The addition of the MP-RTIP payload will enhance radar capabilities. Future plans include hyper-spectral sensors for improved imagery precision and laser communications for better information transfer. The goal is to create a UAV that works with space-based sensors to prevent tactical surprises. The Global Hawk, developed by Northrop Grumman Corporation, received authorization to fly in U.S. civilian airspace in 2003. It is considered for anti-drug smuggling and Coast Guard operations. The RQ-4A is expected to reach initial operational capability in 2006, with the Air Force planning to acquire 51 Global Hawks at a cost of $6.6 billion. Currently, the Air Force has 12 RQ-4A vehicles. The Air Force has 12 RQ-4A vehicles with a program-unit cost of $128.7 million for the Global Hawk. The program has faced cost overruns and delays, with recommendations to delay future purchases until a development strategy is implemented. Concerns over rising costs and mismanagement have sparked debate in Congress and the Pentagon. The FY2005 Defense Authorization Bill criticized the Air Force for misusing funds allocated for a counter-drug surveillance program. This led to a recommendation to cut $18 million from the President's R&D request for the Global Hawk. Additionally, the House Appropriations Committee expressed concerns over the Air Force's development strategy, resulting in cuts to the budget for advanced procurement and current year procurement. One RQ-4A was transferred to the Navy for FY2005 as a result of the cuts. In FY2005, the Air Force's procurement budget request was fully funded, but cuts were made to the Global Hawk program due to increasing costs. Michael Wynne emphasized that UAVs should not cost as much as manned aircraft. The Air Force planned to restructure the program to achieve IOC by the end of 2005. The House Appropriations Committee cut the President's FY2006 procurement request by $110 million and increased Global Hawk R&D by $21 million. The Global Hawk program faced cuts in FY2005 due to increasing costs, with the House Appropriations Committee cutting the President's FY2006 procurement request by $110 million and increasing Global Hawk R&D by $21 million. The Army's Hunter program, originally developed by Israel Aircraft Industries and TRW, has experienced turbulence with plans to acquire 52 systems canceled in 1996. The Army's Hunter program acquired 18 MQ-5B Hunter IIs in FY2004 and FY2005, with longer endurance and anti-tank munitions capability. Operated by various Military Intelligence Battalions, the MQ-5B can fly at altitudes up to 18,000 feet, reach speeds of 106 knots, and stay airborne for up to 15 hours. The Army's Hunter program has expanded its missions to include weaponization for tactical reconnaissance/strike operations and border surveillance. The Hunter primarily uses a gimbaled E-O/IR sensor payload for ISR functions, with plans for advanced software architecture to integrate future payloads. Northrop Grumman tested munitions for the Hunter payload in 2004. In 2004, Northrop Grumman tested Viper Strike precision guided munitions for the Hunter system. The Army has halted production on the RQ-5 Hunter and now uses the I-Gnat-ER to fill service gaps. All 32 Hunter UAVs are still operational and receive upgrades. The Hunter system cost $26.5 million in FY2004, with no funds allocated for procurement or R&D in FY2005 and FY2006. The FY2005 and FY2006 Defense budgets did not include funds for the procurement or R&D of the RQ-5 system. The Army awarded General Atomic's Warrior UAV the contract for the ER-MP UAV program in August 2005. Despite losing the contract, Northrop Grumman plans to market the Hunter II to other services. The Army selected AAI's RQ-7 Shadow for its TUAV program after a two-decade search for a suitable system. The Shadow reached full production capacity and an IOC in 2002, becoming the primary surveillance platform. The Shadow UAV, built by AAI Corporation, has become the primary airborne ISR tool for Army units worldwide. It has a range of 68 nautical miles, an average flight duration of five hours, and can reach a maximum altitude of 14,000 feet. The upgraded RQ-7B Shadow version has a larger wingspan and fuel capacity, allowing for an extra two hours of flight endurance. Its mission includes real-time reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition. The Shadow UAV provides real-time reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition information to the Army at the brigade level. It may also be used for medical resupply missions, delivering crucial items like blood and vaccines via parachute. Unlike the RQ-5 Hunter, the Shadow does not have weapons capabilities. Its 60-pound payload includes an E-O/IR sensor turret for day or night video relayed in real-time to a ground station. The Shadow will be equipped with the Tactical Common Data Link to network with battalion commanders and ground units as part of the Army's Future Combat System plans. The Army currently maintains an inventory of 100 Shadow UAVs at various military bases and with National Guard units. The program cost for a Shadow UAV system reached $16.4 million in FY2005. The Army intends to use the Shadow as the interim Class III TUAV for the future combat systems project, with plans to reach IOC in 2014. In FY2005, the Army procured eight TUAV systems and requested $26 million in FY2006 for retrofitting the existing Shadow fleet with upgrades. Total RDT&E requests equaled $53.6 million in FY2005. In the mid-1990s, the Pentagon began developing UAVs for combat missions, resulting in separate UCAV programs for the Air Force and Navy. Boeing's X-45 was favored by the Air Force, while Northrop Grumman's X-47 and Boeing's X-46 competed for the Navy's project. In 2003, the programs merged to form the J-UCAS project managed by DARPA. Total RDT&E requests were $53.6 million in FY2005 and $139.6 million in FY2006. The J-UCAS project, managed by DARPA, aimed to create a flexible offensive network combining air and ground elements for combat missions. DARPA transferred administration to the Air Force as part of PBD 753 in 2004, forming a joint planning committee with the Navy. The program will maintain competition between Boeing and Northrop Grumman. J-UCAS currently consists of two variants, with the X-45C being an enhanced version with a length of 39 feet and a wingspan of 49 feet. The X-45C, an enhanced version of the evaluationX-45A vehicles, is powered by General Electric's GE F404-102D turbojet engine. It can achieve speeds of 450 knots, altitudes of 40,000 feet, and stay aloft for up to seven hours. Boeing designed the X-45C with a stealthy arrowhead shape similar to the B-2 Spirit Bomber. Its competitor, Northrop Grumman's X-47B, has a longer wingspan of 62 feet and uses a Pratt & Whitney F100-220U turbojet engine for an endurance of nine hours. The X-47B, powered by a Pratt & Whitney F100-220U turbojet engine, has an endurance of nine hours and a range of 1,600 nautical miles. It features folding wing-tips for storage aboard aircraft carriers and a common operating system for both Air Force and Naval technology. The Air Force intended the X-45's mission to be suppression of enemy air defenses, while the Navy planned to use its UCAV for armed intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions. The Navy planned to use its UCAV for armed intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions. Both Boeing and Northrop Grumman's systems will have internal weapons bays and carry guided weapons like the GBU-31 JDAM. The UCAV programs have faced changes in administration and organization, potentially affecting development pace. In 2003, the Air Force and Navy's UCAV projects were combined under the DARPA-controlled J-UCAS program for interoperability. DARPA hired Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab to promote cooperation. The Office of the Secretary of Defense then instructed the Air Force to take control, complicating the program's future. The J-UCAS aircraft inventory includes X-45A and X-47A air vehicles, with plans for X-45Cs and X-47Bs by 2006. Flight assessments are expected to begin soon. The J-UCAS/UCAV program, with over $1.45 billion in funding, is one of the most expensive UAV ventures by DoD. The FireScout, initially designed for the Navy, was revived by the Army in 2003 as the interim Class IV UAV. Army's interest led to renewed Navy funding for the RQ-8, making it DoD's first joint UAV helicopter. The Fire Scout, a joint UAV helicopter funded by the DoD, has been upgraded with new capabilities and features. It is based on a commercial helicopter design and has autonomous flight capabilities. With a payload capacity of 127 lbs, it can stay aloft for up to 9.5 hours. The surveillance payload includes a laser designator, IR camera, and multi-color EO camera for various mission capabilities. The Fire Scout UAV helicopter has line-of-sight communication data links and plans to expand to include wideband data relay and satellite communications. There are discussions of arming the helicopter with various weapons for strike missions and future missions include border patrol, search and rescue, medical resupply, and submarine spotting operations. Currently, five RQ-8A air vehicles and four ground stations are in the developmental testing phase. Four ground stations have reached the developmental testing phase of the acquisition process for Fire Scouts, low-rate-initial-production vehicles. The Army and Navy anticipate a future inventory of 192 vehicles. The Army plans for full-rate production in 2008 and IOC by 2010, intending to use the Fire Scout for its Future Combat System program. The Navy selected the RQ-8B to support the Littoral Combat Ship class. Fire Scout funding is spread across Navy and Army programs. The Coast Guard selected Bell Helicopter Textron's TR911D Eagle Eye tiltrotor UAV for its Deepwater Modernization program, managed by a partnership of manufacturers including Bell, Lockheed Martin, and AAI. The Eagle Eye, a $3 million vehicle, can take off vertically like a helicopter and fly like a plane. The Coast Guard plans to acquire 69 vehicles to enhance surveillance capabilities. It can patrol the U.S. coastline, transmit video and infrared images, fly up to 220 knots, and has an operational radius of 300 miles. The Marine Corps is interested in using it as a replacement for the RQ-2 Pioneer. Lockheed Martin's Force Protection Aerial Surveillance System (FPASS) monitors airbase perimeters for the Air Force. Lockheed Martin's FPASS, known as the Desert Hawk, monitors airbase perimeters in Iraq and Afghanistan to prevent enemy incursions. Developed in 1999 for U.S. Central Command, it improves situational awareness through surveillance and patrols. The UAV is launched by a slingshot, flies preprogrammed paths for up to an hour, and carries a small camera for reconnaissance. Its simple design allows for on-the-job repairs with tape or glue. The Desert Hawk UAV is used by the Air Force with a total inventory of 126 vehicles. Each system costs approximately $300,000. Dragon Eye, a backpack-carried UAV by AeroVironment, provides reconnaissance and surveillance capabilities with autonomous GPS navigation. It has a compact design, an operational endurance of 45 minutes, and can travel up to two and a half nautical miles. The Dragon Eye UAV has an operational endurance of 45 minutes and can travel up to two and a half nautical miles. The Marine Corps awarded AeroVironment a contract for approximately 300 systems of full-rate-production Dragon Eyes. Each system costs $154,000. The FQM-151 Pointer UAV is currently in service in Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom, with a flight endurance of two hours. The Pointer UAV weighs nearly 8.5 lbs with a 9-foot wingspan, requiring two personnel for transportation. It carries IR or daytime E-O sensors and is used by the Air Force and Special Operations Command. AeroVironment is developing the Puma as the Pointer's successor. The Raven UAV was designed for simplicity, portability, and short-range utility for the warfighter. The Raven UAV, engineered from the Pointer design, is smaller and lighter, making it backpackable for Army and SOCOM personnel. It is hand-launched with an electric motor, powered by rechargeable batteries, and equipped with IR or E-O cameras for real-time image transmission to ground operators. The vehicle lands via a controlled crash, with Kevlar plating for protection. The Silver Fox UAV, developed by Advanced Ceramic Research in collaboration with the Office of Naval Research, is a Diesel-powered front propeller UAV designed for tactical ISR support. It has a five-foot fuselage, an eight-foot wingspan, and houses both a daylight E-O and micro-IR camera for surveillance purposes. Flight is achieved through a compressed air catapult or by hand, depending on wind speed. The Scan Eagle UAV, developed by Boeing and the Insitu Group, is known for its long endurance capabilities and low cost. It features a single propeller gasoline powered design with a wingspan two and a half times the length of its fuselage. The vehicle can reach altitudes of 19,000 feet, travel over 60 nautical miles, and has a flight endurance of nearly 20 hours. Equipped with an inertially stabilized camera turret carrying E-O and IR sensors, the Scan Eagle autonomously flies to designated points of interest selected by a ground operator. The Scan Eagle UAV, developed by Boeing and the Insitu Group, features a stabilized camera turret with E-O and IR sensors. It can be launched from a ship and has a Skyhook recovery system. The Marine Corps is evaluating two systems under lease, with an expected price of approximately $100,000 per unit."
