    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"CLEAR Cost Information Act of 2013\". It involves the reporting of certain hospital payment data. The Social Security Act is being amended in various subsections, including adding new subparagraphs and redesignating existing ones. The Social Security Act is being amended to require subsection (d) hospitals to report payment data to the Secretary and submit data on amounts collected from uninsured and insured patients for specific procedures over the past 2 years. The procedures described in paragraph (2) involve reporting the 50 most common diagnosis-related groups and ambulatory payment classification groups for payment determination. Transparency is required in data reporting for consumer benefit, with information made publicly available on a searchable website by the Secretary. The amendments made by this section require hospitals to provide easily comparable information on collections and policies by zip code on their website. Hospitals must also include a link to this data on their homepage. These changes apply to contracts entered into or renewed after the enactment of this Act. The Act mandates that MedPAC's annual reports to Congress include data on the percentage of charity care provided by hospitals. Additionally, a report on charity care trends from certain hospitals must be made publicly available. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act now requires the Secretary of the Treasury to post data on a publicly accessible website for meaningful comparisons by zip code. Additionally, hospitals must provide a link to this data on their home webpage as per Medicare requirements. The Social Security Act is amended to require hospitals and critical access hospitals to include a link on their website to data posted under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. These amendments apply to contracts entered into or renewed on or after a specified date. The amendments shall apply to contracts entered into or renewed on or after the date of the enactment of this Act."
