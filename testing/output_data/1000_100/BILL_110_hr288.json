    "content": "The \"Notch Baby Act of 2007\" establishes a new guaranteed minimum primary insurance amount for individuals eligible during a transitional period. Section 215(a) of the Social Security Act is amended to include provisions for individuals becoming eligible for old-age insurance benefits between 1978 and 1989. This amendment ensures that the primary insurance amount is adjusted to include a transitional increase amount for qualifying individuals. The product is determined by multiplying the excess under former law by the applicable percentage based on the year the individual becomes eligible for old-age insurance benefits. The applicable percentage for old-age insurance benefits eligibility ranges from 60 percent in 1979 or 1980 to 10 percent in 1987 or 1988. The term 'excess under former law' refers to the difference between the former law primary insurance amount and the individual's primary amount. The term 'applicable former law primary insurance amount' refers to the individual's primary insurance amount calculated under previous laws, without certain adjustments. The paragraph outlines exceptions and provisions related to the application of certain sections and calculations for an individual's computation base years and primary insurance amount under specific conditions. The paragraph provides an exception for individuals where applying certain calculations results in a higher primary insurance amount than if computed without the exception. SEC. 3. EFFECTIVE DATE AND RELATED RULES. The amendments made by this Act are effective as if they were part of the Social Security Amendments of 1977, with no benefit increases before January 2007. Recomputation of benefits is required for individuals entitled to monthly insurance benefits under the Social Security Act for December 2006. The Commissioner of Social Security will recompute the primary insurance amount for individuals entitled to monthly insurance benefits under the Social Security Act after December 1978, to reflect the amendments made by the Act."
