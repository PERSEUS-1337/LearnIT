    "content": "The United States has historically been a major provider of food aid globally, but funding for agricultural development has decreased over the years. Critics argue that this has reduced the country's capacity to provide assistance. President Obama made alleviating global hunger a priority during his administration, especially in response to the global food price crisis of 2007-2008. In 2009, the Obama Administration pledged $3.5 billion over three years for a new global hunger and food security initiative. The Obama Administration pledged $3.5 billion over three years (FY2010 to FY2012) for the Feed the Future initiative, aiming to promote global agricultural development, increase food production, and improve food security and nutrition, especially for vulnerable populations. There is a call for reform in American food aid and foreign assistance, with a focus on innovative approaches and increased involvement from local populations and the private sector. The Obama Administration pledged $3.5 billion over three years for the Feed the Future initiative to promote global agricultural development and improve food security. Congress plays a central role in funding and oversight of agricultural development programs, which are administered by various U.S. agencies and international organizations. The 112th Congress may consider legislation related to global food security initiatives. The 112th Congress may consider legislation to authorize and fund aspects of the food security initiative, including support for agricultural development assistance and international agriculture research. Legislation to revise the authorizing statute for U.S. foreign assistance was also introduced in the last Congress. The prospects for consideration of increases to U.S. foreign assistance funding are uncertain due to the change in House leadership and the federal budget deficit situation. The primary objectives of this report are to provide a context for the state of food insecurity in the world and an overview of the Obama Administration's global hunger efforts. The global food insecurity crisis has led to over 1 billion people being undernourished in 2009. The number of chronically hungry individuals is estimated to be 925 million in 2010, down from 1.023 billion in 2009. The Obama Administration's Feed the Future initiative aims to address these issues, and the 112th Congress may consider legislation to support agricultural development and global food security. The number of undernourished people globally has been increasing steadily due to food price crisis and the current global recession. FAO data shows that hunger reduction gains made in the past were reversed between 1995-2006 as investment in agriculture declined. The recent food and economic crises have further worsened the situation, with the proportion of undernourished people on the rise again. The proportion of undernourished people globally had been decreasing, but in 2008, it increased by one percentage point, slowing progress towards reducing hunger and poverty. The majority of undernourished individuals are in developing countries, with Asia and the Pacific having the highest number. The 2010 hunger report showed a 9.6% decline in global hunger from the previous year. The 2010 hunger figure globally decreased by 9.6% from 2009, with Asia seeing an 80 million reduction in hungry people. Sub-Saharan Africa had a smaller drop of 12 million, but still has the highest food insecurity rates. The 2010 Global Health Index improved by almost one-quarter from 1990 to 2010, with varying progress across regions and countries. The Global Health Index improved by almost one-quarter from 1990 to 2010, with varying progress across regions and countries. In South Asia, the GHI scores decreased by 25%, and in the Near East and North Africa by 33%. Southeast Asia and Latin America saw a significant decrease of 40% or more. South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa have the highest GHI scores, but South Asia has made more progress since 1990. The causes of hunger differ between the two regions, with factors like low nutritional and educational status of women in South Asia, and government effectiveness and conflict in sub-Saharan Africa contributing to high child mortality and food insecurity. According to IFPRI, countries in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia have high Global Hunger Index (GHI) scores, with slow progress in reducing them. Only a few countries achieved a 50% reduction in GHI scores over the past decades. Conflict and political instability have worsened hunger in countries like The Democratic Republic of Congo, Burundi, Comoros, Guinea-Bissau, and Liberia. Swaziland's high HIV prevalence also contributes to food insecurity. In Swaziland, high HIV prevalence and inequality have severely undermined food security despite higher national incomes. The Gambia saw a rise in undernourishment due to lower social protection spending. Zimbabwe's economic collapse increased underweight children and child mortality. Some countries, including Angola, Ethiopia, Ghana, Mozambique, Nicaragua, and Vietnam, made significant progress in improving their GHI scores. Ghana was among the top performers in improving their GHI score since 1990. President Obama prioritized alleviating global hunger in his inaugural address. President Obama pledged $3.5 billion over three years at the G8 Summit in Italy to address global hunger and food security. The Global Partnership for Agriculture and Food Security was launched with a goal of mobilizing $20 billion to combat hunger and poverty. The summit committed to five principles for a food security initiative, including supporting comprehensive strategies and improving coordination among donors. The G8 leaders pledged sustainable funding to enhance world production capacity and reverse the trend of decreasing official development assistance for agriculture. The initiative aims to promote sustainable production, productivity, and rural economic growth, along with social protection mechanisms for the most vulnerable. Emergency assistance like food aid remains crucial for addressing acute hunger. The initiative supports the implementation of country and regional agricultural strategies through country-led coordination processes. The Accra Agenda for Action (AAA) aims to reform development aid by promoting country-led coordination processes for agricultural strategies and plans. Developing countries commit to taking control of their futures, while donors pledge to coordinate better and be accountable. In sub-Saharan Africa, the G8 supports the Comprehensive Africa Agricultural Development Program (CAADP) to target resources to countries' priorities. The Comprehensive Africa Agricultural Development Program (CAADP) was established in 2003 as part of the African Union's New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD). It aims to improve food security, nutrition, and increase incomes of smallholder farmers by raising agricultural productivity by 6% annually and increasing public investment in agriculture to 10% of national budgets. Additionally, the program aligns with the Comprehensive Framework for Action (CFA) of the U.N. High-Level Task Force on Global Food Security Crisis to address immediate and long-term food and nutrition security challenges. The CFA proposed addressing immediate needs by enhancing emergency food assistance, nutrition interventions, and safety nets, boosting smallholder farmer food production, adjusting trade and tax policies, and managing the macroeconomic situation. For longer-term food security, they called for expanding social protection systems, sustaining smallholder farmer-led food availability growth, improving international food market accessibility, and developing an international biofuels consensus. The G20 Summit in 2009 endorsed the L'Aquila food security initiative and established a World Bank Food Security Trust Fund to finance investments in agricultural productivity and market access in low-income countries. At the G20 Summit, countries pledged $2 billion to support the Global Partnership, bringing the total to $22 billion. The United States collaborated with private sector actors on food security efforts. FAO convened a World Summit on Food Security in Rome, where international leaders endorsed the Global Partnership and renewed commitments to reduce hunger by half by 2015. Agricultural output needed to increase to meet goals. The U.S. State Department issued a Global Hunger and Food Security Initiative Consultation Document in 2009, leading to the launch of the \"Feed the Future\" Initiative in 2010. This initiative aims to increase agricultural output by 70% to feed a growing global population. The strategy was developed through a consultative process within the U.S. government and with the global community. The \"Feed the Future\" Initiative, launched in 2010, aims to increase agricultural output by 70% to feed a growing global population. It works with various stakeholders to accelerate inclusive agriculture sector growth and improve nutritional status in specific countries through interventions like improving agricultural productivity and expanding markets for agricultural commodities. The Feed the Future (FtF) initiative aims to boost agricultural production and income for smallholder farmers in rural areas by adapting to local conditions, expanding markets, and promoting policies and infrastructure. Progress will be measured by changes in agricultural production and farmers' income levels. The initiative also focuses on linking agriculture with improved nutrition outcomes and collaborates with governments, development partners, and the USG's Global Health Initiative. The Feed the Future (FtF) initiative collaborates with host governments, development partners, and the USG's Global Health Initiative to implement a nutrition strategy based on country-specific needs. Progress will be measured through changes in the prevalence of stunted and wasted children, and underweight women. The initiative also includes investments in regional programs, the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program, strategic partnerships with countries like Brazil, India, and China, and global research and innovation. FtF does not explicitly include traditional U.S. food aid funding but maintains a commitment to providing emergency and humanitarian food assistance. Currently focusing on 20 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. The Feed the Future (FtF) initiative is currently focusing on 20 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean. These countries were selected based on criteria such as chronic hunger, potential for agricultural-led growth, regional synergies, government commitment, and resource availability. FtF investments will occur in two phases, with Phase 1 countries preparing their country investment plans (CIPs) and receiving assistance in capacity-building and technical support. Phase 2 countries must have completed a CIP outlining priority areas, financial projections, targets, beneficiary analysis, and a practical implementation plan. They must also commit resources and establish a policy environment conducive to agricultural development and improved nutrition. FtF partners with selected countries to develop and implement CIPs aligned with the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program. The Administration's FY2011 budget request includes $1.64 billion for FtF activities, which is about 3% of the total international affairs budget. The FY2011 request for FtF is about 40% greater than the estimated FY2010 allocation, with the increase largely the result of $408 million. The FY2011 budget request for Food for Peace activities includes $1.64 billion, representing about 3% of the total international affairs budget. This request is 40% higher than the estimated FY2010 allocation, mainly due to $408 million for a new multilateral trust fund for global food security at the World Bank. Additionally, the Administration is seeking $4.2 billion for humanitarian and emergency assistance in FY2011. The FY2011 budget request includes $861 million for Refugee Assistance, $861 million for International Disaster Assistance, and $45 million for Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance. There have been discussions about reforming U.S. foreign aid programs to better address national security challenges and development needs. The Obama Administration has made efforts to address issues with foreign aid and potential reform processes. The State Department launched the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review (QDDR) in 2009 to develop a whole-of-government approach to U.S. development policy. Despite delays, Secretary Clinton released the findings in 2010 in a strategy document titled \"Leading Through Civilian Power,\" aiming to elevate American \"civilian power\" to better advance national interests and be a stronger partner to the military. The QDDR and PSD-7 were initiatives launched by the Administration in 2009 to review and enhance U.S. foreign policy and development objectives. The QDDR developed strategies and recommended tools and resources for implementation, while the PSD-7 focused on reviewing the roles of U.S. government agencies in global development. Led by key officials, these efforts aimed to make U.S. development policy more effective. The National Security Council (NSC) staff involved in development, democracy, and regional issues play key roles in the PSD review. A draft of PSD-7 titled \"A New Way Forward on Global Development\" prioritizes economic growth and democratic governance, aiming to elevate development as a key pillar of U.S. foreign policy. The PSD-7 process, initially planned for completion in 2010, has been significantly delayed. The PSD-7 process, originally planned for completion in 2010, has been delayed. President Obama announced a new Presidential Policy Directive on Global Development, emphasizing development, diplomacy, and defense as pillars of American power. Global Food Security, Climate Change, and Global Health are key initiatives. The national security staff will coordinate implementation starting with the FY2012 budget process. The USAID Administrator announced the establishment of a new Bureau for Food Security (BFS) to drive food security efforts and coordinate with other agencies. The 112th Congress may face issues on agricultural development, global food security, and U.S. foreign aid reform. The U.S. pledged $3.5 billion over three years to support the Global Agriculture and Food Security Partnership at the G8 Summit in 2009. Congressional appropriations measures could fulfill this pledge. Congress is considering FY2011 appropriations for agricultural development and food security within the Feed the Future Initiative. The House approved a draft funding bill with $4 billion less than the Obama Administration request. The Senate also approved a funding bill with $1.40 billion less than the House subcommittee draft. The Senate bill for FY2011 appropriations included $1.3 billion less than the Administration's request for food security and agriculture development programs under the Feed the Future initiative. Congress did not enact any of the 12 regular appropriations bills for FY2011, instead funding the federal government through continuing resolutions. The current fiscal situation and shift in congressional leadership may lead to further debate on funding priorities. Some skepticism exists in the international community regarding the G8's commitment to the Global Partnership, which stands at $22 billion over three years. The total amount pledged to the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program Trust Fund was US$914 million, but only US$263 million has been received from donors. Concerns have been raised about the lack of strong leadership at USAID, with criticism directed at the Obama Administration for delays in appointing a USAID Administrator. Critics have raised concerns about the leadership vacuum at USAID due to delays in appointing key officials, allowing other federal agencies to take on development roles traditionally held by USAID. This fragmented approach has been criticized for potentially undermining USAID's authority and resources, with some key foreign policy challenges lacking USAID's development perspective. Several senior government officials, including Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and former USAID Administrator Peter McPherson, have raised concerns about the decline in staff capacity at USAID over the past few decades. Secretary Gates highlighted the imbalance between military and civilian elements in the national security apparatus, attributing it to a lack of capacity rather than willingness. This issue stems from the consequences of the 1990s when key instruments of U.S. power abroad were reduced or neglected. The State Department froze hiring of new Foreign Service officers and USAID's staff has significantly decreased over the years. Testimony at a hearing noted that USAID had 2,000 permanent foreign officers in 1980, which declined to about 1,000 by 2008. Currently, USAID has limited technical expertise and has shifted to contracting out a large portion of its foreign aid program. Staff cuts have led to reduced on-the-ground effectiveness and the closure of overseas missions. Since the 1950s and 1960s, the U.S. government has relied on land-grant universities to help establish institutions in developing countries. USAID has faced challenges in managing its agricultural development projects due to staff shortages and has been working to rebuild its technical capacity by hiring more foreign-service officers. This shift towards contracting out a large portion of its foreign aid program has led to less coherence, effectiveness, flexibility, and leverage with other funders. In 1975, land-grant universities were requested to help establish counterpart institutions in developing countries through the Title XII \"Famine Prevention and Freedom from Hunger\" amendment. However, USAID's role in capacity building has declined since the 1990s, leading to reduced support for agricultural research and weaker institutional capacity in partner countries. USAID has recognized the importance of long-term institutional building in developing countries. However, questions remain about the funding and capacity of USAID programs, especially in agriculture. Some believe there is a lack of institutional capacity in both the United States and developing countries, particularly in Africa, hindering the implementation of agricultural programs. Sub-Saharan Africa is noted to have a weak scientific foundation for modern agriculture, with reluctance from African governments and donors to invest in science. African governments and donors have been hesitant to invest in science and technology for agricultural productivity. Several U.S. agencies are involved in agricultural development and food security assistance, requiring interagency coordination. The Chicago Council recommended creating an Interagency Council on Global Agriculture within the Executive Office of the President to provide leadership and maintain consistent priorities among U.S. government agencies in food aid and nutrition. The Government Accountability Office highlighted coordination issues between USDA, USAID, and other agencies in providing food aid and development assistance. The Feed the Future initiative aims to improve interagency coordination for better outcomes in food security efforts. The QDDR states that USAID will lead the Feed the Future initiative, but coordination with other government agencies is unclear. Bills in Congress emphasize the need for interagency coordination in addressing global hunger. Funding implications of a whole-of-government approach are not clearly defined. In the late 1990s, donors and aid agencies began harmonizing their strategies to make international aid more effective. The United States coordinates with other donors like Canada, the UK, Japan, and the EU, as well as international bodies like the UN and OECD. Global summits also play a key role in donor coordination. In 2008, Accra played a crucial role in donor coordination and establishing international development goals. Donors agreed to increase aid predictability and flexibility, aligning with other donors like the United States. This includes USAID support for the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program (CAADP) to boost agricultural productivity in Africa. The Administration's global food security initiative also endorses U.N-sponsored principles and objectives. The initiative supports U.N.-endorsed principles and objectives, but some argue progress is slow. There are concerns about the U.S. aligning with other donors and the emphasis on country-led planning for aid activities. Members of Congress have raised issues about donor control and oversight. Some concerns have been raised about the capacity of developing countries to align with donor objectives and carry out accountability measures. There are worries that country-led planning may become government-led, excluding civil society and private sector actors. Little coordination is mentioned between U.S. food aid and the Food for Peace program, despite the significant funding for food aid. The United States is providing $1.69 billion for Food for Peace Title II food aid in 20 focus countries. Questions arise on coordinating U.S. food aid with Feed the Future activities, potential adverse effects, and integrating cross-cutting initiatives like gender and climate change into country plans. Coordination between U.S. food aid and the Food for Peace program is lacking despite significant funding. The Administration is working on defining key indicators and metrics for the Feed the Future initiative, but it is unclear which agency will be responsible for monitoring progress. Questions remain about the timeline for results, achieving MDG1 in 20 countries, and how frequently Congress will receive updates."
