    "content": "The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) is the federal statute for children with disabilities, providing funding and setting principles for special education services. Requirements include offering a free appropriate public education (FAPE) to all eligible children, evaluating disabilities regardless of severity, and creating individual education programs (IEPs) for each child. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) requires an individual education program (IEP) for children with disabilities, outlining special education services. Parents are involved in planning and overseeing the child's education. IDEA ensures that children with disabilities are educated alongside non-disabled peers and provides procedural safeguards for parents, including the right to a due process hearing and appeal. IDEA was enacted in 1975 to address the need for education for children with disabilities. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) requires an individual education program (IEP) for children with disabilities, outlining special education services. The most recent reauthorization of IDEA was P.L. 108-446 in 2004, with specific authorizations for appropriations through 2011. Congress is currently identifying potential issues for the next reauthorization. The IDEA definition of a child with a disability is categorical, requiring special education and related services. The court in Hansen v. Republic R-III School District examined whether a child with conduct disorder, bipolar disorder, and ADHD qualified as a child with a disability under IDEA. The child was found to meet the categories of serious emotional disturbance and other health impairments, struggling academically despite efforts. In L.I. v. Maine School Administrative District No. 55, the First Circuit Court of Appeals determined that a child with Asperger's Syndrome and an adjustment disorder with depressed mood was considered a child with a disability under IDEA, despite high grades and non-disruptive behavior. The court rejected the notion that IDEA only applies to children whose disabilities significantly impact educational performance. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the argument that a child with schizophrenia was not a child with a disability because the disability did not adversely affect her school performance. In contrast, the Ninth Circuit held that a child with ADHD, depression, reactive attachment disorder, and post traumatic stress disorder was not eligible for IDEA services because her inappropriate behavior did not adversely affect her educational performance. In Alvin Independent School District v. AD, the Fifth Circuit found no adverse educational effect from the child's ADHD. Mr. and Mrs. N.C. v. Bedford Central School District examined whether a child with dysthymic disorder met the requirements of the IDEA regulations for seriously emotionally disturbed and found that the child's behavior fell short of the requirements. The Second Circuit noted that even if the child qualified as seriously emotionally disturbed, there was insufficient evidence that his educational performance was adversely affected. IDEA requires states to submit a plan to the Secretary of Education indicating certain policies and procedures in effect to receive funds under the statute. The Ninth Circuit held in Compton Unified School District v. Addison that failing to evaluate a ninth grader who showed signs of needing special education services violated the IDEA's child find requirement. The Supreme Court is considering whether parents can file a due process complaint for negligence in such cases. The IDEA ensures that children with disabilities have the right to a due process hearing if school officials fail to provide an appropriate educational program. FAPE requires states to offer special education and related services at no cost to the family, meeting state standards and conforming to an individualized education program. The Supreme Court decision in Board of Education of the Hendrick Hudson Central School District v. Rowley in 1982 established the requirements of FAPE under IDEA. It emphasized that the education provided to children with disabilities must confer some educational benefit, consisting of personalized instruction and support services tailored to the child's needs. The Supreme Court decision in Board of Education of the Hendrick Hudson Central School District v. Rowley in 1982 established that children with disabilities must receive personalized instruction and support services to benefit educationally. The instruction should meet state standards, approximate grade levels, and align with the child's IEP. The IEP should enable the child to achieve passing marks and advance grades, but states are not required to maximize each child's potential. The Supreme Court decision in Board of Education of the Hendrick Hudson Central School District v. Rowley in 1982 established that children with disabilities must receive personalized instruction and support services to benefit educationally. The FAPE requirement is met if the child is progressing from grade to grade and making measurable gains. Courts must avoid imposing their view of educational methods on states, leaving the responsibility to state and local agencies. The Court did not establish a specific test for determining educational benefits, focusing on the individual case instead. Rowley remains a key decision under IDEA. The Supreme Court decision in Board of Education of the Hendrick Hudson Central School District v. Rowley in 1982 established that children with disabilities must receive personalized instruction and support services to benefit educationally. Rowley remains a key decision under IDEA and is often cited by courts attempting to determine the parameters of a free appropriate public education. Some courts have interpreted Rowley to support schools' IEPs if procedural requirements are met, even if educational progress is minimal. For example, in Fort Zumwalt School District v. Clynes, the Eighth Circuit emphasized Rowley's \"access to education\" requirement and held that the IEP was adequate, despite dissenting opinions arguing otherwise. Some courts have interpreted IDEA to require educational services but not medical services, focusing on providing more than minimal educational benefit. Courts like the Third Circuit in Polk v. Cent. Susquehanna Intermediate Unit 16 and the Fifth Circuit in Cypress-Fairbanks Indep. School District v. Michael F. have emphasized the need for meaningful educational benefits in an IEP, outlining factors such as individualization, least restrictive environment, coordinated services, and positive outcomes. In Falzett v. Pocono Mountain School District, a student received FAPE under IDEA despite missed days and limited curriculum, as SAT scores improved and excellent grades were achieved. However, in Ringwood Board of Education v. K.H.J., the Third Circuit ruled that above-average intelligence requires more than a negligible benefit under IDEA. Procedural violations do not always constitute a violation of FAPE. Certain procedural violations may not necessarily result in a violation of FAPE, as they must impact the child's substantive rights. For instance, delays in implementing IEP services or inaccessible facilities may not automatically violate FAPE if there is overall program accessibility. However, in cases like N.B. and C.B. v. Hellgate Elementary School District, failure to evaluate a child in all areas of suspected disability was deemed a procedural error that denied FAPE. Similarly, unilaterally scheduling an IEP meeting without proper attempts can also result in a denial of FAPE. The Supreme Court's analysis in Rowley regarding educational standards is somewhat confused by changes in the usage of the term. The term now refers to specific content-based standards reflecting the standards-based education movement. The 1997 Amendments to IDEA significantly changed IEP requirements to include a statement of the child's present levels of. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA emphasized the importance of high expectations for children with disabilities and their access to the general curriculum. This aligns with the standards-based education movement and the changes in educational standards since the Rowley case. The 2004 Amendments to IDEA require specially designed instruction and related services to be based on peer-reviewed research. This requirement aims to ensure the quality of information meets field standards before publication. The 2004 Amendments to IDEA mandate that instruction and services must be based on peer-reviewed research. In a court case, it was found that an eclectic approach was sufficient, emphasizing that courts should not impose their views on educational methods. IDEA requires an Individualized Education Team to create a personalized education program for disabled children. The Individualized Education Program (IEP) is a crucial component of IDEA, outlining academic goals, services, and educational placement for children with disabilities. Judicial decisions focus on ensuring compliance with IDEA procedures and the IEP's effectiveness in providing educational benefits. The IEP does not need to be perfect but must be reasonably calculated to support the child's learning. In School Board of Independent School District No. 11 v. Joshua Renollett, the Eighth Circuit court of appeals found that despite some flaws in the child's IEP, it still provided educational benefits, thus not violating IDEA. Similarly, the Second Circuit in Cabouli v. Chappaqua Central School District determined that the IEP's adequacy was supported by evidence of the child's social progress, indicating no IDEA violation. The absence of a functional behavioral assessment in an IEP does not automatically invalidate it, as seen in Nack v. Orange City School. The Sixth Circuit in Nack v. Orange City School District found that procedural violations that did not cause substantive harm were not a violation of IDEA. Lack of progress in one school year does not necessarily indicate an IDEA violation, as IDEA does not guarantee success but requires sufficient specialized services for the student. Conversely, courts have ruled that an IEP must provide educational benefits to comply with IDEA, as seen in cases like A.K. v. Alexandria City School Board and M.L. v. Federal Way School District. In Federal Way School District v. Ninth Circuit, the absence of a regular education teacher on the IEP team was deemed a denial of FAPE. However, in R.B. v. Napa Valley Unified School District, IDEA did not mandate the child's current special education teacher's presence. Parental input in IEPs has limitations, as shown in Shelby S. v. Conroe Independent School District where a school could conduct an independent medical evaluation without parental consent. In a case involving Wilton-Lyndeborough Cooperative School District and New Hampshire Department of Education, the First Circuit ruled that an IEP was not deficient due to incompleteness. The court highlighted the challenge of drawing a line between valid parental input and excessive demands on the school system. Despite limited parental control over IEPs, courts have sided with parents in some cases. For instance, in County School Board of York County v. A.L., the Fourth Circuit found violations of IDEA due to lack of notice on proposed IEP changes and failure to inform parents of their due process rights. Similarly, determining a child's placement before an IEP meeting and scheduling meetings without considering parental availability were deemed violations of IDEA's procedural requirements. The denial of rescheduling an IEP meeting without considering parents' availability was found to deny the student FAPE, which includes special education and related services such as transportation, speech-language pathology, and counseling. Related services under IDEA include rehabilitation counseling, orientation and mobility services, and medical services for diagnostic and evaluation purposes. Two Supreme Court cases have addressed the provision of medical services, such as in Irving Independent School District v. Tatro where clean intermittent catheterization was deemed necessary for a child with spina bifida to benefit from special education. The Supreme Court cases of Irving Independent School District v. Tatro and Cedar Rapids Community School District v. Garret F. addressed the provision of medical services for children with disabilities to benefit from special education. Tatro established that services could be provided by a qualified person who is not a physician, while Garret F. involved a child paralyzed from the neck down who required substantial medical services. The Court rejected the school's proposed test for related services, stating that the medical services exclusion only applied to services provided by a physician or hospital. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA established risk pools for high-need children with disabilities, allowing states to reserve funds to assist LEAs. The IDEA requires that children with disabilities be educated with non-disabled children to the maximum extent appropriate, with separate schooling only when necessary. Recent court decisions have followed a two-pronged approach to determine if an IEP meets a student's needs. In Daniel R.R. v. State Board of Education, the court must assess if an IEP places a student in the least restrictive environment by considering placement in the regular classroom with supplementary services first. If not feasible, the school must mainstream the child to the maximum extent appropriate. Factors include efforts to accommodate the child, educational benefits in regular vs special education, and impact on other students. In A.G. v. Durtan, the Third Circuit examined the effect of a child with a disability on other students. In A.G. v. Durtan, the court considered the impact of a student's disability on others, including disruptive behaviors like loud vocalizations, removal of shoes and socks, clapping, teeth grinding, toileting difficulties, and inappropriate touching. The court upheld the decision that the student could not be educated full time in a regular classroom. IDEA provided grants to states for children with disabilities and outlined requirements for receiving federal funds, including the \"stay put\" provision during disputes between schools and parents. The \"stay put\" provision in IDEA allows children with disabilities to remain in their current placement during disputes. The Supreme Court case Honig v. Doe challenged this rule, involving emotionally disturbed children facing expulsion for disruptive behavior. The Court upheld the \"stay put\" provision, emphasizing Congress's intent to limit schools' unilateral authority. The Supreme Court case Honig v. Doe upheld the \"stay put\" provision in IDEA, limiting schools' authority to exclude disabled students. Educators can temporarily suspend students posing a safety threat for up to 10 days, with the option to seek judicial relief under section 1415(e)(2) known as a Honig injunction. This ruling did not resolve all concerns about discipline for children with disabilities. In 1994, Congress amended IDEA's \"stay put\" provision to allow schools to remove a child with a disability to an interim alternative setting for bringing weapons or drugs to school. The provision was expanded in 2004 to include situations where a student inflicts serious bodily injury on another person at school. Some courts have addressed whether the stay put requirement applies during a child's transition from Part C to Part B of IDEA. The Third Circuit in Pardini v. Allegheny Intermediate Unit held that the stay put provision requires the child to continue to receive conductive education until the dispute over its appropriateness for inclusion in her IEP was resolved, while the Eleventh Circuit in D.P. v. School Board of Broward County disagreed, stating that children applying for initial admission to a public school program are not entitled to continue to receive services pursuant to their IFSPs. Other issues regarding the stay put provision have involved mediation, private school placement, a move from a resource room to a classroom, and the appeals process in the courts. In Sammons v. Polk County School Board, the Eleventh Circuit ruled that the stay put provision does not apply to a request for mediation. In L.M. v. Capistrano Unified School District, the Ninth Circuit determined that a child unilaterally placed in a private school by parents cannot use the stay put provision. In E.Y. v. Elysian Charter School of Hoboken, the court held that a child's placement in a private school recommended by the IEP team was contested by the district. The court in E.Y. v. Elysian Charter School of Hoboken ruled that a child's relocation from a resource room to an inclusion classroom did not constitute a change in placement under the stay put provision. In Joshua A. v. Rocklin Unified School District, the Ninth Circuit held that the stay put provision applies throughout the appeals process. However, in N.D. v. State of Hawaii, a novel application of the stay put provision failed when the state decided to furlough teachers and shut down public schools, leading to a lawsuit alleging a violation of IDEA's stay put provision, which the Ninth Circuit found no violation of. The Ninth Circuit found no violation of the stay put provision in a case involving system-wide changes in public schools. Congressional interest in seclusion and restraints led to the passing of the \"Keeping all Students Safe Act.\" IDEA requires consideration of positive behavioral interventions for children with disabilities. The use of seclusion and restraints is not specifically addressed in IDEA. The Department allows for the use of mechanical restraints or aversive techniques for children with disabilities, as long as they are consistent with the child's IEP and positive behavioral interventions. The Supreme Court has not directly addressed the use of seclusion or restraints under IDEA, but in Honig v. Doe, it was determined that suspensions longer than ten days violated IDEA's \"stay-put\" provision. This decision does not limit educators in addressing challenging behaviors. In Honig, educators are not restricted in addressing challenging behaviors and may use various methods such as study carrels, timeouts, detention, or suspension. Despite the lack of specific language in IDEA, courts have generally not found violations when seclusion or restraint is necessary for safety or academic progress. The use of seclusion and restraint is also examined in relation to IDEA's administrative exhaustion requirements. In C.N. v. Willmar Public Schools, parents alleged improper and excessive use of seclusion and restraint procedures in their child's IEP. They withdrew their daughter from the school and requested a due process hearing. The Eighth Circuit affirmed the dismissal, stating that complaints must be filed while the child is still in the school district. IDEA has been used by parents to challenge a New York State regulation banning \"aversive interventions.\" The Second Circuit vacated the district court's injunction against a state regulation banning \"aversive interventions.\" The district court upheld the regulations, stating they are informed and rational, consistent with the purposes of the IDEA. Disability harassment may result in a denial of FAPE, and courts have held that severe harassment can deny access to educational benefits. The court has found that disability harassment can lead to a denial of educational benefits under IDEA. Claims of harassment must be tied to IDEA and show that FAPE has been denied. Retaliation claims are subject to IDEA's administrative requirements. The ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act can also lead to actions for retaliation. Safeguards under Section 615 of IDEA protect the rights of children with disabilities and their parents. Provisions under IDEA protect the rights of parents and children with disabilities regarding education. Due process procedures allow for complaints to be filed within two years of the alleged violation. Schools can also file complaints. After an administrative decision, parties can file suit in district court within 90 days. A resolution session is required before due process proceedings. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA introduced a resolution session requirement before a due process hearing, involving parents, IEP team members, and an LEA representative. Mediation provisions were added in 1997 and remain in effect. Judicial enforcement of resolution session or mediation agreements was also established. Court decisions have addressed confidentiality issues in resolution sessions. The inclusion of a school board attorney in resolution sessions was discussed, noting that attorney presence is limited only for the preliminary meeting. Procedural violations in resolution sessions may not violate FAPE if they do not substantially affect the child's educational opportunities. Courts have ruled that judicial enforcement of settlement agreements is limited to those reached through dispute resolution or mediation. In Amy S. v. Danbury, the Sixth Circuit held that mediation agreements signed by parents with counsel are binding. The court upheld mediation agreements signed by parents with counsel, rejecting claims of breach due to transportation issues. In another case, a court dismissed a parent's argument that a settlement agreement was invalid. IDEA requires due process complaints to include a description of the problem, relevant facts, and proposed resolution. In Knight v. Washington School District, a district court reviewed a hearing officer's determination on IDEA's pleading requirements. The court referenced Senate report language stating that the determination of due process complaint notice compliance should be made on the face of the complaint. The court expressed concern that state officials' dismissal of complaints based on federal law may be unreviewable in federal court. The Eighth Circuit affirmed the dismissal without prejudice. Several courts have ruled that an LEA cannot sue an SEA for IDEA non-compliance. In cases such as Traverse Bay Area Intermediate School District v. Michigan Department of Education and Lake Washington School District No. 414 v. Washington State Office of Administrative Hearings, courts have ruled that Local Education Agencies (LEAs) do not have a private right of action under IDEA to challenge state agencies' noncompliance with procedural safeguards. The Ninth Circuit emphasized that complaints under IDEA are limited to matters concerning the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of a child. Additionally, in Winkelman v. Parma City School District, the Supreme Court examined whether non-attorney parents can bring suit under IDEA. The Supreme Court examined whether non-attorney parents can bring suit under IDEA, concluding that pro se suits are permitted for parents suing for their own rights. Justice Kennedy stated that IDEA grants parents independent, enforceable rights for a child's education, not limited to procedural issues. The Court emphasized the Act's purpose to protect the rights of children with disabilities and their parents. The Supreme Court found that IDEA grants both parents and children with disabilities rights, including procedural rights to protect their interests. These rights encompass both procedural and substantive aspects, with no differentiation between the rights of children and parents. Granting these rights may lead to increased lawsuits by parents, potentially raising costs for states. The Supreme Court emphasized that IDEA grants rights to both parents and children with disabilities, including procedural rights. Parents can bring lawsuits without financial constraints, but the Court ruled that this does not support a claim under the Constitution's Spending Clause. Justice Kennedy noted that IDEA allows courts to award attorneys' fees to educational agencies if a parent's action is deemed improper. Non-attorney parents can assert their own claims, and a parent has personal rights to enforce FAPE, surviving a dismissal attempt. In Woodruff v. Hamilton Township Public Schools, the Third Circuit found that parents cannot use their rights to circumvent existing consent decrees. Parental rights, as determined by Winkelman, have been extended to cases under Section 504, ADA, and IDEA, but not all courts agree with this interpretation. In D.A. and M.A. v. Pleasantville School District, the court found that Winkelman reflects IDEA's emphasis on parental involvement. The Winkelman decision emphasized parental involvement in IDEA, but its specific language and structure were not applicable to Section 504 and the ADA. Courts have addressed issues such as parental rights in recovering damages under IDEA and the rights of noncustodial parents in educational decisions. IDEA defines the term \"parent,\" with regulations stating that a parent is presumed to be the parent unless lacking legal authority. The Fuentes court emphasized that the noncustodial biological parent lacks legal authority to make educational decisions for the child. IDEA, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and the ADA address the education rights of individuals with disabilities, with each statute playing a significant role in providing programs for children with disabilities. The ADA and Section 504 are civil rights statutes that protect individuals with disabilities from discrimination. While Section 504 applies to entities receiving federal funds, the ADA has broader coverage. The interaction of these statutes with IDEA in educational settings has been subject to court scrutiny, with differences in coverage noted. IDEA ensures the provision of FAPE through detailed due process requirements. The IDEA ensures detailed due process requirements for FAPE provision, including impartial hearings. The burden of proof in a due process hearing was clarified in the 2005 case of Schaffer v. Weast, where the party seeking relief carries the burden of proof. Justice O'Connor examined reasons for placing the burden of proof on the school system, ultimately rejecting them. The Supreme Court found that the burden of proof should not be on a party when facts are within the knowledge of the adversary. Despite schools having an advantage in information, Congress mandated schools to safeguard parents' rights and share information. The IDEA grants parents rights such as reviewing records, independent evaluations, disclosure of options considered by the school, and attorneys' fees if they prevail. Issues regarding services for children with disabilities in private schools under IDEA have been a source of ongoing controversy. Current law allows for a child with a disability to be placed in a private school by the local or state educational agency, with the full cost covered by the agency. Alternatively, parents can unilaterally place their child in a private school, but the cost is not covered by the agency unless certain findings are made by a hearing officer or court. IDEA requires services for children in private schools, even if parents unilaterally place them there. Reimbursement may be required if the agency did not provide a free appropriate public education in a timely manner. The current statutory provisions on private schools stem from major amendments and Supreme Court decisions. Two recent Supreme Court cases have addressed whether IDEA allows for tuition reimbursement for parents who placed their child in a private school without receiving special education from the public school. In the 2007 decision Board of Education of the City School District of the City of New York v. Tom F., the Court allowed an appeals court ruling on private school reimbursement to stand, stating that parents of a child with a disability are entitled to reimbursement even if the student never received special education services from the school district. The Supreme Court held in Forest Grove School District v. T.A. that IDEA allows reimbursement for private special-education services when a public school fails to provide a FAPE. Recent lower court decisions have found that if a child is making educational progress with an IEP from the public school, they are not entitled to a private school placement. In M.H. and J.H. v. Monroe-Woodbury Central School District, the court ruled that parents are not entitled to tuition reimbursement for a private school placement if the child's IEP is deemed adequate. Reimbursement for private school tuition may be denied if the private school does not adequately address the child's educational needs, even if it has a high percentage of children with disabilities. Parents must notify the LEA of any issues before arranging for private school educational services to avoid being barred from reimbursement. If a school district fails to provide a child with a disability a Free Appropriate Public Education (FAPE), the child may be eligible for private school reimbursement or compensatory education. Compensatory education aims to make up for past inadequate services and is based on a Supreme Court ruling from 1985. Parents can seek reimbursement for private school tuition if their child has not previously received special education services. In Burlington v. Department of Education, parents can seek reimbursement for private school tuition if the public school program violates FAPE. Courts differ on how compensatory education should be awarded, with some favoring a day for day approach and others emphasizing the student's need for appropriate education under IDEA. Children receiving compensatory education may require additional services beyond a general IEP to compensate for the denial of appropriate education. Section 1983 allows suits against state officials for rights violations, but courts differ on whether IDEA procedural remedies must be exhausted before filing a \u00a71983 action. The application of \u00a71983 for damages in IDEA cases is unclear, with some courts allowing damages while others do not. The original IDEA version did not include attorneys' fees provision, so prevailing parties used other statutes for fee recovery. The Supreme Court in Smith v. Robinson held that prevailing parties under IDEA could only seek remedies within that statute, not through other laws like section 505 of the Rehabilitation Act or section 1988 of the Civil Rights Attorneys' Fees Award Act. Congress later enacted the Handicapped Children's Protection Act in 1986 to allow for attorneys' fees under IDEA, which were amended in 1997. The amendments in P.L. 105-17 also allowed for the reduction of attorneys' fees under certain conditions. The 2004 IDEA reauthorization, P.L. 108-446, included provisions for attorneys' fees in special education disputes, allowing fees for the state or local educational agency against parents or their attorneys in certain situations. The ADA permits courts to award attorneys' fees to prevailing parties, as seen in the Buckhannon Board and Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Department of Human Resources case addressing the \"catalyst theory\" for fee awards. The Court rejected the theory of awarding attorneys' fees based on voluntary changes in conduct, stating fees are only available with a judicially sanctioned change in the legal relationship. Attorneys' fees provision in IDEA has been consistently applied, with fees awarded to prevailing parties in administrative and judicial proceedings. Fees have been given even without a finding of denial of FAPE, but not awarded when a child's disability under IDEA has not been determined. To be eligible for attorneys' fees under IDEA, courts require judicial approval for settlement agreements. Fees are not awarded for voluntary settlements or representation by consultants. In Drennan v. Pulaski County Special School District, fees were not granted when certain court-ordered duties were not fulfilled. Attorneys' fees may be awarded to relatives other than parents. Courts have discretion in awarding attorneys' fees to prevailing parties, which may be less than the full amount requested. Refusal to attend a meeting for a proposed settlement does not necessarily result in a reduced award. A fee cap was imposed on IDEA cases in FY1999 in the District of Columbia. The 2004 IDEA reauthorization allows courts to award attorneys' fees to prevailing parties in cases where a parent's complaint is found to be frivolous or without foundation. In El Paso Independent School District v. Berry, the Fifth Circuit upheld the award of attorneys' fees to a school district against a lawyer who refused to accept offered relief and used stonewalling tactics. The Sixth Circuit found that the fee-shifting provision did not apply to private schools, and winning in court does not make parents' actions frivolous. The Ninth Circuit highlighted the importance of not discouraging lawyers from taking on potentially meritorious IDEA cases. Several cases have examined whether the LEA was the prevailing party, with the Fifth Circuit ruling that a school district did not prevail on educational issues in a specific case. The school district was not entitled to attorneys' fees as they did not prevail on the educational issues. In a similar case, the D.C. Court of Appeals also refused to award fees to the school district for not being a prevailing party. The court highlighted the risk of allowing districts to ignore legal obligations until sued, comply, and then seek attorney's fees. Some lower courts have interpreted the IDEA's language on attorneys' fees to potentially allow for expert witness fees for prevailing parents. The Supreme Court, in a decision written by Justice Alito, held that IDEA does not authorize prevailing parents to recover fees they have paid to experts. The majority opinion observed that the language on costs in IDEA does not encompass the payment of expert witness fees. The Supreme Court ruled that IDEA does not allow parents to recover fees paid to experts. Legislation was introduced to amend IDEA to include expert witness fees in attorney's fees. IDEA has two dispute resolution methods: due process procedures and state complaint resolution. The Department of Education monitors IDEA implementation, including due process procedures and state complaint resolution. Court decisions have addressed systemic complaints under IDEA. Congress established protection and advocacy systems to protect individuals with developmental disabilities. Many court cases filed by P & A's are class action lawsuits for systemic violations of rights. Special education students have been involved in systemic violations of rights, often related to P & A's access to student records."
