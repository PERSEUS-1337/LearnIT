Congress finds that commercial motor vehicle crashes are a major concern in the United States, especially with the increasing number of trucks and their role in transporting hazardous materials. A 2004 report showed that crashes involving large trucks are 2.6 times more likely to result in fatalities compared to passenger cars. In 2005, 5,212 individuals died and 114,000 were injured in large truck-related crashes in the US. From 2001 to 2005, there were 25,533 large truck-related fatalities in the United States, costing society $230.6 billion annually. Each crash involving a truck over 10,000 pounds has an estimated cost of $91,112, with fatal crashes averaging $3,604,518. Investments in advanced safety systems by vehicle suppliers and manufacturers aim to improve road safety. The Department of Transportation aims to reduce traffic fatalities by implementing advanced safety technologies on commercial motor vehicles to mitigate crash effects and societal costs. Accelerated deployment of these technologies can help achieve the goal of reducing the fatality rate to 1.0 per hundred million vehicle miles traveled by 2011. Congress supports increasing the deployment of advanced safety technologies to improve road safety and reduce injuries and fatalities. The United States aims to increase the deployment of advanced vehicle safety technologies on commercial motor vehicles through tax incentives to make these systems more affordable for businesses. The United States is offering tax credits to encourage the use of advanced safety systems on commercial vehicles. The United States offers a tax credit of 50% of the cost of qualified commercial vehicle advanced safety systems placed in service, up to $1,500 per system and $3,500 per vehicle. The credit is limited per taxpayer. The tax credit for qualified commercial vehicle advanced safety systems is limited to $350,000 per taxpayer. A qualified system includes brake stroke monitoring, lane departure warning, collision warning, or vehicle stability systems identified by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The tax credit for qualified commercial vehicle advanced safety systems is limited to $350,000 per taxpayer. The system must be certified by the manufacturer for the specific vehicle and function properly when installed. If not installed by the manufacturer, the installer must certify its appropriateness and functionality. The tax credit for qualified commercial vehicle advanced safety systems is limited to $350,000 per taxpayer. The system must be certified by the installer and functioning properly on the vehicle before use. Original use must begin with the taxpayer, and depreciation is allowable.

The tax credit for qualified commercial vehicle advanced safety systems is limited to $350,000 per taxpayer. A qualified commercial vehicle is defined as a highway motor vehicle with specific weight ratings and seating capacities for school or intercity/local bus use. Brake stroke monitoring system is defined as an onboard monitoring system for air-braked vehicles. The curr_chunk discusses the definitions of different safety systems for vehicles, including brake monitoring, lane departure warning, and collision warning systems. These systems use electronic sensors to alert drivers of potential issues and risks on the road. The curr_chunk explains the definition of a vehicle stability system, which intervenes in high-risk situations by automatically adjusting vehicle speed or applying brakes. Additionally, it discusses how controlled groups are treated as a single taxpayer for tax purposes. The curr_chunk provides special rules for the application of tax credits, including basis reduction and recapture of credits. It specifies that no credit is allowed for property used outside the United States. The curr_chunk outlines special rules for tax credits related to qualified commercial vehicles with advanced safety systems, specifying that the seller must disclose any allowable credit to the buyer. The curr_chunk explains that no credit will be allowed for a qualified commercial vehicle advanced safety system if the taxpayer chooses not to apply this section to the system. Additionally, supporting documentation is required for the credit to be allowed. The curr_chunk outlines the requirements for installing a qualified commercial vehicle advanced safety system, including specifying the system type, purchase or installation date, and necessary certifications. The section terminates for property placed in service after December 31, 2012. The curr_chunk amends the general business credit section of the tax code to include the commercial vehicle advanced safety system credit. Conforming amendments are also made to other sections of the tax code. The curr_chunk amends the tax code by inserting a new item after section 45N in subpart D of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1. The curr_chunk introduces a new credit for commercial vehicle advanced safety systems, with the amendments applying to property placed in service after the enactment of the Act."
