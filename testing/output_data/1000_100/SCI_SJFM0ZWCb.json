The proposed Deep Temporal Clustering (DTC) algorithm integrates dimensionality reduction and temporal clustering in an unsupervised manner. It utilizes an autoencoder for dimensionality reduction and a novel temporal clustering layer for cluster assignment. The algorithm optimizes both clustering and dimensionality reduction objectives, with customizable temporal similarity metrics. A visualization method is used to analyze learned features, demonstrated on timeseries data from various domains. The Deep Temporal Clustering (DTC) algorithm integrates dimensionality reduction and temporal clustering in unsupervised learning. It outperforms traditional methods in diverse domains, showing improved performance due to integrated temporal dimensionality reduction and clustering criterion. Deep learning is dominant in supervised learning, but unsupervised techniques are crucial for learning complex structures in unlabeled data. Standard unsupervised techniques include clustering approaches that organize similar objects into clusters. The problem of unsupervised time series clustering is challenging due to variations in properties, temporal scales, and dimensionality. Real-world time series data often have temporal gaps and high frequency noise. Standard clustering techniques struggle with time series data, leaving a gap in technology for accurate unsupervised learning in areas like financial trading and medical monitoring. The novel algorithm deep temporal clustering (DTC) addresses limitations of standard clustering techniques on time series data by transforming it into a low dimensional latent space using a deep autoencoder network. The DTC algorithm disentangles data manifolds by uncovering latent dimensions for temporal or spatio-temporal data classification. The DTC algorithm, consisting of a CNN and BI-LSTM, reduces data dimensionality and uncovers temporal connections between waveforms. It performs non-parametric clustering to split data into classes based on spatio-temporal dimensions. This approach achieves high performance on various datasets without parameter adjustment and includes a unique visualization feature for cluster-assignment activations over time. The study introduces a novel deep learning algorithm for temporal clustering, focusing on meaningful feature extraction and similarity metrics. The end-to-end optimization of the network shows superior performance compared to separate optimization of objectives. The DTC algorithm, combining CNN and BI-LSTM, effectively clusters data based on spatio-temporal dimensions without the need for parameter adjustments. The study introduces a novel deep learning algorithm, DTC, for temporal clustering, outperforming existing methods. Existing research focuses on dimensionality reduction and similarity metrics, with drawbacks in independent reduction and loss of long-range correlations. The limitations of current solutions for time series clustering include the need for domain knowledge in designing transformations and the importance of choosing a suitable similarity measure. Proper dimensionality reduction is also crucial for optimal clustering results. Recent research has shown that casting time series data into a low dimensional latent space is effective for temporal clustering. However, there is a lack of general methodology for selecting an appropriate latent space. To achieve meaningful clustering results, it is important to ensure that the similarity metric is compatible with the temporal feature space. Current clustering methods for static data do not perform well for time series data clustering. The goal is to perform unsupervised clustering of temporal sequences into clusters based on high-level features. The proposed method involves clustering unlabeled sequences into clusters based on high-level features. A temporal autoencoder is used to encode the input signal into a latent space, followed by a BI-LSTM for clustering. The network architecture includes a 1D convolution layer for extracting short-term features and a max pooling layer. Effective latent representation is crucial for temporal clustering. The proposed method involves clustering unlabeled sequences based on high-level features using a temporal autoencoder and BI-LSTM. Leaky ReLUs are used for dimensionality reduction, followed by BI-LSTM for learning temporal changes. The clustering layer assigns sequences to clusters based on BI-LSTM latent representation. Learning is driven by minimizing two cost functions, including mean square error for input sequence reconstruction. The proposed method involves clustering unlabeled sequences based on high-level features using a temporal autoencoder and BI-LSTM. Reconstruction of the input sequence is ensured through upsampling and deconvolutional layers. The clustering metric optimizes the separation of sequences into distinct clusters with different spatio-temporal behaviors. The optimization modifies weights in the BI-LSTM and CNN to disentangle the spatio-temporal manifolds of the dynamics. The end-to-end optimization of the network efficiently extracts spatio-temporal features for unsupervised categorization, improving separation compared to traditional approaches that use disjoint optimization for dimensionality reduction and clustering. Our approach emphasizes end-to-end optimization to extract informative features from spatio-temporal data using BI-LSTM. The temporal clustering layer initializes centroids using latent signals and performs hierarchical clustering to obtain cluster estimates. The temporal clustering layer initializes centroids using latent signals and performs hierarchical clustering to obtain cluster estimates. Initial centroids estimates are obtained by averaging elements in each cluster, followed by training using an unsupervised algorithm that alternates between computing assignment probabilities and updating centroids based on a loss function. Distance from centroids is computed using a similarity metric and normalized into probability assignments using a Student's t distribution kernel. The probability assignment of latent signal belonging to k th cluster is determined by q ij, z i, and parameter \u03b1. siml() is the temporal similarity metric used to compute distances between encoded signals and centroids. Various similarity metrics are experimented with, including Complexity Invariant Similarity (CID) proposed by BID2. The Complexity Invariant Similarity (CID) proposed by BID2 computes similarity based on euclidean distance corrected by complexity estimation of two series x, y. The distance is calculated using a complexity factor and the core idea is that distance increases with complexity differences. Correlation based Similarity (COR) used by BID8 computes similarities using pearsons correlation between latent representation z i and centroids w j. The study computes the COR using pearson's correlation between latent representation z i and centroids w j. Auto Correlation based Similarity (ACF) computes similarity using autocorrelation coefficients and weighted euclidean distance. Training the temporal clustering layer involves minimizing KL divergence loss between q ij and target distribution p ij. Choice of p is crucial to strengthen high confidence predictions and normalize losses. The study discusses the computation of KL divergence loss using a target distribution, followed by joint optimization of clustering and autoencoder. Effective initialization of cluster centroids is emphasized, with pretraining of autoencoder parameters and hierarchical clustering for centroid initialization. Autoencoder weights and cluster centers are then updated accordingly. The study focuses on updating autoencoder weights and cluster centers using gradients, preventing problematic solutions from drifting too far from the original input signal. The latent representation converges to minimize clustering and MSE loss, with a heatmap-generating network used to localize main data features for classification. The study utilizes a DTC network to classify medical images with cluster labels, generating heatmaps to show relevant parts of inputs. Implementation was done using Python, TensorFlow, and Keras on Nvidia GTX 1080Ti. Heatmap values correspond to event localization, with low amplitudes for non-events. The DTC algorithm performance is evaluated on various real-world datasets, including UCR Time series Classification Archive datasets and spacecraft magnetometer data from NASA's MMS Mission for automated detection of flux transfer events (FTEs). The DTC algorithm is evaluated on real-world datasets, including spacecraft magnetometer data from NASA's MMS Mission. The B N component of the magnetic field is analyzed using clustering methods and similarity metrics, with expert labels used for model performance evaluation. The training pipeline is unsupervised, with Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) and area under the curve used for assessment. The evaluation of the DTC algorithm involves using Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) and area under the curve (AUC) as metrics. Bootstrap sampling and averaging ROC curves over 5 trials are employed. Parameter optimization through cross-validation is not feasible in unsupervised clustering. Commonly used parameters for DTC are utilized, with the convolution layer having 50 filters and the pooling size chosen to keep the latent representation size < 100 for faster experimentation. The autoencoder network is pre-trained using the Adam optimizer over 10 epochs. Temporal clustering layer centroids are initialized hierarchically. The deep architecture is trained for clustering and autoencoder loss until convergence criterion is met. Mini-batch size is 64 with a learning rate of 0.1. Results of DTC on MMS dataset show activation map profiles correlating with event locations. The paper discusses the joint training of two objectives, reconstruction loss, and clustering loss, which leads to superior performance compared to disjointed training. Direct comparison on the MMS dataset shows an average AUC of 0.93 for joint training vs. 0.88 for disjointed training. The study compares the performance of DTC algorithm with baseline clustering techniques across various datasets and similarity metrics, showing DTC outperforms in all datasets. Results from ROC analysis also demonstrate the robustness and superior performance of DTC in unsupervised learning of temporal sequences and event clustering. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of DTC algorithm in unsupervised event detection and clustering of temporal sequences. The unsupervised clustering results show high agreement with human-labeled categories, indicating successful dimensionality reduction. The approach shows promise for real-world applications, especially with time-continuous and unlabeled natural stimuli. The generalization to multichannel spatio-temporal input is also straightforward and has been explored in a separate paper."
