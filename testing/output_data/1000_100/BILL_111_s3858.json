    "content": "The \"H-2A Improvement Act\" allows nonimmigrant status for dairy workers, sheepherders, and goat herders coming temporarily to the United States to perform agricultural labor. Special rules are established for aliens employed in these roles. Section 218 of the Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to include special rules for aliens employed as dairy workers, sheepherders, or goat herders, allowing for initial admission for 3 years with the possibility of extension for an additional 3 years. Employers hiring H-2A workers as dairy workers, sheepherders, or goat herders are exempt from showing that the positions are temporary or seasonal. Eligible aliens in these positions can apply for lawful permanent resident status after maintaining H-2A worker status in the US for at least 33 of the previous 36 months. Eligible aliens can seek immigrant visas under section 203(b)(3)(A)(iii) without labor certification. Employers or eligible aliens can file a classification petition under section 204. An application for adjustment of status based on a petition described in subparagraph (B) shall not be a basis for denying various requests related to H-2A workers, including petitions to employ H-2A workers, extensions of nonimmigrant status, admissions of H-2A workers, visa requests, requests to modify immigration status, or requests for H-2A workers to extend their stay in the United States. The Secretary of Homeland Security can extend the stay of an eligible alien with a pending or approved petition in 1-year increments until a final determination is made on their eligibility for adjustment of status to that of a lawful permanent resident. Nothing in this provision can prevent an eligible alien from seeking adjustment of status under any other law."
