The \"Medical Research Investment Act of 2000\" raises the limit on charitable deductions for medical research contributions to 80 percent of the taxpayer's contribution base for any taxable year. The taxable year allows charitable contributions exceeding the limitation to be carried over for 10 succeeding years as medical research contributions. The curr_chunk discusses the definition of a \"medical research contribution\" for capital gain property in charitable contributions. It specifies that such contributions must be designated for conducting medical research to qualify. The curr_chunk amends the Internal Revenue Code to define \"medical research contribution\" and make conforming amendments to related sections. The curr_chunk amends section 170 of the Internal Revenue Code to include medical research contributions for deductions. The effective date applies to contributions made after December 31, 2000, and to contributions made before that date if a deduction would be allowed for taxable years after December 31, 1999. The curr_chunk adds section 170(b)(1)(G) to the Internal Revenue Code for medical research contributions made after December 31, 1999. SEC. 3. Treatment of certain incentive stock options. Treatment of incentive stock options under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include an exception for certain medical research stock transfers. The term 'medical research stock transfer' refers to the transfer of stock traded on an established securities market or acquired through the exercise of an incentive stock option in the same taxable year, and which is a medical research contribution as defined in section 170(b)(1)(G)(iv). The amendment allows for the nonrecognition of certain incentive stock options related to medical research contributions. The transfer of medical research stock is treated as meeting specific requirements. The effective date applies to transfers made after the enactment of the Act."
