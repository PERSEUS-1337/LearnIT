    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Military Readiness and Southern Sea Otter Conservation Act\" and pertains to the Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness and Conservation Act. The Congress finds that the United States Fish and Wildlife Service has developed a relocation and management plan for southern sea otters as authorized by Public Law 99-625. National defense-related activities at San Nicolas Island have not adversely affected sea otters, but further expansion into the designated management zone may pose national security risks. The Sikes Act Compliant Integrated Natural Resources Management Plans for military installations in California address the special management needs of threatened and endangered species, providing conservation benefits to marine environments. Public Law 99-625 authorized the designation of otters at San Nicolas Island as a nonessential experimental population under the Endangered Species Act and Marine Mammal Protection Act for flexibility. The designation should continue to allow for military readiness requirements under Public Law 99-625. The purpose is to conserve the southern sea otter while ensuring military activities can continue. The Secretary of Defense will establish Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas for national defense. The Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas are designated for national defense purposes, including Naval Base Ventura County San Nicolas Island, Begg Rock, Naval Base Coronado San Clemente Island, and adjacent waters within specific coordinates. This is to ensure military activities can continue while conserving the southern sea otter population. The Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas include specific coordinates within Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton and adjacent waters. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 does not apply to the incidental taking of southern sea otters in these areas during military readiness activities. The Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas exempt incidental takings of southern sea otters during military activities. Otters in these areas are treated as proposed endangered species for Endangered Species Act compliance. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 allows for the exemption of southern sea otters in the Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas from removal. The Secretary of the Interior can revise or terminate exceptions if military activities impede otter conservation. The Secretary of the Navy is responsible for monitoring these areas. The Secretary of the Navy is required to monitor the Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas every three years to track the otter population growth or decline. Reports must be submitted to Congress and the public every 24 months. The section does not override any other federal laws, and an ecosystem management plan must be developed in accordance with existing regulations. The Director of the National Marine Fisheries Service, in collaboration with the Marine Mammal Commission, will develop an ecosystem management plan for waters off California to ensure the recovery of the southern sea otter, black abalone, and white abalone. The plan also aims to maintain shellfish fisheries at current harvest levels. The US Fish and Wildlife Service will assess the habitat's carrying capacity for southern sea otters within one year, including the impact of water quality and degradation causes. The Director of the US Fish and Wildlife Service will continue implementing the relocation and management plan for southern sea otters until completion of the required management plan and assessment. Definitions for incidental taking and optimum sustainable population are provided in this section. The term 'southern sea otter' refers to a subspecies of Enhydra lutris nereis. 'Take' is defined in relation to regulations under the Endangered Species Act and the Marine Mammal Protection Act. The term 'military readiness activity' is defined in section 315(f) of the Bob Stump National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003 as all training and operations related to combat, testing of military equipment for combat use. Establishment of the Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas."
