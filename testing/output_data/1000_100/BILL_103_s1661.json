    "content": "The \"Worker Protection Warnings Act of 1993\" is referenced in the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. The Congress finds that the absence of uniform warnings for personal protective equipment for occupational use increases worker exposure to workplace injuries and illnesses. The lack of Federal standards for these warnings leads to confusion among employers and employees, as well as inconsistencies in State requirements, placing a burden on interstate commerce. The purpose of this Act is to enhance workplace safety by clarifying the proper use of personal protective equipment through uniform warnings. It also aims to preempt any state standards that may conflict with these uniform warnings. The Secretary, in consultation with the Director of the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, will issue regulations for uniform warnings on personal protective equipment for occupational use within 12 months of enactment. Personal protective equipment includes gear for eyes, face, head, hearing, extremities, or respiratory tract protection in the workplace. The regulations will prescribe warnings for personal protective equipment to prevent personal injury or death to users. Employers must communicate these warnings to employees using the equipment. The regulations require employers to provide warnings to employees using personal protective equipment, educating them on proper use, workplace application, and consequences of non-compliance. The standards will be effective six months after publication in the Federal Register, with exemptions for equipment already in interstate commerce if warnings are communicated to the employer. The regulations mandate employers to communicate warnings to employees regarding the proper use of personal protective equipment. The Secretary will consider various factors when promulgating standards, including manufacturer experience and the effectiveness of warnings. SEC. 6. PREEMPTION. Section 4 is amended to clarify that Congress intends to regulate warnings for personal protective equipment for occupational use. Section 18 prohibits states from establishing standards for personal protective equipment that differ from federal occupational safety and health standards. The Secretary cannot approve a state plan that includes requirements different from federal occupational safety and health standards."
