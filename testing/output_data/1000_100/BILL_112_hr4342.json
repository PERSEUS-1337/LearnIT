    "content": "The Act titled \"Waterways Are Vital for the Economy, Energy, Efficiency, and Environment Act of 2012\" or the \"WAVE4 Act\" emphasizes the importance of the inland waterways navigation system for the nation's economy, energy reliability, efficiency in transportation of bulk commodities, and environmental protection. The \"WAVE4 Act\" aims to improve program and project management for navigation projects on inland waterways, optimize system reliability, minimize project completion schedules, eliminate delays, and prioritize investments for maximum benefits and reduced risk. The \"WAVE4 Act\" defines \"qualifying project\" as a construction or major rehabilitation project for navigation infrastructure on inland waterways funded from the Inland Waterways Trust Fund. It also defines \"major rehabilitation project\" as a restoration project with a cost exceeding $100,000,000. The Secretary of the Army, through the Chief of Engineers, mandates formal project management training and certification for project managers of qualifying projects. Personnel must be fully certified by the Chief of Engineers to be assigned as project managers. Cost estimation for qualifying projects must be risk-based with a confidence level of at least 80 percent. Projects with estimated total costs exceeding $45,000,000 and public safety concerns require independent external peer review and submission to Congress or the Secretary. The Chief of Engineers determines projects subject to public safety concerns, high complexity, or interagency interest. Governor-requested reviews are also included. Inland Waterways Users Board members may be appointed to project teams, and project status must be communicated quarterly to the Board. The Board is updated on qualifying projects under construction, with the Chairman and project development team appointee as signatories of the project management plan. Lessons learned from prior projects are applied for better project completion. Evaluation of early contractor involvement procedures is conducted to improve project delivery performance. Additional measures may be implemented as deemed necessary by the Secretary. The Secretary may implement practices from military construction management, establish design centers, use standard designs for locks, utilize full-funding contracts, and recommend new project starts with a capital projects business model. SEC. 6. 20-YEAR CAPITAL INVESTMENT PROGRAM. The Secretary of the Army, in collaboration with the Inland Waterways Users Board, must submit a 20-year program for capital investments on inland waterways to Congress within one year of this Act's enactment. The program will be based on national project-selection criteria and may reference the Inland Marine Transportation System Capital Projects Business Model. Additionally, an annual review and update of the program will be conducted. The Army, in collaboration with the Inland Waterways Users Board, must submit an updated 20-year program to Congress, including any changes to project-specific recommendations and national project-selection criteria. Additionally, a strategic review and update of the capital investment program for the Inland Marine Transportation System must be submitted to Congress every 5 years. SEC. 7. COST SHARING FOR QUALIFYING PROJECTS. One-half of the cost of construction of a qualifying project shall be paid from the general fund of the Treasury, and the other half from the Inland Waterways Trust Fund. For dams, the cost shall be paid only from the general fund. SEC. 8. LIMITATION ON EXPENDITURES FROM THE INLAND WATERWAYS TRUST FUND. Section 9506 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to limit expenditures from the Inland Waterways Trust Fund for construction or rehabilitation of dams and any rehabilitation expenditure below $100,000,000. The Inland Waterways Trust Fund can only be used to pay for the cost of constructing a Federal project up to the total authorized cost specified in the relevant legislation, adjusted for inflation and any additional amount agreed upon by the Secretary and the Inland Waterways Users Board. The Inland Waterways Trust Fund financing rate is amended to 26 cents per gallon after 2012."
