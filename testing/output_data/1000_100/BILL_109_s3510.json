The National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 is amended to authorize Partnerships for Access to Laboratory Sciences (PALS) under section 10A. The National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 authorizes grants to high-need local educational agencies for partnerships to improve laboratory access and quality of STEM instruction at the secondary school level through competitive, merit-based awards. Eligible agencies must form partnerships to receive grants. The National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 authorizes grants for partnerships between educational agencies, businesses, and organizations to improve STEM instruction. The Federal share of the cost should not exceed 33 percent, and grants are eligible for a duration of 3 fiscal years. A plan is required for grant eligibility. To be eligible for a grant under the National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002, a high-need local educational agency must submit a plan for improving STEM instruction, developed in consultation with various experts. The plan should align with State academic standards and be part of a comprehensive program to enhance mathematics, science, engineering, and technology education. The plan for improving STEM instruction must include details on laboratory experiences designed for clear learning outcomes, integration with classroom science instruction, student reflection, and teacher training. Safety requirements must also be met as per State or local regulations. The grant recipient must describe how the laboratory and instrumentation will be maintained after the grant period, and how assessment methods will be used to expand research literature on the impact of laboratory science on student understanding and achievement. Grants should supplement existing programs, involve all partners, and improve secondary education. The partners aim to enhance secondary science education by improving laboratories and providing instrumentation in line with State academic standards. This includes developing a plan for improvement, acquiring equipment, and materials. The funding will support scientific educational materials, maintenance of laboratory facilities, teacher training, curriculum development, laboratory safety training, and hands-on experiences to engage individuals in science and engineering. The Science and Engineering Equal Opportunities Act funds activities in mathematics, science, engineering, and technology to prepare individuals for postsecondary studies in these fields. Grants awarded under this section cannot be used for construction of new facilities. High-need local educational agencies must submit an application to seek a grant under this section. Applicants seeking a grant must submit an application to the Director with specific details including partnership descriptions, implementation roles, activity plans aligned with academic standards, and promotion of student achievement. The grant application must include details on activities promoting student achievement in mathematics and science based on research, expected to enhance student performance and strengthen instruction quality, and encourage interest in underrepresented groups. The grant application must include details on activities promoting student achievement in mathematics, science, engineering, and technology, assessing changes in student achievement, evaluating partnership success, and making programmatic assessments available to the research community. The grant application must detail the partnership's ability to effectively carry out proposed programs based on research and best practices, aligned with state academic standards, likely to be widely implemented for reform, and encouraging interest in individuals identified in specific sections of the Science and Engineering Equal Act. The Science and Engineering Equal Opportunities Act aims to support individuals in mathematics, science, engineering, and technology for postsecondary studies. The Director will assess the program using benchmarks to identify best practices and materials developed by partnerships. The Science and Engineering Equal Opportunities Act requires the Director to evaluate partnerships funded by State or Federal agencies and disseminate the results to relevant committees. Materials developed under the program will be made widely available to the public. The Director provides technical assistance to high-need local educational agencies for grant applications and activities. An annual meeting is convened to promote collaboration among grant recipients. The Director provides technical assistance to local educational agencies for grant applications and activities. An annual report is submitted to congressional committees to describe coordination with the Elementary and Secondary Education Act program. Definitions are provided in this section. The President's annual budget request includes definitions for \"high-need local educational agency\" and \"National Laboratory\" as per the Energy Policy Act of 2005."
