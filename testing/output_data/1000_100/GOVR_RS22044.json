    "content": "The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) provides federal funding to states for education of children with disabilities, requiring states to offer a free, appropriate public education (FAPE) to all such children. Prior to P.L. 105-17 in 1997, states had to ensure participation of disabled children in private schools, with benefits comparable to those in public schools. The IDEA Amendments of 1997 rejected the \"equitable participation\" standard and aimed to equalize services for children with disabilities in public and private schools. The Supreme Court vacated and remanded cases related to this issue when Congress rewrote the law in 1997. The IDEA Amendments of 1997 aimed to provide equal services for children with disabilities in public and private schools, rejecting the \"equitable participation\" standard. Provision was made for children in private schools to receive special education and related services funded by federal funds under Part B of IDEA. The 2004 reauthorization made further changes to these provisions, including the requirement for \"child find\" to identify children with disabilities in private schools. The 2004 reauthorization clarified responsibilities of LEAs to ensure fair services for children with disabilities in private schools. Changes reflected current policies from IDEA regulations and the No Child Left Behind Act. The bill aimed to resolve issues regarding children with disabilities placed in private schools, fulfilling the FAPE requirement. Children with disabilities can be unilaterally placed in private schools by their parents, with the cost not covered by the LEA unless certain findings are made. However, IDEA mandates some services for these children. The 2004 reauthorization made changes for children placed in private schools by parents, while provisions for those placed by public agencies remained unchanged. Children in private schools are entitled to special education services consistent with the number and location of such children in the district served by a LEA. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA made changes for children placed in private schools by parents, with specific requirements regarding their location in the school district served by a LEA. This change aimed to protect LEAs from working with private schools in multiple jurisdictions, but has sparked controversy. The issues raised regarding children parentally placed in private schools include the disproportional effect on LEAs with large concentrations of private schools, lack of change in funding formula, and potential conflicts with state laws. The 2004 reauthorization added a provision emphasizing direct services to such children over indirect services. The new provision requires LEAs to conduct a child find process to determine children with disabilities in private schools. Services can be provided on the premises of religious schools. State and local funds can supplement but not supplant federal funds. Each LEA must maintain. The new provision requires LEAs to conduct a child find process to determine children with disabilities in private schools, ensuring equitable participation. Records must be maintained and provided to the SEA, with federal funds serving their intended purpose. New provisions include equitable participation, activities, cost, and completion period. The child find process for parentally placed private school children with disabilities must be completed in a timely manner, with LEAs consulting with private school officials and parents to ensure equitable participation and determine federal funding proportions. The consultation process among LEAs, private school officials, and parents of parentally placed private school children with disabilities includes determining how special education and related services will be provided, apportioning services if funds are limited, and providing written explanations if services are not provided. The new law requires written affirmation of consultation signed by private school representatives. If representatives do not sign, LEA forwards documentation to SEA. Private school officials can submit complaints to SEA if consultation was not meaningful or timely. Compliance procedures added by P.L. 108-446. The 2004 reauthorization requires equitable services to be provided by public agency employees or through contract, with services being secular, neutral, and nonideological. Funds for private school pupils are controlled by a public agency. If dissatisfied with SEA's determination, private school officials can complain to the Secretary of Education. The new law states that reimbursement for private school placement is not paid by the LEA unless certain findings are made by a hearing officer or court. Reimbursement cannot be reduced or denied if parents did not give notice, except in specific circumstances like the school preventing notice or risk of physical harm to the child. The law also includes provisions for cases where parents are illiterate or if compliance would result in serious emotional harm. The Supreme Court's recent decision in Board of Education of the City School District of the City of New York v. Tom F. ruled that parents of a child with a disability are entitled to private school reimbursement even if the student never received special education services from the school district. This decision does not set a precedent for future cases. The Supreme Court's recent decision in Board of Education of the City School District of the City of New York v. Tom F. ruled that parents of a child with a disability are entitled to private school reimbursement even if the student never received special education services from the school district. The Court's decision does not set a precedent for lower courts, and the issue remains unsettled as of October 15, 2007 when the Supreme Court denied certiorari in a similar case."
