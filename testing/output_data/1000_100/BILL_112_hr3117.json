The Secretary requires individuals purchasing electronic stamps to receive an actual stamp before it expires. States must collect and submit customer information and stamp sales data to the Secretary. The Secretary requires states selling electronic stamps to submit sales data and customer information. States can charge a fee for issuing electronic stamps to cover costs. A State authorized to issue electronic stamps may issue a duplicate electronic stamp to replace a lost or damaged one. States cannot require the purchase of a hunting license to obtain an electronic stamp under this Act. SEC. 6. ELECTRONIC STAMP REQUIREMENTS; RECOGNITION OF ELECTRONIC STAMP. The Secretary shall require an electronic stamp issued by a State to have the same format as any other license and specify identifying features of the licensee. The electronic stamp bestows the same privileges as an actual stamp, is recognized nationally as a valid Federal migratory bird hunting stamp, and authorizes the licensee to hunt migratory waterfowl. An electronic stamp issued by a State allows the licensee to hunt migratory waterfowl in any State following its hunting laws. The stamp's duration, agreed upon by the State and the Secretary, cannot exceed 45 days. The authority of a State to issue electronic stamps under this Act may be terminated by the Secretary if the State violates the terms approved by the Secretary, or by the State itself with written notice to the Secretary."
