    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Paleontological Resources Preservation Act\" and includes definitions for key terms. The \"Paleontological Resources Preservation Act\" defines key terms such as casual collecting and Secretary, with the Secretary being either the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Agriculture for National Forest System Lands. The \"Paleontological Resources Preservation Act\" defines key terms such as Federal lands, Indian lands, State, and paleontological resource. Federal lands are controlled by the Secretary of the Interior or Agriculture, excluding Indian lands. Indian lands are held in trust by the United States for Indian tribes or individuals. States include the fifty states, District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and other U.S. territories. The term \"paleontological resource\" refers to fossilized remains, traces, or imprints of organisms that provide information about the history of life on earth, excluding materials associated with archaeological resources or cultural items. The Secretary is responsible for managing and protecting paleontological resources on Federal lands using scientific principles. Plans for inventory, monitoring, and use of resources must be developed, emphasizing coordination with non-Federal partners and the public. The Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture should coordinate efforts. Additionally, a public awareness and education program will be established, and there will be guidelines for the collection of paleontological resources. The Secretary may issue permits for collecting paleontological resources on Federal lands, with exceptions for casual collecting without a permit on certain lands. Valid permits issued before the enactment of this Act are not affected. Permit issuance is based on specific criteria determined by the Secretary. Permits for collecting paleontological resources on Federal lands are issued by the Secretary based on specific criteria. The permit must ensure that the applicant is qualified, the activity furthers paleontological knowledge or public education, aligns with management plans, and does not threaten natural or cultural resources. The permit includes terms stating that collected resources remain the property of the United States. Permits for collecting paleontological resources on Federal lands are issued by the Secretary based on specific criteria. The permit ensures that the resources remain the property of the United States, are preserved for public access, and specific locality data is not released without permission. The Secretary has the authority to modify, suspend, or revoke permits for various reasons, including violations of terms or conditions. The permit for collecting paleontological resources on Federal lands can be revoked if a person is convicted under specific sections or assessed a civil penalty. The Secretary has the authority to restrict access or close areas to protect resources and ensure public safety. SEC. 6. CURATION OF RESOURCES. Paleontological resources collected under a permit must be deposited in an approved repository. The Secretary can make agreements with non-Federal repositories for curation. SEC. 7. PROHIBITED ACTS; CRIMINAL PENALTIES. (a) Prohibits excavation, removal, damage, or alteration of paleontological resources on Federal lands without following the Act's guidelines. \n(b) Restricts the exchange, transport, export, or sale of paleontological resources if obtained unlawfully from Federal lands. The law prohibits the excavation, removal, sale, or transport of paleontological resources from Federal lands without following guidelines. False labeling of such resources is also prohibited. Violators may face fines or imprisonment up to 10 years, depending on the value of the resources involved. The law prohibits unauthorized handling of paleontological resources on Federal lands, with penalties of fines, imprisonment up to 10 years, or both. An exception is made for resources in lawful possession before the enactment of the Act. SEC. 8. CIVIL PENALTIES. The Secretary may assess penalties for violations of regulations or permits under the Act, with the amount determined based on factors like the value of the paleontological resource and the cost of response and restoration. Each violation is considered a separate offense. The Secretary may assess penalties for violations under the Act based on factors like the value of the resource and site damage. Penalties can be doubled for multiple offenses, with a limit set at double the cost of response and resource value. Judicial review is available for those issued penalties. Upon issuance of a penalty, individuals can petition for judicial review within 30 days in the appropriate district court. The court will base its decision on substantial evidence from the record. Failure to pay the penalty within 30 days after it becomes final may result in further consequences. After a court has entered a final judgment upholding a penalty assessment, the Secretary may request the Attorney General to initiate a civil action in a district court to collect the penalty with interest. The district court will have jurisdiction over the case. Penalties collected under this section shall be used by the Secretary for protection, restoration, or repair of paleontological resources. Hearings during proceedings shall follow section 554 of title 5, United States Code. Failure to pay civil penalties may result in additional fees for collection proceedings. The Secretary shall use penalties collected for the protection, restoration, or acquisition of paleontological resources. Additionally, educational materials will be provided to the public, and rewards may be paid as specified in section 9. Rewards and forfeiture are specified in section 9. The Secretary may pay rewards from penalties collected under section 7 or 8, based on regulations or a set amount, to individuals providing information leading to civil or criminal violations. No government officials are eligible for payment. All paleontological resources are subject to forfeiture as specified in section 9. (b) Forfeiture of paleontological resources and related property is mandated in cases of violation under sections 7 or 8, with provisions for civil or criminal forfeiture. The Secretary can transfer seized resources to educational institutions for scientific use. All relevant laws on property seizure, forfeiture, and disposition apply. Federal educational institutions can receive seized paleontological resources for scientific or educational purposes. SEC. 10. CONFIDENTIALITY.\n\nInformation about paleontological resources requiring a permit is exempt from disclosure unless disclosure furthers the Act's purposes, poses no risk to the resource, and complies with other laws.\n\nSEC. 11. REGULATIONS.\n\nThe Secretary will issue regulations to implement the Act, allowing for public input.\n\nSEC. 12. SAVINGS PROVISIONS. Nothing in this Act shall invalidate, modify, or impose additional restrictions on activities permitted under various mining and land management laws. The Act does not impose new restrictions on activities allowed under existing laws related to Federal lands, including casual collecting of certain natural resources. It does not impact non-Federal lands or the lawful recovery of paleontological resources. Additionally, it does not diminish the authority of Federal agencies to protect paleontological resources beyond what is outlined in the Act. It also does not grant any rights or benefits to individuals not affiliated with the United States government. No individual who is not a US officer or employee acting in that capacity can file a civil action in a US court to enforce any provision or amendment made by this Act. Authorization of appropriations is granted to carry out this Act."
