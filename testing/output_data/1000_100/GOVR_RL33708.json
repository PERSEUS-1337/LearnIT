    "content": "Antitrust doctrine focuses on promoting competition to protect consumers, with no set rules on acceptable competition levels or limits on market growth. Monopoly and monopolist terms are used descriptively, without implying legality. Monopolization and unfair acts are prohibited, but the number of competitors in a market is not specified. Antitrust law in the United States does not consider monopolies as inherently unlawful. The Rule of Reason recognizes that some actions may have both anti-competitive and pro-competitive effects. To determine if monopolization has occurred, it must be established if an entity is a monopolist and if they have unlawfully monopolized the relevant market. The legal obligation of a monopolist to deal with competitors is not clearly defined, with the concept of owning or controlling an \"essential facility\" being debated. Recent cases involving Microsoft and Intel highlight the distinction between monopoly and monopolization. The distinction between monopoly and monopolization in antitrust law is crucial. Monopoly refers to the power to control prices or exclude competition, while monopolization involves actual adverse effects on competition in the relevant market. The antitrust laws aim to protect consumers and promote competitive markets. The antitrust laws focus on protecting competition, not competitors. Courts have debated the threshold for labeling a participant a \"monopolist\" since the Sherman Act in 1890. Simply having monopoly power does not automatically constitute monopolization without evidence of anti-competitive behavior. Size or monopoly power alone does not equate to unlawful monopolization. In 1998, the Assistant Attorney General clarified that the size of a merger does not determine its legality under antitrust laws. The focus is on potential competitive harms, not just the size of the companies involved. The key consideration is whether the merger will harm consumers, not the sheer size of the corporations. The Sherman and Clayton Acts prohibit monopolization and attempted monopolization, not just size or monopoly power. The Sherman Act and Clayton Act prohibit monopolization and attempted monopolization in interstate commerce. The Rule of Reason doctrine allows for flexibility in enforcing these laws by considering both anticompetitive and procompetitive effects. The definition of a market entity as a monopolist or facing charges of monopolization depends on how the market is defined. A defendant would prefer a broad definition of the product and geographic market to lessen the likelihood of being seen as controlling a large portion of it. The determination of a market participant as a monopolist or facing monopolization charges depends on the market definition. A broad market definition reduces the likelihood of being seen as controlling a large portion of it. The courts use a subjective test rather than a specific market share threshold to determine monopoly status. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit noted that market share calculation is crucial in determining monopoly status. While a 90% share may constitute a monopoly, 60-64% is doubtful, and 33% is not enough. To be found guilty of monopolization, one must first be determined a monopolist with the power to control prices or exclude competition. Simply possessing monopoly power is not enough; there must also be evidence of willful acquisition or maintenance of monopoly power. Courts evaluate business conduct to distinguish between lawful and unlawful monopolistic behavior. The antitrust laws aim to protect competition, not individual competitors. Allegations of attempted monopolization require proof of predatory or exclusionary conduct by a monopolist. Allegations of \"attempted monopolization\" and \"monopolization\" require proof of predatory or anticompetitive conduct and specific intent to achieve monopoly status. The relevant market and the defendant's ability to lessen competition are crucial factors in determining the dangerous probability of monopolization. The antitrust laws aim to protect competition, not individual competitors. Colgate & Co. is free to choose who they deal with unless it constitutes \"guilty behavior\" or an attempt to expand their monopoly. The right of a trader or manufacturer to refuse to sell is recognized, regardless of patent or copyright laws, unless determined otherwise by the court. The antitrust legality of a situation where a monopolist's actions affect competition in an adjacent market depends on their position vis-a-vis competitors. Whether a monopolist must deal advantageously with entities in an adjacent market also hinges on their attempt to extend their lawful monopoly into another market. Two courts reached opposite conclusions on similar circumstances involving monopolists' decisions on dealings with entities. In Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Technical Services, Inc. and In re Independent Service Organizations Antitrust Litigation, monopolists were involved in decisions affecting competitors in adjacent markets. The first case involved Kodak tying the sale of repair parts to its service, extending its monopoly. In the second case, Xerox Corporation refused to sell patented repair parts or service manuals to independent service organizations. In Image Technical Services, the Supreme Court ruled that Kodak's refusal to sell patented repair parts or service manuals violated antitrust laws. The court required lower courts to determine if Kodak had enough market power to unlawfully tie the purchase of service for its copiers to the purchase of repair parts. On remand, a jury found Kodak had monopoly power and misused it in the service market. The appeals court affirmed this finding and the resulting injunction. The United States Court of Appeals upheld the District Court's grant of summary judgment to Xerox in a litigation case involving antitrust laws and patent rights. The court emphasized that a patent holder has the right to exclude others from patent property, but this does not give them the right to violate antitrust laws. The court stated that a patent may confer the right to exclude competition in more than one antitrust market, unless exceptional circumstances exist. In cases involving antitrust laws and patent rights, a patent holder can exclude others from multiple antitrust markets. The patent holder can enforce their right to exclude others from using the invention without violating antitrust laws, unless there is evidence of illegal tying, fraud, or sham litigation. In a related case, the FTC was criticized for ruling against a publisher for unfair practices in commerce. The FTC's ruling in a case involving unfair practices in commerce raised concerns about giving the Commission too much power to interfere with a monopolist's business judgment. This could potentially allow the FTC to dictate decisions that impact competition in various industries, such as requiring a supermarket to stock specific products. The court's ruling in the Official Airline Guides case is crucial for assessing a monopolist's duty to deal advantageously with non-competitor entities in an adjacent market. The concept of the \"essential facilities\" doctrine, developed since the Sherman Act in 1890, requires a monopolist to provide access to crucial facilities that cannot be duplicated by potential competitors. The United States v. Terminal Railroad Association case established the concept of an \"essential facility\" where access to crucial facilities must be provided to potential competitors. This doctrine was applied in cases like MCI Communications Corp. v. AT&T, where AT&T was required to grant access to its telephone lines for competition in the long-distance telephone business. The essential facilities doctrine requires firms controlling crucial facilities to provide access on nondiscriminatory terms. Curtis Trinko sued Verizon for not sharing network facilities as mandated by the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Verizon was sued for failing to comply with the Telecommunications Act's mandate to provide interconnection service to other carriers. The complaint alleged Verizon's anti-competitive behavior, but the Court rejected the arguments, discussing the regulatory scheme and antitrust implications. The Court analyzed the established antitrust standards of monopoly status, monopolization, and attempted monopolization, citing the \"Colgate doctrine\" on a businessman's right to choose who to deal with. It distinguished previous cases using the \"essential facilities\" doctrine, noting that access had been withdrawn in the present case. The Court distinguished previous cases involving concerted action and emphasized that although Verizon violated a duty imposed by the act, it did not violate any antitrust laws. The 1992 Horizontal Merger Guidelines clarify the \"monopoly\"/\"monopolization\" concept and provide insight into the agencies' antitrust enforcement philosophy. The \"Purpose and Underlying Policy Assumptions\" section of the Introduction emphasizes that mergers should not enhance market power. Antitrust agencies differentiate between monopoly power and active monopolization, as seen in cases against Microsoft and Intel. The DOJ filed action against Microsoft for engaging in anticompetitive activities to protect its Windows monopoly and extend it into other software markets. This included tying other Microsoft software products to Windows, exclusionary agreements with competitors, and restricting services to competitors. The FTC charged Intel Corporation for violating Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act by using its monopoly power to impede innovation and stifle competition. Intel cannot cement its monopoly by preventing other firms from challenging its dominance. Monopoly status does not determine the lawfulness of the monopoly enjoyed. The status of being a monopolist does not automatically require fair dealing with others in the market. A monopolization violation is based on a monopolist's \"guilty behavior\" rather than just their status. The duty to deal with competitors arises from unlawful exploitation of a monopoly position, not solely from being a monopolist. The Colgate doctrine allows market participants to choose their commercial relationships, but the \"essential facilities\" doctrine states that a monopolist must provide necessary components to competitors if they cannot be obtained reasonably. The Supreme Court questioned the validity of the \"essential facilities\" doctrine in antitrust law, particularly in the context of regulated entities. The Court stated that a regulatory statute mandating the sharing of specific facilities does not automatically constitute an antitrust violation without evidence of behavior that would violate antitrust laws."
