    "content": "Under the OCSLA, the DOI must create five-year programs for oil and gas lease sales in U.S. waters, balancing energy supply and environmental protection. The BOEM leads this process, which involves multiple drafts for review and narrowing down leasing areas based on economic and environmental factors before submission to the President and Congress. The Department of the Interior submits five-year oil and gas lease programs to the President and Congress for approval after a 60-day review period. The process includes a programmatic environmental impact statement (PEIS) as required by NEPA, addressing potential impacts and considering alternatives. Public comments are incorporated into the PEIS and the final program. Revisions to a finalized program require restarting the development process due to OCSLA and NEPA requirements. The BOEM released the final version of its oil and gas leasing program for 2017-2022, approving 11 lease sales on the OCS, with revisions from earlier proposed programs. Sales could be canceled but not added during implementation due to environmental review requirements. Three sales initially proposed were not included in the final program. The BOEM released the final version of its oil and gas leasing program for 2017-2022, approving 11 lease sales on the OCS, with revisions from earlier proposed programs. Three sales initially proposed were not included in the final program. Congress plays a role in influencing the program through public comments, oversight hearings, and introducing legislation. Members of the 114th Congress utilized these methods to influence the proposed program. The report discusses BOEM's five-year offshore oil and gas leasing programs for 2017-2022, including the history, legal framework, development process, and analysis. Congress's role in oversight and legislation related to the program is also highlighted. In 1953, laws were enacted regarding jurisdiction and rights off the U.S. coasts, including regulation of oil and gas exploration. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) defines the OCS as submerged lands beyond state coastal waters under US jurisdiction. It aims to expedite offshore resource development while ensuring environmental protection, state involvement, and competitive leasing. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act Amendments of 1978 established a competitive leasing program for offshore oil and gas exploration. This legislation included Section 18, which requires the creation of five-year leasing programs to meet national energy needs. These programs have guided OCS oil and gas exploration since 1980. Congress has made additional changes to offshore exploration, such as the Deep Water Royalty Relief Act of 1995 to incentivize deepwater exploration. The Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 directed leasing in certain regions of the Gulf of Mexico for oil and gas exploration, sharing revenues with Gulf states and the Land and Water Conservation Fund. Congress removed language to allow leasing in certain OCS regions, shaping subsequent five-year programs. The statutory framework governing BOEM's development of offshore oil and gas leasing programs includes OCSLA, NEPA, and CZMA. Section 18 of OCSLA mandates the Secretary of the Interior to create five-year leasing programs. The Secretary of the Interior is mandated by Section 18 of the OCSLA to prepare and maintain an oil and gas leasing program that considers economic, social, and environmental values of the OCS resources. This program includes a schedule of proposed lease sales for the five-year period following its approval, taking into account the impact of oil and gas exploration on marine, coastal, and human environments. The OCSLA mandates the Secretary of the Interior to prepare an oil and gas leasing program considering various factors such as geographical, geological, and ecological characteristics, environmental considerations, interest of oil and gas producers, and state laws. The program must ensure fair market value for leased lands and rights conveyed by the Federal Government, include estimates on appropriations and staffing needs, and involve consultation with interested Federal agencies. The Secretary of the Interior must consult with various agencies and state governors when preparing an oil and gas leasing program under the OCSLA. The program must be submitted to the governors of affected states for comments at least 60 days before publication. The Attorney General and Federal Trade Commission can also provide comments on the program's potential effects on competition. The Secretary must submit the proposed program to Congress and the President at least 60 days before approval, along with an explanation for any rejected recommendations. Once approved, a final five-year program can be implemented, with the option for revisions at any time. The Secretary's responsibilities are carried out by BOEM, with consultation requirements in place, such as requesting input from governors of affected states. The regulations require governors of affected states to identify laws, goals, and policies for BOEM to consider in the five-year program. NEPA and CZMA are federal statutes that influence the program's formation, with NEPA mandating environmental impact statements for major federal actions. Under the CZMA, states are encouraged to enact coastal zone management plans to coordinate protection of habitats and resources in coastal waters, promoting preservation alongside sustainable development. BOEM prepares a programmatic EIS (PEIS) for its five-year programs assuming their significant impact on the environment. State coastal zone management programs approved by the Secretary of Commerce receive federal assistance. Programs must designate conservation measures, permissible land and water uses, and address water pollution sources. BOEM regulations require consideration of state coastal management programs in leasing program development. Information on the relationship between state programs and OCS oil and gas activity is requested from governors and the Secretary of Commerce. The development of a five-year leasing program by BOEM involves consultation with state governors, federal agencies, Congress, and the President. Each stage includes public comment and environmental review. Individual lease sales and exploration plans also undergo review. The process from program development to oil and gas production is outlined in Figure 1. The drafting of the five-year program involves analysis and review at each stage, leading to a winnowing process. The initial draft examines all planning areas for oil and gas leasing, considering Section 18 factors and public input to create a proposed lease sales schedule. Subsequent drafts focus on listed areas for further analysis and environmental review, with the ability to remove proposed sales but not add new ones. The final plan allows for the removal of proposed sales but requires reverting to earlier stages for new sales. Step 1 - Request for Information is initiated by BOEM for a new five-year program, seeking input on energy needs, leasing interests, environmental concerns, and public feedback. A draft proposed program is then published based on analysis and public comments received.\n\nStep 4 - BOEM initiates Request for Information for a new five-year program, seeking input on energy needs, leasing interests, environmental concerns, and public feedback. A draft proposed program is then published based on analysis and public comments received. The DPP analyzes OCS planning areas for leasing and identifies areas proposed for lease sales over the next five years. BOEM published the DPP for 2017-2022 on January 29, 2015, receiving over 1 million comments. The NOI for the proposed lease areas was also published on the same date. After analyzing lease sale areas in the DPP, BOEM publishes a proposed program (PP) for a five-year period, refining locations and timing for OCS oil and gas lease sales. The PP is submitted to Congress, state governors, and relevant federal agencies for review and public comment. The draft PEIS for 2017-2022 was published on March 15, 2016, with a comment period closing on June 16, 2016. The final document, the Proposed Final Program (PFP), is based on additional analysis of OCSLA factors and analysis of the PEIS. The PFP for 2017-2022, based on analysis of OCSLA factors and public comments, is announced in the Federal Register and submitted to the President and Congress for a 60-day review period. Congress does not approve the PFP, but the review period allows for potential legislative influence. The final PEIS for the program is also published and submitted to the President and Congress. The Secretary of the Interior may approve the PFP at least 60 days after submission, making it final. The Secretary of the Interior approves the final Program for 2017-2022, which is published as a record of decision. Previous five-year programs dating back to 1980 have been submitted to Congress and approved after a 60-day review period. The programs reflect offshore oil and gas leasing policies of different administrations and stakeholder input. The 2012-2017 program was submitted by the Obama Administration under former Secretary Ken Salazar. The 2012-2017 program was submitted to Congress by the Obama Administration under former Secretary Ken Salazar, reflecting policies on offshore energy development post-Deepwater Horizon oil spill. It included 15 proposed lease sales, with 11 sales held by late November 2016. The 2007-2012 program was prepared by the George W. Bush Administration under former Secretary Dirk Kempthorne, with a schedule of 21 sales that was later revised in accordance with a 2009 court order. The 2002-2007 OCS oil and gas leasing plan was submitted to Congress in 2002 under former Secretary of the Interior Gale Norton. It consisted of a schedule of 20 lease sales, with 15 held before the program expired in June 2007. The submission listed 16 sales, 12 held before the program expired in June 2002. Programs from 1992-1997, 1987-1992, and 1982-1987 were presented to Congress reflecting different administrations' energy policies. The 1980-1982 oil and gas leasing program was presented to Congress under former Secretary of the Interior James Watt, consistent with the Reagan Administration's energy policies. It included 41 sales, with 23 held before the program expired in June 1987. The program was preceded by the 1978 Amendments to the OCSLA and President Carter's \"Energy Message\" in 1979, leading to the approval of 36 sales in June 1980. The leasing history prior to 1980 included federal government lease sales from 1954 to 1980. In 2016, BOEM released the final offshore oil and gas leasing program for 2017-2022, scheduling 11 lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska regions. U.S. offshore crude oil production accounted for 16% of total production in FY2015. Offshore production in FY2015 accounted for 16% of U.S. total crude oil production, down from 31% in FY2010. Production volumes decreased by 12% during this period, while total U.S. crude production reached 9.4 million barrels per day, a 73% increase from FY2010 levels. Offshore natural gas production represented 4% of U.S. total production in FY2015, down from 9.5% in FY2010, with volumes falling by nearly 50%. The surge in total U.S. crude oil and natural gas production is attributed to increased production of shale gas and shale oil in onshore formations like Marcellus, Bakken, Permian Basin, and Eagle Ford. The increased U.S. oil production from onshore shale oil plays like Marcellus, Bakken, Permian Basin, and Eagle Ford has reduced imports from OPEC countries. Offshore production in the Central Gulf of Mexico accounts for the majority of producing leases. Lower oil and gas prices may lead to decreased investment in offshore leases, impacting future production levels according to the Energy Information Administration. Lower domestic investment in oil and gas projects from 2015-2020, with ONRR estimating lower bonus bid revenues for offshore leasing in the next five fiscal years. The Office of Management and Budget's crude oil price estimates have also decreased. Despite this, offshore crude oil production on federal lands is expected to continue contributing significantly to the U.S. energy supply. The EIA predicts record offshore crude oil production in the Gulf of Mexico in 2017, with new deepwater projects contributing. BOEM emphasizes the importance of energy diversification and new production from other OCS regions to meet energy needs. Oil and gas exploration and production involve stages that increase certainty about resource volumes, with undiscovered resources turning into discovered volumes through drilling. The volumes of oil and gas reserves in U.S. OCS areas are measured via well penetration or technology. Reserves are reported to the SEC by well owners. The U.S. OCS has 4.3 billion barrels of proven oil reserves and 16 Tcf of dry gas, mostly in the Gulf of Mexico. Estimated undiscovered resources include 89.9 billion barrels of oil and 327.5 Tcf of natural gas. The Gulf of Mexico contains 54% of the UTRR for oil and 43% for natural gas, with the majority in the Central Gulf. Alaska's UTRR estimates are mainly in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas. BOEM must consider resource potential, environmental, and socioeconomic impacts in OCS regions for leasing. Some areas were unavailable for leasing in the 2017-2022 program due to presidential withdrawals, congressional moratoriums, or protected status. Areas unavailable for leasing in the 2017-2022 program included the Eastern and Central Gulf of Mexico, certain ocean areas in Alaska, and national marine sanctuaries and monuments. Marine monuments established by U.S. Presidents are withdrawn from future oil and gas leasing activities in various parts of the Atlantic Ocean, Pacific Ocean, and Gulf of Mexico. President Obama made additional withdrawals under the OCSLA in December 2016, including much of the U.S. Arctic and certain areas of the Atlantic Ocean. These withdrawals did not impact the 2017-2022 leasing program. BOEM's leasing strategy considers U.S. ocean regions for future leasing programs based on various criteria. The final program includes 11 lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska regions, with no sales scheduled for the Atlantic and Pacific regions. Marine monuments in these regions are withdrawn from leasing activities. The 2017-2022 leasing program includes 11 lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska regions, with no sales in the Atlantic and Pacific regions. The Gulf region is the most mature, with abundant oil and gas resources and strong industry support. Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, and Alabama are supportive of offshore activities, leading to the majority of lease sales being scheduled in the Gulf region. The 2017-2022 leasing program includes 10 of the 11 proposed sales in the Gulf region, covering the Western Gulf, Central Gulf, and Eastern Gulf planning areas. The Eastern Gulf and a small portion of the Central Gulf are closed to leasing due to congressional moratorium. BOEM has replaced area-specific sales with region-wide sales to offer all available lease blocks in each sale, providing greater flexibility to industry and facilitating better planning for exploration. The 2017-2022 leasing program schedules fewer lease sales in the Gulf region compared to previous programs, with a focus on consolidating area-specific sales. This change has raised concerns among some Members of Congress, but BOEM attributes the decrease to offering all available Gulf blocks at each sale. Interest in exploring for offshore oil and gas in the Alaska region has increased due to the shrinking summer polar ice, allowing for longer drilling seasons. Interest in exploring for offshore oil and gas in the Arctic region has increased due to the shrinking summer polar ice, allowing for a longer drilling season. The region faces challenges such as severe weather, perennial sea ice, and lack of infrastructure for extraction and transportation. Stakeholders, including the State of Alaska and some Members of Congress, seek to expand offshore oil and gas activities in the region, while others, including environmental groups, oppose drilling due to concerns about potential oil spills. The Obama Administration supported offshore oil and gas exploration in the Arctic but also aimed to minimize oil spill risks. Lease sales in the Beaufort Sea and Chukchi Sea were canceled due to market conditions. The final program included only a sale in Cook Inlet, removing sales in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas. The Obama Administration supported offshore oil and gas exploration in the Arctic but canceled lease sales in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas due to market conditions. BOEM decided against the sales in those areas based on factors like declining industry interest, Arctic ecosystem uniqueness, and existing domestic energy sources. The Obama Administration canceled lease sales in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas due to declining industry interest and existing domestic energy sources. President Obama withdrew large portions of the Arctic OCS from future leasing consideration for an indefinite time period. The final program for 2017-2022 excludes a lease sale in the Atlantic region that was proposed in the DPP version of the program. Congressional bans and presidential moratoria on Atlantic leasing have been lifted, allowing for potential lease sales in the region. No Atlantic lease sale has taken place in the intervening years, despite changes allowing for potential lease sales in the region. Factors analyzed for the Atlantic region included resource potential, infrastructure needs, ecological and safety concerns, competing uses by the Department of Defense and NASA, and state/local attitudes towards drilling. Initial analysis for the DPP resulted in a planned lease sale in a combined portion of the Mid- and South Atlantic planning areas. BOEM initially planned a lease sale in the Mid- and South Atlantic planning areas in 2021 but later removed the Atlantic sale due to strong opposition, conflicts with other ocean uses, current market dynamics, and feedback from affected states. Conflicts with existing uses like tourism, fishing, shipping, and defense activities were cited as reasons for the removal. The lack of a history of offshore mineral production in the Atlantic raised concerns among stakeholders. The BOEM decided not to hold an Atlantic lease sale in the 2017-2022 period due to concerns about conflicts with other ocean uses and the current U.S. energy situation. The agency stated that domestic oil and gas production will remain strong without additional production from the Atlantic region. No lease sales are scheduled for the Pacific region in the 2017-2022 program, with the last federal oil and gas lease sale in the region held in 1984. The governors of California, Oregon, and Washington oppose offshore oil and gas leasing in the region. Congress can influence the Administration's development of a five-year program through public comments, oversight hearings, and legislation. The 114th Congress pursued these avenues for the 2017-2022 program, and the 115th Congress could also address it. The 115th Congress may address the proposed 2017-2022 program through legislation or choose not to do so. BOEM received comments from Members of Congress on the program, with some supporting lease sales and others opposing certain regions' inclusion. Comments also touched on issues like seismic testing in the Atlantic. The public comments on the proposed 2017-2022 program, including seismic testing in the Atlantic, are considered by BOEM in developing successive drafts. BOEM may revise the program based on feedback from Members of Congress and may hold oversight hearings to evaluate it. The House held a hearing on the program in April 2015, addressing issues like the number of lease sales proposed. The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee discussed the proposed 2017-2022 program, including targeted lease sales in Alaska and the removal of the Atlantic lease sale. Congress can influence the program through legislation, such as adding or removing lease sales. Bills like H.R. 1487 and S. 791 were considered but not enacted in the 114th Congress. The proposed 2017-2022 program included bills like H.R. 1487 and S. 791, which aimed to use an earlier-proposed Bush Administration draft program for oil and gas leasing. These bills would have required lease sales, including one in the Atlantic region, and mandated regular lease sales for areas with commercial interest. The program would have been approved under NEPA without further environmental review. H.R. 1663 would have approved BOEM's DPP for 2017-2022 and added lease sales for various regions, including the Chukchi Sea, Beaufort Sea, Bristol Bay, Virginia coast, and OCS areas with significant oil or gas reserves. The bill also included state revenue-sharing provisions and declared the final program approved under NEPA. H.R. 3682 aimed to amend the OCSLA to ensure at least 50% of available unleased acreage in each OCS planning area is made available for leasing in five-year programs. The bill aimed to increase oil and gas production by setting specific goals for BOEM's five-year leasing programs, including adding areas with large reserves and allowing the Secretary to include additional areas under certain conditions. BOEM was required to finalize a leasing program for 2016-2021 that complied with these provisions and conduct a previously proposed lease sale in the Atlantic region. The bill aimed to increase oil and gas production by setting specific goals for BOEM's five-year leasing programs, including adding areas with large reserves and allowing the Secretary to include additional areas under certain conditions. It included lease sales off of South Carolina and Southern California, revenue sharing provisions with states, and military protections for offshore energy activities. The bills aimed to expand oil and gas production by reducing leasing moratoriums in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico and adding lease sales to the 2017-2022 program. They also included provisions for state revenue-sharing and offshore energy activities. The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources discussed the bills in hearings and reported them in 2015. Additionally, the bills required lease sales in Alaska's Cook Inlet and Beaufort Sea planning areas, with provisions for extending existing leases and revenue sharing with Alaska. The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources discussed bills S. 1278, S. 1279, and S. 3203 in hearings in 2015. The bills aimed to expand oil and gas production by adding lease sales in various planning areas, including the South Atlantic, Beaufort, Chukchi, and Cook Inlet. They also included provisions for revenue sharing with the state of Alaska and addressing potential conflicts with military operations. The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources discussed bill S. 3203 in a hearing, which aimed to increase revenue sharing with Alaska and make changes to lease terms in the Alaska region. Congress has the authority to introduce legislation to alter the final version of each five-year program under the OCSLA. The House passed a congressionally developed plan for additional lease sales in various regions, but it did not become law. Legislation in the 114th Congress aimed to change the lease sale schedule for the 2017-2022 program, with potential for further alterations in the 115th Congress."
