The program has a long history of supporting courses in less commonly taught languages and regions, reflecting federal government's priority on diplomacy and national security. Title VI of the Higher Education Act provides grants for foreign language and area studies, focusing on less commonly taught languages and regions. The program supports diplomacy, national security, and trade competitiveness. Interest in Title VI has grown due to concerns about terrorism from foreign regions not typically covered in American curricula. The program's funding remained stable at $93.1 million in FY2007 and $95.6 million in FY2008. The report aims to overview Title VI programs and analyze reauthorization issues. The U.S. Department of Education has discretion in allocating funds for Title VI activities under the Higher Education Act. The authorization levels for Parts A, B, and C are specified, with grants typically awarded on a multi-year basis. The statutory authorities for Title VI expired in FY2004 but have since been extended. The last specific authorization was in FY1999 for $80 million for Part A, $18 million for Part B, and $10 million for Part C. No more than 10% of Part A funds can be used for Undergraduate International programs. Under the Higher Education Act, no more than 10% of Part A funds can be used for Undergraduate International Studies and Foreign Language Programs. The majority of funds are allocated to National Language and Area Centers (NLACs) and FLAS Fellowships. NLAC grant recipients also receive grants for FLAS Fellowships, with these programs being the core activities supported under Title VI. Other smaller-scale activities serve more specific goals or support the primary programs. Funds under HEA Title VI programs are allocated competitively for National Language and Area Centers, FLAS Fellowships, and Language Resource Centers. Provisions in appropriations acts specify activities and language/world regions for specialization. The FY2002 Department of Education Appropriations Act and FY2004 Consolidated Appropriations Resolution specified the world regions and languages for Title VI funds to sustain investments in training experts with foreign language proficiency in targeted areas like Central and South Asia, the Middle East, Russia, and the former Soviet Union. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005 (P.L. 108-447) allocates funds for building foreign language capacity in strategic world areas important to national security interests, including southeast Asia and Africa. One percent of the appropriation is earmarked for program evaluation and $1,500,000 is designated for an independent review of Title VI programs. The National Foreign Language Center at the University of Maryland is a significant source of evaluations for HEA Title VI programs. The International Research and Studies program funds are used for assessing the effects of HEA Title VI programs, including program graduates. The EELIAS Project, funded by the ED, aims to evaluate and assess HEA Title VI programs and develop performance indicators and data reporting systems. It also evaluates the Fulbright-Hays program and develops methods for program assessment. The project aims to evaluate the impact of HEA Title VI programs on foreign language capacity over a five-year period. A 2000 report assessed the importance of HEA Title VI support in maintaining the nation's capacity in less commonly taught languages. The report evaluates the impact of HEA Title VI programs on foreign language capacity, emphasizing the strategic importance of less commonly taught languages for the United States. It highlights the significant role of Title VI grants in supporting graduate students and textbook development in these languages. Discussions on HEA Title VI-related issues are expected during the reauthorization process in the 110th Congress, reflecting the increasing interaction between American society and global cultures with potential national security implications. It is important for our nation to provide education and support for people to acquire advanced knowledge of languages and cultures of nations of current concern, including both major and minor ones. This ongoing support is crucial as it is difficult to predict which nations will generate national security concerns in the future. The federal government supports instruction in critical foreign languages and cultures, focusing on those with major security or trade interests. This support raises questions about whether it should be provided by the government and if it should target colleges, universities, or federally-operated institutions. Two language schools, the Defense Language Institute in California and the Foreign Service Institute in Virginia, help meet the government's language needs. The HEA Title VI program provides grants to IHEs for educational programs in specific subject areas, unlike the general approach of the HEA which focuses on student aid based on financial need. Title VI is one of the few HEA programs that target specific subject areas, requiring specific justification for its focused support of advanced study in foreign languages and cultures. Supporters argue that advanced study of foreign languages and regions is crucial for national security, defense, and economic competitiveness. They emphasize the importance of maintaining research and instructional programs in critical foreign language and area studies at federally-operated institutions and colleges accessible to the public. These skills are essential not only for national defense and diplomacy but also for international trade and increasing understanding of foreign nations and cultures among the broader public. The research and development of foreign language programs in higher education institutions are crucial for expanding understanding of foreign cultures and improving language instruction. Collaboration between American and foreign educational institutions is easier in colleges and universities compared to federal institutions. Additionally, support for specific subject areas under HEA Title VI is not unique to the Department of Education, as other federal agencies also provide support to institutions focused on foreign languages and regions. Several federal agencies provide support to institutions of higher education for specific subject areas on a larger scale than HEA Title VI, such as health care education by the National Institutes of Health and science and mathematics education by the National Science Foundation. These subject areas are considered of special national interest and worthy of targeted federal support. If sufficient student interest exists, institutions may provide adequate instruction in critical foreign languages and area studies without federal subsidies. If federal aid is necessary, it could be limited to covering start-up costs. Federal aid for critical foreign languages and area studies may be limited to covering start-up costs, not ongoing expenses. Efforts could be made to utilize the language skills of recent immigrants. Private foundations occasionally support FLAS programs. Individual institutions struggle to offer instruction in rare languages like Pashto or Farsi. Proponents argue for federal support, like Title VI, for critical foreign languages and area studies due to insufficient funding from institutions. Title VI funding may not fully meet national needs, and reauthorization is being considered by Congress. Title VI is a major source of federal support for FLAS programs in U.S. colleges. Title VI is not the only source of support for foreign language and area studies programs. Coordination with other related programs is questioned for efficiency. Programs like the Fulbright-Hays Act, NSEP, and Gilman International Scholarship Program are also relevant. The Fulbright-Hays Act authorizes international exchange activities, including exchanges of graduate students and scholars in various fields. These activities are primarily administered by the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs of the Department of State, involving participants from nations other than the United States. In contrast, the Fulbright-Hays programs relevant to HEA Title VI are administered by ED's Office of Postsecondary Education, supporting foreign travel-related activities for American graduate students and professors. The Fulbright-Hays programs under ED support foreign travel activities for American graduate students and professors to improve FLAS instruction in U.S. colleges and universities. The NSEP, authorized by the David L. Boren National Security Education Act, provides aid for international education and foreign language studies for American undergraduate and graduate students. The NSEP provides funding for higher education programs in critical foreign language and area studies, fellowships for graduate students, and scholarships. Recipients are required to seek employment in national security positions or work in higher education related to their field of study. The institutional grants program supports instructional programs in less commonly taught languages and nations, increases minority participation in international education, and integrates foreign language studies with professional education. A new strategy starting in 2003 includes a Flagship Language Initiative for advanced study of critical foreign languages, authorized by the Intelligence Authorization Act for FY2003. The National Security Education Program (NSEP) complements these efforts. The National Security Education Program (NSEP) complements other federal programs for international education by supporting travel grants for undergraduate students and having a service requirement. Administered by the Department of Defense's National Defense University, the NSEP determines critical nations, disciplines, and subject areas for national security. The National Security Education Program (NSEP) is administered by non-governmental organizations and supports international education and exchange. In FY1995, there were attempts to eliminate the program, but a compromise was reached to reduce its trust fund to $75 million. The National Security Education Program (NSEP) is funded annually at $8 million through the Department of Defense Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2003. It differs from HEA Title VI by having a service requirement, focusing on national security-related FLAS skill needs, being administered by DOD, and supporting international travel for undergraduate students. The program, authorized by the International Academic Opportunity Act of 2000, provides scholarships of up to $5,000 for U.S. citizen undergraduate students. The Gilman Scholarships are available for undergraduate students, including those from community colleges, to cover travel costs, tuition, and study abroad expenses. Eligibility requires being a recipient of financial aid through the Pell Grant program. Preference is given to students who have not previously studied abroad. The program aims to provide study abroad opportunities to students who may not otherwise have the chance. The Gilman Scholarships program, administered by the Department of State through the Institute of International Education, supports 179 students for the 2002-2003 academic year. The Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education (FIPSE) administers various programs to enhance U.S. postsecondary education, with targeted support for international education activities under specific programs. The Program for North American Mobility in Higher Education, U.S.-Brazil Higher Education Consortia Program, and European Community-United States of America Cooperation Program provide grants for cooperation and exchange between U.S. and foreign institutions. Funding levels for FY2002 are $2,043,000, $1,495,000, and $2,254,000 respectively. There is a question of whether these programs should be consolidated under a coordinated national strategy for efficiency. Consolidation of federal programs serving similar purposes can enhance efficiency, especially when grant competitions overlap. Coordination among programs like Fulbright-Hays, FIPSE, and NSEP could be improved by consolidation or oversight by a single board. NSEP, with its focus on national security needs, plays a unique role among these programs. The NSEP emphasizes national security needs and has a service requirement for aid recipients, setting it apart from other programs. Coordination with Title VI and related programs may be more consistent with NSEP's purposes, but questions arise about the efficiency of maintaining a separate program. The NSEP's trust fund has experienced a significant reduction, raising concerns about its long-term viability under the current funding structure. The Gilman International Scholarship Program provides funding for undergraduate students to travel abroad, but lacks the national security focus and service requirements of the NSEP. There is a suggestion to transfer the Gilman program to the Department of Education and coordinate all federal programs related to foreign language and international studies. The Assistance Program authorized by Title V-D-9 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) aims to coordinate FLAS specialists' needs at both federal and national levels. There is a question of increased coordination between HEA Title VI funded IHEs and federal agencies offering language instruction, suggesting potential collaboration in targeting fellowships and grants towards federal language needs. The NLAC and FLAS Fellowship grant recipients for FY2000-2002 cycle reflect a balance among world regions, including critical areas like the Middle East and South Asia. While critical languages or regions may change over time, a stable group can be identified for funding. It is important to identify stable languages or regions for Title VI grants targeting. Decisions on fund allocation can be made by ED, an interagency advisory body, a new entity for federal FLAS programs, or Congress. Matching federal funds with non-federal resources is required for some HEA Title VI programs, leading to additional funding support. Title VI grants attract additional funds from various sources, but questions arise about the adequacy of the HEA Title VI program. Opponents argue against increased targeting of grants for specific languages and regions, citing uncertainty in predicting future needs. They suggest relying on the initiative of institutions to propose new programs and support a wide range of languages and regions. The HEA Title VI program supports a comprehensive range of languages and regions through grants, rather than directing them through a central coordinating body. Efforts to quantify national language needs include annual surveys and reports, identifying languages and regions of major national security interest. The GAO report focused on federal agencies like the Army, State Department, Commerce's Foreign Commercial Service, and FBI, highlighting shortages of translators, interpreters, diplomats, and intelligence specialists with critical foreign language skills. These shortages have hindered various U.S. operations in military, law enforcement, intelligence, counterterrorism, and diplomatic efforts due to the changing security environment and globalization of the U.S. economy."
