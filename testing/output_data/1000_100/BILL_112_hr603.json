    "content": "The Transition toward Excellence, Achievement, and Mobility through Empowerment Act of 2011, also known as the TEAM-Empowerment Act of 2011, includes a short title and table of contents. The Act outlines individualized transition plans and transition planning services administrative units. Congress finds that evidence-based research has shown that youth with significant disabilities benefit from inclusive education, work experience, and paid work while in school, leading to better postsecondary outcomes and sustainable employment. Higher rates of self-determination and flexibility in blending government funds during the transition process also contribute to improved outcomes. The Act aims to create a holistic system for successful transition of youth with disabilities into adulthood, focusing on high expectations, equality of opportunity, self-determination, and informed choice. Agency officials providing supports during the transition process need additional training to address individual needs effectively. The Act aims to promote self-determination and informed choice for youth with disabilities, focusing on post-secondary options leading to competitive employment. It also emphasizes innovative strategies for academic, professional, and social inclusion, coordination of transition services, and collaboration among stakeholders to improve opportunities for these youth. The Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of 2000 is amended to include a new section on Individualized Transition Plans and Transition Planning Services Administrative Units under the Adult Transition System. The term 'asset development' refers to a strategy to help low-income individuals, including those with disabilities, achieve economic security through various means such as effective money management, education, home ownership, and retirement planning. 'Individualized education program' and 'integrated employment' are also defined terms in the context. The term 'ITP' refers to an individual transition plan developed under section 173, while 'local educational agency' and 'secondary school' have specific meanings as defined in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. Additionally, the term 'State intellectual and developmental disabilities agency' refers to the primary State agency responsible for such disabilities. The term 'transition services' refers to activities designed to help students move from school to post-school activities, including education, training, and employment. Transition services encompass a coordinated set of activities tailored to individual student needs, including instruction, community experiences, employment objectives, career preparation, work-based learning, youth development, self-advocacy training, family involvement, and peer mentoring. Transition services involve a coordinated set of activities focused on individual student needs, including instruction, community experiences, employment objectives, career preparation, work-based learning, self-advocacy training, family involvement, and supports. This does not include facility-based employment settings. The activities aim to achieve outcomes like post-secondary education, long-term integrated employment, asset development, independent living, and community participation. \"State assistance under SEC. 172 involves competitive grants to States for required activities. Payments are allocated based on the number of individuals to be served. SEC. 173 focuses on individualized transition plans.\" Each State receiving assistance under this subtitle must develop an individual transition plan for individuals with developmental disabilities transitioning from secondary school to adulthood. The plan aims to coordinate services for integrated employment, postsecondary education, independent living, and community engagement. The plan should be coordinated with existing transition services and developed within 30 days after exiting secondary school. The individual transition plan for individuals with developmental disabilities must be developed within 30 days after exiting secondary school and is applicable until the individual turns 26 years old. The plan should be reviewed annually, updated as needed, and developed during in-person meetings led by the State's intellectual and developmental disabilities agency, involving stakeholders such as the individual, family, transition broker, vocational rehabilitation agency, and relevant service providers. An ITP includes strategies for implementing effective service models in postsecondary education, career preparation, work-based learning, leadership development, connecting activities, and family support. The Individual Transition Plan (ITP) includes strategies for postsecondary education, career preparation, work-based learning, leadership development, connecting activities, and family involvement. It also identifies the individual's needs in various areas and outlines how the State and its agencies will meet those needs. Additionally, the plan aims to promote economic self-sufficiency through asset development goals and tools such as tax benefits, work incentives, savings plans, education financing, and budget management strategies. \"SEC. 174. TRANSITION PLANNING AND SERVICES ADMINISTRATIVE UNIT.\" Each State receiving assistance under this subtitle must establish a transition planning and services (TPS) administrative unit within the State intellectual and developmental disabilities agency. The primary focus of the TPS unit is to help individuals with developmental disabilities transition from the secondary school system to adulthood by developing and implementing individual transition plans (ITPs) and employing transition brokers. A transition broker of the TPS administrative unit facilitates coordination among State agencies in developing ITPs and provides assistance to individuals with developmental disabilities in navigating support services. Eligibility to serve as a transition broker requires possessing expertise related to individuals. Expertise required for a transition broker includes knowledge of developmental disabilities, benefits planning, transition services, employment, job development, workforce development, vocational rehabilitation, asset development, economic self-sufficiency tools, tax benefits, work incentives, savings plans, education financing, budget management, and credit strategies. The Transition Planning Services (TPS) administrative unit provides strategies for budget management, credit, self-direction, and person-centered planning. They also offer training on self-advocacy, self-determination skills, and peer mentoring for individuals with developmental disabilities and their families. The TPS administrative unit provides information and resources to individuals with developmental disabilities and their families on Federal and State services, supports, and regulations, including asset development, insurance, benefit programs, and financial savings tools. This information is updated quarterly and aims to improve self-advocacy and negotiation skills. The developmental disabilities agency in each State receiving assistance must facilitate agreements among key State agencies to coordinate and enhance services for individuals with developmental disabilities during the transition to adulthood. The Secretary must submit an annual report to Congress evaluating the implementation and effectiveness of the subtitle, including the number of individuals with Individual Transition Plans (ITPs) developed, progress in ITP objectives, and demographic information of individuals with ITPs. $50,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2012 through 2016 to carry out this subtitle."
