    "content": "SECTION 1. RELEASE OR DETENTION OF A MATERIAL WITNESS. Amendments to Title 18, Section 3144 of the United States Code allow for the arrest of a material witness if there is probable cause to believe their testimony is essential in a criminal case or before a Federal grand jury, and they have failed to appear after being served with a summons or subpoena. A judicial officer may waive the summons or subpoena requirement in certain circumstances. A warrant may be issued for a material witness if there is clear and convincing evidence that serving a summons or subpoena would result in the person fleeing or not appearing as required. The warrant must contain the witness's name or a description, specify the need for their testimony in a criminal case or grand jury proceeding, and command their arrest. A warrant for a material witness can be issued if there is evidence that a summons or subpoena would result in the person fleeing. The warrant must include the witness's name, specify the need for their testimony in a criminal case, and command their arrest. The warrant should also inform the witness of their right to counsel and be signed by a judicial officer. Upon arrest, the officer must show the warrant to the witness. If an officer does not have the warrant when arresting a material witness, they must inform the witness of the warrant's existence and purpose. Upon request, the officer should provide the warrant to the witness as soon as possible. After executing the warrant, the officer must return it to the judicial officer before whom the witness is brought. Upon arrest, a material witness must be brought before a judicial officer without delay. The initial appearance can take place in the district of arrest or an adjacent district for promptness. An unexecuted warrant can be canceled at the request of the US attorney. At the initial appearance, a judicial officer must inform a material witness of the warrant against them, their right to counsel, and allow them to consult with counsel. The witness may be released or detained as provided by procedures. Upon initial appearance, a judicial officer must inform a material witness of the warrant, their right to counsel, and allow counsel consultation. The officer can release or detain the witness as per procedures, and transfer them to another district if necessary. Upon initial appearance, a judicial officer must inform a material witness of the warrant and their right to counsel. The witness can be released on personal recognizance, an unsecured appearance bond, or conditions under section 3142(c), unless clear and convincing evidence shows they may not appear. Testimony can be secured by deposition if the witness cannot comply with release conditions. If there is no reasonable assurance of appearance, the witness may be detained after a hearing. After a hearing, a judicial officer may order the detention of a material witness for up to 5 days if no conditions will ensure their appearance. Testimony can be secured through deposition or court appearance. Extension of detention can be granted upon motion of a party. The United States Government can extend the detention of a material witness before a Federal grand jury for up to 5 days at a time, or until their testimony can be secured. The total detention period cannot exceed 30 days in a criminal case or 10 days in other cases. The detention of a material witness before a Federal grand jury can be extended for up to 10 days if their testimony is sought. A motion for extension must show good cause for why the witness couldn't be deposed or appear before the court or grand jury in the previous 5-day period. Judicial officers consider the witness's history and characteristics when deciding on release or detention. The release order must comply with specific requirements, while a detention order must also meet certain criteria, including holding a material witness separately from individuals facing criminal charges and under the least restrictive conditions possible. The Attorney General must provide an annual report to the Judiciary Committees of the Senate and House of Representatives on the use of warrants under this section, including the number sought, granted, or denied, as well as details on material witnesses arrested and reasons for their testimony not being secured. The amendment to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure requires the court to supervise the detention of defendants awaiting trial and material witnesses to eliminate unnecessary detention."
