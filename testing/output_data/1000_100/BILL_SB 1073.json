    "title": "SB 1073",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 17052 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to allow an earned income tax credit against the \"net tax\" for taxable years starting January 1, 2015. The credit amount is determined based on Section 32 of the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted by a factor specified in the annual Budget Act. The earned income tax credit is only available when resources are allocated in the annual Budget Act for oversight and auditing. The credit percentage and phaseout percentage vary based on the number of qualifying children, with corresponding earned income amounts and phaseout amounts specified. The phaseout amounts for the earned income tax credit vary based on the number of qualifying children: $3,290 for no qualifying children, $4,940 for one qualifying child, and $6,935 for two or more qualifying children. Various modifications to the Internal Revenue Code are also specified. The Internal Revenue Code is modified to increase the earned income tax credit amount to $3,400. Starting from January 1, 2016, the credit amounts will be adjusted annually. Any excess credit will be applied to other taxes owed, with the remaining balance refunded to the taxpayer from the Tax Relief and Refund Account. The Franchise Tax Board can create rules for this section, refunds will be treated like federal earned income refunds for benefit eligibility, and the Board is exempt from certain requirements for implementing the credit for the 2015 taxable year. The Franchise Tax Board is required to include the scope, costs, and schedule changes related to the California Earned Income Tax Credit in its next Special Project Report. The purpose of the credit is to reduce poverty among working families and individuals, and the Board must annually report on the number of tax returns and individuals claiming the credit. The Franchise Tax Board must report on the number of tax returns and individuals claiming the California Earned Income Tax Credit, including details such as the average credit amount, distribution by dependents and income ranges, and estimates of families lifted out of deep poverty by the credit. The Franchise Tax Board will provide a report on the California Earned Income Tax Credit to various Senate and Assembly committees. The tax credit will apply to taxable years starting from January 1, 2016."
