Adverse events can result from disruptions to CI systems, whether due to natural disasters or deliberate attacks. This report outlines key policy concerns for Congress, including defining and identifying CI, assessing CI risk, federal organization for CI, and the role of the private sector. Presidential Decision Directive 63 (PDD-63) in 1998 was the first policy guidance for critical infrastructure protection, focusing on national vulnerability to asymmetric attacks. Presidential Decision Directive 63 (PDD-63) in 1998 addressed national vulnerability to asymmetric attacks by defining critical infrastructure as essential systems for the economy and government. It set ambitious goals to eliminate vulnerability to non-traditional attacks, but assessing criticality remains challenging due to varying perspectives and values. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 defines critical infrastructure as vital systems and assets crucial to national security and economic stability, including the electricity sub-sector with its 7,000 operational power plants. The interconnectedness of the U.S. and global economies complicates efforts to identify and protect these critical assets. Critical infrastructure policy has evolved to encompass essential services and conveniences to the public, with a focus on protecting assets that impact national security and economic stability. The intelligence community is concerned about asymmetric threats from state and non-state adversaries using physical or cyber means to disrupt infrastructure and cause civilian casualties. In the post-9/11 era, critical infrastructure policy has expanded to include natural disasters and other disruptive events, not just terrorism. The definition of critical infrastructure has broadened to encompass events with disruptive effects at all levels of society. The emphasis is now on infrastructure as a key enabler of prosperity, public safety, and civic life, as outlined in the National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP) published by DHS in 2013. The policy guidance for critical infrastructure defines it as assets, systems, and networks essential for American society, considering impacts of various hazard events. Since 1998, administrations have broadened CI policy to focus on societal resilience over asset protection. In 2017, DHS designated U.S. election systems as part of the Government Facilities critical infrastructure sector. The elections systems, including physical locations and technology infrastructure, are critical components of national infrastructure sectors. These sectors are essential for supporting the nation's civic life and are part of the framework for public-private partnerships overseen by DHS. The critical infrastructure sectors, overseen by DHS, involve public-private partnerships with various federal agencies playing leading roles. Each sector has its own unique characteristics and formal coordination bodies that include private sector stakeholders and SLTT government representatives. The expanding definitions of critical infrastructure have policy implications for Congress. The definition of critical infrastructure is not consistent due to diverse perspectives and evolving interests within public and private sector communities. This diversity in definitions reflects efforts to negotiate boundaries rather than imprecision. Critical infrastructure policy encompasses two orientations: Critical infrastructure protection (CIP) focuses on identifying and safeguarding infrastructure assets based on their importance, while critical infrastructure resilience (CIR) emphasizes investing in hazard mitigation and preparedness. The foundation of critical infrastructure policy includes both Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) and Critical Infrastructure Resilience (CIR). While CIP focuses on safeguarding assets, CIR emphasizes investments in hazard mitigation and preparedness. National CI policy reflects a hybrid approach that combines elements of both CIP and CIR, leading to complexities in defining criticality and identifying critical infrastructure. This report uses the term \"critical infrastructure security\" to discuss CI policy. The report discusses critical infrastructure security, emphasizing the importance of asset identification and prioritization for protection against threats. Despite the logic behind creating asset lists, complexities arise in practice, leading to challenges in national-level asset identification and prioritization across all critical infrastructure sectors. Inventory requirements serve as the initial step in broader risk management strategies for critical infrastructure protection. The National Strategy for the Physical Protection of Critical Infrastructures and Key Assets, released in February 2003, directed the Department of Homeland Security to develop a methodology for identifying critical facilities. This was followed by Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 in December 2003. Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 (HSPD-7) in December 2003 directed federal departments to identify, prioritize, and protect critical infrastructure to prevent deliberate attacks. Despite claims of a comprehensive database in the 2006 NIPP, a DHS Inspector General report found shortcomings in the national database of critical infrastructure assets. The DHS Inspector General report found that the National Asset Database had grown rapidly from 160 key assets in 2003 to 77,069 assets in 2006, including a wide range of assets from nuclear power plants to petting zoos. The report highlighted conceptual and methodological shortcomings, with entries listing unusual assets and lacking assurance that critical assets were included. Congress later included provisions for the database in the 9-11 Commission Act of 2007. The 9-11 Commission Act of 2007 requires a national database of vital systems and a classified list of critical infrastructure assets. The Secretary determines assets that could cause catastrophic effects if disrupted. Quality control procedures ensure asset nominations meet criticality thresholds. DHS improved critical asset identification processes, but questions remain about reporting criteria and methodology. The report highlighted ongoing concerns about changes in nomination and adjudication criteria for the National Critical Infrastructure Prioritization Program (NCIPP) established by DHS to comply with the 9-11 Commission Act. Methodological adjustments were made to assess criticality based on potential adverse consequences like fatalities, economic loss, mass evacuation length, and national security impacts. Unique characteristics of critical infrastructure were considered, such as the potential second-order effects of a collapse in the U.S. financial system or disruptions to election infrastructure used in federal elections. The report highlighted concerns about the National Critical Infrastructure Prioritization Program (NCIPP) criteria and recommended an independent peer review for asset nomination vetting methods. Being listed in the NCIPP elevates an asset's national significance, impacting various government activities. The exact number of nominated assets is classified but numbers in the thousands. The 2013 GAO report found that some states were not participating in DHS data calls for the NCIPP list due to compliance burdens, technical limitations, and cost-benefit calculations. States lacked expertise to assess consequences of failure or disruption, leading to an incomplete national inventory of critical systems. DHS failed to provide documentation for statutory reporting requirements, indicating persistent difficulties in assuring completeness and quality of centralized inventories of critical infrastructure assets. The Critical Infrastructure Registry (CIR) focuses on maintaining centralized inventories of CI assets for protected status and prioritizes adaptive use of critical capabilities for service continuity during stress periods. The approach expands data collection to include all assets in a CI sector for emergency planning, utilizing the Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD) database managed by DHS, DOD, National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, and U.S. Geological Survey. The Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD) database, managed by DHS, DOD, National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, and U.S. Geological Survey, compiles data from public and private sector partners for law enforcement and emergency management use. It includes critical assets for homeland security functions and non-critical assets that may become critical in specific emergencies or policy decisions. The Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD) database, managed by various agencies, compiles data on critical and non-critical assets that may become vital in emergencies or policy decisions. For example, during the 2017 hurricane season, HHS used HIFLD to locate day care centers in impacted areas, essential for providing critical public health services. The HIFLD partnership model aims to enable relevant agencies and private sector entities to access infrastructure data easily. The HIFLD database allows private sector entities to access infrastructure data for real-world use cases, informing preparedness and incident management activities. The database contrasts with the NCIPP list by not elevating specific systems for federal oversight, but it remains relevant for inventorying critical infrastructure assets. The DHS continues to inspect and enforce regulations on high-risk chemical manufacturing facilities under CFATS. Policy shifts towards system-level resilience may impact legacy programs like NCIPP. Stakeholder participation in NCIPP may require additional appropriations or streamlining efforts to support data collection. Congress may need to update National Asset Database requirements to align with emerging CISA programs and priorities. Efforts to identify and prioritize critical infrastructure systems are crucial for understanding homeland security risks and informing resource allocation decisions. Congressional assessments of national risk inform planning, appropriations, emergency preparedness, regulatory oversight, grant funding, and security measures for critical infrastructure. DHS defines risk as the potential for unwanted outcomes from incidents, events, or occurrences, determined by likelihood and consequences. Threat, vulnerability, and consequence are the three components of risk according to DHS. Threat is defined as anything with the potential to harm life, information, operations, the environment, or property, including natural or man-made occurrences. Threat assessments consider data on human adversaries or natural hazards to estimate potential risks. Vulnerability assessments provide information about assets or systems that may be open to exploitation or damage from threats. Recommendations for resilience measures to mitigate vulnerabilities may be included. DHS defines consequence as the \"effect of an event, incident, or occurrence.\" Criticality assessments focus on potential consequences of adverse events that disrupt infrastructure systems. Various methods, including technical and non-technical, are used for these assessments. Different modeling methodologies are developed by research centers, universities, and industry groups to inform security investments. Non-technical assessments are also made by subject-matter experts and officials based on knowledge and experience. Consequence-based criticality assessments can inform risk assessments when combined with threat and vulnerability assessments. DHS has applied risk elements to planning, programs, and budget activities since 2007, using the formula R=f(TVC) where risk is a function of threat, vulnerability, and consequence. Critics question the formula's accuracy in assigning probabilities to rare events like terrorist attacks and the interdependence of its terms. DHS recognized the need for a more comprehensive risk assessment approach for critical infrastructure in 2018 and proposed revisions to the current methodology. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Act of 2018 created CISA as an operational component of DHS to manage national CI risk through the National Risk Management Center. This elevates CI risk management as a policy focus with an evolved approach emphasizing cross-sector analysis. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Act of 2018 established CISA to manage national critical infrastructure (CI) risk through the National Risk Management Center. This approach emphasizes cross-sector analysis and capabilities-oriented methods for identifying and prioritizing CI risks. Congress may request information on CISA's efforts to institutionalize new risk management approaches and ensure validation by external reviewers. Various organizations, including National Laboratories, university-based DHS Centers of Excellence, and industry research groups, can provide expertise in infrastructure risk assessment methodology. The Homeland Security Act outlines how the Secretary of Homeland Security can utilize these resources to support homeland security activities. Congress has the discretion to set funding priorities and program guidance for these organizations to enhance national CI security goals. Federal attention to critical infrastructure (CI) policy increased in the 1990s due to concerns about potential malicious exploitation of technology and physical infrastructure. The Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection was established in 1996 to address infrastructures vital to the nation's functioning. The Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection was established in 1996 to address infrastructures vital to the nation's functioning. Two years later, the Administration issued PDD-63 to eliminate vulnerabilities to cyber threats within five years. The directive focused on increasing interagency coordination through the National Coordinator for Security, Infrastructure Protection, and Counter-Terrorism. The Gilmore Commission was established in 1999 to assess terrorist threats and the implementation of PDD-63. Their report in 2000 highlighted incomplete implementation of PDD-63, underdeveloped Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs), lack of a national CIP strategy, and issues with the National Infrastructure Protection Center (NIPC). The 9/11 attacks prompted urgent national concern for homeland security and critical infrastructure protection. Two legislative tracks emerged, one favoring reestablishing the Office of Homeland Security with additional budget authorities and oversight requirements. This option followed the recommendations of the Gilmore Commission. The second legislative track favored comprehensive consolidation of government counterterrorism functions under a single federal agency named the National Homeland Security Agency, following the recommendations of the Hart-Rudman Commission. Key supporters in Congress believed that dispersing homeland security functions across various agencies left the nation vulnerable to terrorist attacks, advocating for consolidation to ensure clearer lines of authority and centralization of counterterrorism functions. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 implemented clearer lines of executive authority, centralized counterterrorism functions, and improved interagency coordination. It transferred infrastructure security functions to DHS from various sectors like business, finance, and public health. The creation of DHS was deemed high risk due to the challenges of merging numerous agencies. DHS integrated nearly three dozen federal agencies into four major directorates. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 restructured agencies into four main directorates, prioritizing homeland security missions, especially counterterrorism. The Office of Management and Budget distinguished critical infrastructure protection (CIP) as a separate but related mission due to diverse risks beyond terrorism. The 2003 OMB report to Congress highlighted the shift in budget priorities post-9/11, with increased focus on infrastructure programs related to counterterrorism efforts. Requested budget increases for FY2004 reflected the newfound importance of counterterrorism across federal departments and agencies. The White House requested $12.1 billion for FY2004, a 450% increase from pre-9/11 levels, with 28 federal entities involved in infrastructure programs. CIP and counterterrorism funding were largely merged, leading to the creation of DHS to centralize homeland security efforts. Despite the creation of DHS to centralize homeland security efforts, infrastructure security functions remained distributed among various agencies. Counterterrorism remained a focal point, but public perception of the terrorist threat had softened by 2005. The public perception of the terrorist threat softened by 2005, with terrorism no longer listed as a top concern in early 2019 Gallup surveys. The failure of the levy system after Hurricane Katrina highlighted vulnerabilities to diverse hazards beyond terrorism, leading to renewed policy concerns about critical infrastructure security. The Homeland Security Advisory Council argued for a shift towards improving the resilience of critical infrastructure, rather than solely focusing on protection from terrorist attacks. The House Committee on Homeland Security also addressed the importance of resilience in government policies and actions, leading to increased emphasis on resilience in subsequent policy documents like the 2010 Quadrennial Homeland Security Review. The first top-level DHS strategic review highlighted the diversity of missions and stakeholders in homeland security, emphasizing the importance of preventing terrorist attacks while addressing various threats such as natural disasters, cyberattacks, transnational crime, and contagious diseases. DHS plays a leadership role in managing risks to critical infrastructure and other missions related to immigration, border security, cybersecurity, and disaster response, presenting homeland security as a decentralized enterprise shared by diverse stakeholders in the public and private sector. In 2013, PPD-21 replaced HSPD-7 as the authoritative policy guidance for federal infrastructure protection, emphasizing all-hazards critical infrastructure resilience. The 2014 QHSR expanded critical infrastructure security boundaries. The 2014 QHSR expanded critical infrastructure security boundaries to include factors like aging and neglect of critical systems, making investment and maintenance homeland security concerns. DHS did not submit a QHSR to Congress in 2017, leaving no current departmental-level statement on strategic direction for infrastructure security. The boundaries of responsibility for critical infrastructure security are still being negotiated among various stakeholders. The Plum Island Animal Disease Center was transferred from USDA to DHS due to concerns about terrorist threats to the food and agriculture sector. However, in 2018, Congress authorized the transfer of a replacement facility back to USDA from DHS. Critical infrastructure security has evolved into a distributed enterprise with partnerships and policy frameworks emphasizing an all-hazards approach. Congress may need to consider the aspects of critical infrastructure security that should be under its purview. The evolving landscape of critical infrastructure security, including the distributed enterprise model and the expanding definition of homeland security, raises questions about the division of responsibilities between homeland security and other government sectors. Congress awaits a top-level strategy update from DHS, which could clarify Departmental goals and activities related to critical infrastructure security. The Quadrennial Homeland Security Review Technical Corrections Act of 2019 (H.R. 1892) reflects Congressional interest in homeland security strategy, requiring DHS to consult with advisory committees and align the strategy with budgeting and program management. Congress has also defined organizational relationships within DHS, originally formed with four main directorates. The Department of Homeland Security has evolved from a centralized directorate structure to a more federated one, emphasizing operational components. The National Protection and Programs Directorate became an agency within DHS in 2018. Congress may need to consider the organization and relationships within DHS to support critical infrastructure security. Managing critical infrastructure risk in a complex ownership and regulatory environment poses ongoing policy challenges. In a complex ownership and regulatory environment, policymakers favor the federated partnership model for critical infrastructure security. This model relies on voluntary collaboration between the public and private sectors, with CI owner-operators responsible for assessing and mitigating risks at the enterprise level. Congress directs executive branch agencies to manage risk at the national level, creating a collaborative effort between the public and private sectors through incentives, information sharing, and voluntary security investments. Private individuals or entities largely handle investments in critical infrastructure security. The private sector and government collaborate to manage critical infrastructure risks collectively. Determining responsibility for upfront costs and regulatory oversight can be challenging. The federal government relies on the private sector to develop risk management strategies for national resilience. The private sector and government collaborate to develop CI risk management strategies and mitigation investments to support national resilience goals. Government encourages industry to invest in national interest through public-private partnerships, but effectiveness varies, especially for low-probability/high-consequence events. Incentives for industry participation include improved access to risk information, national-level risk analyses, and the opportunity to influence CI policy. The private sector collaborates with the government to develop CI risk management strategies and mitigation investments. Congress reduced barriers to information sharing through the Critical Infrastructure Information Act of 2002. Public-private coordination councils provide a forum for policy discussions. A 2019 OECD report highlighted challenges in voluntary information sharing for attaining resilience targets. Regulatory mandates are favored for critical infrastructure sectors with potentially catastrophic incident impacts. Collaborative approaches are more common as risks become privatized. Policymakers aim to limit government regulation in CI security, as stated in PDD-63. The Homeland Security Act established DHS with broad responsibilities but limited regulatory mandates. Various agencies like TSA, Coast Guard, and CISA have specific regulatory roles in infrastructure security. Other federal, state, and local agencies also have regulatory authority related to infrastructure security. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) enforces safety requirements for civilian nuclear facilities, stemming from the Three Mile Island incident. Infrastructure security, including protection against deliberate attacks, falls under NRC jurisdiction, not DHS. Lessons from past experiences emphasize the importance of separating regulatory and partnership roles. DHS focuses on enhancing voluntary collaboration in infrastructure security programs. The DHS infrastructure security programs aim to enhance voluntary collaboration with partners through information sharing, analysis, training, and coordination. The current partnership structures are organized under PPD-21 and implemented through sector and cross-sector partnerships outlined in the 2013 NIPP. This approach emphasizes distributed responsibility among stakeholders for common national resilience goals. NIPP partnerships at the federal level are managed by CISA in collaboration with other DHS components and federal agencies. The NIPP framework includes 16 critical infrastructure sectors with Government Coordinating Councils (GCCs) and Sector Coordinating Councils (SCCs) for interagency coordination. DHS leads 10 GCCs as the Sector-Specific Agency (SSA), with other agencies like EPA, GSA, and departments of Agriculture, Defense, Energy, Health, Transportation, and Treasury also serving as SSAs. SSAs use NIPP partnership structures to develop sector-specific infrastructure protection plans. Sector Coordinating Councils (SCCs) are formed by private-sector trade associations and CI owner-operators to develop sector-specific infrastructure protection plans that align with the NIPP goals. SCCs analyze sector risks, interdependencies, and stakeholders to establish resilience goals and effectiveness measures. They have advisory roles with the government, facilitate coordination and information-sharing between public and private stakeholders, and may support sector-specific Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs) for enhanced information exchange. The National Council of ISACs lists 24 member organizations, maintaining operations centers and deploying representatives to NCCIC and NICC. Private-sector participation in SCC activities varies by sector. Four cross-sector councils represent key stakeholder groups. The SLTTGCC aims to enhance infrastructure resilience partnerships between jurisdictions. The Critical Infrastructure Cross-Sector Council, Regional Consortium Coordinating Council, and Federal Senior Leadership Council play key roles in coordinating cross-sector issues, sharing best practices, and forging policy consensus among federal agencies on CI risk management strategies. The FSLC, chaired by the CISA Director, exercises leadership over the other cross-sector councils. The Critical Infrastructure Partnership Advisory Council (CIPAC) facilitates discussions between CI stakeholders on sensitive topics related to infrastructure security. It provides legal exemptions for coordinating councils and member organizations to develop consensus policy advice and recommendations for DHS and other relevant agencies. CIPAC engages government and private-sector stakeholders through the NIPP partnership structure. The Homeland Security Advisory Committee (HSAC) provides advice and recommendations to the Secretary of Homeland Security on homeland security matters. Members include leaders from various sectors appointed by the Secretary. Subcommittees focus on specific issues like cybersecurity. The National Infrastructure Advisory Council advises the President and SSAs on critical infrastructure policy, serving as an intermediary between coordination councils, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the President. The National Infrastructure Advisory Council was established in 2001 to facilitate consultation between public and private sector representatives at the highest levels of government. It monitors critical infrastructure sector coordinating councils, encourages risk management practices, and promotes collaboration through various activities involving governmental and non-governmental stakeholders across different sectors. The National Infrastructure Coordinating Center (NICC) and National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) are key elements of the distributed partnership structure maintained by DHS for coordinating and sharing threat information in real-time within critical infrastructure sectors. NICC provides decision support and training to private sector partners, while NCCIC monitors and responds to cybersecurity incidents. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) administers the NICC and NCCIC, serving as a monitoring and incident response center for cybersecurity incidents. The partnership system aims to increase trust between public and private sectors to enhance industry investment in system-level resilience. Key questions include private sector collaboration, incentivizing investments in risk reduction programs, and appropriate legislative remedies. The diversity and breadth of critical infrastructure enterprise lead to varying answers on appropriate legislative remedies for risk reduction. Empirical analyses on collaboration within the voluntary framework are limited. Studies show that strong communities of interest in CI sectors are linked to specific threats and cost-benefit analysis drives private-sector risk mitigation investments. The GAO testified to Congress in 2014 about challenges in DHS partnership efforts, including barriers to sharing information, sharing assessment results, and evaluating program effectiveness. DHS did not collect data on industry participation in security surveys or measure security improvements. Absence of these measures hinders program evaluation. The GAO reported on DHS partnership challenges in 2014, highlighting the lack of data collection on industry participation and security improvements. Congress may need to assess DHS progress in implementing data gathering and analysis initiatives to evaluate the effectiveness of partnership activities in meeting critical infrastructure resilience goals. Congress may address gaps in incentivizing bidirectional information sharing and private investments in national resilience. Enhancing regulatory authorities of federal agencies may be necessary to meet CI resilience goals in cases where voluntary measures are ineffective. The Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018 is an example of expanding jurisdiction to prevent foreign adversaries from exploiting the trade system. CISA plans to maintain sector-specific public-private partnerships for information sharing and policy coordination. Congress may need to consider adjusting or replacing these structures to align with the federal risk management approach."
