    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Congressional Responsibility Act of 1995\". Its purpose is outlined in Section 2. The \"Congressional Responsibility Act of 1995\" aims to ensure that Federal regulations are only enacted by Congress, as outlined in Article I of the United States Constitution. This Act prohibits the delegation of regulatory authority to unelected officials and requires all agency regulations to be approved by Congress before taking effect. It aims to make Congress more democratic and accountable while protecting the public from regulations not endorsed by elected officials. SEC. 3. ENACTMENT OF AGENCY REGULATIONS.\n\nRegulations cannot take effect before the enactment of a bill containing the regulation's text. Agencies must submit a report to Congress with the proposed regulation text and an explanation of its basis and purpose.\n\nSEC. 4. EXPEDITED CONGRESSIONAL PROCEDURES FOR AGENCY REGULATIONS. (a) Introduction.--Within three legislative days of an agency submitting a report under section 3(b), the Majority Leader of each House of Congress must introduce a bill containing the regulation's text. If not done, any Member of that House may introduce the bill.\n(b) Bill.--A bill under this section refers to a bill in Congress that approves agency regulations as law.\n(c) Referral and Consideration.--Such bills do not need to be referred to a committee, and any Member can move for consideration. A Member can move to proceed to the consideration of a bill in Congress, with all points of order waived. The motion is privileged and not debatable, not subject to amendment, postponement, or consideration of other business. If agreed to, the respective House must immediately consider the bill without interruption. The bill shall remain the unfinished business of the respective House until disposed of. Debate on the bill and debatable motions limited to one hour, divided equally between those favoring and opposing the bill. Amendments not allowed. Appeals from Chair decisions on regulations decided without debate. Final passage of a bill must occur within 60 days of its introduction in a House of Congress. A motion to suspend certain rules can be passed by a majority vote. If both Houses have bills with the same text, the bill from the other House is not referred and is treated like other bills. The bill from the other House shall not be referred to a committee and can only be considered for final passage. The procedure for the bill in the receiving House remains the same, but the final vote will be on the bill from the other House. After the bill from the other House is dealt with, the original bill in the receiving House cannot be considered. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    Defines \"agency\" and \"regulation\" according to specific terms in the United States Code.\n\nSEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n    This Act applies to agency regulations made after its enactment.\n\nSEC. 7. JUDICIAL REVIEW.\n\n    Regulations in bills under this Act are not considered agency actions for judicial review purposes."
