    "content": "The FMLA requires covered employers to grant up to 12 workweeks of leave for various reasons including the birth or adoption of a child, caring for a family member with a serious health condition, or the employee's own health condition. Additionally, eligible employees can receive up to 26 workweeks of leave to care for a covered military servicemember with a serious injury or illness. The FMLA provides up to 12 workweeks of leave for various reasons, including caring for a family member with a serious health condition or the employee's own health condition. To be eligible, an employee must work for a covered employer, have 1,250 hours of service in the past 12 months, work at a location with 50 or more employees within 75 miles, and have worked for the employer for 12 months. Private-sector employers with 50 or more employees are covered, as well as public agencies. Public-sector employees must also meet the worksite coverage requirement to be eligible for FMLA leave. The FMLA has been amended multiple times since 1993 to cover legislative branch employees, create military family leave entitlement, and modify airline flight crew eligibility requirements. Several bills in the 114th Congress aimed to expand FMLA entitlements and modify employee eligibility requirements. Eligible employees must work for a covered employer with 50 or more employees within 75 miles of the worksite. Two bills proposed additional entitlements to FMLA leave: Parental Involvement and Family Wellness Leave. H.R. 5518 would allow eligible employees up to four hours of leave every 30 days, with a maximum of 24 hours per year for school or medical needs. Parental Involvement Leave, under H.R. 5535, allows eligible employees up to eight hours of leave every 30 days, with a maximum of 48 hours per year, to attend school conferences or activities for their child or grandchild. Employees must give a 7-day notice to their employers before taking this leave. The 114th Congress considered expanding qualifying uses of FMLA leave, including bereavement, domestic violence needs, family involvement, and medical needs related to service-connected disabilities for veterans. Eligible employees could use FMLA leave for the death of a close family member. S. 1302 / H.R. 2260 and S. 473 proposed expanding FMLA leave entitlements for the death of a close family member, including a son or daughter. S. 473 also aimed to address domestic violence needs and allow leave for family involvement in school activities. Employees could use family involvement leave for school-related activities or medical appointments for family members. The proposed bills aimed to expand FMLA leave entitlements for various family involvement purposes. Several proposals sought to expand employees' options for using FMLA leave by either expanding the set of relationships eligible for family leave or amending definitions related to the current entitlement. Currently, employees can use FMLA leave for the arrival of a new child, caring for a family member with a serious health condition, or military exigency leave. The FMLA allows employees to take leave for various reasons, including caring for a family member with a serious health condition or military exigency. Proposed legislative changes aimed to expand FMLA coverage to include caregiving for a domestic partner's new child. H.R. 5701 proposed expanding FMLA coverage to include leave for the arrival of a grandchild or adult child. Other proposed bills aimed to add additional family members for caregiving needs related to a serious health condition. H.R. 5701 and S. 473 proposed expanding FMLA coverage to include a wider range of family members for various types of leave, such as adult children, grandchildren, domestic partners, parents-in-law, siblings, and others with close relationships equivalent to family. H.R. 5701 proposed expanding FMLA coverage to include adult child, grandchild, and grandparent, broadening current definitions of son or daughter and serious health condition. This would allow for leave for children of \"any age,\" including adult children. The proposed amendments to the FMLA would broaden the definition of serious health condition to include recovery from surgery related to organ donation. The determination of a serious health condition is typically made on a case-by-case basis. The 114th Congress considered proposals to amend FMLA eligibility requirements for employees seeking leave, including H.R. 5518 which aimed to reduce the minimum requirements. Recovery from surgery related to organ donation would not automatically qualify as a serious health condition under S. 2584 and H.R. 4616. Two bills proposed changes to FMLA eligibility requirements, including reducing the minimum number of employees within 75 miles of an employee's worksite and amending the hours-of-service requirement. Additionally, new eligibility requirements were proposed for veterans with service-connected disabilities and education support professionals. The bill proposed separate eligibility requirements for veterans with service-connected disabilities, allowing them to access FMLA-protected leave with reduced employment duration and hours worked. Veterans with a disability rated at 30%-50% would need 8 months of employment and 833 hours worked, while those with a disability rated at 60% or higher would require 6 months of employment and 625 hours worked to use leave for medical care related to their disability. Employees with a service-connected disability rated at 30% or higher must provide certification from a VA medical provider or approved non-VA facility to use leave for medical needs. Veterans with a disability rated at 30%-50% at the time of retirement can access FMLA-protected leave after 8 months of employment and 833 hours worked. Employees with a service-connected disability rated at 30% or higher can access FMLA leave for medical needs after 8 months of employment and 833 hours worked. Veterans with a disability rated at 60% or higher at retirement can use leave for their service-connected disability after 6 months of employment and 625 hours worked, needing certification from the Department of Defense. This separate eligibility requirement allows new employees to access FMLA leave for service-connected disability sooner than the standard 12-month requirement. S. 3444 proposed a separate hours-of-service requirement for educational support professionals (ESP) in public schools or institutions of higher education. An ESP would be eligible for FMLA leave if they worked an average of 60 hours per month or 60% of the total monthly hours expected for their job description in the previous 12 months. The proposal suggested a separate hours-of-service requirement for educational support professionals (ESPs) in public schools or institutions of higher education, with eligibility for FMLA leave based on working an average of 60 hours per month or 60% of total monthly hours expected in the previous 12 months. The Secretary of Labor could create separate rules for calculating leave entitlement for ESPs without changing the entitlement size available to them."
