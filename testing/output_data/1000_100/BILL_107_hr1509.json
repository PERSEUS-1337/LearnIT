    "content": "The Act titled \"National Media Campaign to Prevent Underage Drinking Act of 2001\" amends the Public Health Service Act to establish a national media campaign aimed at preventing underage drinking. The Act establishes a national media campaign to reduce and prevent underage drinking in the US, administered by the Secretary through the Office of Public Health and Science. The campaign is based on scientific research on youth attitudes and underage drinking prevalence, as well as mass media prevention campaigns. The Secretary will supplement existing efforts to reduce underage drinking and coordinate with other Federal agencies. The Secretary will target the use of available funds for the national media campaign. The Secretary will allocate funds for a national media campaign focusing on prevention and treatment resources for consumers in specific geographic areas, with language-appropriate messages for minority groups. The funds will be used for advertising and campaign development. The funds allocated for a national media campaign will be used for the development of a comprehensive strategy planning document, purchase of media time and space, talent reuse payments, out-of-pocket advertising production costs, testing and evaluation of advertising, evaluation of campaign effectiveness, and negotiated fees for the winning bidder on request for proposals. Funds under subsection (e) can be used for partnerships with various groups and collaborations with the entertainment industry to create underage-drinking prevention messages in different media formats. None of the funds under subsection (e) can be used to supplant community-based efforts, pro bono public service time donated by broadcasting networks, for partisan political purposes, or for media campaigns featuring certain officials without advance notice from the Assistant Secretary for Health. The Secretary for Health must notify relevant committees before funding advertising messages with company logos. Sellers of media time must contribute 50% of the purchase price to the national media campaign. The Secretary must develop a comprehensive strategy to address underage drinking and submit annual reports to Congress. The Secretary is required to submit annual reports to Congress on the activities funded under subsection (e) and the national media campaign's performance. A progress report on the campaign's measurable outcomes must be submitted within one year of the section's enactment. The term 'underage drinking' is defined as any consumption of alcoholic beverages by individuals. The term 'underage drinking' refers to any consumption of alcohol by individuals below the legal purchasing age. Funding for this initiative is authorized for fiscal years 2002 through 2007, with a limitation of $1,000,000 for specific activities."
