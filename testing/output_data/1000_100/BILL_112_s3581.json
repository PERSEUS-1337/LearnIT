The amendment to section 45Q of the Internal Revenue Code limits the credit allowed for qualified carbon dioxide captured by carbon capture equipment at a qualified facility. The credit is limited by the national allocation and the amount of carbon dioxide captured after July 31, 2013. The national limitation for the credit on qualified carbon dioxide captured is set at 75,000,000 metric tons, with excess allocated to projects by the Secretary before July 1, 2013. The Secretary allocates credits for carbon capture projects at qualified facilities and certifies projects that receive allocations. Applicants must submit applications to the Secretary for allocations, with priority given based on the date of application submission. Priority for carbon capture project allocations is determined by the date of application submission, with earlier dates receiving higher priority. If applications are received on the same date, priority is given to those concurrently applying for certification. Priority for carbon capture project allocations is based on the date of application submission, with earlier dates given higher priority. The Secretary allocates tonnage to applicants based on the amount requested and the rank of the application until the available tonnage is exhausted. Projects with no or partial allocation retain their ranking and may receive forfeited or recaptured tonnage. The Secretary is limited in the allocation process. The Secretary may not allocate more than the projected amount of captured carbon dioxide to any project, based on a 10-year period or a written disposal contract for secure storage. The Secretary may allocate up to 15,000,000 metric tons of qualified carbon dioxide for disposal in secure geological storage, with a reduction for prior credits. No credit is allowed for carbon capture equipment before August 1, 2013. No credit is allowed for using carbon capture equipment to capture qualified carbon dioxide at a qualified facility before the project is certified. Each project allocated a portion of the national limitation must submit an application for certification to the Secretary within 6 months of receiving an allocation. The project must be certified before using carbon capture equipment to capture qualified carbon dioxide. Certification application must be submitted to the Secretary within 6 months of receiving an allocation. The construction start date is defined as the first date of significant work on the project or when 5% of the total project cost has been spent. Revocation of certification may occur for materially inaccurate information. The Secretary may revoke a certification if an applicant provides materially inaccurate information or fails to timely place carbon capture equipment in service within 5 years of receiving the allocation. The Secretary may revoke a certification if inaccurate information is provided or if carbon capture equipment is not placed in service within 5 years. If certification is revoked or a taxpayer fails to obtain certification, the allocated national limitation for the project shall be reallocated. The Secretary must publicly disclose any allocation, certification, revocation, or change in project ranking within 30 days. An annual report summarizing credits allocated and available for allocation must be issued. Conforming amendments are made to section 45Q(c) of the Code.
