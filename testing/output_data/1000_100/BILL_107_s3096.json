    "content": "The \"Ballistics, Law Assistance, and Safety Technology Act\" or the \"BLAST Act\" aims to increase public safety by assisting law enforcement in solving gun-related crimes through ballistics technology. It requires ballistics testing of all new firearms for sale and those in custody of Federal agencies to aid in identifying firearms used in crimes. Additionally, it adds ballistics testing to existing firearms enforcement programs. SEC. 3. DEFINITION OF BALLISTICS.\n\nSection 921(a) of title 18, United States Code, is amended to define ballistics as a comparative analysis of fired bullets and cartridge casings to identify the firearm used. \n\nSEC. 4. TEST FIRING AND AUTOMATED STORAGE OF BALLISTICS RECORDS. Section 923 of title 18, United States Code is amended to require licensed manufacturers or importers to test fire firearms, prepare ballistics images, store records in a database, and store fired bullet and cartridge casings as specified by the Secretary. No civil liability except for civil penalties is created by this amendment. The Attorney General and the Secretary will assist firearm manufacturers and importers in complying with requirements related to ballistics equipment, database maintenance, education on ballistics, and coordination among law enforcement agencies. The Attorney General and the Secretary will work with law enforcement agencies and the firearm industry to reduce firearm-related crime and trafficking, including implementing effective ballistics testing. They will establish a computer system for accessing ballistics records and promote training for examiners. Additionally, they will provide annual reports on the impact of these efforts to the Senate and House Judiciary Committees. The report will detail the impact of the section, including the number of criminal investigations aided by ballistics records, accessibility of such records across jurisdictions, and statistical evaluation of test programs. $20,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2001-2004 for equipment installation. The amendment mandates ballistics testing of firearms by the Secretary and the Attorney General once their systems are interoperable. $20,000,000 is allocated for equipment installation. The amendment mandates ballistics testing of firearms, with provisions for implementation timelines. SEC. 5. PRIVACY RIGHTS OF LAW ABIDING CITIZENS. Ballistics information of individual guns may not be used for prosecutorial purposes unless law enforcement has reasonable belief of a crime."
