Chapter 154 of Title 28, United States Code, introduces special habeas corpus procedures in capital cases. This chapter applies to cases under section 2254 brought by prisoners in State custody subject to a capital sentence, addressing the appointment of counsel and procedures for appointment. Chapter 154 of Title 28, United States Code, applies to cases under section 2254 brought by prisoners in State custody subject to a capital sentence. It requires States to establish a mechanism for appointing competent counsel in post-conviction proceedings for indigent prisoners with upheld capital convictions. The mechanism must offer counsel to all State prisoners under a capital sentence and provide for court orders. The court can appoint counsel for an indigent prisoner under a capital sentence if the prisoner accepts, is unable to decide, or rejects with understanding. Counsel cannot have previously represented the prisoner unless requested. The court can appoint counsel for an indigent prisoner under a capital sentence if needed, and the ineffectiveness of counsel during post-conviction proceedings will not be a ground for relief. A mandatory stay of execution can be granted upon application to the appropriate court. The court can appoint counsel for an indigent prisoner under a capital sentence if needed, and a mandatory stay of execution can be granted upon application if the State has invoked post-conviction review procedures. The stay expires if the prisoner fails to file a habeas corpus petition or if relief is denied after court reviews. The Supreme Court can dispose of a capital case without disturbing the sentence, or a State prisoner can waive habeas corpus review in front of a court. If either condition is met, no Federal court can grant relief in a capital case unless a new claim is presented. Sec. 2258 outlines the requirements for filing a habeas corpus petition, including time limits and tolling rules. The petition must show that the failure to raise the claim was due to State action, a new Federal right, or facts that could not have been discovered earlier. Additionally, the facts must be sufficient to undermine the court's confidence in the jury's determination of guilt in a death penalty case. Sec. 2258 specifies the time limits and tolling rules for filing a habeas corpus petition under section 2254. The petition must be filed within 180 days of an order issued in compliance with section 2256(c). Time requirements can be tolled in certain circumstances, such as when a State prisoner seeks review of a capital sentence. The time limits for filing a habeas corpus petition under section 2254 are specified in Sec. 2258. The petition must be filed within 180 days of an order issued in compliance with section 2256(c). Time requirements can be tolled when a State prisoner has a pending request for post-conviction review before a State court, with additional tolling possible upon a showing of good cause by the State prisoner's counsel. Sec. 2259 outlines the process for evidentiary hearings and scope of Federal review when a State prisoner files a habeas corpus petition under a capital sentence. The district court must assess the sufficiency of the evidentiary record based on claims presented in State courts, unless the prisoner demonstrates a failure to raise a claim. Tolling of time limits may occur during post-conviction review, but not during a petition for certiorari before the Supreme Court. The district court must rule on the merits of claims after conducting any necessary evidentiary hearings for habeas corpus review. The certificate of probable cause is not applicable in this process. The certificate of probable cause is not required for habeas corpus cases under this chapter, except for second or successive petitions."
