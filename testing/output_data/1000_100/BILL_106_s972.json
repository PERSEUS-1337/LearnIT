The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act is amended to designate the Lamprey River in New Hampshire as a recreational river, extending 23.5 miles from Bunker Pond Dam in Epping to the confluence with the Piscassic River near the Durham-Newmarket town line. The segment will be administered by the Secretary of the Interior through cooperative agreements. The Lamprey River in New Hampshire is designated as a recreational river under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, extending 23.5 miles. It will be managed according to the Lamprey River Management Plan through cooperative agreements with the State of New Hampshire. The Secretary of the Interior will coordinate management responsibilities for the designated segment of the Lamprey River with the Lamprey River Advisory Committee. The Lamprey River Advisory Committee, established under New Hampshire RSA 483, oversees land management in towns along the river, including zoning ordinances for conservation of shoreland, floodplains, and wetlands. These ordinances are considered to meet federal standards and requirements. The section prohibits Federal acquisition of lands by condemnation and applies to a designated segment. The Secretary's authority to acquire land is limited to donation or with the owner's consent. The Omnibus Parks and Public Lands Management Act of 1996 is amended to include additional criteria from the Lamprey River Management Plan. Section 405 of the Act is repealed."
