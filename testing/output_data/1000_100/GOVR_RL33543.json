    "content": "The report discusses the modernization of U.S. military tactical aircraft, including fighter aircraft, strike fighters, and attack planes. These aircraft are a significant part of U.S. defense capability and spending. Current modernization efforts focus on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, Air Force F-22 fighter, and Navy F/A-18E/F strike fighter programs. Key issues for Congress in FY2010 include decisions on the F-35 alternate engine program and ending F-22 procurement at 187 aircraft. The report covers key decisions for Congress in FY2010 regarding the F-22 procurement, F/A-18E/F funding request, and multiyear procurement arrangements for tactical aircraft. It also references CRS reports on the F-35, F-22, and F/A-18E/F programs. The legislative activity focuses on U.S. tactical aircraft, particularly on affordability and the future of the industrial base. Tactical aircraft are shorter-ranged combat planes that operate within a regional theater of operations. Strategic aircraft, on the other hand, are larger and longer-ranged bombers like the B-52, B-1, and B-2. Tactical aircraft, such as fighters, strike fighters, and attack planes, are designed for shorter-ranged combat missions within a regional theater of operations. Fighters are primarily for air-to-air combat, while strike fighters have dual-role capabilities in air-to-ground and air-to-air operations. Tactical aircraft, designated for air-to-ground or air-to-air operations, operate from land bases or aircraft carriers. Marine Corps aircraft can operate from Navy ships or land bases with short runways. Some Marine Corps aircraft are VSTOL or STOVL. Fighters focus on air-to-air combat for air superiority, while attack planes specialize in air-to-ground combat. The Air Force and Navy operate various types of tactical aircraft for air-to-ground and air-to-air combat operations, including F-22, F-15, F-16, A-10, and F/A-18A-F fighters and strike fighters. Marine Corps aircraft can operate from Navy ships or land bases with short runways. The U.S. tactical aircraft inventory in early 2009 included approximately 3,500 aircraft, with the Air Force having about 2,375 and the Navy and Marine Corps having about 1,125. Modernization efforts focus on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, F-22 fighter, and F/A-18E/F strike fighter programs. The F-35, known as the Lighting II, is being procured for the Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy as a fifth-generation strike fighter. The F-35 program is the DOD's largest weapon procurement program, aiming to acquire 2,456 JSFs for the Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy at an estimated cost of $246 billion. The Air Force is procuring the F-35A as a replacement for F-16s and A-10s, with procurement starting in FY2007. The F-35 program aims to acquire 2,456 JSFs for the Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy. The Air Force is replacing F-16s and A-10s with the F-35A, while the Marine Corps is getting the F-35B to replace F/A-18A-D and AV-8B Harrier. The Navy is procuring the F-35C for carrier operations. The FY2010 budget requested funding for 30 F-35s, including 10 F-35As, 16 F-35Bs, and 4 F-35Cs. The Air Force's F-22 Raptor is a fifth-generation fighter with advanced capabilities. The F-22 procurement began in FY1999, with a total of 187 aircraft procured by FY2009. The administration plans to halt procurement at 187, with no additional funding requested in FY2010. Supporters aim for 243 to 250 aircraft. The F/A-18E/F Super Hornet is a Navy strike fighter, considered a fourth-generation aircraft with some fifth-generation technology. The Navy has been procuring F/A-18E/F Super Hornets since FY1997, with a total of 449 purchased through FY2009. The administration's proposed FY2010 budget requested funding for nine more F/A-18E/Fs. Air Force officials projected a fighter shortfall of up to 800 aircraft by 2024, while Navy officials projected a strike fighter shortfall of over 100 aircraft by 2018. Some observers question these projections, citing assumptions about military threats from other countries. The Air Force announced a plan to retire 249 older tactical aircraft to generate savings for other program needs, not including five fighters proposed in the FY2010 budget submission. The projected Navy-Marine Corps strike fighter shortfall depends on assumptions about service life extensions and procurement rates of F-35Cs and F-35Bs. The Air Force plans to retire 249 older tactical aircraft, including 112 F-15 Eagles, 134 F-16 Fighting Falcons, and three A-10 Thunderbolt IIs, to fund a smaller and more capable force. This restructuring plan aims to redistribute personnel for higher priority missions and create savings for other program needs. Michael Donley proposed a plan to convert legacy fighters and F-22s into a more flexible and lethal bridge to fifth-generation fighters like the F-35. Cost savings of $355 million in FY10 and $3.5 billion over the next five years would be used to reduce capability gaps, invest in advanced modifications for remaining fighters and bombers, procure munitions for joint warfighters, and sustain critical intelligence capabilities. The Air Force is restructuring its Combat Air Forces to address modernization needs and threats. This plan involves moving manpower to priority missions like surveillance and nuclear deterrence. Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Norton Schwartz emphasizes the importance of investing in bridge capabilities and fifth-generation aircraft to maintain an advantage over potential adversaries. The Air Force is realigning its Combat Air Forces to enhance capabilities for surveillance and nuclear deterrence operations. This includes expanding aircrews for various aircraft, increasing squadron numbers, and improving information processing capabilities. Secretary Donley and General Schwartz are committed to revitalizing the nuclear enterprise and deploying 50 unmanned combat air patrols by FY11. The focus is on meeting current mission requirements while preparing for future challenges. Congress is concerned about the affordability of DOD's plans for modernizing tactical aircraft. The affordability of DOD's plans for modernizing tactical aircraft has been a long-standing concern in Congress and elsewhere. Observers fear a budget \"train wreck\" as funding may not be sufficient for acquisition plans. The issue was previously focused on the F-35, F-22, and F/A-18E/F programs, but as production of the F-22 and F/A-18E/F decreases, the focus may shift to the affordability of the F-35 program. DOD aims to increase F-35 procurement rates, with plans to reach 130 aircraft per year by 2014-2015. DOD aims to increase F-35 procurement rates, including 80 F-35As per year for the Air Force by 2015 and 50 F-35Bs and Cs for the Marine Corps and Navy by 2014. Reductions in planned aircraft acquisitions were made through post-Cold War adjustments and the Navy-Marine Corps Tactical Air Integration Plan. The F-35 program is a major initiative to reduce costs for developing, procuring, and operating U.S. tactical aircraft. The DOD aims to reduce costs for tactical aircraft through the acquisition of a strike fighter that can be procured in three common versions for the three services. However, the affordability of DOD's tactical aircraft modernization plan is uncertain, especially with potential budget constraints in the future. The projected Air Force and Navy-Marine Corps fighter shortfalls highlight the ongoing challenge of funding tactical aircraft modernization. Policymakers may need to make tough decisions if funding for these plans requires cuts to other DOD programs. Policymakers may face funding tradeoffs between tactical aircraft acquisition programs and non-aircraft systems that can perform similar missions. Some suggest shifting funding emphasis from tactical aircraft to long-range aircraft due to regional anti-access capabilities. Funding priorities are shifting towards long-range aircraft over tactical aircraft, as well as towards unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs). This reflects a larger concern about the affordability of the Department of Defense's plans for acquiring new aircraft of all types. The Department of Defense is increasing emphasis on UAVs and UCAVs for ground-attack operations, particularly for precision attacks on terrorist targets. Funding priorities are shifting towards long-range aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles, reflecting concerns about affordability. The administration's proposal to end F-22 procurement at 187 aircraft and focus on the F-35A raises questions about funding tradeoffs between different tactical aircraft models. Potential tradeoffs include upgrading older aircraft like F-15s and F-16s instead of purchasing more F-22s or F-35s, as well as extending the service life of existing F/A-18s. These decisions involve complex considerations of costs and capabilities. The potential tradeoffs between upgrading older aircraft like F-15s and F-16s, extending the service life of existing F/A-18s, and procuring F-35Cs and Bs are being studied in depth for U.S. military goals and objectives. The Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) is reviewing how to balance preparing for irregular warfare operations vs. conventional interstate conflict, including the role of tactical aircraft in these planning efforts. Some observers question the need for large quantities of high-capability tactical aircraft in the post-Cold War era. Some observers question the need for large quantities of high-capability tactical aircraft in the post-Cold War era, suggesting investments in UAVs, UCAVs, special operations helicopters, medical evacuation aircraft, and forward air controllers. Others argue that such aircraft are still necessary due to potential threats from Russian aircraft and SAMs, as well as the potential market for advanced aircraft and SAMs from European and Asian companies. The end of the Cold War did not diminish the need for advanced aircraft in high-threat areas. Concerns have been raised about China and India acquiring advanced fighter aircraft and surface-to-air missiles, potentially challenging U.S. airpower. The Government Accountability Office examined DOD's investment planning for acquiring new tactical aircraft, with plans to spend $109.3 billion on 570 new aircraft in the next 7 years. The services plan to spend $109.3 billion on acquiring 570 new tactical aircraft and modernizing operational aircraft. Cost increases, schedule delays, and changing requirements have reduced procurement quantities. The F-22A development period doubled, unit costs more than doubled, and the number of aircraft the Air Force can procure has declined. Similar issues are emerging for the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF), with increased development costs and slipping schedules. The JSF is crucial for future modernization efforts, but faces challenges in funding and delivery schedules. Legacy aircraft procurement and delivery schedules are slipping, leading to interdependent funding needs for new and legacy aircraft. Uncertainty in costs and deliveries of new systems hinders effective planning and modernization efforts. Services are investing $1.7 billion per year on legacy modifications, but billions more are needed for unfunded requirements and potential life extension programs. DOD lacks a comprehensive investment plan for modernizing fighter and attack aircraft. Each military service operates independently, leading to underperformance in delivering necessary resources. Hard decisions on retiring or extending legacy aircraft are imminent. The military services have underperformed in delivering aircraft within desired costs and quantities. Future plans may be unaffordable within projected funding levels due to unrealistic assumptions about new acquisitions and funding levels. Joint requirements have not significantly affected service plans. The GAO recommends that DOD take actions to shorten cycle times for new tactical aircraft and develop an integrated investment strategy for tactical air forces. The CBO conducted a study on fighter capabilities and costs under DOD's fiscal year 2009 plans. The CBO study compares alternative approaches for modernizing fighter forces to meet inventory requirements and increase capability with state-of-the-art aircraft. The DoD's fiscal year 2009 procurement plans for fighter aircraft show that inventories may fall below stated goals in the future, despite advancements in technology. The new aircraft offer increased payload capacity and stealth capabilities, enhancing survivability. However, the unrefueled ranges of these aircraft may not increase significantly. Overall, the new fighters are expected to provide enhanced lethality and survivability, but potential adversaries' capabilities could offset some of these improvements. Purchasing upgraded versions of legacy aircraft like the F-16 Fighting Falcon and F-15E Strike Eagle could provide short-term inventory relief and cost savings, although with lesser capability improvements compared to buying JSFs. A mix of fighters and subsonic attack aircraft would offer improved basing flexibility and persistence during air-to-ground missions. Replacing some fighters with attack aircraft could maintain air-to-ground weapons capacities. The potential use of upgraded legacy aircraft like the F-16 and F-15E could provide cost savings and inventory relief, but with lesser capability improvements compared to purchasing JSFs. Tactical aircraft modernization decisions can impact employment levels and the structure of the U.S. military aircraft manufacturing industry, which currently has two active prime contractors - Lockheed and Boeing. The production of tactical aircraft by Lockheed and Boeing may be reduced to one prime contractor (Lockheed) when F/A-18E/F and F-22 production winds down. Concerns have been raised about the potential impact on competition, innovation, pricing, schedule adherence, and production quality. Questions for Congress include the number of prime contractors needed for future military needs, the value of competition in aircraft development and procurement, and the potential for Boeing to maintain its role in the industry. The potential impact of reduced production of tactical aircraft by Lockheed and Boeing on competition, innovation, pricing, and production quality is a concern. Questions for Congress include the need for multiple prime contractors, the value of competition in aircraft development, and Boeing's ability to maintain its industry role. Legislative activity for FY2010 related to tactical aircraft modernization is discussed, with a focus on the procurement of \"4.5\"-generation aircraft such as F-15s, F-16s, and F/A-18s with upgrades. The provision requires a report on 4.5 generation fighter aircraft procurement, including the number needed for the Air Force and estimated costs for single and multiyear contracts. The potential impact of reduced production by Lockheed and Boeing on competition and innovation is a concern. The provision mandates a report on 4.5 generation fighter aircraft procurement, including the potential savings from a multiyear contract. It also discusses the availability of F-35s for Air National Guard recapitalization and recommendations for Congress on authorizing such contracts. The provision requires a report on 4.5 generation fighter aircraft with advanced capabilities and the ability to deploy advanced armaments. It also includes a report on force structure findings from the 2009 Quadrennial Defense Review. The QDR report discusses the force structure for the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps, including factors influencing decisions on fighter force capabilities, unmanned aerial vehicle inventories, and operational risks. Section 1047 prohibits the Air Force from retiring fighter aircraft until 90 days after submitting a report. SEC. 1047. COMBAT AIR FORCES RESTRUCTURING. Prohibits the retirement of fighter aircraft and reassignment of Air Force personnel until 90 days after the Air Force submits a report to Congress. The Air Force must allocate funds for the continued operation and maintenance of 249 fighter aircraft scheduled for retirement in fiscal year 2010. A report detailing plans to address force structure and capability gaps resulting from the retirement actions must be submitted to Congress. The report must include an assessment of the current threat environment, mission assignments for affected bases, criteria for base and fighter selection, environmental analyses, manpower authorizations, funding needs for 2010-2015, cost avoidance estimates, and investment plans for the remaining fighter force. Funds will be invested in the future-years defense plan to modernize the remaining fighter force and extend its service life. An exception is made for five fighter aircraft scheduled for retirement in fiscal year 2010. Congress expresses its findings on Navy carrier air wing force structure, stating the requirement for not less than 11 operational aircraft carriers and 10 carrier air wings. The Department of the Navy requires a carrier air wing to include at least 44 strike fighter aircraft. Congress believes that the naval combat forces should have no less than 10 carrier air wings with a minimum of 44 strike fighter aircraft each. The House Armed Services Committee is concerned about the Air Force's plans to retire 249 legacy fighter aircraft in fiscal year 2010, including 112 F-15s, 134 F-16s, and 3 A-10s. This could create gaps in force structure and capability as replacement aircraft are still being tested and not yet available for fielding. The committee is concerned about the Air Force's plan to retire 249 legacy fighter aircraft in fiscal year 2010. They have identified unjustified program growth and unexecutable peacetime operations totaling $344.6 million. The committee recommends using these funds for the continued operation and maintenance of the legacy fighters until follow-on missions are identified. Additionally, $10.5 million for aircraft procurement should be available for obligations. The committee recommends allocating $10.5 million for aircraft procurement to sustain 249 fighter aircraft. The Air Force projects a shortfall of approximately 800 fighter aircraft by 2024, which could impact future mission requirements. The committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force to provide a report on addressing this shortfall. The Chief of the Air National Guard and the Chief of the Air Force Reserve are required to submit a report to Congress by March 1, 2010. The report should address the \"fighter gap\" issue with alternative solutions, including accelerated procurement of fifth generation fighters, interim procurement of \"4.5 generation\" fighters, and fleet management options. It must analyze the impact of any shortfalls on the Air National Guard and the air sovereignty alert mission. The report expresses concern about the projected Navy-Marine Corps strike fighter shortfall, with a predicted peak shortfall of 312 aircraft by fiscal year 2018. Factors contributing to this shortfall include a decision to reduce F/A-18A through D inventory in fiscal year 2002. The committee is concerned about the Navy-Marine Corps strike fighter shortfall, with a peak shortfall of 312 aircraft by fiscal year 2018. Factors contributing to this include a 2002 decision to reduce F/A-18A through D inventory, delays in the F-35B/C program, and F/A-18A through D aircraft reaching service life sooner than expected. The committee supports procurement of additional F/A-18E/F aircraft to address the shortfall. The committee supports procurement of additional F/A-18E/F aircraft through a multi-year contract to address the Navy-Marine Corps strike fighter shortfall. The provision also includes maintaining a minimum of ten carrier air wings with 44 strike-fighters each. The Senate Armed Services Committee's report on the F/A-18E/F program expresses concern about the Navy facing a significant aircraft inventory gap as older F/A-18A-D Hornets retire before the F-35C variant is available. The committee recommends evaluating the costs of extending the service-life of existing aircraft versus procuring additional F/A-18E/F aircraft through a multi-year contract to address the strike fighter shortfall. The Senate Armed Services Committee is concerned about the Navy's aircraft inventory gap due to retiring older F/A-18A-D Hornets before the F-35C variant is available. The committee recommends evaluating costs of extending aircraft service-life versus procuring additional F/A-18E/F aircraft through a multi-year contract to address the strike fighter shortfall. The Navy failed to provide a report comparing single versus multiyear procurement costs as mandated by committee reports. The Navy projected a shortfall of 69 tactical aircraft in 2017, which could increase to 125 when Marine Corps requirements are included. The Chief of Naval Operations suggested the gap may be as high as 250 aircraft. The Chief of Naval Operations stated that the Department of the Navy may face a shortfall of up to 250 aircraft. The Navy's delay in addressing this issue raises concerns about national security and reliance on costly measures like the service life extension program for legacy F/A-18s. Achieving initial operational capability of the F-35C by 2015 is seen as optimistic by many observers. The Navy is considering extending the life of legacy F/A-18s to address a shortfall in carrier strike aircraft. The cost of extending the flight hours to 10,000 is estimated at $26.0 million per plane, but it is uncertain how many planes can reach this milestone. The Navy's reliance on this proposal is concerning due to possible delays and increasing costs with the Joint Strike Fighter program. The committee is concerned about the cost uncertainties of extending the life of legacy F/A-18s to 10,000 flight hours. They believe that procuring new F/A-18E/F's may be more cost-effective, with a potential cost of less than $50.0 million each. The committee suggests that the Navy should carefully evaluate the costs and benefits of new aircraft. The committee suggests that the Navy should carefully evaluate costs and benefits of new F/A-18E/F procurements compared to investing in a SLEP of legacy aircraft. New F/A-18E/F models offer improved technological capabilities over legacy F/A-18's, increasing the benefit of purchasing new aircraft. The Navy projects that the F/A-18E/F will remain in the fleet until at least 2040, with the potential to use the full service life of any newly purchased aircraft. The Department of Defense will review tactical aircraft forces in the upcoming Quadrennial Defense Review. The committee expects analysis on multiyear procurement for the F/A-18, including cost differences and tradeoffs between SLEP and new procurements. Tactical aviation procurement strategies should be informed by the Quadrennial Defense Review, with actions needed to address the strike-fighter shortfall without delay. The conference version of H.R. 2647 requires the Department of Defense to submit a report to Congress on the procurement of \"4.5\"-generation fighter aircraft. The report should include factors that informed decisions regarding fighter force structure for the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps. Additionally, the Air Force is prohibited from retiring fighter aircraft until a report is submitted to Congress. The Department of Defense must submit a report to Congress on the procurement of 4.5 generation fighter aircraft, including the number needed and estimated costs. The Air Force is prohibited from retiring fighter aircraft until the report is submitted. The Department of Defense is required to report to Congress on the procurement of 4.5 generation fighter aircraft, including estimated costs and savings from multiyear contracts. The report must also compare the benefits of annual vs. multiyear procurement contracts and discuss the feasibility of re-capitalizing the Air National Guard with F-35 aircraft. The Department of Defense is required to report to Congress on the procurement of advanced fighter aircraft like F-16 and F-18 with AESA radar, high capacity data-link, and enhanced avionics. The report must include analyses supporting force structure findings and changes in military capabilities from previous reviews. The term \"major military capabilities\" includes capabilities determined by the Secretary, those in the 2006 quadrennial defense review report, and those in section 118(d) of title 10, United States Code. Section 1075 prohibits the retirement of fighter aircraft under the Combat Air Forces restructuring plan until the Secretary of the Air Force submits a report. The Air Force is restricted from reassigning personnel associated with a restructuring plan. A report must be submitted to Congress detailing plans to address force structure gaps, assessment of threat environment, mission assignments for affected bases, criteria for base selection, environmental analyses, and manpower authorizations. The Air Force is prohibited from reassigning personnel involved in a restructuring plan. A report to Congress must outline plans to address force structure gaps, assess threat environment, mission assignments for affected bases, criteria for base selection, environmental analyses, and manpower authorizations. Additionally, there is an exception for five fighter aircraft scheduled for retirement in fiscal year 2010. In 2009, Congress submitted Section 1076 regarding carrier air wing force structure. It states that the Navy should maintain 10 carrier air wings with 44 strike-fighter aircraft per wing, in addition to the required 11 operational aircraft carriers. The conference report emphasizes the need for the Navy to maintain 10 carrier air wings with 44 strike-fighter aircraft per wing, along with 11 operational aircraft carriers. The Department of the Air Force's investment strategy aims to transition to a smaller, more flexible, and capable strike fighter force, which will be challenging. The Air Force is expected to analyze the possibility of procuring additional aircraft as needed. The conferees expect the Air Force to analyze the viability of procuring additional 4.5 generation fighter aircraft under a multiyear contract and submit a proposal to Congress if conditions under Section 2306b of title 10, United States Code, are met. The provision aims to support a multiyear purchase of F-15, F-16, and F-18 aircraft with advanced capabilities without modifying existing requirements. The House Appropriations Committee expressed concerns about the lack of detail and analysis provided to Congress regarding the Air Force's proposed combat forces restructuring plan to retire 248 legacy F-15, F-16, and A-10 aircraft. These concerns were also raised in the House-passed version of the fiscal year 2010 National Defense Authorization Act. The Committee is concerned about the Air Force proposal to remove F-15 pilot training from Tyndall Air Force Base and requests a cost benefit analysis within 180 days. The Committee requests an analysis of factors impacting F-15 training quantity and quality, including training synergies, airspace access, and simulator training access. They also ask for the identification of airfields sharing runways for Air Force and commercial operations, along with an analysis of training and operational mission impacts at bases with shared runways. The Committee requests an independent review by a Federally Funded Research and Development Center on the impact of the restructure on the Nation's combat air forces. The Secretary of the Air Force is directed to provide reports no sooner than 180 days after enactment of this Act. No funds may be obligated on executing the Combat Air Force restructure until 180 days after submission of all directed reports to the congressional defense committees. The report addresses the Navy-Marine Corps strike fighter shortfall due to high operational tempo in overseas contingencies. The Navy is facing critical shortfalls in its strike fighter inventory due to high operational tempo and delays in the introduction of the F-35 Lightning II aircraft. The shortfall is now over 200 aircraft, exceeding previous predictions of 125 aircraft. The life extension of older F-18 aircraft is proving to be more challenging than anticipated. The Navy is experiencing critical shortages in its F-18 aircraft inventory, with a shortfall of over 200 aircraft due to high operational tempo and delays in the F-35 Lightning II aircraft introduction. The reduction in F-18 purchases for fiscal year 2010 is perplexing as it goes against expectations during an aircraft shortage. The F/A-18E/F production line is still operational, producing cost-effective aircraft under a multi-year procurement strategy. The Navy is missing out on a valuable opportunity by not taking advantage of this procurement method before the F-35 delivery in significant quantities. The Navy is facing a critical shortage of F-18 aircraft due to high operational tempo and delays in the F-35 Lightning II introduction. The Committee recommends a multi-year procurement for F/A-18E/F aircraft to mitigate the shortfall and achieve cost savings. Additionally, funding is proposed for the procurement of additional F/A-18E/F aircraft to further address the strike fighter shortage. The Committee is concerned about the Navy's strike fighter shortfall due to aging F/A-18 models and delays in the F-35 program. An increase of $512,280,000 is provided to procure 9 additional F/A-18s in fiscal year 2010 to address the shortfall. The Senate approved an amendment prohibiting the Air Force during consideration of H.R. 3326. The Senate approved an amendment (S.Amdt. 2596) to prevent the Air Force from retiring any tactical aircraft until a detailed plan is submitted to address force structure and capability gaps. The report described in subsection (b) outlines a plan to address force structure and capability gaps resulting from the retirement of tactical aircraft. It includes details on follow-on missions for affected bases, criteria for base selection, personnel reassignment, cost savings from aircraft retirement, and fund allocation. The appendix presents Air Force briefing slides on the proposed combat air forces restructuring plan, including details on fund allocation and investments for the future-years defense program."
