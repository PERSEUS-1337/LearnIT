Congressional members are working to resolve these issues and move the program forward. This report details the history of UCLASS requirements development and changes over time. In 1999, the Navy and DARPA started researching unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAVs). The Navy's N-UCAV was designed for reconnaissance missions and identifying targets for manned aircraft attack waves. Northrop Grumman built the X-47A under the N-UCAV program, with its first flight in February 2003. The OSD adjusted future funding for both UCAV projects. The Defense Department directed the Navy and Air Force to merge their UCAV development efforts into a joint program called Joint Unmanned Combat Air Systems (J-UCAS) in 2003. The program aimed to demonstrate the feasibility and military value of networked high-performance unmanned air vehicles for missions like SEAD, electronic attack, precision strike, and surveillance in denied enemy territories. In 2006, the Navy initiated the N-UCAS program to develop an unmanned longer-range carrier-based aircraft with greater standoff capability and the ability to operate in denied airspace. The Navy invested over $1.4 billion in the UCAS-D program to demonstrate the feasibility of operating unmanned air combat systems from an aircraft carrier. This led to the development of the UCLASS program, aimed at addressing a capability gap in sea-based operations. The UCLASS program was developed to address a capability gap in sea-based surveillance and enhance the Navy's ability to operate in contested environments. The requirements for UCLASS were altered in 2012, favoring permissive airspace ISR capabilities over strike capabilities, possibly due to budget constraints. The Navy's decision to reduce the strike capability of the next generation carrier-based unmanned aerial vehicle was budget-driven, according to Dyke Weatherington, the Pentagon's director of unmanned warfare. Affordability was emphasized as the top priority for the program, leading to a redefinition of mission scopes to support various operations. The Navy's emphasis on affordability for the next generation carrier-based unmanned aerial vehicle led to a budget-driven decision to reduce strike capability. The development document established a affordability Key Performance Parameter (KPP) limiting the cost for one 600 nautical mile orbit to $150 million. The draft request for proposals (RFP) for the UCLASS system prioritized affordability, timely fielding, and endurance over operating in highly contested environments. The program aims to provide two intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance orbits at tactically significant ranges 24/7. The UCLASS aims to provide intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance orbits at tactically significant ranges 24/7, with a light strike capability for targets of opportunity. The design allows for capability growth to operate in contested environments, evolving to include precision strike, extended range missions, electronic warfare, tanking, and maritime domain awareness. The procurement timeline for UCLASS is unclear, with ongoing delays due to changes in requirements. The Navy now expects to award the air system contract in fiscal year 2017, a delay of around 3 years. Early operational capability is now expected in fiscal year 2022, a delay of around 2 years. The Navy's UCLASS program is facing delays, with a Milestone A review expected in fiscal year 2017, a delay of around 3 years. The program's schedule is stretching out across multiple budget years, possibly leading to further reviews and changes in requirements."
