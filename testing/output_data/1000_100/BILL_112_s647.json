    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Montana Mineral Conveyance Act\" and includes findings. Congress finds that the Secretary of the Interior has conveyed mineral rights in large coal tracts near the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation to the State of Montana. The development of these tracts and other energy resources in the surrounding areas generates significant public revenues for the State, helping to address the impacts of development on the Northern Cheyenne tribal community. The Northern Cheyenne tribal community faces economic challenges and lacks access to public services despite not benefiting from surrounding energy development revenues. The tribe has limited revenue sources to address development impacts and has filed a lawsuit against the Secretary over proposed conveyances of Federal coal tracts to the State, citing violations of Federal laws and the trust responsibility to the Tribe. The Tribe withdrew a lawsuit with prejudice based on commitments that legislation similar to this Act would be introduced to address coal development impacts. The Tribe retains claims against the United States for not acquiring mineral rights when the Reservation was expanded in 1900. The Tribe will waive legal claims against the United States for mineral rights lost when the Reservation was expanded in 1900 to the Tongue River, currently owned by Great Northern Properties. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The term \"Cheyenne tracts\" refers to a 5,000-acre land located in the eastern portion of the state within the boundaries of the Reservation, as depicted on a map dated April 7, 2010. It is comprised of specific sections and lots within the area. The term \"Federal tracts\" refers to unleased land outside the Reservation boundaries in the State, totaling approximately 5,000 acres as shown on a map dated March 18, 2011. The \"Federal Coal Land Conveyance\" dated March 18, 2011, includes specific land locations in various townships and ranges. The term \"Great Northern Properties\" refers to certain properties as defined. The term \"Great Northern Properties\" refers to the Great Northern Properties Limited Partnership and any successor ownership interest in coal or iron under the Cheyenne tracts. Other defined terms include Reservation (Northern Cheyenne Reservation), Secretary (Secretary of the Interior), State (State of Montana), and Tribe (Northern Cheyenne Tribe). SEC. 4. MINERAL RIGHTS CONVEYANCES.\n\nGreat Northern Properties will convey mineral interests to the Tribe, and in return, the Secretary will convey coal rights to Great Northern Properties. The mineral interests conveyed to the Tribe will be immune from State taxation.\n\nSEC. 5. TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF MINERAL CONVEYANCES. The Tribe waives legal claims in exchange for mineral conveyances. The Tribe and Great Northern Properties must agree on revenue sharing for coal production. Mineral conveyances must be completed within 90 days after the agreement on revenue sharing. The mineral conveyances under section 4(a) must be completed within 90 days after written notification. If any conveyance is invalidated by a court and not overturned on appeal, the Secretary or Great Northern Properties can rescind all conveyances, leading to the Tribe's waiver being rescinded. SEC. 6. ELIGIBILITY FOR OTHER FEDERAL BENEFITS.\n\nNo benefits provided to the Tribe under this Act shall affect their eligibility for any Federal services or programs due to their status as a federally recognized Indian tribe or the status of its members.\n\nSEC. 7. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\nAppropriations necessary to carry out this Act are authorized."
