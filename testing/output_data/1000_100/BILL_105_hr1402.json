    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Commission on Probabilistic Methods Act\". The Congress recognizes the wide applicability of probabilistic methods in improving efficiency and reducing overdesign in government programs. Integration of these methods in business practices has saved billions for companies, but federal use lags behind industry. Probabilistic methods offer better understanding of safety and environmental risks, leading to more business-friendly regulations if properly applied. Integrating these methods in federally funded design efforts could enhance product specifications. The appropriate use of probabilistic methods in government programs, including the Department of Transportation, could lead to more reliable and cost-effective components in the transportation system. This could benefit other federal agencies such as the Department of Defense, the Department of Commerce, and the National Institutes of Health. The Administrator of the Research and Special Programs Administration of the Department of Transportation will establish the Commission on Probabilistic Methods to improve reliability and cost-effectiveness in government programs, benefiting various federal agencies. The Commission on Probabilistic Methods will identify how these methods can benefit the Department of Transportation, assess their potential for maximizing ROI and enhancing public safety, evaluate the technology state, recommend practical techniques, establish uncertainty quantification models, identify key technology areas for development, and provide implementation guidelines. The Commission on Probabilistic Methods will recommend guidelines for implementing probabilistic technology, setting reliability levels for public safety, safety testing, creating databases, expediting technology transfer, identifying barriers, and institutionalizing probabilistic methods in Department of Transportation programs. The Commission on Probabilistic Methods will recommend guidelines for implementing technology and pilot projects for evaluation after its termination. SEC. 5. MEMBERSHIP. The Commission shall consist of 19 members, including a chairperson from an engineering society with experience in probabilistic methods, representatives from higher education, government, industry, labor, environmental community, public interest, Department of Defense, Department of Commerce, and National Institutes of Health. The Commission consists of 19 members appointed by the Administrator, serving for life without pay. Members receive travel expenses and a quorum of 10 is required for meetings, with the initial meeting to occur within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The Commission, composed of 19 members appointed by the Administrator, will hold its initial meeting within 180 days of the Act's enactment. Within 6 months of this meeting, the Commission will provide the Administrator with a written agenda for its activities. The Department of Transportation will provide administrative support to the Commission as needed. The Commission can hire experts and consultants and obtain official data from government agencies. It can also use the United States mails for its operations. SEC. 7. REPORTS.\n\nThe Commission must submit an interim report to the Administrator within 2 years of its initial meeting and a final report within 36 months. The final report will include findings, conclusions, and recommendations.\n\nSEC. 8. TERMINATION.\n\nThe Commission will end 10 days after submitting the final report. The Federal Advisory Committee Act's termination rules do not apply.\n\nSEC. 9. BUDGET ACT COMPLIANCE. SEC. 9. BUDGET ACT COMPLIANCE. Any spending authority authorized by this Act shall be effective only to such extent and in such amounts as are provided in appropriation Acts."
