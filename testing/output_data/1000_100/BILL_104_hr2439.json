    "content": "The \"State Infrastructure Banks Act of 1995\" allows states to use State infrastructure banks for financing transportation projects, providing more freedom in developing low-cost support for public-private transportation partnerships. The \"State Infrastructure Banks Act of 1995\" defines key terms such as Secretary, State, and State infrastructure bank. State infrastructure banks are created at the State or multi-State level to finance transportation projects. Congress grants consent to States to establish State infrastructure banks and enter into interstate compacts to promote regional investment in transportation infrastructure. State infrastructure banks can provide loans, issue debt, and offer assistance to entities constructing eligible transportation projects under title 23, United States Code. State infrastructure banks, established under the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991, can provide loans or assistance to public or private entities for transportation projects. The assistance may include credit enhancements, capital reserves, bond issuance costs, interest rate subsidies, and other forms of debt financing. State infrastructure banks must maintain an investment grade rating on debt issuances or have sufficient insurance. Investment income generated must be credited to the bank, available for loans to transportation projects, and invested in US Treasury securities. The State infrastructure banks must invest in United States Treasury securities, bank deposits, or other financing instruments to earn interest for transportation projects. Repayment of loans can be credited back to the bank for any purpose. Loans from the bank must bear appropriate interest and repayment should start within 5 years of project completion. The Secretary must ensure that loan repayment terms do not exceed 30 years, limit transfers to the bank, and require annual reports. Federal disbursements for capital reserves should align with historic rates, and procedures for State infrastructure banks must be specified. Under this Act, States can transfer up to 15% of Federal funds apportioned under Title 23 to a State infrastructure bank. The transfer must align with the traditional rate of disbursement for the Federal-aid highway program. The deposit of Federal apportionments into a State infrastructure bank does not create a commitment or obligation on the part of the United States. The Act allows States to transfer up to 15% of Federal funds apportioned under Title 23 to a State infrastructure bank. The deposit of Federal funds does not create a commitment or obligation on the part of the United States. State infrastructure banks are not guaranteed by the United States, and management of Federal funds under this Act is exempt from certain sections of title 31. States can contribute up to 2% of Federal funds deposited into the bank for administrative costs."
