It provides funding for research, early career grants, and establishes a new Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) for energy technology research. The America COMPETES Act authorizes programs at government agencies for research and early career grants, including the establishment of ARPA-E for energy technology research. It also includes initiatives for education, scholarships, and training programs to recruit and enhance STEM teachers, as well as student-focused STEM programs at various agencies. The America COMPETES Act includes scholarships, fellowships, and mentoring for students, new STEM education activities at ED, DOE, and NSF, a Director of Science, Engineering, and Education position, National Laboratory educational activities, and White House efforts to foster innovation and competitiveness. The Act aims to maintain economic growth and competitiveness in a global economy. In order to maintain economic growth and competitiveness in a global economy, U.S. companies must engage in trade, retain market shares, and offer high quality products and services. Scientific and technological advances play a crucial role in contributing to the creation of new goods, services, jobs, and capital, as well as increasing productivity. Various factors such as scientific advances, government activity, firm organization, and serendipity can influence technological progress. Two policy approaches have been used to address U.S. competitiveness, including direct measures like budget outlays and indirect measures such as financial incentives and legal changes. Since World War II, the United States has used direct and indirect approaches to enhance competitiveness. Concerns about competition from other economies arose in the Steelman report post-WWII. In the 1970s, experts worried about losing market share to Japan, Europe, and newly industrialized countries in various industries. Declining U.S. technological superiority was also a concern, especially in high-tech exports. The U.S. was losing its share of high-tech exports to Japan, leading to concerns about declining technological superiority. This was attributed to lower productivity growth, fewer patents granted to Americans, and a gap in R&D expenditures compared to Europe and Japan. Congress responded by passing the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980. The U.S. responded to concerns about declining technological superiority by passing key legislation such as the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980, the Bayh-Dole Act, the Federal Technology Transfer Act, the National Cooperative Research Act, and the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988. Additional actions included creating the SEMATECH consortium and providing tax credits for research and development through the Economic Recovery Tax Act and the Tax Reform Act. The Small Business Development Act also supported federal R&D funding. The U.S. responded to declining technological superiority by passing key legislation to support small firms in innovative R&D. By the mid-1990s, the economy and technological innovation improved, leading to success in industries like Internet applications and biotechnology. Today's competitiveness concerns focus on globalization and federal funding for science and engineering research. The globalization of American companies has both positive and negative impacts on the economy, workers, and families. Increasing integration with the world economy can boost productivity and living standards, but also raises concerns about job loss and lower wages due to competition with low-wage developing countries. The information technology revolution has further intensified competitiveness. The globalization of the economy, driven by technology and increased labor supply, has raised competitiveness concerns for U.S. white collar jobs. The America COMPETES Act addresses these trends by authorizing direct measures and committees to examine indirect policy mechanisms. Some believe federal funding for basic science and engineering research is insufficient. The America COMPETES Act aims to increase federal funding for basic research in physical sciences, engineering, mathematics, and computer science to drive technological progress and create new industries and jobs. It also focuses on making the U.S. labor pool more competitive globally by addressing the lack of proficiency in science and mathematics among American students. The America COMPETES Act aims to improve STEM education and increase federal funding for research in science and mathematics. It also addresses the need for more American students to pursue advanced STEM degrees. Additionally, the act authorizes actions to identify ways to enhance U.S. trade and investment policies, including studying costs faced by U.S. businesses compared to foreign competitors. Other legislative initiatives encourage industry to invest more in research and development. The America COMPETES Act aims to improve STEM education, increase federal funding for research, promote joint research activities, facilitate technology transfer, and provide incentives for quality improvements. There is debate among experts on the best actions to enhance competitiveness, with varying perspectives from domestic firms, multinational corporations, and domestic labor. The focus of competitiveness for firms is trade and the ability to compete for market share against imports or foreign firms. The U.S. trade balance in high technology products shifted from a surplus to a deficit in 2002, growing to $43.6 billion by 2005 before dropping to $38.1 billion in 2006. The U.S. trade deficit in high technology products grew from $43.6 billion in 2005 to $52.6 billion in 2007, but only increased slightly to $55.5 billion in 2008. The deficit does not necessarily mean the U.S. is losing the technology race, as many imports are from U.S. companies. However, the growing deficit may require closer policy scrutiny. Competitiveness for U.S. multinational corporations is defined by the ability of their overseas operations to compete for market share. Foreign direct investment in the United States declined after 2000 but rebounded by 2006. Domestic labor is concerned about competitiveness against foreign firms. Key measures for domestic labor are employment levels and wages. The U.S. is the largest recipient of foreign direct investment. The United States is the largest recipient of foreign direct investments and the largest investor abroad. U.S. firms invested $249 billion abroad in 2006. Concerns about displaced U.S. workers and lower wages exist, but most economists believe that direct investment abroad does not lead to fewer jobs or lower incomes overall for Americans. Determining the science and engineering workforce and the jobs created is a challenging task according to NSF analysts. The NSF identifies five categories of science and engineering occupations: computer and mathematical scientists, life scientists, physical scientists, social scientists, and engineers. However, this classification does not include all individuals with science and engineering degrees who use their knowledge in their occupations. For example, a chemist teaching high school chemistry and an engineer managing a manufacturing plant are classified as a teacher and a manager, respectively, not as part of the science and engineering workforce. Additionally, there are individuals in science- and engineering-related occupations who use their knowledge in jobs such as patent attorneys or physicians, even if they do not have degrees in science and engineering. Some also apply their science and engineering training in non-S&E occupations like writers, salesmen, financial managers, and legal professionals. The science and engineering workforce extends beyond traditional occupations, with estimates ranging from 5.0 million to 21.4 million individuals in 2006. The National Science Board suggests that the most relevant number is around 17.0 million individuals with at least one degree in a science and engineering field. This workforce includes individuals in non-S&E occupations who apply their science and engineering knowledge. The science and engineering workforce in the United States is estimated to be around 17.0 million individuals with at least one degree in a science and engineering field. This number includes those in non-S&E occupations who apply their knowledge. Various data sources provide different estimates, ranging from 5.0 million to 21.4 million individuals in 2006. Statistical analysts face challenges in accounting for the need for STEM knowledge in all workers and the impact of computerization on changing employment skills. The impact of computerization on employment skills is evident in the shift towards high-level tasks, reducing the need for routine manual and cognitive tasks. Task changes within occupations explain a significant portion of the demand shift favoring college-educated labor. The U.S. Census Bureau's analysis shows significant growth in science and engineering occupations, outpacing the overall labor force growth. STEM workforce growth in the 1990s was three times higher than the overall labor force growth. The STEM workforce has shown mixed trends, with a decline in professionals as a percentage of the employed civilian workforce since 2000. However, science and engineering occupations are projected to grow by 21.4% from 2004 to 2014, with computer-related occupations expected to drive much of this growth. Unemployment in S&E occupations was low at 1.6% in 2006, and faster-than-average growth is anticipated in various science and engineering-related fields. The compensation for STEM occupations is higher than the U.S. labor force, ranging from $53,000 to $58,000 per year. S&E bachelor's degree holders have seen a 15% increase in real salary from 1993 to 2003. Median salaries for S&E bachelor's degree holders 15-19 years after graduation are $65,000, higher than non-S&E degree holders at $49,000. The Council on Competitiveness argues that traditional measures of competitiveness do not fully capture a nation's competitiveness in STEM fields. Factors like foreign affiliate sales, global supply chains, and intangibles such as knowledge and intellectual property are not adequately considered. They suggest that assessing a nation's trade balance is less useful in today's global economy, where value is created through intangible assets. The Council on Competitiveness suggests additional measures to understand individual prosperity, such as pension funds, real estate, and healthcare benefits. They also emphasize the importance of assessing prosperity equality across society and individuals' potential to improve their prosperity. The America COMPETES Act is based on the assumption that STEM knowledge is essential for all Americans, not just those in science and engineering careers. Individuals with STEM degrees or enhanced STEM knowledge are crucial for generating enthusiasm in students, leading to a better-trained workforce. The United States needs more Americans to pursue science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields to stay competitive globally. STEM degree holders are versatile and can work in various occupations. Science and engineering research funding is vital for U.S. economic growth and competitiveness. Federal funding for basic science and engineering research in the United States is insufficient compared to other competing countries. This lack of funding hinders the nation's competitiveness in creating new industries and jobs. Studies show that American students lag behind in science and mathematics literacy compared to their international peers. The United States faces challenges in STEM education and research. Studies show that American middle school math teachers are not as well-prepared as teachers in other countries, contributing to lower scores for students. Additionally, the U.S. has a low rate of STEM degrees awarded compared to the international average. Research and development investment is crucial for economic growth, with efforts to estimate its impact on the U.S. economy. Research and development investment is crucial for U.S. economic growth. If R&D were considered as investment, it would have contributed to 5% of real GDP growth between 1959 and 2004, and 7% between 1995 and 2004. Some question the exclusive benefits of U.S. federal research programs and the impact of federal investments in STEM education. Some analysts question the necessity of actions to enhance U.S. competitiveness through STEM research and education, doubting if more scientists and engineers are needed. They also raise concerns about the quality and number of scientists and engineers in China and India. The necessity of actions to enhance U.S. competitiveness through STEM research and education is questioned by some analysts. Concerns are raised about the quality and number of scientists and engineers in China and India. Issues regarding unintended side-effects of implementation, oversupply of scientists and engineers, and proper management of funding doubling are also highlighted. Policymakers' concerns about U.S. competitiveness drive proposed direct and indirect measures, with a focus on direct measures in the act. Discussions include the need for government assistance in technologies with the greatest promise, as indicated by industry willingness to match funds. President Bush announced the American Competitiveness Initiative in January 2006 during his State of the Union address, responding to concerns about the United States' ability to compete economically with other nations in the future due to insufficient investment in science and technology research and workforce development. Supporters of indirect policy mechanisms argue that the market is better at deciding which technologies are worthy of investment, while proponents of direct measures believe indirect measures are wasteful and ineffective. The America COMPETES Act and the ACI aim to address these issues. The America COMPETES Act, a response to the American Competitiveness Initiative, includes provisions for increased research funding at NSF, NIST, and DOE Office of Science, as well as STEM education programs like Math Now and AP/IB. It also authorizes funding increases for new research organizations like ARPA-E and Discovery Science and Engineering Innovation Institutes. The act encourages executive agencies to allocate a percentage of their basic research budget to fund high-risk, high-reward projects. The America COMPETES Act authorizes increased funding for NSF, NIST, and DOE Office of Science, as well as STEM education programs. It encourages agencies to allocate a portion of their basic research budget to fund high-risk, high-reward projects, based on the National Academies' recommendation to increase long-term basic research investment by 10% annually over seven years. The National Academies committee recommends a 10% annual increase in long-term basic research funding over the next seven years, especially in physical sciences, engineering, mathematics, and information sciences. Federal funding in these fields has been stagnant for 15 years, leading to a lack of support for high-potential high-risk research. Corporations are unlikely to fill this gap as they fund little basic research due to its societal benefits and higher risk. The National Academies committee recommends a 10% annual increase in long-term basic research funding over the next seven years. The committee believes this growth rate strikes a balance between urgency and efficiency in applying new funds. The Administration has not explained why it chose a 7% annual rate for doubling research activities over 10 years, citing limited funding availability. The National Academies' 2005 report \"Rising Above the Gathering Storm\" emphasized the importance of federally funded science for economic competitiveness. It recommended increased funding for basic research in physical sciences, mathematics, and engineering, even suggesting reallocating existing funds or seeking new funds. This led to the American Competitiveness Initiative proposing to double budgets for NSF and NIST. The America COMPETES Act proposed doubling budgets for NSF, NIST, and the Department of Energy's Office of Science over ten years. It states that NASA should participate in efforts to promote innovation and economic competitiveness through research and STEM education. The act emphasizes the importance of robust funding for NASA to contribute to U.S. innovation and competitiveness. The Senate and House appropriations committees are concerned about the lack of balance in the President's FY2008 budget for NASA, with insufficient funds for important initiatives like the President's Vision for Space Exploration. A National Research Council report suggests that NASA is being asked to do too much with too little resources, calling for a reevaluation of the agency's tasks and resources. The America COMPETES Act also emphasizes the need for NASA to contribute to innovation and competitiveness. The America COMPETES Act encourages executive research agencies to allocate a percentage of funding for high-risk, high reward projects that address fundamental challenges through multidisciplinary work. This provision aims to address concerns about current funding review mechanisms not being open to new ideas. Transformative research may not fit traditional project-focused or center-based models and can face challenges in review systems dominated by experts invested in current paradigms or during budget constraints. The National Institutes of Health and NSF face challenges in funding transformative research due to reluctance in submitting radical ideas and limited budgets. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 emphasizes the need for revolutionary and cutting-edge research, but no dedicated funds are available for this purpose. The National Science Board highlights the lack of support for transformative research at NSF. The National Science Foundation is directed to review current practices supporting transformational proposals and provide reports to Appropriations Committees. $10 million of NSF's budget is designated for a new program emphasizing transformative research. The America COMPETES Act authorizes ARPA-E to enhance economic and energy security through research and development. ARPA-E aims to enhance US economic and energy security by developing technologies to reduce foreign energy imports, lower greenhouse gas emissions, improve energy efficiency, and lead in advanced energy technologies. It follows the DARPA model to promote revolutionary advances in energy technology projects that industry may not undertake due to technical and financial uncertainty. The concept for ARPA-E is based on bridging the gap between fundamental discoveries and military use. Similar initiatives have been proposed in the past, including a civilian technology agency in the 100th and 101st Congresses and recommendations for a civilian technology corporation in energy research. Presidential candidate Bill Clinton and Senator Al Gore also proposed a civilian advanced research agency for renewable technologies. The ARPA-E was created to support research on renewable technologies and fuels, with objectives to bring excitement to energy research, focus on transformational projects, maintain a nimble organization, and phase out unproductive programs. The National Academies committee proposed funding ARPA-E starting at $300 million, increasing to $1 billion per year over five to six years. They emphasized the importance of not jeopardizing basic research supported by the DOE's Office of Science. The committee suggested leaving the organization and mission details of ARPA-E to be determined by the Secretary of Energy. The America COMPETES Act directs DOE to establish multidisciplinary Discovery Science and Engineering Innovation Institutes at DOE National Laboratories to apply fundamental science and engineering discoveries to technological innovations. The institutes, along with their partners, would support research on emerging technologies critical to global competitiveness and train science and engineering students. The Institutes aim to train science and engineering students, develop educational curricula, conduct research with higher-education and industrial partners. Proponents believe it will reshape engineering research and education to address global challenges in markets, security, sustainability, and health. The America COMPETES Act authorizes new STEM education programs to recruit and enhance STEM teachers, support students in STEM education through various initiatives, and emphasize outreach and mentoring for women and minorities. It includes grants for specialty high schools in STEM education and experiential-based learning opportunities. The America COMPETES Act authorizes new STEM education programs, including grants for specialty high schools in STEM education, internships for middle and high-school students, centers of excellence in STEM education, summer institutes for teachers, a Director for STEM Education at the Department of Energy, and a graduate research fellowship program called Protecting America's Competitive Edge (PACE). Two new competitive grant programs at the Department of Education (ED) aim to enhance STEM education by offering courses leading to a baccalaureate degree with teacher certification and a master's degree program for current teachers. Additionally, Math Now program focuses on improving math instruction for elementary and middle school students, while the Advanced Placement/International Baccalaureate (AP/IB) Program aims to expand low-income students' access to AP/IB courses. The Baccalaureate (AP/IB) Program aims to increase access to AP/IB coursework for low-income students by training more high school teachers in math, science, and critical foreign languages in high-need schools. It also includes support for existing NSF programs such as the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program, Math and Science Partnerships program, STEM talent expansion program (STEP), Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program, and Graduate Research Fellowships (GRF). The America COMPETES Act programs include Graduate Research Fellowships (GRF) and Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) program for STEM education. The DOE and its National Laboratories are to manage these programs, despite opposition from the Administration on certain initiatives. The focus is on inspiring children to learn math and science at the K-12 level. The DOE emphasizes the importance of inspiring K-12 students in STEM education by providing opportunities to interact with scientists and engineers actively conducting research. Specialty schools for math and science aim to improve academic achievement in these subjects, with supporters highlighting their role in fostering excellence in math and science education. The America COMPETES Act authorizes summer internship programs at DOE. The America COMPETES Act authorizes summer internship programs at DOE national laboratories for middle and secondary school students to provide hands-on learning in STEM fields. Proponents argue that these programs significantly improve the quality of education. DOE National Laboratory Centers of Excellence in STEM education assist teachers in using laboratory equipment to teach courses in high-need public secondary schools. The Administration opposes establishing school-based centers for STEM education, believing it would divert resources from DOE national laboratories. The America COMPETES Act reauthorizes STEM programs at NSF and introduces a new program. The Administration is against increasing funding for the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program and establishing funding for the Laboratory Science Pilot program. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 addresses NSF's role in promoting quality math education. The NSF promotes quality math and science education in the U.S. by supporting research and increasing the number of qualified K-12 teachers. The Robert Noyce Scholarship program encourages STEM students to become K-12 educators. An additional $5,000,000 is allocated for the program, totaling $15,000,000. The Noyce program awards grants to STEM students to become K-12 math and science teachers. Students receive scholarships and stipends in exchange for teaching in high-need school districts. The program is based on successful models like UTeach and California Teach. The Noyce program awards grants to STEM students to become K-12 math and science teachers, emphasizing practical training and preparation for high-need fields. Universities have shifted their focus to prepare students for education careers in addition to research careers. The program also includes master K-12 classroom teachers as role models. PSM programs are designed to meet industry workforce needs by providing advanced training in science or mathematics along with workplace skills. These programs, developed with industry guidance, typically include two years of academic training, internships, and cross-training in business and communications. The NSF Laboratory Science Pilot program aims to award grants to partnerships of higher education institutions for the development of PSM programs. The NSF Laboratory Science Pilot program aims to award grants to partnerships to improve school laboratories and instrumentation for STEM instruction. It includes professional development for teachers, purchasing equipment, developing instructional programs, and implementing hands-on experiences. A National Research Council report highlighted the poor quality of laboratory experiences for most students, especially in schools with higher concentrations of non-Asian minorities and poor students. The America COMPETES Act authorizes new programs in the Department of Education to improve STEM education. The Teachers for a Competitive Tomorrow program aims to increase STEM teachers by providing grants to institutions of higher education. Math Now focuses on enhancing math instruction for teachers through research-based tools. The America COMPETES Act aims to improve math instruction for elementary and middle school students by providing teachers with research-based tools and professional development. It includes provisions for the establishment of a President's Council on Innovation and Competitiveness, chaired by the Secretary of Commerce. President Bush responded by creating a National Science and Technology Committee (NSTC) on Technology subcommittee to meet the act's requirements. Additionally, the act calls for a National Science and Technology Summit to assess the state of U.S. science. The America COMPETES Act called for a National Science and Technology Summit in 2008 to evaluate the state of U.S. science. The summit aimed to examine the health and direction of the country's science, technology, engineering, and mathematics enterprises. As a result, the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) was directed to submit an annual budget description aligning with the summit's conclusions. Additionally, the Act required the OSTP to establish principles for federal scientists to communicate and exchange data openly. In response, the Bush Administration issued a memorandum outlining core principles for the communication of scientific research results by federal civilian agencies. The Federal government emphasizes scientific openness for sharing information with the public and policymakers. NASA's communication policy serves as a model for other agencies, allowing employees to speak openly about their work. The America COMPETES Act tasks OSTP with studying barriers to scientific communication, but no action has been taken by the Bush Administration. The Bush Administration has not taken action on various innovation-related activities, including studying barriers to innovation and coordinating national research infrastructure. Dr. John Holdren was confirmed as OSTP Director in 2009, and during his nomination hearing, he highlighted the challenge of communicating scientific and technical information effectively. The OSTP faces challenges in ensuring objective science and technology advice to the President and Congress. Dr. Holdren emphasized the importance of open communication of data and results from federal agencies. The OSTP is tasked with ensuring scientific integrity in the federal government by promoting open communication of research findings and preventing suppression or distortion of data. President Obama issued a memorandum in 2009 assigning the responsibility to OSTP to develop recommendations for this purpose within 120 days. Within 120 days, the Director will develop recommendations for Presidential action to ensure scientific integrity in the executive branch, focusing on candidate selection, agency procedures, scientific process integrity, and accurate reflection of scientific information in policy decisions. Each agency should make scientific or technological findings available to the public for policy decisions, have procedures to address compromised scientific integrity, and adopt additional procedures to ensure integrity in decision-making. Each agency must inform the Director to assist in making recommendations to the President. Interim procedures may be developed to ensure scientific decision-making integrity. Funding for America COMPETES Act programs in FY2008 and FY2009 is summarized in Table 2. The Omnibus Appropriation Act and the American Investment and Recovery Act provided combined funding. The Omnibus Appropriation Act and the American Investment and Recovery Act funded America COMPETES Act programs at authorized levels. Some programs received funding below authorized levels or were not funded. For example, ARPA-E had an FY2008 authorization of $300.0 million and an FY2009 authorization for \"such sums as are necessary,\" with an FY2009 appropriation of $415.0 million. Maintaining funding levels at the authorized level in the future may pose challenges for institutions and individuals sponsored by these programs, especially in research and education. Lack of an enumerated appropriation does not necessarily mean a program is unfunded. The budget proposed by the Bush Administration for DOE in FY2009 did not align with these funding levels. The budget proposed by the Bush Administration for DOE in FY2009 did not align with the America COMPETES Act, making it challenging to determine the status of programs. The Obama Administration's FY2010 budget request also did not realign existing programs with the Act. Insufficient evidence shows that new America COMPETES Act programs are funded. The Obama Administration's FY2010 budget request for America COMPETES Act programs is under consideration by Congress. Funding levels for R&D programs are a key issue, with some programs never receiving appropriations. The question remains whether these programs will receive the necessary funding. The America COMPETES Act programs face uncertainty in receiving necessary funding beyond FY2010. The act aims to invest in innovation and improve U.S. competitiveness, but measuring success is challenging due to various influencing factors. The America COMPETES Act aims to maintain the U.S.'s top ranking in international competitiveness despite increasing science and technology investments by other countries. Evaluation mechanisms assess competitiveness using inputs, outputs, and outcomes, but there are no direct measures of innovation or competitiveness. Numerous indicators of innovation activity are available, but adding them together does not accurately assess innovation or competitiveness. Factors like necessity or serendipity also play a critical role. Evaluating the quality and value of innovation is limited and can vary depending on perspective. Increased spending on research and development does not guarantee new technologies, and innovation can occur without it due to market demand or minor product alterations. The federal government, industrial sector, and universities fund R&D and innovation. Innovation measures often focus on research and development funding without differentiation. University-industry cooperation is crucial for linking basic research and industry. Non-defense R&D analysis is important as U.S. R&D funding is largely defense-related. In analyzing industry R&D, the focus is on the nature of investment, such as funding allocation between research and development, and specific industrial sectors. Patent data may indicate innovation, but not all outcomes of R&D can be patented. The number of scientists and engineers may not fully reflect a nation's innovative capacity. The focus of government policy is to create an environment for innovation to flourish, leading to competitiveness. Monitoring and assessments are crucial for making policy adjustments. The President's Council on Innovation and Competitiveness plays a role in measuring the effectiveness of the act. The Council on Innovation and Competitiveness, comprised of key members, monitors and advises on public laws and initiatives to promote innovation. It identifies opportunities, makes recommendations for improvement, and develops metrics to measure federal progress in innovation. Specific programs like ARPA-E are evaluated by the National Academy of Sciences to assess their effectiveness. The effectiveness of federal research programs, including ARPA-E and the Discovery Science and Engineering Innovation Institutes, is evaluated by the National Academy of Sciences. White House guidelines require evaluation based on quality, relevance, and performance. Merit-based competitive processes are used to determine funding for research activities. DOE summer institutes must report to Congress on improving STEM teaching skills, increasing STEM teacher participation, and enhancing student academic achievement. Grants in the ED STEM baccalaureate degree program are also subject to evaluation. The ED STEM programs aim to increase the number of STEM teachers in schools, especially those in need, by evaluating and reporting on their effectiveness. An annual independent evaluation is conducted to assess the impact on student academic achievement, with reports submitted to relevant committees. Monitoring mechanisms are in place to evaluate U.S. competitiveness. The status of U.S. competitiveness is evaluated through various indicators such as the WEF Global Competitiveness Report and the OECD Science, Technology and Industry Scoreboard. These reports provide information on innovation, trade competitiveness, and productivity based on input and output indicators. The nation's economic competitiveness is evaluated through input and output indicators such as trade balance, foreign direct investment, employment, and wages. Various agencies like the BEA, BLS, Census Bureau, and NSF monitor these indicators regularly. The NSF releases a biannual report on science and engineering indicators, while the BEA is conducting an analysis on the contribution of R&D to GDP growth. Input indicators include the quality of education, availability of a STEM workforce, and the nation's capacity for innovation. The United States evaluates economic competitiveness through input indicators like education quality and capacity for innovation. While ranked number one overall in competitiveness, the US does not lead in all input/output indicators. Key sub-indicators include quality of education and availability of scientists/engineers. The America COMPETES Act influences various input/output indicators related to economic competitiveness, such as human capital investment, research and development inputs, and technology concentration. Different institutions use factors like high-tech jobs, R&D expenditures, and STEM degrees to assess state-level competitiveness. The America COMPETES Act influences economic competitiveness through factors like academic R&D funding and STEM degrees. New programs established by the act require subsequent appropriation acts for funding. The 110th and 111th Congress provided appropriations for various programs under the act, including DOE's ARPA-E and NSF's PSM program. Some programs received funding in FY2009, while others did not. The America COMPETES Act programs received appropriations at authorized levels in FY2009, while some newly authorized programs have yet to receive funding. Congress is deliberating on the FY2010 budget to determine if these programs will be funded to address concerns about U.S. competitiveness and the role in the global economy. This will test if investments in R&D and STEM education can enhance the U.S. competitive position. The America COMPETES Act (P.L. 110-69) originated as the 21st Century Competitiveness Act of 2007 and was passed by both the Senate and the House in 2007. It aimed to enhance U.S. competitiveness through investments in R&D and STEM education. The President signed the bill (P.L. 110-69) into law on August 9, 2007, which included several House bills related to science, technology, and education. These bills aimed to promote STEM education and research, such as the 10,000 Teachers, 10 Million Minds Science and Math Scholarship Act, the National Science Foundation Authorization Act, and the establishment of the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy. In the 110th Congress, various bills related to science and education were introduced, including the 10,000 Teachers, 10 Million Minds Science and Math Scholarship Act, the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, and the Science and Mathematics Education for Competitiveness Act. Senators Frist, Reid, and McConnell were involved in sponsoring these bills. In the 110th Congress, S. 761 was introduced by minority leaders, building on previous bills like PACE-Energy and the American Innovation and Competitiveness Act. These bills were based on recommendations from the National Academies report \"Rising Above the Gathering Storm.\" The \"Gathering Storm Report\" was a response to a request from several lawmakers. The American Innovation and Competitiveness Act bill (S. 2802/Ensign) was influenced by the Council of Competitiveness report Innovate America and the Gathering Storm report. The America COMPETES Act, also known as America Creating Opportunities to Meaningfully Promote Excellence in Technology, Education, and Science Act, includes provisions for a National Science and Technology Summit and a report on its results. The American Innovation and Competitiveness Act bill requires a report on Summit results, including R&D priorities related to the conclusions and recommendations. It also mandates a study on new forms of risk for businesses and amends the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act. The Innovation Act of 1980 is being updated to rename the National Technology Medal to the National Technology and Innovation Medal. Congress suggests promoting STEM education in schools and supporting service science through research and education. The President will establish a Council on Innovation and Competitiveness to promote innovation and competitiveness in the US. The National Academy of Sciences will recommend 50 advisors for the Council. The Director of OSTP will identify deficiencies in research facilities and coordinate planning for their acquisition and maintenance. The bill requires agencies to address deficiencies in research facilities and instrumentation through acquisition, refurbishment, and maintenance. Annual reports to Congress must detail identified deficiencies, list projects and budget proposals for instrumentation acquisitions, and explain how these projects relate to priorities. Congress emphasizes supporting innovation through high-risk basic research projects and allocating a percentage of annual basic research budgets to STEM research. The bill requires executive agencies to allocate a percentage of their annual basic research budget to fund high-risk STEM research projects. It also mandates the OSTP Director to develop principles for open communication of research findings and prevent distortion of results. NASA is required to participate in interagency efforts to promote innovation and economic competitiveness. The bill mandates executive agencies to allocate a portion of their basic research budget for high-risk STEM projects and requires NASA to participate in interagency efforts to promote innovation and economic competitiveness through R&D and STEM education. NASA Administrator must provide annual reports to Congress and the President on promotional activities and submit a plan for assessing the effectiveness of NASA's STEM education programs. Coordination with relevant programs in other departments is also required. The Joint Planning and Development Office coordinates basic research activities related to physical sciences, technology, engineering, and mathematics among various agencies. Congress recommends NASA to address aging workforce issues by documenting experiences, providing incentives for retirees to return, and recognizing outstanding senior employees. NASA is also encouraged to utilize existing undergraduate student programs.
