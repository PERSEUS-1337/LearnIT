The \"Keep Our Homes Act of 2008\" allows for a temporary deduction for qualified mortgage counseling expenses incurred by individuals, limited to $500 per year. Qualified mortgage counseling is defined as counseling provided by an organization accredited by the Federal Housing Administration before the loan is issued for the taxpayer's principal residence. The deduction for certain mortgage counseling expenses is terminated after December 31, 2012. The deduction for certain mortgage counseling expenses ends after December 31, 2012. A temporary deduction for upside-down mortgages applies to taxable years starting after December 31, 2007. In general, an individual can deduct 20 percent of the excess acquisition indebtedness on their principal residence over its valuation for real property tax assessments. The deduction is limited to $5,000 per year and is not allowed for fraudulently obtained mortgages. The deduction under section 224 allows individuals to deduct 20 percent of excess acquisition indebtedness on their principal residence, limited to $5,000 per year. This deduction is not allowed for fraudulently obtained mortgages and terminates after December 31, 2009. The amendments made by section 225 apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 2007. A new section 25E provides a credit for certain home purchases in the Internal Revenue Code. A new section 25E in the Internal Revenue Code allows a credit for individuals purchasing a qualified principal residence, equal to 10% of the purchase price or $7,500 ($9,000 in high-cost areas). The credit is divided equally over two taxable years starting in the year of purchase. The credit allowed under section 25E is limited to purchases made within 12 months after the enactment date and is subject to reduction based on modified adjusted gross income. The credit allowed under section 25E is limited based on the taxpayer's adjusted gross income for the taxable year, with a higher limit for joint returns. Modified adjusted gross income includes any excluded amounts from gross income under specific sections. The credit amount for any taxable year cannot exceed the excess of the regular tax liability. The credit allowed under section 25E is limited based on the taxpayer's adjusted gross income for the taxable year, with a higher limit for joint returns. The credit amount for any taxable year cannot exceed the excess of the regular tax liability plus the tax imposed by section 55, over the sum of the credits allowable under this subpart for the taxable year. If a credit is allowed for the purchase of a qualified principal residence, no credit shall be allowed for the purchase of any other qualified principal residence in the same taxable year. No credit is allowed under section 25E for the joint purchase of a qualified principal residence by unmarried or married individuals if any of them have claimed the credit for another residence. A qualified principal residence is defined as a residence purchased to be the purchaser's main residence, with the same meaning as in section 121. No double benefit is allowed for the credit. No credit is allowed under section 25E for the joint purchase of a qualified principal residence if a credit is already claimed under section 1400C. If a taxpayer disposes of the residence within 24 months of purchase or fails to occupy it as their main residence, the remaining credit will be disallowed in the taxable year of disposition or non-occupation. Special rules apply for joint purchases of qualified principal residences. For married individuals filing separately, the credit amount is $3,500 instead of $7,000 each. For unmarried individuals purchasing together, the credit amount is allocated among them, not exceeding $7,000 in total. The tax credit for the purchase of a residence is $7,000. Rules similar to section 1400C apply, and the basis of the residence is reduced by the amount of the credit allowed. Conforming amendments include changes to sections 24(b)(3)(B) and 25(e)(1)(C)(ii) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Internal Revenue Code is amended by inserting a new section 25E, making changes to various existing sections such as 25B, 25D, 26, 904, and 1016. Additionally, section 1400C is also amended. The amendments include adding references to section 25E in the respective sections. Section 1400C(d)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code is amended to include reference to section 25E. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections, inserting a new item after section 25D. The amendments made by section 25E apply to home purchases in taxable years after the enactment of the Act. The amendment for additional standard deduction for real property taxes applies to nonitemizers. The amendment allows for a real property tax deduction of up to $500 ($1,000 for joint filers) for taxable years 2008 and 2009. The amendment allows a deduction for eligible state and local real property taxes up to $500 ($1,000 for joint filers) for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2007.
