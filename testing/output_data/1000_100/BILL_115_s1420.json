    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Lavender Offense Victim Exoneration Act of 2017\" or the \"LOVE Act of 2017\". During the Lavender Scare in the 1950s and 1960s, over 1,000 Department of State employees were wrongfully dismissed for alleged homosexuality. The Department of State's Bureau of Diplomatic Security forced employees out based on their sexual orientation, citing security risks. Many patriotic Americans were also barred from joining the Department due to a screening process targeting individuals who appeared to be gay or lesbian. Between 1950 and 1969, the Department of State was required to report on the number of homosexuals fired each year as part of their annual appeals before Committees on Appropriations, in response to congressional investigations into alleged homosexuality among Federal employees. Congressional pressure led to the Department's actions during the Lavender Scare, where over 1,000 employees were wrongfully dismissed for alleged homosexuality. In the early 1990s, the Department of State investigated and dismissed State personnel suspected of being gay as \"security risks\". However, progress was made with prohibitions against discrimination based on sexual orientation in 1994 and 1998. Secretary of State John Kerry apologized in 2017 for the past discriminatory practices known as the \"Lavender Scare\". The Department of State acknowledges past discriminatory practices and reaffirms commitment to diversity and inclusion for all employees, including the LGBTI community. The Director General of the Foreign Service and Director of Human Resources will review employee terminations since 1950 to identify wrongful terminations based on sexual orientation. A report will be compiled within 270 days, including historical statements on policies leading to such terminations. The Secretary of State will review the consistency of Director General's reviews under section 3 and submit reports to Congress within 270 days of the Act's enactment. Additionally, a Reconciliation Board will be established. The Secretary of State will establish an independent Reconciliation Board within the Office of Civil Rights to review reports on the \"Lavender Scare\" firings. The Board will contact affected employees or their families to inform them of inappropriate terminations and offer to change their employment records. The Reconciliation Board within the Office of Civil Rights will review reports on the \"Lavender Scare\" firings, receive testimony from affected employees or their families who experienced discrimination due to sexual orientation, and provide a grievance process for former employees who believe they were terminated for the same reason. The Board will review each claim within 150 days of receiving it. The Department of State will provide necessary information for each claim to prove wrongful termination. The Board will terminate 5 years after the enactment of this Act. SEC. 6. ISSUANCE OF APOLOGY. Secretary of State Kerry apologized on January 9, 2017 for past discrimination against LGBTI employees at the State Department. He highlighted his support for the LGBTI community and efforts to promote their rights globally, including appointing a Special Envoy for the Human Rights of LGBTI Persons in 2015. The Department of State apologized for past discrimination against LGBTI employees, acknowledging wrongful actions and reaffirming commitment to diversity and inclusion. Congress also formally apologized for encouraging discriminatory policies like the \"Lavender Scare\". The Department of State faced pressure from Government Agencies and Congress regarding discriminatory policies. Establishment of permanent exhibit on the Lavender Scare. The Secretary of State will collaborate with a public-private partnership to create a permanent exhibit on the \"Lavender Scare\" at the United States Diplomacy Center. The exhibit must be installed within a year, provide access to relevant reports, and display material from oral testimonies. SEC. 8. GUIDANCE ON ISSUING VISAS.\n\nThe Secretary of State must report to Congress within 100 days on countries denying visas to Foreign Service personnel's spouses based on sexual orientation. Recommendations may include eliminating visa reciprocity with offending countries to ensure all spouses receive visas regardless of sexual orientation.\n\nSEC. 9. ESTABLISHMENT OF ADVANCEMENT BOARD. The Secretary of State will establish an Advancement Board within the Department of State to address issues faced by LGBTQI Foreign Service employees and their families. The Board will hear testimony on discrimination faced due to sexual orientation and submit reports to Congress based on the collected testimony. The Department of State aims to prevent discrimination based on sexual orientation for employees and their families. The report on this issue will be kept private and accessible only to Members of Congress, their staff, and the Advancement Board."
