    "content": "The statutory debt limit applies to federal debt held by the public and by the government's own accounts, including federal trust funds like Social Security and Medicare. Changes in debt held by the public are determined by the government's surpluses or deficits, while debt held in government accounts is affected by net financial flows and government accounting practices. Since the late 1950s, the federal government increased borrowing from the public, except in FY1969 and FY1998-FY2001. Budget deficits led to more debt issuance. Growth in government-held debt, including trust funds, has required Congress to raise the debt limit periodically. Debt limit issues since 2011 are discussed in more detail in CRS Report R43389. Since 2011, the U.S. Treasury's ability to borrow has been constrained by the debt limit, complicating financial management due to fluctuations in federal revenues and outlays. Treasury's cash management systems rely on borrowing to handle these fluctuations, which can occur on a monthly basis even in trust fund accounts that typically run surpluses. If the U.S. Treasury is unable to borrow due to the debt limit, it may struggle to meet legal obligations on time, manage cash flows, and invest surpluses in federal debt. This could hinder its ability to borrow on favorable terms in the future. The Government Accountability Office warns that delays in debt limit increases could have serious negative consequences for the Treasury market and increase borrowing costs. Defaulting on interest payments on Treasury securities could trigger a global financial crisis. Delaying payments on obligations effectively borrows from various entities, leading to interest penalties under statutes like the Prompt Payment Act and the Internal Revenue Code. The Government Accountability Office warns of serious consequences if debt limit increases are delayed, including increased borrowing costs and potential global financial crisis. Past Treasury Secretaries have used special strategies to manage cash and debt responsibilities during near-binding debt ceiling situations. Congress has authorized the Treasury Secretary to invoke a \"debt issuance suspension period\" to address funding issues. The U.S. Treasury Secretary has been authorized by Congress to use special strategies, such as tapping into the Civil Service Retirement Fund and the Thrift Savings Fund, to address funding issues during near-binding debt ceiling situations. The Treasury began selling off mortgage-backed securities in 2008 to manage debt, with the pace of sales targeted at $10 billion per month. As of March 2012, the Treasury's portfolio of MBSs has been eliminated, but proceeds from other asset sales may not be enough to maintain smooth debt management. The U.S. Treasury's potential asset sales may not be sufficient to manage debt without increasing the debt limit. Alternative strategies, such as invoking the Fourteenth Amendment or implementing imaginative solutions, have been suggested to overcome debt ceiling constraints. President Obama and legal analysts have rejected the idea of ignoring the statutory debt limit. The federal debt near its limit requires Treasury to take extraordinary measures. The debt limit allows Congress to control spending and imposes fiscal accountability. Some advocate for eliminating the debt limit. Some budget experts argue for eliminating the debt limit, stating that the modern congressional budget process established in 1974 supersedes its necessity. The Obama Administration proposed allowing debt limit increases with congressional disapproval. Committees on Appropriations handle discretionary spending, authorizing committees manage mandatory program spending, and Committees on the Budget draft the overall budget framework specifying federal spending levels. Congress has historically placed restrictions on federal debt to assert its constitutional powers of the purse, taxation, and war initiation. The form of statutory restrictions evolved into an aggregate limit between World War I and World War II, applying to nearly all federal debt outstanding. Before World War I, borrowing was authorized for specific purposes, with Congress specifying financial instruments, interest rates, and maturities. Before World War I, Congress specified details of federal borrowing, including interest rates and maturities. Some concerns were raised about the Treasury Secretary's authority to issue debt affecting monetary policies, but these became irrelevant after the establishment of the Federal Reserve System in 1913. The War Revenue Act of 1898 allowed the Treasury to use certificates of indebtedness for short-term borrowing and cash management. The 1898 War Revenue Act granted the Treasury Secretary authority to issue $100 million in short-term certificates of indebtedness and $400 million in longer-term notes and bonds. This allowed large investors, banks, and smaller investors to participate in funding the Spanish-American War costs. The act also provided administrative leeway to the Treasury Secretary, which expanded over time, as seen in the Second Liberty Bond Act of 1917. The First Liberty Bond Act authorized unused borrowing capacity and retained separate limits for previous debt issues. Subsequent borrowing measures were amendments to the Second Liberty Bond Act until 1982. Congress provided Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon with leeway to replace expensive federal debt with cheaper new issues in the 1920s. In the 1930s, Congress granted the U.S. Treasury greater flexibility in issuing bonds, allowing for more efficient management of public debt. Treasury Secretary Mellon emphasized the importance of allowing the Treasury Department to determine the type of securities to be issued without arbitrary limitations. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau later called for replacing a limit on federal borrowing. In 1935, Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau called for replacing a limit on bond issuance with a more flexible limit on the amount of outstanding bonds, emphasizing their role in managing federal finances. Congress established a $20 billion limit on shorter-term debt and a $25 billion limit on outstanding bonds. President Franklin Roosevelt and Secretary Morgenthau later asked Congress to eliminate separate limits on bonds and other types of debt, leading to the creation of an aggregate limit of $45 billion in 1939. The law (P.L. 76-201) in 1939 created the first aggregate limit of $45 billion covering public debt, combining limits on bonds and shorter-term debt. This allowed the Treasury to manage federal debt more effectively by issuing debt instruments with maturities to reduce interest costs and minimize financial risks. Legislation in 1941 increased the aggregate limit to $65 billion, giving the Treasury greater independence in managing debt on the eve of World War II. The debt limit in 1939 was $45 billion, only 10% above the total federal debt of $40.4 billion. During World War II, the debt ceiling was raised annually until it reached $300 billion in 1945. After the war, the limit was reduced to $275 billion and remained unchanged until 1954. In August 1954, a temporary increase in the debt limit was approved, followed by two more temporary increases. The limit reverted to $275 billion in July 1957, and Congress raised it in February 1958 to promote better management of money and manpower in the defense program. By March 1962, the debt limit had reached $300 billion, its level at the end of World War II. Since then, there have been 78 separate measures altering the federal debt limit, with some recent increases being significant, such as the $1.9 trillion increase in February 2010. Since FY2001, federal debt held by the public has grown due to persistent budget deficits, while debt held in government accounts has also increased. This growth is partly due to Social Security payroll taxes exceeding beneficiary payments. Federal debt held by government accounts has steadily increased since 1982, driven by Social Security tax increases and the baby boom generation entering peak earnings. Table 1 and Figure 1 display debt components as percentages of GDP from FY1996 to FY2014, with projections through FY2019. Table 2 outlines debt limit increases from 1993 to 2014. The federal government experienced deficits and surpluses in the late 1990s and early 2000s, leading to fluctuations in debt held by the public as a percentage of GDP. Accumulating debt in government accounts contributed to pressure on the debt limit in 2002. During the four fiscal years with surpluses, there was a net increase of $405 billion in total debt. Between FY2002 and May 2002, total debt subject to limit increased by $405 billion, nearing the $5,950 billion debt limit. The Administration requested Congress to raise the debt limit to $6,700 billion due to a deteriorating budget outlook and growing debt held by government accounts. In the first six months of FY2002, the Administration repeatedly asked Congress to increase the debt limit to avoid adverse financial consequences. On April 4, 2002, the Treasury suspended reinvestment of government securities in the G-Fund of the federal employees' Thrift Savings Plan to issue new debt and meet obligations. By April 15, debt subject to limit was just $25 million below the limit. After tax revenues flowed in, the Treasury restored the G-Fund and by the end of April, debt subject to limit had fallen $35 billion below the limit. By mid-May 2002, debt subject to limit had risen to within $15 million of the statutory limit. In May 2002, the Treasury faced financing problems as debt approached the statutory limit. They requested Congress to raise the debt limit to avoid default. A \"debt issuance suspension period\" was announced to manage government operations during this period. The Treasury reduced federal debt held by government accounts by replacing it with non-interest-bearing instruments to issue new debt. Without a debt limit increase by June 28, 2002, the Treasury would need to take actions to avoid breaching the ceiling, risking default. Congress took steps to increase the debt limit in May and June 2002. The House passed an appropriations bill (H.R. 4775) allowing for a potential increase in the debt limit during a House-Senate conference. The Senate's supplemental appropriations bill (S. 2551) did not include a debt limit increase, but the Senate later passed a bill (S. 2578) to raise the debt limit by $450 billion to $6,400 billion. The House narrowly passed the $450 billion debt limit increase on June 27, which was signed into law by the President. The 2002 debt limit crisis was resolved with a $450 billion increase in the debt limit signed into law on June 28, 2002. In early 2003, the Treasury requested another increase as the $6,400 billion debt limit would soon be reached. The Treasury took measures to manage debt holdings to avoid reaching the limit. The Treasury managed debt holdings to avoid reaching the debt limit in early 2003. The adoption of the FY2004 budget resolution triggered the \"Gephardt rule\" to raise the debt limit. The Senate acted on the debt-limit legislation in May after Treasury warnings of imminent default. In May, the Senate adopted legislation to raise the debt limit to $7,384 billion after rejecting eight amendments. The Treasury warned of imminent default due to reaching the limit in October, with debt just $25 million below the existing limit. Secretary of the Treasury John Snow employed methods to keep debt under the legal limit. The Treasury warned of imminent default in October as debt approached the legal limit. Secretary of the Treasury John Snow informed Congress that measures to avoid breaching the debt limit would be exhausted by mid-November, risking the government's reputation in capital markets and raising borrowing costs. Without a budget resolution passed by Congress, no resolution to raise the debt limit could be deemed passed automatically under the Gephardt rule. In November 2004, legislation was introduced to raise the debt limit by $800 billion, from $7,384 billion to $8,184 billion. The Senate approved the increase on November 17, 2004, followed by the House on November 18. The President signed the legislation into law (P.L. 108-415) on November 19, 2004. The debt limit was increased in November 2004 from $7,384 billion to $8,184 billion. The Treasury rescheduled a debt auction and canceled a \"debt limit suspension period\" due to the increase. Congress included instructions in the FY2006 budget resolution to raise the debt limit by $781 billion to $8,965 billion. The debt limit was increased to $8,965 billion with a reporting date of September 30, 2005. The Gephardt rule triggered a House Joint Resolution to raise the debt limit by $781 billion. The Senate had not considered the resolution by the end of the first session of the 109th Congress. Treasury Secretary Snow warned that the debt limit would likely be reached in mid-February 2006. In early 2006, Treasury Secretary Snow requested an increase in the debt limit to avoid reaching it by mid-March. The Senate passed a debt limit increase on March 16, and the President signed it into law on March 20, raising the limit to $8,965 billion. Congress passed a joint resolution (H.J.Res. 43, 110th Congress) raising the debt limit by $850 billion to $9,815 billion. The Treasury requested the increase in July 2007, projecting reaching the limit in October or November. The Senate approved the resolution on September 27, 2007, which the President signed on September 29. The Senate passed a measure on September 27, 2007 (P.L. 110-91) which the President signed on September 29. Financial markets showed turmoil in mid-2007, leading to a serious crisis in 2008 and a recession lasting until 2009. Federal actions were taken to stabilize housing and financial markets, including unfreezing credit markets and increasing spending to combat the economic slowdown. This resulted in large deficits and debt limit increases. The federal deficit spiked to 9.8% of GDP due to economic recession, affecting federal revenues and spending. Boosting the economy through deficit spending provides a fiscal stimulus. Deficit spending can stimulate the economy if output levels are below potential, but it can also lead to inflation if output levels are near potential. The federal deficit reached $455 billion in FY2008, exceeding estimates. The federal debt limit was raised multiple times in response to economic conditions. The House Concurrent Resolution on the Budget projected a $10,200 billion debt in FY2009. The Senate and House proposed policies in FY2009 that would result in a total debt of over $10 trillion, requiring an increase in the federal debt limit. The budget conference report passed in both chambers, but the Senate did not take up legislation to increase the debt limit, leaving it at $9.8 trillion. The House passed a bill increasing the debt limit to $10,615 billion on July 23, 2008, which was later approved by the Senate and signed by the President on July 30 (P.L. 110-289). The bill also authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to extend a line of credit to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae and created the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). On September 7, 2008, the FHFA placed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in conservatorship, giving full control over their assets and operations. The government took steps to stabilize financial markets after the deprivatization of the two entities. The U.S. Treasury proposed buying mortgage-related assets to support the housing market on September 20, 2008. The Treasury Secretary proposed buying mortgage-related assets to stabilize financial markets, with a $700 billion limit and a debt limit increase to $11,315 billion. Congress considered the proposal, leading to the passage of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, raising the debt limit to $11,315 billion. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 included provisions to raise the debt limit to $12,104 billion, amidst economic stimulus measures containing tax cuts and spending increases. The Budget for FY2010 recommended policies leading to a debt limit of $13,233 billion, triggering the Gephardt rule and a House Joint Resolution to raise the limit by $925 billion. In August 2009, Treasury warned of reaching the limit in mid-October, but later announced a postponement until December. The Treasury reduced its balance sheet by $185 billion, extending the time until reaching the debt limit. Measures such as scaling back TARP and issuing nonmarketable securities were considered to operate within the limit. The U.S. Treasury was set to issue nonmarketable securities to the FDIC and make interest payments to federal trust funds, potentially challenging debt management activities without a debt limit increase. A smaller increase in the debt limit was chosen by senior House Members to allow normal debt management operations for two months. H.R. 4314 raised the debt limit to $12,394 billion, passing in the House and Senate before being signed by the President. The Senate passed an amended version of H.J.Res. 45 to raise the debt ceiling by $1,900 billion to $14,294 billion. An amendment to impose PAYGO restrictions was approved. Some Members of Congress called for a national commission to address federal debt. An amendment to establish a Bipartisan Task Force for Responsible Fiscal Action was not approved. President Obama charged a National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform with identifying policies to improve the fiscal situation. The Fiscal Commission issued a report on December 1, 2010, and the House approved H.J.Res. 45 on February 4, forwarding the measure to the President, who signed it into law on February 12, 2010. The 2011 debt limit episode was resolved by the Budget Control Act of 2011, which reinstated statutory caps on discretionary spending and other means of constraining federal spending. U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner announced a debt issuance suspension period on May 16, 2011, after the federal debt reached its statutory limit. The federal debt reached its limit in 2011, leading to a debt issuance suspension period to extend borrowing capacity until August 2. The Treasury confirmed exhaustion of borrowing authority on July 1. Extraordinary measures may provide limited time due to a large deficit. Cutting spending was suggested to slow debt growth. The U.S. Treasury announced a suspension in reinvestment in the Exchange Stabilization Fund as a measure to avoid exceeding the debt limit. Analysts predict that without a debt limit increase, funding federal operations could become increasingly complicated. Treasury cash flows analysis projects cash inflows from August 3 onwards. Treasury projects cash inflows of $174.4 billion from August 3 onwards, $134.3 billion less than projected outflows of $306.7 billion. Uncertainties surround cash flow projections due to shifting estimates of debt limit constraints and duration of extraordinary measures. Higher individual income tax revenues and sales of mortgage-backed securities have expanded federal debt headroom. Estimates of reaching the debt limit and borrowing capacity align closely with Treasury's projections, requiring analysis of spending patterns. The Treasury Secretary planned to declare a debt issuance suspension period on May 16, 2011, unless Congress acted beforehand to extend borrowing capacity. Extraordinary measures, such as drawing down the Supplementary Financing Program, were already in place to manage monetary policy. New issuances of State and Local Government Series Treasury securities were suspended on May 6, 2011. Treasury securities were suspended on May 6, 2011. Treasury Secretary Geithner requested an increase in the debt limit in January 2011, predicting federal debt reaching its limit between March and May 2011. Despite efforts, a bill to raise the debt limit was defeated in a House vote on May 31, 2011. The Cut, Cap, and Balance Act of 2011 was passed by the House on July 19, 2011, but was later tabled by the Senate on July 22. The Budget Control Act of 2011 was signed into law by President Obama on August 2, 2011, after being approved by the House and Senate. It included provisions for deficit reduction and allowed for increases in the debt limit up to $2.4 trillion, eliminating the need for further increases until early 2013. The Budget Control Act of 2011 included provisions for deficit reduction and allowed for increases in the debt limit of up to $2.4 trillion. The legislation established discretionary spending caps, a Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, and a mechanism for raising the debt ceiling. The debt limit was raised in three steps, first by $400 billion and then by $500 billion. In September 2011, a second increase of $500 billion in the debt limit was triggered by the President's certification. The Senate rejected a disapproval measure, while the House passed one. In late December 2011, the debt limit was close to its statutory limit, prompting a provision for a third increase of $1.2 trillion. The President delayed the request to allow Congress to consider a disapproval measure. The President delayed a request for a third increase in the debt limit to allow Congress to consider a disapproval measure. The increase could have been triggered by a balanced budget amendment or recommendations from the Super Committee, but both options failed to materialize. The Select Committee could not agree on recommendations, leading to a $1.2 trillion increase in the debt limit to match budget reductions. Treasury Secretary Geithner used extraordinary measures until mid-February to mid-March 2013. The House passed a measure to suspend the debt limit until May 19, 2013, with the Senate following suit. After the Senate passed the measure on January 31, it was signed into law on February 4, allowing the U.S. Treasury to replenish funds used for federal payments. The debt limit was reset at $16,699 billion on May 20, 2013, triggering a new debt issuance suspension period declared by Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew. After stronger revenue collections and special dividends from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, Secretary Lew informed Congress that the U.S. Treasury's borrowing capacity would be exhausted no later than October 17, 2013. Congress passed a resolution on October 17, 2013, suspending the debt limit until February 8, 2014, when the U.S. Treasury reset the debt limit to $17,212 billion. After the debt limit suspension ended on February 7, 2014, Congress quickly addressed the issue by approving a measure to suspend the debt limit until March 15, 2015. The President signed the measure into law on February 15, 2014. When the suspension expired on March 16, 2015, the debt limit was reestablished at $18,113 billion. Treasury Secretary Lew then invoked extraordinary measures to extend the debt issuance suspension period until July 30, 2015, and later extended it until the end of October. Treasury Secretary Lew invoked extraordinary measures to meet federal financial obligations until the end of October. These measures would be exhausted by November 3, 2015, with a small cash reserve of less than $30 billion on hand. Lower tax collections and higher trust fund investments reduced the Treasury's headroom more than expected, pushing the exhaustion date closer to mid-November. In early December 2015, estimates suggested a debt limit reset on March 16, 2017, due to a Bipartisan Budget Agreement released on October 26, 2015. The agreement also increased discretionary spending caps for FY2016 and FY2017. On October 28, 2015, the House approved Senate amendments to H.R. 1314. The House concurred with Senate amendments to H.R. 1314, known as the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015. The President signed the modified version into law on November 2, 2015. The federal government had budget surpluses from FY1998 to FY2001, but deficits increased due to higher military and security spending post-9/11. The financial crisis of 2007-2009 and subsequent recession led to large federal deficits, necessitating debt limit increases. Fiscal issues became less prominent after the 2011 debt limit episode, with federal deficits decreasing as economic recovery progressed. For example, the FY2015 deficit was 2.5% of GDP compared to 9.8% in FY2009. The FY2015 federal deficit was 2.5% of GDP, lower than the FY2009 deficit of 9.8%. Despite slower growth in federal health program costs and net interest expenses, persistent deficits could significantly increase federal debt over the next decade. CBO warns that current borrowing trajectory is unsustainable and could hinder economic growth in the long run. Without policy changes, Congress may need to raise the debt limit repeatedly to meet financial obligations. The table displays the monthly changes in federal debt from September 2001 to September 2015. Total federal debt increased by $12,380 billion, with debt held by government accounts rising by $2,566 billion and debt held by the public increasing by $9,813 billion. Despite occasional reductions, all three debt measures showed an overall increasing trend. Before the United States entered World War II, major debt measures showed an overall increasing trend."
