    "content": "The amendment to Section 233(e) of the Act allows agreements to enter into force after 60 days of transmittal to Congress, excluding certain days. Documents related to the agreement must be delivered to both Houses of Congress on the same day. The agreement must be delivered to the Clerk of the House of Representatives or the Secretary of the Senate if the respective House is not in session. The document must include a determination by the Chief Actuary of the Social Security Administration on the impact of the agreement on the actuarial balance of the social security system over a 75-year period. The term 'actuarial balance' is defined as the difference between the adjusted summarized income rate and cost rate over a period. 'Taxable payroll' refers to total wages and self-employment income for a period. 'Adjusted summarized income rate' is the ratio of trust fund balance plus total income to taxable payroll. 'Adjusted summarized cost rate' is the ratio of total cost to taxable payroll over a period. The term 'trust fund balance' refers to the combined balance of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund. 'Income from taxes' is the amounts deposited in the Trust Funds based on taxes under specific sections of the Internal Revenue Code. 'Cost' during a period is the total expenses incurred. The term 'cost' refers to disbursements from the Trust Funds during a period, including benefit payments, administrative expenses, and payments for vocational rehabilitation services. The term 'target trust fund balance' is the desired balance of the Trust Funds. The \"target trust fund balance\" is the balance needed at the end of a 75-year period to maintain a 100 percent trust fund ratio. The Chief Actuary uses specific assumptions for calculations. Agreements must be approved within 60 days to take effect. The Chief Actuary's determination on agreements under this section must show a net reduction in the actuarial balance of the social security system over a 75-year period. If the reduction is at least 0.005 percent of the present value of taxable payroll, the agreement needs approval by Congress within 60 days to take effect. Congress has the power to establish rules for disapproval and approval resolutions, which supersede other rules if inconsistent. Each House can change its rules regarding procedures at any time. Within 60 days, Congress must approve agreements that reduce the social security system's actuarial balance by at least 0.005 percent of the present value of taxable payroll. The Congress has the authority to consider bills for the approval or disapproval of agreements under specific conditions. The amendment applies to totalization arrangements transmitted to Congress after the enactment of the Act. The Act specifies a special rule for totalization arrangements between the US and other countries signed before the enactment of the Act. These agreements will not enter into force as of the Act's enactment date. The Act specifies that totalization agreements signed before its enactment will enter into force only after meeting certain requirements, including the submission of a report to Congress. Additionally, biennial reports on the ongoing operation of these agreements will be provided to Congress. \"Biennial Oversight Reports on totalization agreements are submitted to Congress for review.\" The Commissioner of Social Security submits biennial reports to Congress evaluating totalization agreements, including changes in benefit costs and contributions, as well as information on fraudulent receipt of benefits. The Commissioner of Social Security submits biennial reports to Congress evaluating totalization agreements, including information on potential fraudulent receipt of benefits, problems with data integrity, and demographic trends affecting costs. The initial report must be submitted by December 31, 2008. SEC. 203. SUSPENSION OF BENEFITS FOR INDIVIDUALS REMOVED FROM THE UNITED STATES. Section 202(n)(1) of the Social Security Act is amended to state that no lump sum death payment will be made to an individual after being notified of their removal from the United States by the Commissioner of Social Security, Attorney General, or Secretary of Homeland Security. These amendments apply to individuals who have been removed from the United States. The Commissioner of Social Security receives notification from the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security after the twelfth month following the enactment of this Act."
