    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Facilitating Access to Speedy Transmissions for Networks, E-commerce and Telecommunications (FASTNET) Act.\" It includes findings and purpose statements. Congress finds that the Telecommunications Act of 1996 aimed to promote competition and reduce regulation in telecommunications markets to deploy advanced technologies nationwide. The Act recognized the unique position of local exchange carriers with fewer than two percent of the Nation's subscriber lines, enabling them to accelerate the deployment of advanced services in less densely populated regions. Reducing regulatory burdens on two percent carriers will enable them to deploy advanced services and competitive initiatives in less densely populated regions, benefiting consumers in the Nation. This will also increase their ability to respond to marketplace conditions and accelerate the deployment of advanced services. The Act aims to accelerate the deployment of advanced services and promote competition in the telecommunications industry for the benefit of consumers nationwide. It reduces regulatory burdens on local exchange carriers with less than two percent of the Nation's subscriber lines, allowing them to redirect resources towards increasing investment in initiatives. The Communications Act of 1934 is amended to define a \"two percent carrier\" as an incumbent local exchange carrier with fewer than two percent of the Nation's subscriber lines. Regulatory relief is provided for these carriers to promote competition and investment in telecommunications services. The Communications Act of 1934 is amended to define a \"two percent carrier\" as an incumbent local exchange carrier with fewer than two percent of the Nation's subscriber lines. Regulatory relief is provided for these carriers to promote competition and investment in telecommunications services. Reduced regulatory requirements for two percent carriers are outlined in Section 281. The Commission must consider the impact of regulatory requirements on two percent carriers when adopting rules for incumbent local exchange carriers. If the Commission fails to do so, the rule cannot be enforced on two percent carriers until a separate evaluation is conducted. This does not apply if the rules adopted do not pertain to two percent carriers. The section includes a savings clause stating that size-based differentiation among carriers is allowed. The effective date of the section applies to rules adopted after its enactment. SEC. 282 limits reporting requirements for two percent carriers, exempting them from filing cost allocation manuals or ARMIS reports, except for section 224. SEC. 283 addresses the integrated operation of two percent carriers. SEC. 283 states that the Commission cannot require a two percent carrier to have a separate affiliate for various services. It also mentions that carriers and their affiliates do not need to maintain separate personnel, facilities, or operations. The text discusses the options available to a two percent carrier regarding participation in common line tariffs and price cap regulation. The carrier can choose to participate or withdraw from participation in the common line tariff for specific study areas with a 60-day notice requirement. Additionally, the carrier can elect to be regulated under price cap rate regulation for one or more study areas. The Commission allows a carrier to withdraw from regulation for specific study areas with a 60-day notice. A carrier can elect to be regulated under price cap rate regulation for one or more study areas, with the election binding for one year. The Commission permits two percent carriers to introduce new interstate telecommunications services with only one day's notice, without needing approval for rate structures. This allows carriers to offer a wider range of service options to ratepayers. Additionally, the entry of competing carriers is addressed in the following section. (a) Pricing Flexibility.--A two percent carrier can de-average its interstate switched or special access rates, file tariffs with one day's notice, and file contract-based tariffs immediately upon certification of competition in its service area. Rate-of-return regulation will be based on the nondiscounted rate for services with pricing flexibility. The text discusses the regulation of a two percent carrier engaged in facilities-based entry within a service area. The carrier may participate in a common line tariff and certain definitions apply to this regulation. The text defines \"facilities-based entry\" and \"contract-based tariff\" for a two percent carrier within a service area. Facilities-based entry involves providing local telephone exchange switching and service to at least one unaffiliated customer. A contract-based tariff is based on a service contract with customers and includes details such as the contract term and service descriptions. The curr_chunk provides details on contract terms, including minimum volume commitments, contract prices, volume discounts, and other regulations. The term \"service area\" is defined in line with section 214(e)(5). The curr_chunk outlines savings provisions related to the authority of the Commission, rights of rural telephone companies, and state authority. It also includes a limitation on merger review. The curr_chunk introduces an amendment to the Communications Act of 1934 regarding the deadline for making public interest determinations in mergers involving two percent carriers. The Commission must make determinations within 60 days of receiving an application for such mergers or acquisitions. The amendment to the Communications Act of 1934 sets a deadline for the Commission to approve or deny applications for mergers involving two percent carriers. If no action is taken within the specified period, the application is deemed approved without conditions. The Commission must allow a carrier to make an election regarding local exchange facilities acquired through a merger. This provision applies to applications submitted after the enactment of the Act. The Commission must approve or deny merger applications involving two percent carriers within a specified period. Applications pending on the enactment date of this Act will be subject to the new requirements. SEC. 6. TIME LIMITS FOR ACTION ON PETITIONS FOR RECONSIDERATION OR WAIVER. Amendment to the Communications Act of 1934 requires the Commission to issue an order granting or denying petitions within 90 days. Failure to act within this period results in relief being granted. The Commission must issue an order granting or denying petitions within 90 days, and failure to act within this period results in relief being granted. Any order issued or grant of a petition for waiver is final and may be appealed. The provisions apply to petitions submitted after the enactment of this Act. Petitions for waiver pending with the Commission on the date of enactment of this Act will be subject to the requirements of this section as if they were filed on the date of enactment. SEC. 7. NATIONAL SECURITY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT EXCEPTIONS. Executive Branch agencies can request an extension on the 60-day or 90-day time period for petitions or applications under sections 310 or 405 of the Communications Act if national security, law enforcement, or public safety concerns are involved."
