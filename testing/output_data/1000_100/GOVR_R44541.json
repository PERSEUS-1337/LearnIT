The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) defines TBML as disguising crime proceeds through trade transactions. TBML schemes, also known as TBML/FT when used by terrorist groups, involve misrepresenting prices, quantities, or quality of imports/exports. Financial institutions can be involved in TBML and TBML/FT schemes when used to settle, facilitate, or finance international trade transactions. In June 2015, the U.S. Department of the Treasury issued reports on money laundering, highlighting trade-based money laundering (TBML) as a significant challenge. TBML schemes can launder billions of dollars annually through international trade transactions. Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) issued an advisory on TBML in February 2010, citing over 17,000 Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) related to potential TBML activity. Between January 2004 and May 2009, TBML activities involved transactions totaling over $276 billion. Criminal organizations and terrorist financiers utilize the international financial system and cash couriers to disguise their activities. They exploit the complexities of the trade and finance system, co-mingle legitimate and illicit funds, and take advantage of limited resources in customs agencies to obscure transactions. Money launderers also exploit vulnerabilities in letters of credit and financial arrangements for cross-border trade. According to FATF, Trade-Based Money Laundering (TBML) involves misrepresenting goods' prices, quality, or quantity during cross-border trade to launder funds. TBML techniques include over- and under-invoicing goods and services, a common method used to shift funds across borders. Over- and under-invoicing goods and services involve manipulating prices to transfer value between parties, often requiring collusion and having significant tax implications. Complex products and those in supply chains are more susceptible to these activities, complicating customs officials' ability to determine true market value. Multiple invoicing for the same transaction can be used by money launderers or terrorist financiers to justify multiple payments through various financial institutions. By making multiple payments through different financial institutions, money launderers can increase transaction complexity and hinder detection efforts. They can provide plausible explanations for detected transactions and engage in over- and under-shipments of goods and services. Additionally, they can manipulate prices, misstate quantities, and falsify descriptions of goods and services to conceal illicit activities. TBML involves misstating the value of goods on shipment forms to disguise illicit activities, such as the Black Market Peso Exchange used by Colombian drug traffickers. It is a common form of international money laundering and is utilized by terrorist organizations. However, TBML is less understood by academics and policymakers compared to traditional money laundering through the banking system. TBML can have a more destructive impact on legitimate commerce than other money laundering schemes. Transnational criminal organizations may dump imported goods purchased with illicit proceeds at a discount into a market to expedite the money laundering process, putting legitimate businesses at a competitive disadvantage and robbing governments of tax revenue. TBML undermines economic activity by reducing tax revenue through underpriced goods and undervalued imports. Global trends in trade have enabled criminal organizations to hide gains from illegal activities. Organized crime has expanded into new markets following advancements in communications and transportation. Global markets offer criminal organizations new opportunities to diversify into profitable activities with low detection risks, according to the OECD. Illicit trade is evolving to overcome challenges in connecting production to consumers, creating economies of scale and efficiencies similar to legitimate trade. This illegal trade poses challenges for law enforcement and could have economic consequences, especially in developing countries where illicit money transfers may reduce domestic expenditure and investment. The international trade system is vulnerable to exploitation by criminal organizations and terrorist groups due to its complexity and limited verification procedures. FATF highlights key vulnerabilities including the enormous volume of trade flows, complex foreign exchange transactions, comingling of illicit funds with legitimate business, lack of verification procedures, and limited resources for customs data exchange between countries. According to FinCEN, trade-based money laundering (TBML) is increasing in volume and global reach. TBML activities were most frequently identified in transactions involving Mexico, China, Panama, Dominican Republic, and Venezuela. Concerns about TBML have also surfaced in countries like Afghanistan, Australia, Belize, Brazil, Cambodia, Canada, China, Colombia, Greece, Guatemala, Hong Kong, India, Iran, Iraq, Japan, Kenya, Lebanon, Mexico, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, and the Philippines. Trade-based money laundering (TBML) is a growing concern globally, with activities identified in various countries including Trinidad and Tobago. TBML is associated with customs and tax revenue losses, corruption, exploitation of free trade zones, and trade in gold and precious gems. Anecdotal case studies have shown terrorist groups like Hezbollah using TBML. The Treasury Department's National Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment found that while terrorist groups like Hezbollah have used trade-based money laundering (TBML), it is not the dominant method for terrorist financing. Cash movement and banking transactions have been more prevalent in cases related to terrorist financing since 2001. The State Department identified trade-based money laundering (TBML) as a terrorism-related concern in Tunisia and Syria, particularly used by hawala brokers with corrupt officials. Hawala is an informal fund transfer method in regions with limited banking presence, involving trusted money brokers who settle balances without using traditional financial institutions. Unregulated hawala systems are preferred for their quickness, reliability, and lower cost but lack transparency, making them vulnerable to abuse by terrorist groups. The State Department's 2016 report highlighted specific countries at risk of trade-based money laundering (TBML) and terrorist financing schemes, such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Lebanon. In Lebanon, individuals are involved in a TBML scheme using vehicle trade to launder drug proceeds linked to Hezbollah. U.S. law enforcement identified money wires from Jordanian and Lebanese entities to domestic vehicle dealerships in the United States, used to purchase vehicles exported to Lebanon and Jordan, sometimes with hidden weapons. TBML schemes are prevalent in Paraguay's Tri-Border Area, where the cross-border cigarette smuggling market is exploited for money laundering, benefiting criminal organizations and corrupt officials. The United Arab Emirates State Department reports that trade-based money laundering (TBML) schemes may support sanctions-evasion networks and terrorist groups in various countries. The Lebanese Canadian Bank (LCB) was designated as a primary money-laundering concern in 2011, with Hezbollah allegedly receiving financial support from drug and money laundering activities involving TBML. An international narcotics trafficking and money laundering network moved illegal drugs and laundered hundreds of millions of dollars monthly through accounts at LCB and trade-based money laundering with consumer goods. The Lebanese Canadian Bank (LCB) was involved in trade-based money laundering schemes, including purchasing used cars in the United States and shipping them to West Africa and elsewhere. The proceeds from car sales were repatriated to Lebanon through bulk cash deposits. Additionally, Asian-supplied consumer goods were shipped to Latin America, and the proceeds were laundered through a BMPE-styled scheme, with funds funneled through LCB's U.S. correspondent accounts. LCB's banking license was revoked in September 2011 by Lebanon's central bank. In September 2011, Banque du Liban revoked LCB's banking license, leading to the sale of its assets to Lebanese Societ\u00e9 Generale de Banque au Liban. Individuals linked to an illicit network faced financial sanctions and investigations in the U.S. Toy wholesaler Woody Toys, Inc. received cash payments from narcotics trafficking, which were laundered through a BMPE scheme. The company used the funds to buy toys from China for export to Colombia. The Colombian pesos generated from toy sales in Colombia were used to reimburse Colombian drug traffickers through a BMPE scheme. Some employees of Woody Toys had previously worked for Angel Toy Company, implicated in a similar toys-for-drugs scheme. The investigation benefitted from information sharing between the US and Colombia through Trade Transparency Units. Another money laundering scheme in the early 2000s involved cash couriers, money transfer services, hawala, and formal systems. The individual in Dubai operated various businesses and affiliates globally, opening letters of credit with inflated export values to benefit affiliated exporters. Bogus trade documents were arranged to satisfy banks, along with drug trafficking funds. The individual in Dubai operated businesses globally, using inflated export values in letters of credit to benefit affiliated exporters. Drug proceeds were remitted to India, where they were distributed to affiliates and sold at market value. Funds were moved offshore through hawala operators, facilitating trade in banned goods by falsifying trade documents. U.S. government policy responses to address trade-based money laundering include international cooperation in financial action. The U.S. government's response to trade-based money laundering includes participation in the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), Treasury Department regulations, and the use of Trade Transparency Units by the Department of Homeland Security. FATF develops AML/CFT guidelines and can suspend non-compliant member countries. Since 1989, FATF has focused on examining money laundering techniques and trends, issuing comprehensive recommendations in 1990. The FATF issued a new report with 40 recommendations to combat money laundering. The U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes leads the U.S. delegation to the FATF, which includes members from various government departments. The U.S. has been a strong supporter of the FATF, using it as a central resource to fight money laundering and terrorist financing. The FATF adopted revised recommendations in 2012 and 2015 to include CFT guidelines and address the financing of weapons of mass destruction. The new mandate aims to enhance global surveillance of criminal and terrorist threats, strengthen partnerships with the private sector, and raise standards, especially in low capacity countries. The updated recommendations also address new and emerging threats, strengthen requirements for higher-risk situations, and allow countries to focus on areas with high risks. The FATF revised recommendations in 2012 and 2015 to include CFT guidelines and address financing of weapons of mass destruction. The standards focus on transparency requirements for beneficial ownership, but do not specifically address trade-based money laundering (TBML). Despite recognizing the increased opportunities for abuse in international trade, FATF has issued stand-alone reports on TBML best practices. Surveys show a lack of comprehensive data on the extent of the TBML issue. The FATF identified a lack of data on TBML due to jurisdictions not recognizing it as a separate activity under money laundering. They recommended developing specific training programs for detecting TBML, focusing on financial and trade data analysis. FinCEN plays a central role in combating TBML through advisories and special measures. FinCEN issues advisories and special measures to combat money laundering, particularly trade-based money laundering (TBML). They first highlighted TBML in 1997 and issued specific red flags for financial institutions to detect suspicious activity related to TBML. Financial institutions are urged to include TBML or BMPE on SARs when reporting suspected TBML. In May 2014, FinCEN issued an updated TBML advisory on increased TBML activity involving funnel accounts following restrictions on U.S. currency in Mexico. A funnel account receives multiple cash deposits below the reporting threshold and withdraws funds in a different area. The advisory lists red flags for TBML activity by Mexican criminal organizations. FinCEN also relies on Geographic Targeting Orders (GTOs) to impose additional recordkeeping and reporting requirements. In 1988, Geographic Targeting Orders (GTOs) were introduced to impose time-limited recordkeeping and reporting requirements on domestic financial institutions or nonfinancial businesses in specific areas to aid regulators and law enforcement in identifying criminal activity. GTOs can only last a maximum of 180 days and violators may face civil or criminal penalties. Recent GTOs have been used to combat Trade-Based Money Laundering (TBML), such as one issued in April 2015 for Miami-based electronics exporters, lowering cash reporting thresholds to $3,000 for certain transactions. FinCEN imposed new reporting requirements to combat TBML schemes by drug and crime organizations. GTOs were renewed in October 2015, lowering cash reporting thresholds to $3,000 in the Los Angeles Fashion District to target drug traffickers. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) imposed special measures on foreign financial institutions involved in money laundering, including requiring enhanced due diligence and prohibiting certain account activities. Two Lebanese exchange houses, Halawi Exchange and Rmeiti Exchange, were designated as primary money laundering concerns in April 2013. The U.S. government identified Halawi Exchange and Rmeiti Exchange as primary money laundering concerns for their involvement in a TBML scheme and providing services to a narcotics trafficking network linked to Hezbollah. The Trade Transparency Unit in Washington, DC, established in 2004 by ICE/HSI, uses a specialized computer system to detect TBML, customs fraud, contraband smuggling, and tax evasion. The U.S. government has identified instances of TBML, customs fraud, contraband smuggling, and tax evasion that require further law enforcement investigation. HSI and Treasury, with funding support from the Department of State's INL, have established Trade Transparency Units (TTUs) in various countries to combat TBML. These TTUs aim to develop an international network similar to the Egmont Group of FIUs, with a focus on exchanging and analyzing trade data among trading partners. The State Department reports a growing number of TBML investigations stemming from TTU activities, with over $1 billion seized since the establishment of U.S.-led TTUs. The 114th Congress has addressed TBML in hearings focusing on specific terrorist groups like Hezbollah and regional security priorities in Latin America. Witnesses have questioned the effectiveness of U.S. and international efforts to combat TBML, particularly the role and resources of TTUs. Some have suggested linking U.S. trade policy to combat TBML. The 114th Congress has shown interest in the connection between TBML and terrorist financing, with concerns about links to groups like Hezbollah. In response, the Hizballah International Financing Prevention Act of 2015 was enacted to impose financial restrictions on Hezbollah-linked foreign financial institutions. The Hizballah International Financing Prevention Act of 2015 requires reporting on Hezbollah's financing operations, including its use of TBML, and periodic briefings on assets and financing activities. OFAC issued a final rule in April 2016 to implement the Act. President Obama is committed to imposing sanctions on Hezbollah. The Treasury Department aims to implement the Act robustly while preserving the Lebanese financial system. Congress may continue monitoring these efforts. Congress may seek to monitor the implementation of the Hizballah International Financing Prevention Act of 2015 and other financial tools to address trade-based money laundering (TBML). Hearings in the 114th Congress discussed TBML, including the topic of TBML in terror finance. The House Financial Services Committee and House Homeland Security Committee have held hearings on terrorist financing trends, including examining terror funding streams from South America, coordinating government efforts to stop terror finance, and preventing cultural genocide by countering the plunder and sale of cultural antiquities by ISIS. The House Financial Services Committee and House Homeland Security Committee have held hearings on terrorist financing trends, including examining terror funding streams from South America and preventing cultural genocide by countering the plunder and sale of cultural antiquities by ISIS. The House Financial Services Committee, House Foreign Affairs Committee, and Senate Judiciary Committee have conducted hearings on terrorist financing, including trade-based money laundering, kidnapping, antiquities trafficking, and immigration enforcement policies. The House Financial Services Committee, House Foreign Affairs Committee, and Senate Judiciary Committee have conducted hearings on terrorist financing, including trade-based money laundering, kidnapping, antiquities trafficking, and immigration enforcement policies. The House Homeland Security Committee also discussed DHS's international security programs. The House Financial Services Committee, House Foreign Affairs Committee, Senate Judiciary Committee, and House Homeland Security Committee have held hearings on terrorism financing, transnational crime impact, and Iran and Hezbollah in the Western Hemisphere. The Secretary of the Treasury discussed the International Financial System on March 17, 2015."
