    "content": "The House and Senate Armed Services Committees annually review national defense authorization bills with provisions affecting military personnel, retirees, and their families. Differences between the two versions are resolved by a conference committee. This report highlights personnel-related issues in S. 1356, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal year. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 (FY2016 NDAA) was passed by the House and Senate after an initial veto by the President due to concerns about defense spending exceeding budget caps. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 raised spending caps for both defense and nondefense spending in FY2016. The revised NDAA, passed by the House and Senate, included final military personnel provisions. The Congressional Budget Office issued cost estimates for the bills in 2015. Background: The authorized active duty end-strengths for FY2001 were as follows: Army (480,000), Navy (372,642), Marine Corps (172,600), and Air Force (357,000). These figures were enacted prior to the September 11th terrorist attacks. In response to wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Congress increased Army and Marine Corps personnel strength. However, end-strengths for Air Force and Navy have been declining since 2001. By FY2015, Army had 490,000 personnel, Navy had 323,600, Marine Corps had 184,100, and Air Force had 312,980. Due to budget constraints, Army plans to reduce personnel to 420,000-450,000 by FY2017, while Marine Corps plans to reduce to 175,000-182,000. The Marine Corps plans to reduce its active personnel strength to between 175,000 and 182,000 in the FY2017-2019 timeframe. The Administration request proposed continuing the reduction in strength for the Army, Navy, and Air Force, with the exception of the Air Force, which is 3,715 higher than the Administration's request. Section 402 of the initial Senate-passed bill would have repealed 10 U.S.C. 691, which sets minimum end-strengths for the armed forces. The initial Senate-passed bill (H.R. 1735) aimed to reduce personnel numbers in active and reserve components, while the final bill (P.L. 114-92/S. 1356) adjusted minimum end-strengths downward and expanded authority. The final bill (P.L. 114-92/S. 1356) adjusted minimum end-strengths downward, allowing a decrease of up to 2% versus the current 0.5%. The overall authorized end strength of the Selected Reserves has declined by about 5% over the past 14 years. Between FY2001 and FY2015, shifts in authorized end strength have occurred in the Selected Reserve components, with the largest decreases seen in the Navy Reserve, Air Force Reserve, and Coast Guard Reserve. The Army National Guard and Marine Corps Reserve have remained relatively unchanged during this period. The administration proposed reductions in authorized Selected Reserve end strength for three reserve components: Army National Guard (-8,200), Army Reserve (-4,000), and Marine Corps Reserve (-300). Proposed increases include Navy Reserve (+100), Air National Guard (+500), and Air Force Reserve (+2,100). No change was proposed for Coast Guard Reserve. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) matched the Administration's request. The military pay raise for 2016 is determined by a formula linked to the Employment Cost Index, with a proposed increase of 1.3% in the FY2016 President's Budget, lower than the statutory formula of 2.3%. The Department of Defense plans to limit pay raises through FY2020 despite estimating a 2.3% increase in the ECI annually for the next four years. The DOD Budget Request Overview stated that the ECI will increase by 2.3% per year in the next four years. The House bill did not specify the rate of increase in basic pay, but the committee supports a 2.3% military pay raise for fiscal year 2016 to keep pace with private sector pay increases. President Obama set the pay raise for 2016 at 1.3% for servicemembers below the O-7 paygrade, with a freeze on the pay of generals and admirals at 2014 levels. The military retirement system is a funded, noncontributory, defined benefit system that provides a monthly annuity to servicemembers after 20 years of qualifying service. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2013 established a Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission to provide recommendations to modernize pay and benefits for the armed services. The Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission delivered its final report and recommendations to Congress on January 29, 2015. Congress has included many proposed changes in the enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356), transitioning the existing military retirement system to a blended defined-benefit, defined-contribution system with reduced benefits and continuation pay at 12 years of service. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) transitions the military retirement system to a blended defined-benefit, defined-contribution system with reduced benefits and continuation pay at 12 years of service. Existing servicemembers and those entering before January 1, 2018 will be grandfathered in, with an option for those with less than 12 years of service on December 31, 2017 to elect the new system. Cost of Living Allowance adjustments enacted by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 are repealed. The FY2014 DOD Annual Report on Sexual Assault in the Military highlighted issues of unwanted sexual contact, social retaliation, and data collection. 4.3% of women and 0.9% of men in the military experienced unwanted sexual contact in 2014, with 53% facing social retaliation. Types of retaliation included adverse administrative action, professional retaliation, and punishment for reporting. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) addresses concerns about retaliation and male victims of sexual assault, enhancing the Special Victims' Counsel Program and modifying requirements for judicial proceedings, reporting, and sentencing in sex-related offenses. The Department of Defense rescinded the 1994 Direct Combat Exclusion Rule to allow women in combat roles, with all military occupations open to women with no exceptions. Congress established gender-neutral occupational performance standards in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994. The 2015 National Defense Authorization Act emphasized the importance of developing performance standards related to actual duties in specific military occupations and individual capabilities. The 2016 NDAA added criteria for combat unit readiness standards, potentially requiring validation efforts. DOD must notify Congress of changes to assignment policies affecting female access to units, positions, or career designators. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) shortens the waiting period for Congress to review changes to assignment policies affecting female access to units, positions, or career designators from 30 days in continuous session to 30 calendar days. This change provides a more definitive timeline for DOD implementation and reduces the amount of in-session time for Congress to review and act on proposed changes. The Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission found weaknesses in financial literacy programs for military servicemembers, potentially impacting readiness. Improving financial literacy could save the DOD millions annually and reduce troops separated due to financial distress. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) mandates financial literacy training for servicemembers upon entry. The enacted bill mandates financial literacy training for military servicemembers at various career points due to life changes or transitions. Requirements for enlistment differ between the active component and reserve components. The Military Accessions Vital to National Interest (MAVNI) program allows exceptions for enlistment in the United States military if deemed vital to national interest. Enlistment requirements include being a US citizen, lawful permanent resident, or having previous military service. The enacted bill does not link eligibility requirements for the active and reserve components. In 2004, Congress established the Reserve Educational Assistance Program (REAP) to provide enhanced educational benefits to reservists called to active service in response to a war or national emergency. The Post\u20109/11 GI Bill, approved four years later, offered more generous benefits, leading to a recommendation to terminate REAP. The Senate-passed bill proposed a sunset date for REAP four years after the enactment of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016. The Reserve Educational Assistance Program (REAP) was established in 2004 to provide enhanced educational benefits to reservists called to active service. The Senate bill proposed a sunset date for REAP four years after the enactment of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016, allowing only those currently using REAP to continue. For more information on REAP and the Post 9/11 GI Bill, refer to CRS reports. The Senate bill proposed a \"Recognition of Service ID Card\" for veterans, but the enacted bill did not include this provision. The ID card would identify the bearer as a veteran and include their name and photograph, with negotiations for acceptance at national retail chains. The enacted bill did not include the \"Recognition of Service ID Card\" provision for veterans. Alternative options exist for veterans to obtain state-issued ID cards or utilize the joint DOD-VA eBenefits web portal for proof of military service. President Obama signed the Veterans Identification Card Act of 2015 into law, requiring the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to provide identification cards to veterans demonstrating their military service. The House bill (H.R. 1735) authorizes service secretaries to provide recruitment incentives for officers, warrant officers, and enlisted personnel, subject to congressional review. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) includes this provision. When reservists are called into active federal service, they are eligible for legal protections, including the right to reemployment under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) of 1994. USERRA allows for reemployment after military service, with exemptions for certain types of duty that do not count towards the five-year limit. In 2011, Congress created new mobilization authorities for reservists in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 (P.L. 112-81), allowing 120-day activations for disaster response and 365-day activations for preplanned missions. Activations under these new authorities are not currently exempt from the five-year cumulative limit on military service. Section 565 of the House-passed bill (H.R. 1735) would exempt military duty under the new reserve activation authorities from counting towards the cumulative five-year limit for reemployment protection under USERRA. Section 562 of the enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) addresses this issue. By statute, a veteran is defined as a person who served in the active military, naval, or air service under conditions other than dishonorable. Active service refers to full-time service as a member of the Army, Navy, or Air Force, excluding active duty for training. Active service is necessary for most VA benefits. For more information on USERRA and mobilization authorities, refer to CRS Report RL30802. Active service, excluding active duty for training, refers to full-time service in the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, Public Health Service, or National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. It also includes periods of active duty for training where injury or death occurred in the line of duty, as well as certain health conditions incurred during training. National Guard and reserves members not activated for active duty military service do not meet the statutory definition of veteran. Reservists who qualify for reserve retirement may not necessarily be considered veterans unless they have completed the required active service. The initial House-passed bill aimed to honor reservists as veterans without providing additional benefits, but this provision was not included in the enacted bill. The Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009 established a pilot Career Intermission Program (CIP) allowing 20 officers and enlisted personnel per year to take a 3-year break from their military career. For more information on veterans' benefits, burial benefits, and Reserve Component retirement benefits, refer to CRS reports R42324, R41386, and RL30802 respectively. The Career Intermission Program (CIP) allows servicemembers to take a 3-year break from their military career to address work/life balances or pursue broadening opportunities. The program aims to retain high-performing servicemembers and increase retention rates. Participants accept an additional active duty service obligation for every month spent in CIP. The Career Intermission Program (CIP) allows servicemembers to take a 3-year break from their military career to address work/life balances or pursue broadening opportunities. Participants accept an additional active duty service obligation for every month spent in CIP. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) would remove prohibitions on program participation by members of the Armed Forces serving under an agreement upon entry, or members receiving a critical military skill retention bonus. Section 523 removes the restriction that limits the number of annual participants in the program to 20 officers and 20 enlisted members. Congress has been concerned with improving the recruitment, retention, and career management for the acquisition workforce. The Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986 incentivized officers to be educated in joint matters and tied joint professional military education to promotions. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) extends joint duty credit to include service in acquisition-related assignments and allows officers to pursue a dual career track in combat arms and acquisition fields. The NDAA encourages the inclusion of acquisition matters in Phase II joint professional military education. DOD policies limit carrying government-issued firearms on military bases to personnel on assigned duties. Military servicemembers are prohibited from carrying personal firearms. Contact [author name scrubbed] for military personnel issues and [author name scrubbed] for defense acquisition issues. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) would compel DOD to give more flexibility to commanders of installations and defense facilities to establish force protection measures following recent active shooter incidents on military bases. The Purple Heart is awarded to Armed Forces members killed or wounded in action. In 1995, a domestic terrorist attack in Oklahoma City killed 168 people. The Oklahoma City bombing in 1995 killed 168 people and injured over 650, including servicemembers from the Army and Marine Corps. There is a debate over whether these servicemembers should be eligible for the Purple Heart due to the nature of the attack being domestic terrorism. The eligibility criteria for the Purple Heart was expanded in 2015 to include servicemembers wounded and killed in terrorist attacks at Little Rock and Fort Hood. The eligibility for the Purple Heart was expanded in 2015 to include servicemembers wounded and killed in terrorist attacks inspired by foreign terrorist organizations. This change was made to address concerns over whether acts of violence by Muslim perpetrators should be considered acts of terrorism. The House-passed bill did not adopt the provision in Section 583, meaning servicemembers affected by the Oklahoma City bombing are not eligible for the Purple Heart under the enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356). Congressional attention has focused on military working dogs, with laws and provisions in the NDAA related to their transfer and adoption. The NDAA for FY2012 and FY2013 included provisions to facilitate the adoption of retired military working dogs by law enforcement agencies and former handlers. Liability claims arising from the transfer of these dogs were also limited. Military working dogs were classified as \"equipment,\" and eligible individuals paid for transporting the dogs stateside. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) requires DOD to transfer retiring military working dogs located overseas to the United States for adoption, giving priority to former handlers. This change from \"may\" to \"shall\" facilitates the domestic transfer of these dogs. The enacted bill requires DOD to transfer retiring military working dogs from overseas to the United States for adoption, prioritizing former handlers. Opponents argue that the transfer will be costly without appropriated funds. Congress has been focused on improving the Defense Commissary system, with the President's FY2015 budget proposing $1 billion in cuts over three years. The FY2015 NDAA added $100 million to the commissary budget to reverse the Administration's proposal to cut $300 million in subsidies for commissaries. This would reduce operating days and hours for patrons and increase costs for goods and services. Authorized patrons include active duty military members, retired personnel, disabled veterans, and DOD civilians stationed overseas. The enacted bill requires the Secretary of Defense to submit a report on achieving budget-neutrality for the DeCA and military exchange system by March 1, 2016. The plan must detail how to meet benchmarks such as customer service satisfaction and sustain discount savings for eligible patrons by October 1, 2018. It may include modifications like privatization or closure of commissaries. The Defense Secretary is required to submit a report on achieving budget-neutrality for the DeCA and military exchange system by March 1, 2016. The report must include an analysis of pricing constructs, impact on MWR programs, and consider previous reports and studies. It may involve privatization or closure of commissaries. The enacted bill requires a report on the Commissary Surcharge, Non-appropriated Fund, and Privately-Financed Major Construction Program to be submitted to the Committees on Armed Services within 180 days. Reference: CRS Report R43806, Fact Sheet: Selected Highlights of H.R. 3979. TRICARE is a health care program for servicemembers, retirees, and their dependents. The Administration proposed changes in FY2016, but only pharmaceutical copays were adopted. Recommendations for TRICARE changes were made by the Military Compensation and Retirement Compensation Modernization Commission, but not endorsed by the President. The President did not endorse recommendations for TRICARE changes made by the Military Compensation and Retirement Compensation Modernization Commission. Congress may consider major changes to the TRICARE benefit in the future, but a deliberate approach is recommended to understand the implications and unintended consequences. Provisions in the Act aim to improve access to care, deliver better health outcomes, enhance the care experience for beneficiaries, and control healthcare costs. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) lays the foundation for TRICARE modernization and reform legislation. Comprehensive reform of the military health care system is essential to improve access, quality, and cost effectiveness. The current system needs to keep pace with best practices and innovations in the commercial healthcare market to meet future needs of the DOD, servicemembers, families, and retirees. To modernize and improve the military healthcare system, all elements of the current system must be reevaluated, including necessary increases to fees and co-pays. TRICARE beneficiaries have access to a pharmacy program with various options for filling prescriptions, and active duty servicemembers have no pharmacy copayments at certain locations. TRICARE beneficiaries can fill prescriptions at military pharmacies for free or through TRICARE Pharmacy Home Delivery. Generic medications are preferred over brand-name drugs. The 2015 NDAA allowed a one-time $3 increase in pharmacy copays and mandated refills for maintenance drugs to be filled through mail order or military pharmacies. The FY2016 budget proposed annual copayment increases. Section 702 of the enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) resulted in smaller copayment increases than initially proposed. Section 702 of the enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) includes a one-time increase in pharmacy copayments for prescriptions filled at retail pharmacies and by mail order. The copay for generic drugs at retail pharmacies increases from $8 to $10, and for formulary brand name drugs from $20 to $24. Mail order copays for formulary drugs increase from $16 to $20, and for non-formulary drugs from $46 to $49. This change is estimated to reduce direct spending by about $1.5 billion over 10 years. The military health system underwent a review resulting in an action plan ordered by then-Secretary of Defense Hagel. Some Members of Congress are interested in the follow-up plan's implementation. The initial Senate bill required actions to increase visibility of health quality metrics, costing about $95 million over 2016-2020. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) is less demanding and presumably less costly. The 2014 annual report of the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Service highlighted concerns about access to contraception for Service members. TRICARE covers various forms of birth control when prescribed by an authorized provider, including contraceptive diaphragms, intrauterine devices, prescription contraceptives, and surgical sterilization. However, TRICARE does not cover condoms or nonprescription spermicidal products. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) requires the Secretary of Defense to establish clinical practice guidelines for contraception and counseling for DOD health care providers. It also mandates comprehensive counseling on contraception for all women in the Armed Forces."
