    "content": "In FY2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) obligated over $280 billion for federal contracts, more than all other agencies combined, equal to 8% of federal spending. Analysts and officials believe that using data more effectively in acquisition decision-making could save billions, allocate resources efficiently, and enhance military operations. The National Defense Industrial Association emphasized data as a critical step in improving defense acquisitions. Congress has taken steps to enhance DOD's efficiency, including requiring auditability and acquisition reform provisions in National Defense Authorization Acts. The report examines the effectiveness of DOD in using data for decision-making, focusing on defense acquisitions. Congress has taken steps to enhance DOD's efficiency, including provisions on acquisition reform in National Defense Authorization Acts. In light of advances in information technology, data analysis is crucial for informed policy decisions and managing government programs. Sufficient data allows decision-makers to measure program effectiveness, inform policy decisions, and provide transparency. A lack of data can lead to incorrect conclusions, resulting in wasted resources and ineffective policies. The importance of data-driven decisions in government programs and military operations is highlighted by reports showing a lack of access to data and analytical tools. Issues such as improper tracking of spare parts and unreliable data in audits have led to wasted resources and hindered supply chain management in Afghanistan. The lack of data integration in decision-making processes within the Department of Defense (DOD) has hindered supply distribution and operational effectiveness in Afghanistan. Despite the significance of data, many policy decisions are made without substantive data, leading to potential inefficiencies and lack of success measurement. Retired Air Force General Norman Schwartz emphasized the importance of incorporating relevant data into program reviews. Retired Air Force General Norman Schwartz highlighted the importance of data-driven decision-making in both the private sector and government settings. Congress passed the DATA Act in 2014 to improve government operations by establishing data standards for financial information and enhancing transparency in Federal spending. Policy makers aim to improve data quality on USASpending.gov by holding Federal agencies accountable. In a recent hearing, Senator McCain highlighted the challenge of addressing management problems without accurate data. Former Secretary of Defense Gates described the difficulty in obtaining accurate information, leading to inefficiency and harm to national security. The lack of accurate information in the Department of Defense hinders the ability to measure national security policies, assess military priorities, and make informed decisions. Key elements for effective data usage include having information systems, comprehensive and accurate data, and using data for decision-making. In some cases, decision-makers lack even a basic database to manage information, leading to inefficiencies in managing weapon system portfolios. Effective management of weapon system portfolios requires sound information systems to avoid manual, paper-based processes that are labor-intensive and prone to errors. The lack of reliable systems can hinder the Department of Defense's ability to improve budgetary accounting and utilize valuable program information effectively. The Department of Defense's accounting has been hindered by flawed financial management systems and transaction control weaknesses. Efforts to improve these systems are ongoing, with completion expected by 2017. Multiple IT systems and databases containing similar information have led to concerns about data conflicts and the lack of a single source for analyzing specific data sets. Calls have been made to enhance the architecture of data systems for collecting, managing, and analyzing DOD acquisition data. The Department of Defense faces challenges with data reliability and sufficiency in its acquisition data systems, including the Federal Procurement Data System\u2014Next Generation (FPDS) and Operations and Support costs. FPDS is a crucial database for government-wide procurement, relied upon by Congress, executive branch agencies, analysts, and the public for understanding federal contracting spending. The FPDS database is crucial for government procurement, but concerns have been raised about its data accuracy and reliability. The GAO and OMB have recommended improvements to enhance data quality. Analysts now use FPDS mainly for identifying trends and making rough estimates. The General Services Administration is currently overhauling several data systems, including FPDS. Several data systems, including FPDS, are undergoing a significant overhaul to improve reliability and usefulness. Focus groups with stakeholders are providing feedback on how to enhance the data systems. Upgrades are expected to be rolled out in 2017 or 2018. GAO found inconsistencies in DOD reports on weapon system O&S costs due to insufficiently comprehensive and reliable data. The GAO found that DOD officials lacked necessary information to analyze operations and support cost growth for major systems, identify cost drivers, or develop plans for managing costs. O&S data were incomplete and inconsistently reported, with inconsistencies in tracking costs against final estimates. The AT&L office is now requiring more consistent use of units for calculating O&S, but it will take years to build a data bank for analysis. The DOD faces challenges with data access, quality, and availability throughout the acquisition process. Even when reliable data exists, it may not reach decision-makers or be effectively incorporated into the decision-making process. Some policies and decisions are based on perceptions or anecdotal evidence due to a lack of data analysis. Barriers to sharing data exist, including institutional and cultural obstacles within the DoD. The stovepiped structure of DoD limits visibility and information sharing, with bureaucratic incentives and policies restricting data access. Decisionmakers struggle to use existing data effectively, lacking personnel for complex data analysis. Some senior leaders within DOD do not understand how to utilize data for informed decisions, leading to unchecked statistics and slick presentations influencing decisions without validation. Some government officials and analysts emphasize the importance of understanding data limitations in decision-making. Concerns include avoiding data collection for its own sake and the tendency to collect data without a clear purpose. Without a well-thought-out understanding of needed data, the quest for data may become an end in itself, with limited usefulness. Some DOD officials feel too much time is spent on data calls and reporting requirements. Some observers caution that the benefit of data analyses should outweigh the cost of collecting and analyzing data. Striving for more and better data can sometimes hinder effective analysis, as data do not need to be perfect to be useful. Decision-makers should focus on whether sufficient data exist for reasonable conclusions. Decision-makers should focus on whether there is sufficient data to draw reasonable conclusions. Critical questions to ask when working with data include what useful analysis can be developed, how to model correctly, and understanding the uncertainty bounds of the data. Imperfect data can still be useful, and even perfect data may not yield perfect analysis. Cost estimating for large programs is imprecise, but a good estimate can help in understanding risks and making budget decisions. From FY2007 to FY2013, DOD spent over $80 billion on contracts in Afghanistan but lacked reliable data to make strategic contracting decisions. The lack of IT systems and databases hindered tracking of money spent on reconstruction and contracting in Afghanistan, leading to ineffective supply chain management. The lack of data hindered DOD's supply chain management in Afghanistan, affecting distribution of supplies and equipment. Multiple conflicting IT systems led to wasteful spending and poor data sharing. Data reliability remained questionable even when systems were in place. Data reliability in tracking information was questionable as data often remained at the local level and did not flow up to the central database. When data was sent to the central database, it was often incomplete and unreliable. Only about 10% of all data records were eventually put into the central database, with some areas being more accurately tracked than others. For example, only 14% of approximately 59,000 records contained all required elements for reconstruction projects. Overall, only about 10% of all data records were eventually put into the central database, with an error rate of approximately 50%. Officials often lacked awareness of existing data, such as the Central Command quarterly contractor census and contracting data in FPDS related to Afghanistan. DOD acknowledged data shortcomings and worked to improve reliability and appropriateness of gathered data. DOD has made progress in identifying data needed for contract decisions and may leverage data systems from Afghanistan operations for future operations. However, there are significant gaps in data availability and reliability. Efforts are underway to improve IT systems and gather data for policy decisions. To succeed in informing policy decisions, DOD must integrate data gathering and analysis into its culture. Leadership support is crucial for a successful analytics program, with a focus on transitioning to a more data-informed decision-making process. Secretary Kendall's office emphasizes the importance of data with the motto \"In God We Trust. All Others Must Bring Data.\" The annual report on the Performance of the Defense Acquisitions System, based on 30 years of data, highlights the shift towards a more data-driven approach in supply chain management. Despite investments in IT systems and analytical tools, some argue that senior leadership statements are not sufficient. Efforts are being made to improve data quality within DOD and the federal government. The government is working to improve data quality, with systems like FPDS undergoing overhauls. DOD is enhancing operations and support data consistency. An analytics center was established by Under Secretary of Defense Frank Kendall in 2013 to analyze acquisition effectiveness. CAPE launched the CADE project to consolidate acquisition data into a single online system for decision-makers and cost analysts. The military services are integrating data into decision-making processes by reevaluating IT systems and identifying necessary data for analysis. The Air Force has established the Air Force IT Business Analytics Office, which has identified over $500 million in potential cost savings and is developing a baseline of past acquisition cost performance. The Weapon System Acquisition Reform Act focused on using data to improve decision-making in DOD's acquisition process, leading to better cost estimates and root cause analysis for major defense programs. The FY2010 NDAA requires DOD to ensure its financial statements are audit-ready to improve efficiency and resource deployment. Despite past failures, auditability aims to enhance data-based decision-making. Successes like the Navy's Air System Command may occur, but challenges are expected. The Air Force cancelled a $1 billion effort to develop an enterprise resource planning system in 2012. It will take years for DOD to implement data systems and foster a data-driven decision-making culture. Historic data scarcity makes it hard to assess trends accurately. Building a robust historical database is crucial to understanding the acquisition system's performance and avoiding knee-jerk reactions. Former Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) emphasized the importance of data in decision-making. The success of promoting data use in decision-making at the Department of Defense depends on congressional support. Congress can allocate resources for data systems and workforce, pass legislation to influence decision-making, and consider the need for information systems and qualified personnel. Congress's actions can improve defense acquisitions by ensuring effective data analysis. Congress may need to allocate resources to build analytical capability within the Department of Defense, including investing in IT systems and increasing the capacity of relevant offices. Key considerations include whether DOD has a clear strategy for data needs, the in-house capability for data analysis, and a strategy for hiring qualified personnel. Additionally, Congress may need to assess the effectiveness of contracting out data analysis capabilities. Many analysts argue that a culture valuing data-driven decisions and integrating data analysis into organizational routines is crucial. Congress could consider legislation to promote data use in decision-making within the Department of Defense. Key questions include assessing DOD's culture for data utilization, examining incentives that promote or hinder data use, incorporating data analysis into routine processes, and ensuring a clear strategy for using data analytics to enhance acquisitions and operations. The RAND report highlighted inefficiencies in accessing acquisition data, with government personnel often not receiving their preferred data in a timely manner. Data-sharing benefits need to be balanced with information security concerns, raising questions on how the Department of Defense can improve efficiency while protecting information."
