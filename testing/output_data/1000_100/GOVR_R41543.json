    "content": "The role of natural gas in the U.S. economy has been a major part of the energy policy debate in Congress. Both the House and the Senate have held hearings on natural gas, with numerous bills introduced. This report highlights global natural gas markets, supply and demand, and major U.S. developments. Natural gas is considered a potential bridge fuel to a lower-carbon economy due to its cleaner burning properties compared to coal and oil. The United States has become a leader in the shale gas revolution, increasing its natural gas resource profile. Other countries are trying to develop shale gas, but progress is slow outside of North America. If the U.S. and other countries can bring large new volumes of natural gas to market at a competitive price, natural gas could play a larger role in the world's economy. Factors like price and technical capability will determine the availability of significant new quantities of natural gas, especially unconventional resources. The development of U.S. unconventional natural gas resources is being closely monitored by many countries due to factors like price, technical capability, environmental concerns, and political considerations. Natural gas is expected to have a greater role in the global energy mix because of its growing resource base and lower carbon emissions compared to other fossil fuels. In 2015, the world consumed 122,442 billion cubic feet of natural gas, with the United States accounting for 27,463 billion cubic feet. U.S. consumption grew by 3% in 2015, driven by the rapid growth of shale gas reserves and production, which now make up 51% of proved U.S. natural gas reserves and 56% of dry natural gas production. The U.S. shale gas resources have transformed the country into a potential net exporter of natural gas, with 51% of proved reserves and 56% of production coming from shale gas. Global natural gas trade is increasing, with the U.S. being the largest consumer at 27,463 bcf in 2015. Russia is the second-largest consumer, but its consumption has declined by 8% between 2011 and 2015 due to economic factors. Global natural gas consumption grew at 1.7%, below the 10-year average of 2.3%. The United States had the largest consumption growth at 3%, contributing almost 40% of the total growth. Iran and China also saw increased consumption at 6.2% and 4.7% respectively. China, the world's most populated country, is a major energy consumer with natural gas accounting for about 5% of its energy consumption. China is expanding natural gas imports for energy security. Iran, with the world's second-largest natural gas reserves, has faced stagnation in its energy sector due to sanctions and lack of investment. Domestic energy demand has surged by 50% since 2004, with natural gas making up 60% of total energy consumption in 2014. The lifting of sanctions in 2016 raises questions about Iran's natural gas production capacity and its role in the global energy market. In comparison, the United States is the largest consumer of natural gas, accounting for nearly 23% of global consumption in 2015. The United States is the largest consumer of natural gas and the second-largest consumer of energy globally. In 2015, 35% of U.S. natural gas consumption was for electric power generation, 27% for industrial use, 17% for residential use, and 12% for commercial use. The use of natural gas for power generation has doubled since 2000 and is expected to grow by 40% by 2040. The industrial sector in the U.S. increased its natural gas consumption by 10% between 2010 and 2015, with a wider array of fuel choices expected as domestic gas resources expand. Global natural gas reserves have grown by 19% since 2005, with over half controlled by government-owned companies. Russia's Gazprom and Iran's companies are majority-owned by the state. In 2015, U.S. natural gas reserves were 368,700 bcf, driven by shale gas development. Global natural gas production grew by 2.2%, with the U.S. accounting for 22% of total production. U.S. natural gas production increased by 5.4% in 2015, the largest increase globally. The United States saw the world's largest production increase in natural gas at 5.4%, driven by unconventional resources like the Marcellus and Utica shale formations. Despite low prices, U.S. natural gas production has been steadily rising, with a 65% increase between 2005 and 2015. By 2040, shale gas production is projected to increase by 73% to 19.6 tcf, leading to a 45% overall increase in total U.S. natural gas production. LNG, a liquid form of natural gas, is becoming more prevalent in global gas trade due to new gas supplies entering the market. In 2015, LNG trade increased by 1.8%, with LNG accounting for 33% of the global gas trade. Countries like Australia and the United States launched their first LNG shipments in 2016 to expand their export capacity. The United States shifted from importing LNG to exporting due to abundant domestic natural gas resources, leading to modifications and expansions of existing LNG terminals for increased export capacity. The U.S. natural gas market is transitioning with increased supply from technologies like hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling. Shale gas resources in regions like the Marcellus and Utica Basins have made production economically competitive. Production has shifted away from traditional sources, impacting natural gas transportation. The U.S. natural gas market has transitioned with increased supply from shale plays like Marcellus, Eagle Ford, and Anadarko Basins. This has led to a decrease in demand for gas from traditional sources and a shift towards becoming a net exporter by 2017. The Panama Canal reopening in 2016 has reduced transit time to Asian markets, benefiting U.S. gas exports. The Panama Canal reopening in 2016 has reduced transit time to Asian markets for U.S. LNG exports. This strategic position raises questions about the impact on domestic gas prices and the economy, as well as concerns about shale gas resources, development sustainability, and water usage in hydraulic fracturing. The growth of U.S. natural gas production has raised concerns about the impact of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water quality and quantity, competition for water resources, and wastewater disposal. The EPA initiated a study in 2010 to assess these impacts, including the potential link between deep-well injection and human-induced earthquakes. Emissions from the natural gas sector, particularly methane, also pose health concerns. The EPA established national air standards in 2012 to reduce methane emissions in the natural gas sector. In 2016, the standards were updated to include additional equipment in the gas production chain. However, federal standards do not cover all sources of methane, posing a significant issue for policymakers as natural gas production expands in the United States. The issue of methane as an air pollutant is significant for policymakers due to the increasing integration of global and regional natural gas markets. Approximately 30% of natural gas is traded internationally, with LNG trade increasing by 1.8% in 2015. Traditionally, natural gas is sold under long-term contracts indexed to oil prices, but U.S. LNG exports have pressured other countries to delink their gas exports from oil-indexed prices. The international natural gas trade is mostly conducted through long-term contracts, whether by pipeline or LNG, to finance expensive transportation facilities. LNG producers can sell excess gas on the spot market. Russia and Qatar are major exporters, with Russia targeting Europe through pipelines and Asia through LNG, while Qatar exports mainly to Asia and Europe. The spot market for natural gas is growing. In 2015, 31% of the world's LNG trade went to Asia and Europe. Europe imports natural gas mainly from Russia, Norway, and Algeria by pipeline. Asia relies heavily on LNG, with China increasingly importing gas via pipeline from Kazakhstan, Myanmar, and Turkmenistan. China is the primary importer of natural gas from Turkmenistan. The United States and Canada have an integrated pipeline system, with exports expected to increase to Mexico and slightly rise to Canada by 2040. The United States is projected to export 1.5 tcf of natural gas in 2040, with exports to Canada expected to rise slightly. U.S. LNG prices are market-based, creating an economic incentive for exports. The first U.S. LNG cargo was shipped in 2016, sparking debates on global market impact. Multiple LNG export terminal projects are underway in the lower-48 states. The United States has several LNG export terminals, including facilities in Hackberry, LA; Freeport, TX; and Corpus Christi, TX. The Kenai LNG terminal in Alaska supplies LNG to Japan. LNG has also been shipped to Barbados and Honolulu using cryogenic containers. Alaska has the potential to be a major source of natural gas. The US has LNG export terminals in Hackberry, LA; Freeport, TX; and Corpus Christi, TX. The Kenai LNG terminal in Alaska supplies LNG to Japan, Barbados, and Honolulu. Alaska's North Slope has potential for over 200,000 bcf of natural gas, but most is reinjected for oil production. Officials aim to sell gas internationally as LNG, but face commercial challenges. The TPP FTA signed in 2016 may impact US natural gas trade, expediting permits for exports to FTA countries under the Natural Gas Act. The United States has LNG export terminals in various locations. The TPP and TTIP trade agreements could grant free trade status to key consumers of LNG. The Paris Agreement, resulting from the COP-21 conference, establishes measures for addressing climate change. The US has signed the agreement. The United States signed the Paris Agreement on emissions mitigations, adaptation, and finance in 2016. Concerns arise regarding the aging infrastructure for gas transmission pipelines, with estimates of necessary investments ranging from $2.6 billion to $3.5 billion annually between 2015 and 2030. Other factors affecting the markets include oil prices, new infrastructure, technological developments, interdependence between gas and electric sectors, and climate and environmental policies. The Gas Exporting Countries Forum (GECF) in Qatar, also known as gas OPEC, is a developing cartel organization. The Gas Exporting Countries Forum (GECF) is a cartel organization based in Qatar, comprising 11 natural gas producing countries. They account for a significant portion of global natural gas reserves and trade. The GECF is unlikely to impact U.S. natural gas consumption due to the U.S.'s resource base. Europe, heavily reliant on GECF members for gas imports, may be more vulnerable to cartel control. However, the current market structure limits supply and price manipulation. Global natural gas production in 2015 grew by 2.2%, with the United States surpassing Russia as the world's largest producer in 2009. Most countries are evaluating their shale gas resources, but lack the necessary data, technology, and equipment for successful exploitation. Commercial production outside of the U.S. and Canada is unlikely before the end of the decade. The price of natural gas in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom is determined by market hubs like the Henry Hub in Erath, LA. By 2040, the EIA projects the Henry Hub natural gas spot price to increase to $7.85 per MBtu due to rising demand, requiring more well completions for higher production levels. The price of natural gas in many markets is determined by long-term contracts linked to crude oil prices. Producers are under pressure to incorporate spot prices into their pricing formulas due to disparities between contract and spot prices. The recent fall in world oil prices may impact this debate. The regional nature of the natural gas industry and the disparity between contract and spot prices have led to high prices in Asia. Two key contract concepts are take-or-pay clauses, where buyers must pay regardless of gas receipt, and destination clauses, allowing redirection of cargo. Take-or-pay clauses typically require buyers to purchase at least 80% of the contracted volume, leading to potential inefficiencies. The natural gas industry is facing the question of whether it is time for natural gas to become the world's primary energy source. The International Energy Agency predicts a 60% increase in demand for natural gas by 2040, with most of the growth coming from non-OECD countries like China and the Middle East. As North America continues to produce unconventional gas, the rest of the world is exploring unconventional resources more slowly. China's decisions in the energy sector often drive global trends. China's shift to a services-focused economy will reduce energy needs by 85%, leading to uncertainty in future energy consumption predictions. India is expected to drive 25% of global energy demand growth by 2040, requiring a significant investment of $2.8 trillion. The U.S. electric power industry is driving natural gas demand growth due to factors like low prices and competitive financing. Natural gas usage growth is influenced by government policies on carbon dioxide emissions. Globally, it is projected to make up 28% of electricity generation by 2040, with non-OECD countries leading. Production needs to increase to meet demand and stabilize prices, except in Europe. Unconventional gas resources drive 60% of global supply growth, with challenges in development outside North America, like in China due to water scarcity and geological constraints. The text discusses how density in resource-rich areas may hinder efforts to maximize natural gas capacity. It includes various appendices on global natural gas consumption, reserves, production, exporters, major companies, and U.S. statutes related to natural gas."
