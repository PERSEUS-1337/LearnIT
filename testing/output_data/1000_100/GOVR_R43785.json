    "content": "The cultivation, distribution, and possession of marijuana are prohibited except for federally approved research under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970. However, several states and territories have legalized medical marijuana, decriminalized possession, and allowed recreational use for individuals 21 and older. Colorado and Washington were the first states to legalize recreational marijuana, with commercial sales starting in 2014. Alaska and Oregon followed suit in 2014. On November 4, 2014, Alaska and Oregon legalized marijuana for recreational use, while the District of Columbia approved measures for cultivation and possession. Popular sentiment and state movements have shifted towards marijuana legalization, leading to debates at the federal level. Bills have been introduced in Congress to remove marijuana from the list of Schedule I drugs. The debate on marijuana legalization at the federal level includes bills to remove it from Schedule I drugs and impose a federal excise tax. A National Commission on Federal Marijuana Policy is proposed to review revenue potential. The economic debate focuses on imposing a tax on legalized marijuana, considering arguments for taxes and potential revenue generation. Marijuana, derived from the Cannabis sativa plant, is analyzed for tax implications. The main psychoactive component is THC, but other cannabinoids also contribute to its effects. Different strains may be sought for specific cannabinoid contents. Marijuana strains high in CBD are sought for anxiety relief. The potency of marijuana products varies depending on preparation. Female plants grown separately from males produce high-resin buds with 10%-18% THC content. Marijuana can be consumed in various ways, such as smoking dried plant matter in joints or blunts. Other methods include using glass pipes or vaporizers. Different marijuana products have varying THC concentrations and consumption methods. The text discusses the various ways marijuana can be consumed, including smoking and using different products with varying THC concentrations. It also explores the reasons for imposing an excise tax on marijuana, such as reflecting external costs, discouraging use, preventing price falls, funding programs, and raising revenue for economic efficiency. The rationale for imposing a tax on marijuana is to reflect external costs, such as early death, and to achieve economic efficiency. Society bears the loss of tax revenue from lost earnings and some healthcare costs, but also gains from reduced future health costs. External costs are typically smaller than total costs in studies of other substances. The external costs of alcohol and tobacco were estimated to be $30 billion in a 1991 study. No similar study exists for marijuana, but comparing the costs of cannabis to alcohol suggests that a tax may be necessary to correct for externalities. A British study ranked alcohol's harm at 72 and cannabis at 20, with cannabis accounting for 28% of alcohol's harm. The external harm of alcohol and cannabis was compared, with cannabis ranking 9 compared to alcohol's 47, or 19% of alcohol's harm. A Canadian study found health costs per user for cannabis to be about 12%. Non-health costs of marijuana are likely lower than alcohol, with evidence suggesting marijuana impairs driving less and is inversely related to domestic violence. Enforcement costs for marijuana are higher, possibly due to its illicit status. The externalities of marijuana per user are smaller than alcohol, and marijuana use prevalence is lower. Based on the National Survey of Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), marijuana usage is 19% as common as alcohol usage. The external costs of marijuana are estimated to range from $0.5 billion to $1.7 billion. A 2014 report by the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy provides estimates on marijuana market size, price, and consumption in the United States. The ONDCP report on marijuana consumption in the United States from 2002 to 2010 shows a 40% increase. Estimates of total U.S. expenditures on marijuana in 2010 range from $30 billion to $60 billion. THC levels in marijuana also increased during this period. The White House's 2014 ONDCP report indicates that the price per gram of marijuana remained relatively constant from 2000 to 2010, suggesting a decrease in inflation-adjusted price over time. The price of marijuana was estimated to be $7.11 per gram in 2010, with anecdotal prices suggesting a range of values. Different techniques and data sources have been used to estimate marijuana prices, with one website reporting an average price of $317 per ounce. However, the representativeness of this data is unclear. The price of high-quality marijuana in Washington State is around $28 per eighth of an ounce, or $238 per ounce. Tax rates on marijuana range from 0.8% to 5.3%, with estimates of external costs ranging from $1.60 to $16.80 per ounce. In a fully competitive market, the price could be as low as $5 per ounce. The largest estimate for the tax on a joint is $0.30, comparable to the tax on a six-pack of beer. States and localities also impose taxes on alcohol and tobacco, which are likely already higher than the external costs of marijuana. Despite uncertainties, the available information suggests a relatively small tax compared to current prices. Some argue for a tax on marijuana to deter users who underestimate long-term health costs and potential dependence, especially among underage users. Studies show around 9% of users become dependent, with medical marijuana laws increasing abuse by 15%-27% in adults. More research is needed to improve awareness of risks. Economists debate whether user behavior is suboptimal, with \"rational addiction\" theories suggesting otherwise. Some economists argue that user behavior may be suboptimal, with concerns about hyperbolic discounting and disproportionate consumption among heavy users. A tax on marijuana could potentially reduce consumption but may also impact user welfare and income. Researchers estimate that a small percentage of users account for a large portion of marijuana consumption, similar to trends seen with alcohol and tobacco. A tax on marijuana, similar to alcohol and tobacco, would primarily affect heavy users. The regressive nature of the tax may be undesirable, but current users could benefit from lower prices. Evaluating the impact of taxes on consumption depends on users' response to price changes, measured by elasticities. Low elasticity means taxes have little effect on behavior but impose a significant burden on users. Gallet (2014) analyzed 42 studies on illicit drug demand, including 13 on marijuana price elasticity. The model predicts a -0.15 to -0.31 elasticity range, indicating a small decrease in demand with a 1% price increase. Users may be harmed by a tax despite potential optimal consumption benefits. Government policies aim to restrict drug use among minors, including marijuana. Despite state laws prohibiting marijuana purchases by those under 21, minors can still access it. Studies show that taxes may effectively reduce youth consumption, with estimates of price elasticity being higher for minors. The challenge lies in determining the appropriate tax burden on adult users to deter youth consumption. This issue is similar to tobacco taxation and lacks a quantifiable solution. After legalization, the cost of marijuana is expected to decrease significantly due to increased production and reduced enforcement costs. To prevent prices from falling too much, especially among minors, a tax may be necessary. The level of this tax will depend on the consequences of a legal market and could be adjusted accordingly. A legalized market for marijuana could lead to lower production costs and increased competition, resulting in lower prices. A federal tax rate could be based on the difference between projected costs in a legal market and current illicit production prices. The tax should be set at a level that does not hinder market competitiveness. Caulkins (2010) estimates production costs of legalized marijuana, with outdoor cultivation being cheaper but potentially lower in THC. Processing costs add $20 to $35 per pound. The estimated production costs of legalized marijuana vary depending on the cultivation method. Greenhouse production can cost up to $215 per pound, while outdoor production costs around $10 per pound. Processing costs add an additional $20 to $35 per pound. THC concentration also affects the cost, with sinsemilla containing 10% - 18% THC. Government-sponsored marijuana in Canada can be produced at 33 cents per gram. The estimated cost to go to a retail market is about 10 cents per gram. Overall, the expected price ranges from $5 to $18 per ounce. In jurisdictions where marijuana is quasi-legal, prices tend to be lower than street prices but higher than cost estimates. In Canada, medical marijuana prices range from $1.80 to $5 per gram for consumers, while suppliers can provide it for $1 to $4 per gram. Street prices are listed at $10 to $15 per gram. The Canadian government set the price of medical marijuana at $7.60 per gram in April 2014. Under the new law, small growers and homegrown marijuana will no longer be allowed. Actual prices of marijuana can be seen on websites like Leafly.com, where a gram is priced around $9 to $15 in Denver. Leafly provides consumer reviews and menu prices of products available at marijuana shops. In Denver, marijuana prices range from $9 to $15 per gram, $29 to $40 per eighth of an ounce, and $190 to $350 per ounce. Prices in Colorado are lower than the national average, with high-quality marijuana at $238 per ounce and medium-quality at $197 per ounce. These prices suggest falling prices with legalization, but they may not reflect a fully legal market. Prices in Colorado may not reflect those in a fully legal market due to their quasi-legal status. Marijuana businesses face challenges in obtaining banking assistance and are subject to high federal income taxes. The threat of potential enforcement from federal authorities remains. Researchers estimate that with legalization, the pretax retail price of marijuana could decrease by over 80%, suggesting a price range of $40-$60. The retail price of marijuana could decrease by more than 80%, with estimates ranging from $40-$60 per ounce to $100-$150 per ounce. The potential for taxes up to $200 per ounce exists to align legalized prices with current street prices. The retail price of marijuana could decrease significantly, with potential taxes up to $200 per ounce. Lowering taxes and monitoring market conditions may be the best strategy. Tax revenue could fund marijuana research, especially for medical marijuana approved in 23 states and the District of Columbia. The American College of Physicians report highlights barriers to marijuana research, including federal approval challenges and the classification of marijuana as a Schedule I drug. It emphasizes the need to study the efficacy and side effects of marijuana for various conditions. Legalization could facilitate research on externalities, addictive properties, and health effects, with potential tax revenue used for information programs and discouraging underage consumption. An excise tax on marijuana can generate revenue, similar to cigarette taxes used for healthcare spending. Revenue projections are uncertain due to market variables, including potential new consumers entering the legal market. These effects may not be accounted for in current price elasticity estimates. The legal market for marijuana could be much larger than the current market, influenced by price elasticity estimates and the pace of legalization at the state level. Analysts have tried to estimate potential revenue from nationwide legalization, considering factors like excise taxes and equalizing prices between legal and illicit markets. Miron and Waldock of the Cato Institute estimate that a federal excise tax on marijuana could raise $5.8 billion annually if taxed at 50% of its price to consumers. They also project a 50% price decrease, a 25% consumption increase, and $3.3 billion in law enforcement savings. Their market size estimates are smaller compared to others, assuming a tax of around $50-$75 per ounce. The calculation outlines how to estimate revenues from an excise tax on marijuana, using a $50 per ounce tax. It considers the effects on consumption and interactions with income taxes, depending on market conditions and tax rates. Data on price and quantity are necessary, with market value estimates ranging from $30 billion to $60 billion. Assuming a $40 billion market and a $250 current price, potential revenue effects are illustrated with a fully legalized industry and a $50 pretax price per ounce. Assuming a fully legalized industry with a $50 pretax price per ounce and state and federal taxes totaling $50 per ounce, the total price would be $150 per ounce. The federal excise tax revenue would be approximately $8 billion based on a market value of $40 billion and a current price of $250 per ounce. Legalization is expected to reduce the price to $50 per ounce, leading to a 50% increase in quantity due to price elasticity. The projected excise tax collection for legalized marijuana is estimated to be $9.1 billion, with a projected revenue gain of $6.8 billion after accounting for income and wage tax losses. The yield will depend on the extent of legalization and coverage of medical marijuana, with only Colorado and Washington currently allowing recreational use. The potential revenue from recreational marijuana sales is estimated to be less than $300 million, representing less than 4% of the population. Tax collection data from Colorado and Washington could provide insights into the potential tax base of a national legalized market. Marijuana sales are subject to multiple layers of taxation, with an effective tax rate between 15% and 25%. The effective tax rate on marijuana products in Colorado is between 15% and 25%, with additional local taxes possible. Colorado collected over $37.0 million in sales taxes, excise taxes, and license fees on recreational marijuana from January to September 2014. Extrapolating from this data, the national market for marijuana could be estimated at between $15.9 billion and $17.0 billion per year. The combined medical and recreational marijuana sales in Colorado suggest a market of at least $30 billion annually in the United States, with potential for growth. The Colorado market may be underdeveloped, leading to continued illicit sales due to lower prices or existing black market relationships. Non-resident sales could also contribute to overstated consumption levels. The issue of whether to exempt medical marijuana and how to enforce any medical exemption are important design issues for an excise tax. Levying the tax at earlier stages of production reduces administrative costs and opportunities for tax evasion. Federal excise taxes are typically imposed on manufacturers and imports, with marijuana taxed based on a per unit measurement or product price. A weight-based tax for marijuana can be administered at the manufacturing level, encouraging the production of more potent products. In comparison, a potency-based tax based on THC content could be more complex and costly to enforce and administer. A potency-based tax for marijuana may be challenging to enforce due to the need for accurate lab testing of strains. Lab testing costs can range from $60-$120 per sample, with potential for price reduction and improved technology with increased competition. However, there is a risk of growers selecting labs that underestimate THC content, making it difficult to measure final potency accurately. A potency-based tax for marijuana could be challenging to enforce due to the need for accurate lab testing of strains. It may be difficult to measure final THC content reliably, and there is a risk of growers selecting labs that underestimate potency. An alternative could be a tax based on the ratio of THC to CBD, encouraging consumers to purchase marijuana with more sedative effects. Ad valorem taxes, levied as a percentage of the manufacturers or retail sales price, have advantages in adjusting for price changes and can be easily applied to a wide variety of products. The tax regimes in Colorado and Washington use ad valorem taxes on wholesalers to tax marijuana. H.R. 501 proposes a 50% tax on the producer or importer price. A manufacturers tax is simpler to administer as it is imposed after the plant is grown and harvested. Federal excise taxes are typically imposed at the manufacturer stage. Regulations need to address how to determine a manufacturers price for vertically integrated firms. A retail tax regime, similar to a sales tax, could capture price markups and market power of firms. The price of marijuana products could be determined by various characteristics. A per unit tax rate can be indexed for inflation using measures like the Consumer Price Index. Sunset provisions could be included in the initial authorization of a marijuana tax due to uncertainty over prices and demand post-legalization. Sunset provisions in marijuana tax laws could be used to adjust tax rates to reflect industry changes. Different taxation methods, such as a general tax based on price or weight with surcharges for higher-THC products, could help shape consumption and reduce negative social costs. Delegating authority to adjust tax rates to officials like the Secretary of the Treasury is another option. Different tax rates could add complexity and unequal tax burdens across various marijuana consumers. Alcohol is taxed by potency and category, while cigarettes are taxed per unit. The initiation of a federal marijuana tax raises questions about integrating existing stocks into the tax base and addressing taxation of marijuana plants and consumer goods in legalized jurisdictions. Integrating preexisting marijuana plants and products into the tax base could help producers and retailers meet initial demand. The potential benefits of a federal marijuana tax include meeting initial demand, reducing complexity in tax regulations, and increasing federal tax revenue. However, existing marijuana plants and products may not comply with new regulations. Providing lead time before the tax takes effect could help producers comply. Colorado and Washington have different approaches to this issue. In Colorado and Washington, existing marijuana plants can be converted to legal stocks if guidelines are met. Federal excise taxes may apply to untaxed floor stocks to prevent inventory buildup. Policy makers may implement regulations at the federal or state level, leading to potential complications in tax treatments. State laws in Colorado and Washington limit recreational marijuana purchases to individuals aged 21 or older, potentially impacting the tax base. Excluding younger consumers could lead to underground production or indirect sales. Colorado residents can possess up to one ounce of marijuana with no transaction limits. Non-Colorado residents face restrictions. Non-Colorado residents in Colorado are restricted to purchasing one quarter of an ounce (7 grams) in a single transaction to reduce risks of diversion or export. More restrictive purchasing limits and production limits based on market size or per grower could increase effective tax rates on heavy users. Washington has a target of 80 metric tons for its marijuana market to monitor diversion and guide license issuance. Production limits could lead to the diversion of sales to other states or countries where marijuana is illegal. Mark Kleiman suggests that production limits could also reduce the power of larger producers and prevent negative social consequences. However, production limits may create inefficiencies and windfall profits for firms. This approach has not been used for any other commodity by the federal government and may not be effective for states or a national legal market. The tax treatment of medical marijuana varies in jurisdictions that have legalized it, with different sales taxes applied. Evidence suggests a negative correlation between medical marijuana use and prescription drug deaths. This use may appeal to consumers who prefer legal options over the illicit market. The tax treatment of medical marijuana varies in jurisdictions that have legalized it, with different sales taxes applied. Exempting medical marijuana from federal tax could lead to users seeking medical prescriptions for cost incentives, but strict standards are needed to prevent abuse and limit the tax base. Segregation of sales and marking devices may be necessary if medical marijuana is exempt from tax. In Washington, home growing of marijuana for recreational use is not allowed, unlike the allowance for up to six plants for individuals and up to 12 plants for households. The debate on home production includes considerations of quantity limits and taxation exemptions, with experts suggesting that a limit may be necessary due to the high yield of a single plant. Caulkins et al. suggest that allowing home production of marijuana could undermine enforcement efforts, as individuals could claim home production to avoid taxes. Banning home production may increase revenue from a marijuana tax, similar to tax reductions for small wine and beer producers. However, a small businesses exemption could lead to evasion and go against the efficiency of collecting taxes from larger producers. A small businesses exemption may lead to larger evasion in marijuana taxation. Lower taxes on outdoor marijuana cultivation could reduce costs, but concerns about environmental impact exist. Incentives for higher-potency marijuana may favor indoor production. Another option is a special occupational tax on businesses involved in marijuana production, distribution, or sales. The Marijuana Tax Equity Act of 2013 (H.R. 501) proposes an occupational tax on marijuana producers, importers, and manufacturers, as well as others involved in the marijuana industry. Enforcement and administrative efforts are crucial for a sustainable federal tax regime on marijuana, as seen in historical examples like the end of Prohibition in 1934. The Marijuana Tax Equity Act of 2013 proposes an occupational tax on marijuana industry participants. Enforcement efforts are crucial for a sustainable federal tax regime on marijuana, as seen in historical examples like the end of Prohibition in 1934. Enforcement of marijuana laws would have to deter consumers from engaging in illicit transactions and compel producers to obtain licenses and pay taxes. Legalizing and taxing marijuana without adequate resources for tax enforcement could undermine the federal tax base. The Marijuana Tax Equity Act of 2013 proposes an occupational tax on the marijuana industry. Enforcement efforts are crucial for a sustainable federal tax regime on marijuana, similar to the end of Prohibition in 1934. Tax collection could be more efficient if applied early in the production stage, with possible methods including tax stamps, seals on packages, individual marks on joints, or the use of dye. New technological developments like genetic markers or tracking systems could also enhance monitoring from seed to final sale. Colorado has developed enforcement planks for its system. Colorado has implemented a system to track marijuana plants from seed to sale using RFID tags. Marijuana enterprises must report inventory through a linked-computer system. Standardized weights and potency measurements may accompany a marijuana tax regime for consumer safety. The U.S. Department of the Treasury could develop marketing standards for labeling and branding. The U.S. Department of the Treasury could develop marketing standards for labeling and branding of different strains of marijuana to inform consumers and prevent competition. Different tax rates for medical and recreational marijuana could create arbitrage opportunities for consumers, especially heavy users. Enforcement of regulations is crucial for proper tax collection from nonprofit medical marijuana dispensaries. The 113th Congress made changes to U.S. policies regarding industrial hemp during the omnibus farm bill debate, allowing research institutions and state departments of agriculture to grow hemp if permitted by state laws. Hemp, with low THC concentrations, could be legalized for industrial production if marijuana is legalized for commercial production, with potential tax distinctions based on THC content. Oglesby notes that proposed legislation in the United States used a THC content of less than \u00bd of 1% and less than 1% by weight to distinguish hemp from marijuana. Europe and Canada currently allow hemp to be grown with less than 0.3% THC by weight to distinguish legal hemp from illegal marijuana. There is a concern that marijuana could be hidden in hemp fields, but cross-pollination would weaken the marijuana plants. The decision or delay of federal legalization could impact state marijuana tax policy. While marijuana remains illegal at the federal level, states with legalization laws may opt for licensing private businesses to grow and sell marijuana instead of state-based monopolies. Proponents view monopolies as a way to regulate consumption, while opponents see them as prone to corruption and driven by revenue motives. The dominance of licensing systems could make it challenging for lawmakers to transition to state monopolies in the future. The uncertainties surrounding legalized and taxed marijuana markets, including pricing, market size, consumer response, and health effects, make revenue projections and tax implementation challenging. The tax base for legalized marijuana sales is more limited compared to alcohol or tobacco, posing difficulties in determining the level and method of taxation. The limited tax base for legalized marijuana sales compared to alcohol or tobacco makes revenue projections and tax implementation challenging, especially if medical marijuana sales are exempt from federal taxation. The relationship between marijuana and alcohol consumption is a key factor in determining the social costs of marijuana legalization. If marijuana is a substitute for alcohol, it may have positive spillover effects on society due to fewer social costs associated with marijuana consumption. Researchers have not reached a consensus on the negative spillover effects of marijuana consumption when combined with alcohol. Economic studies on marijuana often do not capture long-term effects or representative populations. Marijuana research is highly regulated in the US, with limited focus on potential medical benefits. The effects of commercial and recreational legalization, like in Colorado and Washington, have not been fully studied due to lack of comparable jurisdictions. The uncertainty surrounding the relationship between alcohol and marijuana use limits the plausibility of levying a marijuana tax based on external costs to society. Initiatives in Colorado and Washington provide an opportunity to understand the effects of broader legalization policies. The social costs of marijuana legalization could vary based on polydrug use, with studies indicating potential effects. Studies indicate that marijuana has a lower risk of addiction and abuse compared to cocaine, crack, or heroin. Some believe it may act as a \"gateway drug\" to further illicit drug use. Survey data shows that heavy marijuana users are more likely to use other illegal drugs. Research on marijuana's impact on traffic fatalities is limited, with some studies focusing on driving abilities and others on actual fatalities. Marijuana is the most commonly detected non-alcohol substance in drivers. Marijuana is the most frequently detected non-alcohol drug in drivers, including those involved in crashes. However, there is no clear causal link between marijuana use and traffic fatalities. Testing technology is limited in detecting marijuana intoxication levels accurately, with metabolites remaining in the body for up to a week. Detection of nonalcoholic drugs in drivers should be seen as an indicator of use, not necessarily impairment. Advanced testing methods are needed to distinguish levels of impairment accurately. Some suggest that advanced testing methods are required to differentiate between recent marijuana use and chronic medical marijuana patients not under the influence. Legalizing marijuana could potentially lead to savings in criminal justice spending, with estimates varying from large to smaller figures. For instance, Jeffrey Miron estimated in 2005 that legalization could save $7.7 billion annually in enforcement costs, while Sevigny and Caulkins found that 8% of drug law offenders in prison were marijuana-only offenders. Legalizing marijuana could potentially lead to savings in criminal justice spending. According to the U.S. Sentencing Commission, 28.4% of federal drug-related sentences were for marijuana offenses. In state and local jails, marijuana-only violations make up less than 10% of drug charges. Legalizing marijuana may result in a 2% decrease in incarcerations. Legalizing marijuana could lead to a 2% decrease in incarcerations, mainly affecting federal prisons. The majority of costs related to the black market for drugs are from illegal stimulants and opiates, not marijuana. The current treatment of deductibility of expenses for marijuana-related businesses is restricted by the Internal Revenue Code Section 280E, which prohibits deductions for costs related to selling marijuana due to its classification as a controlled substance. Media reports indicate that the IRS enforces Section 280E by denying deductions for marijuana-related businesses, resulting in a significant tax burden. Some businesses, like Canna Care marijuana dispensary, have challenged these penalties in court. The differences in federal and state tax treatments of marijuana businesses create economic incentives for underground activity. Marijuana businesses cannot deduct their expenses, leading to implicit taxes up to 39.6% or 35%. Illicit sellers have an advantage due to the current federal tax laws. The Small Business Tax Equity Act of 2013 aims to exempt compliant marijuana businesses from certain tax regulations. The IRC Section 280E prohibition affects marijuana businesses by disallowing tax credits or deductions for expenditures related to controlled substances trafficking. An estimate of the national marijuana tax base can be calculated using data from Colorado or Washington, although total demand may be underestimated due to pending licenses and the presence of an underground market. Colorado's tax revenue data is used to estimate the state's marijuana tax base for this report. The recreational tax base for marijuana sales in Colorado is calculated using data from the 10% retail marijuana sales tax and the 2.9% general sales tax. The average of these two calculations estimated $30.0 million in recreational marijuana sales in September 2014. The recreational tax base for marijuana sales in Colorado in September 2014 can be used to estimate the national sales tax base by extrapolating the data for each state and the District of Columbia. This calculation considers population and usage rates, assuming no major changes in price or tax rates that could affect supply and demand. Using data from Colorado, it is estimated that the national sales tax base for marijuana can be determined. Based on August 2014 data from Colorado, the national sales tax base for recreational marijuana could be estimated at $14.5 billion to $15.4 billion annually. Similar calculations can be applied to the medical marijuana tax base in Colorado, with sales reaching $31.3 million in September 2014. Monthly medical marijuana sales in Colorado ranged between $31 million and $35 million from January to September 2014. Before the legalization of recreational marijuana in FY2013, state sales tax collections data implied an annual medical marijuana tax base of $314.2 million in sales. The opening of the recreational marijuana market in Colorado has not yet shown a clear impact on the demand for medical marijuana. Medical marijuana data in Colorado may not be representative of the general U.S. population due to incomplete data in some states and potential self-selection bias among patients. Colorado's tax collections suggest that medical marijuana consumption could exceed recreational marijuana consumption, even with stricter regulations post-legalization. Users denied a medical card could still purchase marijuana for recreational use."
