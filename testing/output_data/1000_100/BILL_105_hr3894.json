Congress acknowledges the importance of scientific research and technology development in ensuring America's aeronautical defenses. Maintaining air, space, and information superiority requires a strong research base, a vision that dates back to the founding of the Air Force. Investment in Air Force research and development has benefited American industry, especially the aerospace sector, and has made significant contributions to the economy for over 50 years. The text chunk \"SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY FUNCTIONS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE.\" summarizes the Congress's perspective on the science and technology functions of the Department of the Air Force. The Congress emphasizes the need for dedicated funding for emerging technologies within the Air Force, separate from acquisition management. A minimum of 15 percent of science and technology funds should be invested in new technology areas over the next 5 years to meet future challenges. To enhance Air Force science and technology capabilities, it is recommended to increase the number of officers and civilian employees with doctorate degrees in technical fields, expand the variety of technical master's degrees granted, and eliminate 5 percent of science and technology programs annually to fund new programs. SEC. 4. AMENDMENTS RELATING TO SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY FUNCTIONS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE. The text chunk discusses the separation of research and development functions within the Department of the Air Force, including the establishment of an Assistant Secretary for Science and Technology. The text chunk amends sections related to Science and Technology within the Department of the Air Force, including the establishment of an Assistant Secretary for Science and Technology and a Deputy Chief of Staff for Science and Technology. The text chunk adds a new subsection appointing the Deputy Chief of Staff for Science and Technology within the Department of the Air Force. The text chunk appoints the Deputy Chief of Staff for Science and Technology within the Department of the Air Force. The Secretary of the Air Force is required to contract the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences to study the Air Force's technology base. The study will recommend minimum requirements to maintain a technology base for superiority in air and space weapons systems, address effects on national defense and civilian industries by reducing funding, and recommend appropriate staff levels with specific degrees. The Secretary of the Air Force will submit a report to Congress within 120 days of completing a study on the ratio of civilian and military staff with science and technology degrees to maintain the Air Force's technological superiority in air and space weapons systems."
