The Congress acknowledges the impact of expanded access to credit on homeownership rates, but expresses concern about predatory lending practices that make homeownership more costly for vulnerable families. Borrowers with fair credit can access loans in the prime market, while those with poor credit turn to the subprime market with higher rates and fees. Predatory lending in the market involves unjustifiably high interest rates, excessive fees, and other unreasonable terms, particularly affecting minority neighborhoods and cash-poor homeowners. This practice strips away wealth accumulated over decades or a lifetime. The joint report by the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Department of the Treasury urged Congress to adopt legislation to curb predatory home mortgage lending, restrict abusive terms on high-cost loans, improve consumer literacy and disclosures, and prohibit government-sponsored enterprises from purchasing loans with predatory features. The joint report recommended a four-point plan to address predatory lending, including improving consumer literacy and disclosures, disclosing credit scores to borrowers, and providing timely and accurate loan information. Government agencies are working to reduce high-pressure sales tactics and misleading practices by lenders. Predatory lending poses a threat to the efforts of nonprofit organizations working to improve distressed neighborhoods. More assistance is needed for borrowers with predatory loans, consumer education on home loan risks is crucial, and referrals to government agencies for help are essential.

The Secretary of the Treasury may provide grants to States, local governments, and nonprofits for eligible anti-predatory lending activities. These activities include education programs to inform vulnerable consumers about predatory lending practices related to home loans.
