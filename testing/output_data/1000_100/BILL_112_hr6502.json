    "content": "The Act titled \"Life-Threatening Diseases Compassion through Combination Therapy Act of 2012\" promotes the development of combinations of investigational new drugs for serious diseases by providing marketing exclusivity and priority review for significant drug combinations. The Secretary may designate a combination of drugs as significant if it includes 2 or more drugs that offer the potential to advance treatment for a serious or life-threatening disease and meet criteria for codevelopment. The Secretary may designate a combination of unmarketed investigational drugs for codevelopment, with the purpose of encouraging the development of such drug combinations. Task force recommendations are considered in the designation process. The Secretary can designate a combination of unmarketed investigational drugs for codevelopment to encourage their development. The manufacturer or sponsor of a drug can request the Secretary to determine if a combination of 2 or more drugs is significant, with a response required within 30 days. The Secretary can designate a combination of unmarketed investigational drugs for codevelopment to encourage their development. If a combination of drugs meets the requirements for designation, the Secretary will designate it as a significant drug combination and notify the requester. The Secretary can designate a combination of unmarketed investigational drugs for codevelopment to encourage their development. If the request does not meet the requirements for designation as a significant drug combination, the Secretary will provide notice to the requester. The request for designation must be made concurrently with or after the submission of an application for drug investigation, but not later than the completion of phase I trials for any of the drugs involved. The Secretary will develop and publish a list of significant drug combinations on the FDA website, updating it annually to include new combinations and exclude others. The Secretary will publish a list of significant drug combinations on the FDA website annually, excluding combinations that no longer meet requirements. If a drug is part of a designated combination, it may receive extended market exclusivity periods.

The phrase 'significantly advance treatment' in this section refers to a drug combination that treats life-threatening or serious diseases with no existing therapy or shows improved effects on serious outcomes compared to alternative therapies, such as superiority or minimizing drug resistance in clinical trials. The Fast Track Product amendment allows for drugs in significant drug combinations designated under section 505E(a) to be fast-tracked if intended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening conditions with unmet medical needs. The Codevelopment Task Force is established. The Secretary of Health and Human Services establishes an interagency task force to promote the codevelopment of drugs in significant combinations. The task force includes experts in research and drug development for serious diseases like cancer. Their duties include recommending a list of important drug combinations for designation by the Secretary. The task force recommends significant drug combinations for designation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The list will be made public for comments and revised based on feedback before being submitted to the Secretary and Congress. Additionally, the task force will update the list annually. The task force will annually update and submit a list of significant drug combinations to the Secretary and Congress, along with a report identifying challenges and opportunities for drug codevelopment. The task force will provide recommendations to support the codevelopment of drugs in significant combinations, with a draft report open for public comment. The task force's duration is exempt from the Federal Advisory Committee Act, and significant drug combinations are defined for the purpose of the task force. The task force will provide recommendations for significant drug combinations, defined as a combination of 2 or more drugs that advance treatment for serious diseases and meet FDA criteria for codevelopment. The task force will recommend significant drug combinations that advance treatment for serious diseases and meet FDA criteria. These drugs must be licensed under specific acts. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will conduct a study on the impact of exclusivity extensions on significant drug combinations. Interim findings will be shared with a task force and the public, with an opportunity for comments. Final findings will be submitted to Congress within 5 years."
