    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Environmental Justice Enforcement Act of 2006\". The Act is necessary due to a Supreme Court decision that weakens statutory protections against discrimination established by Congress. The decision undermines these protections by denying victims the right to seek redress in Federal court and questioning the validity of regulations. It also challenges expectations set by the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was created to prevent federal funding from supporting discriminatory programs based on race, color, or national origin. Regulations were put in place to ensure broad protections for beneficiaries, including forbidding discriminatory criteria or methods of administration. The regulations under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protect individuals involved in discrimination cases. These regulations, drafted by executive branch officials, have never been invalidated, implying congressional intent. Title VI aims to benefit those facing discrimination. Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 relies on private attorneys for enforcement, as Congress recognized the need for additional measures beyond the Attorney General's actions. The Supreme Court has affirmed individuals' right to bring discrimination cases to Federal courts for effective protection, even though this right was not explicitly stated in the statute. Congress and the Courts have acknowledged an implied right of action under title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, with Congress providing means for enforcement. In 1972, Congress established a right to attorney's fees in private actions under title VI. The Supreme Court's decision in Sandoval had no legal basis for denying a right of action under regulations of title VI while allowing it under the statute. Regulations under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 were congressionally mandated to enforce antidiscrimination provisions. The regulations, approved by the President, prohibit practices that have a disparate impact, as recognized by the Supreme Court in cases like Griggs v. Duke Power Co. (1971). The Supreme Court cases Griggs v. Duke Power Co. (1971), Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Hous. Dev. Corp. (1977), Washington v. Davis (1976), and Watson v. Fort Worth Bank & Trust (1988) highlight the importance of evidence of disproportionate burden, invidious purpose, and the disparate impact method of proof in analyzing unlawful discrimination under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. The interpretation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits practices with disparate impact not justified by program goals. Congress reinstated the disparate impact standard in the Civil Rights Act of 1991. Congress also reinstated a private right of action under Title VI. Action by Congress is necessary to specify a private right of action under Title VI to ensure individuals have a remedy for discrimination in various programs and services. This is crucial as Federal agencies may not always take appropriate action due to administrative burdens. Entities subject to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 may face discrimination practices. Courts have dismissed claims challenging discriminatory effects under Title VI regulations. A waiver of sovereign immunity will allow for a private right of action under Title VI. SEC. 3. PROHIBITED DISCRIMINATION. Section 601 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is amended to include provisions regarding discrimination based on disparate impact. An aggrieved person must demonstrate that a covered entity's policy or practice causes a disparate impact based on race, color, or national origin, and the entity fails to show that the policy is necessary for nondiscriminatory goals. The aggrieved person must demonstrate that a particular policy or practice causes a disparate impact, and show that a less discriminatory alternative exists if the covered entity refuses to adopt it. The elements of a covered entity's decision-making process must be separable for the demonstration. The covered entity's decision-making process may be analyzed as one policy or practice if not separable. If a specific policy or practice does not cause disparate impact, it is not required to show it is necessary for achieving program goals. Demonstrating necessity of a policy or practice cannot be used as a defense against intentional discrimination claims. Discrimination or retaliation is prohibited for opposing any policy or practice under this title. Discrimination or retaliation is prohibited under this title for opposing any policy or practice. SEC. 4. RIGHTS OF ACTION. Amends Section 602 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to allow any person aggrieved by a covered entity's failure to comply with the title to bring a civil action in Federal or State court. SEC. 5. RIGHT OF RECOVERY. Adds a new section 602A to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 for actions brought by aggrieved persons. In actions under this title, an aggrieved person can seek legal relief for intentional discrimination, including compensatory and punitive damages, attorney's fees, and costs. Punitive damages are not available against government entities. For discrimination based on disparate impact, equitable relief can be sought. In actions under this title, an aggrieved person may recover equitable relief, attorney's fees, and costs. SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE. This Act and its amendments are retroactive to April 24, 2001, and apply to all actions pending on or after that date, except for actions against a State under the disparate impact standard, which have the effective date of the Act's enactment."
