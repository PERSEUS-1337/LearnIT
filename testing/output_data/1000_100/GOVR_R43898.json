    "content": "Recent legislation has extended certain expiring provisions in the Internal Revenue Code, making some temporary provisions permanent. The American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA) reduced tax policy uncertainty by permanently extending most tax cuts and indexing the alternative minimum tax (AMT) for inflation. The Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 retroactively extended provisions that expired in 2013 through 2014. The Appropriations Act, 2016 (P.L. 114-113) extended all expired tax provisions, making some permanent and others temporarily extended. These provisions, known as \"tax extenders,\" have been regularly extended by Congress. The debate in the 114th Congress focused on whether to make these expired provisions permanent or temporarily extend them. The tax extenders provisions were extended, either temporarily or permanently, reducing uncertainty in the tax code. Some expired provisions were made permanent, but others are still set to expire at the end of 2016. Debate in the 114th Congress may address whether these provisions should be extended further. Additional information on specific extender provisions can be found in other CRS reports. The Consolidated Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2016 (P.L. 114-113) contained the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 (PATH Act), which extended or made permanent various tax provisions that had expired at the end of 2014. This included enhancements to the child tax credit, American Opportunity Tax Credit, and earned income tax credit. The PATH Act in the Consolidated Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2016 extended or made permanent various tax provisions, including the earned income tax credit and a two-year moratorium on the medical device excise tax. Other tax-related provisions in Division P of P.L. 114-113 included changes to the high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage excise tax and extensions of tax credits for renewable power facilities. The Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 extended expiring tax provisions for one year. Legislation in the 113th Congress proposed extensions and permanent provisions for expiring tax provisions. In the 113th and 114th Congress, various tax reform legislation was introduced to make certain expiring provisions permanent, including the research and experimentation tax credit and increased expensing allowances for businesses. The Tax Relief Extension Act of 2015 aimed to extend certain expired provisions permanently. The Tax Relief Extension Act of 2015 (S. 1946) aimed to extend temporary tax provisions that expired at the end of 2014 for two years, including dozens of temporary tax provisions. The term \"tax extender\" has been used to refer to the package of expiring tax provisions temporarily extended by Congress. The term \"tax extender\" refers to temporary tax provisions routinely extended by Congress for evaluation, relief during economic weakness, or budgetary reasons. Temporary provisions allow Congress to assess effectiveness before further extension. Enacting temporary tax provisions allows for evaluation before extension, but the lack of systematic review undermines this purpose. The rationale for expiration dates is to prompt policymakers to assess costs and benefits, yet in practice, extenders are often passed without careful analysis. Tax incentives for alcohol fuels like ethanol, dating back to 1978, were not extended beyond 2011. The Government Accountability Office found that ethanol tax credits were duplicative and did not increase consumption. Congress may choose not to extend provisions if benefits do not exceed costs. Tax policy can address temporary circumstances with economic stimulus measures or disaster relief policies. Disaster relief policies, such as casualty loss deductions and net operating loss carrybacks, are temporary provisions enacted to address special economic circumstances. These provisions, like the exclusion of mortgage forgiveness from taxable income during the housing crisis, the payroll tax cut, and grants in lieu of tax credits, should expire once the situation is resolved. Temporary tax policies may be enacted for budgetary reasons, as it is easier to offset short-term extensions than long-term ones. The Congressional Budget Office assumes this approach for legislation that reduces revenues. The Congressional Budget Office assumes that temporary tax cuts expire as scheduled under the current law baseline. This can lead to an overestimation of projected revenues if these provisions are routinely extended. Temporary tax benefits influence economic behavior and resource allocation, but their impact on efficiency, equity, and simplicity can be evaluated. Extenders can impact economic efficiency, equity, and simplicity. They may provide subsidies to encourage certain activities. Market failures may justify tax distortions for improved economic efficiency. The effectiveness of extenders depends on whether they address market failures. Tax extenders can impact economic efficiency and fairness in taxation. They are considered effective if they stimulate desired activities better than direct subsidies. However, direct spending programs may be more successful at targeting resources. Tax extenders can lead to differential tax payments for individuals with similar incomes, deviating from the principle of horizontal equity. Fairness in taxation also involves vertical equity, ensuring tax burdens are distributed fairly among people. Tax extenders can impact economic efficiency and fairness in taxation by potentially benefiting those with higher incomes more than those with lower incomes, reducing the progressivity of the tax system. An example of this is illustrated by two teachers with different tax brackets claiming deductions for classroom expenses. Tax extenders can impact economic efficiency and fairness in taxation by potentially benefiting higher-income individuals more than lower-income individuals. This complexity in the tax code raises costs for both the government and individual taxpayers, as seen with the extension of temporary tax provisions in P.L. 114-113. In 2014, tax extender provisions were extended in P.L. 114-113. Provisions expired in 2014 classified into individual, business, charitable, or energy categories. Individual tax extender provisions, including above-the-line deduction for classroom expenses, were extended. The above-the-line deduction for classroom expenses was made permanent in P.L. 114-113, along with other individual provisions like state and local sales taxes deduction and employer-provided mass transit benefits. Business provisions that expired in 2014, such as the research tax credit and Work Opportunity Tax Credit, had been extended multiple times before. The New Markets Tax Credit, bonus depreciation, and enhanced expensing allowances expired at the end of 2014. Some business-related extender provisions were made permanent in P.L. 114-113, while others were extended through 2019. Table 1 provides details on the business tax extenders. Four charitable provisions that expired in 2014 were also made permanent in P.L. The renewable energy production tax credit (PTC) was extended through 2019 with a phase-down starting in 2017. Other energy-related tax provisions expired in 2014 were first enacted in the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 included tax incentives for energy efficient new homes, commercial buildings, and nonbusiness energy property. Certain incentives for alternative technology vehicles and fuel refueling property were also introduced. These provisions were extended through 2016, but some credits for specific vehicles expired earlier. The alternative motor vehicle credit for qualified fuel cell vehicles and the credit for two-wheeled plug-in electric vehicles were extended through 2016 in P.L. 114-113. Congress regularly extends expired tax provisions, and P.L. 114-113 also made certain provisions permanent, resulting in higher costs compared to other proposals in the 114th Congress. The extensions of tax extenders in P.L. 114-113 are estimated to reduce federal revenues by $628.8 billion between 2016 and 2025. Nearly one-third of this cost is due to provisions scheduled to expire in 2017 and the two-year moratorium on the medical device excise tax. The total cost of extending the tax extender provisions is estimated at $426.8 billion, with 89% of the total cost associated with permanent extensions. The estimated cost of permanent extension of provisions that had expired in 2014 is $361.4 billion. The cost of tax extenders in P.L. 114-113 is $361.4 billion, with a small portion of $17.7 billion for a two-year extension of provisions expired in 2014-2016. Legislation in the 114th Congress aimed to make certain temporary tax provisions permanent, with the debate considering the cost of temporary versus permanent extensions. The Senate Finance Committee proposed the Tax Relief Extension Act of 2015 (S. 1946) to retroactively extend expired tax provisions, estimating a revenue reduction of $97.1 billion between 2016-2025. The cost of extending expired provisions in S. 1946 was $96.9 billion, with macroeconomic effects bringing it down to $86.6 billion over 10 years. The JCT expects economic growth from extending business-related provisions, but higher interest rates may offset some gains. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that extending all expiring tax provisions before 2025 would reduce revenues by $897.9 billion over the 2016 to 2025 budget window. This includes costs for bonus depreciation, Section 179 expensing, and expansions to tax credits. The cost of extending expiring tax provisions before 2025 is estimated to be $202.8 billion. Most of the revenue cost is for provisions that were either extended or made permanent in P.L. 114-113. CBO's revenue projections are higher than actual revenue levels, leading to smaller projected budget deficits under the current law baseline. Providing a short-term extension is less costly than extending provisions through the budget window. The CBO scores provide a more accurate measure of the long-term budget impact of temporary tax provisions. Extending expiring provisions may have a lower 10-year revenue cost compared to the cost in year 2015 due to tax deferrals or timing provisions like bonus depreciation. The one-year extension of bonus depreciation in P.L. 113-295 cost $1.2 billion over the 10-year budget window. The cost of extending bonus depreciation through 2019 was $11.3 billion over 10 years, with a one-year revenue loss of $45.3 billion in 2015. Making bonus depreciation permanent would cost $223.6 billion over 10 years. The tax extenders legislation in P.L. 114-113 made certain temporary tax provisions permanent. The tax extenders legislation in P.L. 114-113 made certain temporary tax provisions permanent, while temporarily extending others. Earlier proposals in the 114th Congress aimed to make expired tax provisions permanent, with the Senate Finance Committee reporting the Tax Relief Extension Act of 2015 to extend provisions through 2016. The House had also passed legislation to make eight temporary tax provisions permanent. The Small Business Tax Relief Act of 2015 (H.R. 636) aimed to make permanent enhanced expensing allowances under Section 179 and extend expired S corporation provisions. The America Gives More Act of 2015 (H.R. 644) included three expired charitable provisions. The American Research and Competitiveness Act of 2015 (H.R. 880) sought to modify and make permanent the research tax credit. Legislation was also passed to make permanent the option to deduct state taxes. Legislation passed in the House aimed to make permanent the option to deduct state and local sales taxes instead of income taxes (H.R. 622). These measures would cost $317.5 billion over 10 years. Various bills were considered in previous Congresses to extend or make permanent expired tax provisions, with a one-year \"tax extenders\" bill ultimately being passed in 2014. The Senate Finance Committee reported the EXPIRE Act (S. 2260) to extend expiring provisions for two years. The House passed legislation to make certain tax provisions permanent, reducing revenues by $511.4 billion over 10 years. Some provisions were included in the Jobs for America Act (H.R. 4) and the America Gives More Act of 2014 (H.R. 4719). The Ways and Means Committee reported legislation in 2014 to make two international-related extender provisions permanent, but it was not considered by the full House. Some provisions that expired in 2013 were not extended in the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014. The health coverage tax credit and credit for electric-drive motorcycles were not included in the EXPIRE Act but have been extended in subsequent legislation. The health coverage tax credit was first enacted in 2002 without an expiration date. The health coverage tax credit and credit for electric-drive motorcycles were extended through December 31, 2019, as part of the Trade Preferences Extension Act of 2015. Incentives for plug-in electric vehicles are currently available, while most other alternative technology vehicle incentives have expired. The credit for two-wheeled electric plug-in vehicles was extended through 2016. The EXPIRE Act did not extend provisions for partial expensing of certain refinery property and the credit for energy efficient appliances that expired on January 1, 2014. Two disaster-related provisions, including tax-exempt bond financing for facilities in the New York Liberty Zone, were also not extended."
