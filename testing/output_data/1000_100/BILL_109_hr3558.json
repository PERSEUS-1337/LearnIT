The \"Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe Equitable Compensation Amendments Act of 2005\" acknowledges the impact of the Oahe Dam and Reservoir Project on the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, causing economic and cultural damage. Congress has provided compensation to address these issues. Congress provided compensation to the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe for the Pick-Sloan projects. The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe Equitable Compensation Act created a Tribal Recovery Trust Fund, but did not include additional compensation for tribal members who lost land due to the Oahe Dam and Reservoir Project. The Act aims to allow the Trust Fund to provide compensation. The Recovery Trust Fund may compensate Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe members who lost land due to the Oahe Dam and Reservoir Project and capitalize the Tribal Recovery Trust Fund. The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe is entitled to equitable compensation under Section 3. The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe seeks fair compensation for land acquired by the United States for the Oahe Dam and Reservation project. The amendment aims to ensure adequate compensation for the Tribe and its member landowners. The Equitable Compensation Act (Public Law 106-511; 114 Stat. 2365) is amended to define \"member landowner\" and \"power program\" related to the Cheyenne River Sioux Reservation. This is part of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribal Recovery Trust Fund. The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribal Recovery Trust Fund is amended to specify funding requirements, with the Secretary of the Treasury depositing 25 percent of power program revenues into the Fund annually. The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribal Recovery Trust Fund is amended to include a calculation for interest and earnings based on a specific index, with the Secretary of the Treasury depositing a portion of power program revenues into the Fund annually.
