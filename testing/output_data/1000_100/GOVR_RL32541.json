    "content": "The 9/11 Commission found that al Qaeda terrorists exploited weaknesses in aviation security, including a focus on potential bombers, lax checkpoint screening, lack of in-flight security measures, compliance with hijackers, and a failure of imagination among senior officials. The 9/11 Commission found that vulnerabilities in the aviation system were due to a failure of imagination among senior policymakers and agencies responsible for intelligence, national defense, and aviation security. Before September 11, 2001, there were no specific actions taken to defend against the possibility of suicide hijackings, which were greatly underestimated. Congressional oversight of aviation security was lacking, with a focus on airport congestion and passenger service. After the 9/11 attacks, Congress passed the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA) to address weaknesses in aviation security. ATSA established the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to oversee security in all modes of transportation, including establishing a federal security screener workforce. The Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA) established TSA to oversee security in all transportation modes, focusing on aviation. It required explosive detection screening of checked bags, air marshals on high-risk flights, and hardened cockpit doors. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 placed TSA within the Department of Homeland Security and authorized arming airline pilots for additional security. Additional measures were included in the FAA reauthorization act, Vision 100 - Century. Vision 100 established an aviation security capital fund for explosive detection systems and arming pilots. However, vulnerabilities in air cargo operations, general aviation, employee access controls, screener performance, and potential terrorist attacks with shoulder-fired missiles persist. The 9/11 Commission also highlighted these vulnerabilities. The 9/11 Commission identified vulnerabilities in cargo and general aviation security, as well as inadequate screening and access controls. Recommendations were made for improvements in airport passenger and baggage screening, and air cargo security. The Commission did not address risks related to access controls in secured areas or shoulder-fired missile attacks against commercial airliners. The recommendations were outlined in a section titled \"A Layered Security System.\" The 9/11 Commission emphasized the need for a multi-layered aviation security system that includes effective and coordinated security measures to address possible terrorist tactics. Recommendations focused on persisting vulnerabilities in commercial aviation, with a concept of \"concentric rings of security.\" The 9/11 Commission's final report included six aviation-specific recommendations to enhance passenger pre-screening, improve explosives detection, address human factors at screening checkpoints, deploy baggage screening systems, intensify efforts to screen dangerous cargo, and use hardened cargo containers on passenger aircraft. Additionally, an overarching recommendation was made to prioritize transportation security based on risk and implement cost-effective deterrents. On September 11, 2001, passenger pre-screening involved three measures. Passenger pre-screening on September 11, 2001 involved three measures: CAPPS, security questions, and photo ID presentation. Over half of the hijackers were identified through these techniques, but with little consequence. CAPPS now screens for possible hijackers using behavioral algorithms. The CAPPS II system aims to authenticate passengers' identities and check them against terrorist watch lists for improved pre-screening capabilities, recommended by the 9/11 Commission. The system could deny boarding or require secondary screening for flagged passengers. The system has faced controversy over data privacy and civil liberties concerns. The Homeland Security Appropriations Act and Vision 100 directed the Department of Homeland Security to address concerns with CAPPS II implementation. The TSA only addressed one of eight concerns, and airlines' reluctance to provide data has hindered progress. Recent reports suggest that the CAPPS II program has been scrapped due to privacy concerns, but a new program may be developed in the future. Security Tom Ridge has suggested a new program may replace CAPPS II. Congress may increase oversight of the Secure Flight program, successor to CAPPS, and debate on implementation. H.R. 10 requires TSA to take over prescreening from airlines within 180 days and start testing by November 1, 2004. The 9/11 Commission highlighted al Qaeda's interest in bombing airliners, referencing Ramzi Yousef's 1994 attack as a precursor. Ramzi Yousef's 1994 bombing of a Philippines Airlines flight was a precursor to the \"Bojinka\" plot to bomb multiple U.S.-bound airliners. Concerns over IEDs were raised after incidents involving Richard Reid and Nathaniel Heatwole. The 9/11 Commission acknowledged weaknesses in detecting explosives on passengers. The 9/11 Commission recommended improving detection of explosives on passengers by implementing explosives screening for all individuals selected for secondary screening. New technology using trace detection methods is being tested at various airport sites. The 9/11 Commission recommended improving explosives detection on passengers through various methods such as body scan imaging, bomb-sniffing dogs, and physical searches. Congress may debate funding for passenger screening initiatives. The 9/11 Commission recommended improving explosives detection on passengers through methods like body scan imaging, bomb-sniffing dogs, and physical searches. The TSA is addressing screener performance issues by conducting human factors studies and implementing initiatives like threat image projection (TIP) to assess on-the-job performance and improve recurrent training. Key human factors issues include screener selection, training, and fitness. The TSA is addressing screener performance issues through human factors studies and initiatives like threat image projection. Key human factors issues include screener selection, training, fitness, and human interaction with screening technologies. However, research on aviation security human factors and funding for these activities are lacking compared to other agencies. Congress may need to conduct oversight to ensure TSA's research efforts adequately address concerns over passenger and baggage screening performance. Congress may consider tasking an independent body to examine human factors needs in aviation security, as the National Academy of Sciences has not focused on this issue since 9/11. H.R. 10 includes a provision for TSA to conduct human factors studies to improve screener performance. The 9/11 Commission recommended expediting installation of baggage screening systems, raising questions about current funding adequacy. Vision 100 authorizes up to $500 million annually for aviation security capital fund, but only $250 million has been allocated. The 9/11 Commission recommended expediting installation of baggage screening systems, but only $250 million out of the authorized $500 million annually has been allocated for this purpose. The TSA's approach of reimbursing airports for expenses as they are incurred could further slow down the integration of EDS systems at airports. The 9/11 Commission recommended that the aviation industry should pay a fair share of the costs for in-line EDS deployment, which has been a point of contention. Airlines and airports currently contribute to the costs, with airports facing proposed increases in their share. The 9/11 Commission recommended a more equitable contribution from the aviation industry for in-line EDS deployment. Congress is debating the cost-sharing equity for airport security projects, with proposed legislation seeking to increase aviation security fees for capital funds and TSA flexibility. H.R. 5121 aims to enhance TSA's flexibility in meeting checked baggage security screening requirements through multi-year contracts with airports or third-party vendors for EDS imaging capabilities. The TSA unveiled a strategic plan for cargo security in November 2003, based on recommendations from the Aviation Security Advisory Committee, focusing on enhancing shipper and supply chain security and identifying elevated risks. The TSA unveiled a strategic plan for cargo security in November 2003, focusing on key strategic objectives such as enhancing shipper and supply chain security, identifying elevated risk cargo through pre-screening, and securing all-cargo aircraft through appropriate facility security measures. The plan aims to pre-screen all cargo shipments, inspect items considered to pose an elevated risk, deploy new technology solutions, and implement operational and regulatory programs to support enhanced security measures. The 9/11 Commission recommendations support TSA's approach but suggest accelerating progress towards achieving these objectives. Recent debate in Congress over air cargo security has focused on the level of physical screening or inspection of cargo needed to mitigate risks. Proposals have been made to require 100% screening, but Congress has supported a risk-based approach relying on the known-shipper program. Both H.R. 10 and S. 2845 aim to improve cargo screening and tracking, with S. 2845 specifically requiring TSA to double the amount of air cargo screening. S. 2845 would require TSA to double air cargo screening within one year. The 9/11 Commission recommended deploying hardened cargo containers on passenger aircraft carrying suspicious cargo. The cost of acquiring these containers would be $125 million, with an estimated annual industry-wide cost of $11 million due to reduced revenue and increased fuel burn. Passenger airlines may oppose this initiative due to increased operational costs. Proponents of deploying hardened cargo containers argue that it adds a redundant layer of defense, similar to a hardened cockpit door, in line with the goal of a multi-layered security system. However, using just one container per passenger aircraft still leaves vulnerabilities tied to cargo assessments. TSA currently requires unvetted shippers to use all-cargo airplanes for their cargo. The TSA is considering a pilot program to allow suspicious cargo to travel on passenger airplanes in hardened cargo containers. This raises policy questions about the effectiveness and implications of this security measure. Congress may debate the deployment of hardened cargo containers as a security layer against potential cargo bombings. The TSA is considering a pilot program to evaluate blast-resistant containers for carrying baggage and cargo on passenger airliners. The 9/11 Commission recommended risk-based priorities for protecting transportation assets and developing a plan, budget, and funding for implementing defenses. The 9/11 Commission recommends a strategic plan for aviation security, assigning roles to various authorities and stakeholders. While a risk-based approach is already in place, there is a need for a unified strategic plan. The TSA has focused on meeting ATSA mandates post-9/11 attacks, but now should develop a formal strategy for national aviation security policy, likely utilizing a risk-based multi-layered approach. In line with the 9/11 Commission's recommendations, Congress may task the TSA to develop a national strategy for aviation security, addressing funding, roles of authorities, and industry involvement. Challenges persist in defining roles and resources for state and local participation in aviation security cooperation and integration. Challenges remain in defining roles and allocating resources for state and local participation and industry involvement in aviation security. Local jurisdictions are responsible for the physical security of airport sites, while TSA oversees security enforcement and passenger screening. Local governments and state authorities often provide law enforcement support at airports, and passenger air carriers must implement security procedures and training. Security measures in air cargo and general aviation heavily rely on direct actions. In air cargo and general aviation, security measures rely on the direct participation of aircraft owners and operators, with federal oversight. There is a need for a unified plan to assign roles and missions to stakeholders and integrate strategies for overall security. Congress and the TSA should improve strategic planning, resource allocation, and integration of resources for aviation security. Integration of specific strategies with an overall security strategy is also important. The Department of Homeland Security is required to prepare a transportation security plan that includes aviation security. Congress has focused on implementing recommendations from the 9/11 Commission report, with attention to transportation security. The 108th Congress passed legislation related to aviation security, including the Vision 100 - Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act and the National Intelligence Reform Act in response to the 9/11 Commission's recommendations. Vision 100 included provisions for a redress process for aviation professionals. Vision 100 included provisions for a redress process for aviation professionals, requiring justification for Air Defense Identification Zones, modifying security training for airline crews, and mandating a study on aviation security effectiveness by the Department of Homeland Security. Vision 100 mandated a study on aviation security effectiveness by the Department of Homeland Security, including recommendations for improvement and the creation of the Aviation Security Capital Fund with annual appropriations of up to $500 million. The act also granted the Undersecretary for Border and Transportation Security the authority to issue grants for integrating baggage explosive detection systems at airports. Vision 100 mandated the deployment of explosive detection systems in various areas of airports and set guidelines for funding allocation. It also required security programs for air charter operators and mandated a review of the CAPPS II passenger prescreening system by the Government Accountability Office. The TSA addressed issues related to civil liberties, privacy, data protection, system security, and oversight by replacing the CAPPS II program with \"Secure Flight.\" Vision 100 expanded the Federal Flight Deck Officer Program to include all-cargo airline crew members and required security regulations for foreign and domestic aircraft repair stations. Additionally, it mandated a security review of foreign repair stations working on air carrier aircraft. Vision 100 expanded security regulations for foreign and domestic aircraft repair stations, including a mandate for background checks before training in larger aircraft. The legislation also authorized fee collections to cover the costs of these checks. The National Intelligence Reform Act contains provisions addressing aviation security concerns and recommendations. The Aviation and Transportation Security Act requires the Department of Homeland Security to develop a National Strategy for Transportation Security and modal-specific security plans, including one for aviation. It mandates the TSA to issue guidance on biometrics for airport access control and establish procedures for identifying law enforcement officers carrying firearms on passenger aircraft. The act also allocates $20 million for these initiatives. The Aviation and Transportation Security Act authorizes funding for research and development of biometric technologies for aviation security, establishes a center of excellence in biometric technologies, and requires the TSA to begin testing an advanced passenger prescreening system. It also mandates the TSA to assume the role of passenger prescreening within 180 days of completing testing, establish redress procedures for false identifications, and minimize false positives. Additionally, the act requires the TSA to establish an oversight board. The Aviation and Transportation Security Act mandates the TSA to establish safeguards for security and integrity, conduct prescreening for international flights, screen individuals against terrorist watch lists, and allow air charter companies to submit customer information for prescreening. The act also requires the Security Privacy Officer to report on the impact of selectee and no-fly lists. The Aviation and Transportation Security Act mandates the TSA to establish safeguards for security and integrity, conduct prescreening for international flights, screen individuals against terrorist watch lists, and allow air charter companies to submit customer information for prescreening. The act also directs the DHS to prioritize developing airport screening technologies for detecting weapons and explosives, create a strategic plan for explosive detection equipment deployment, and initiate a pilot program for advanced airport checkpoint screening systems. The Aviation and Transportation Security Act mandates the TSA to establish safeguards for security and integrity, conduct prescreening for international flights, and prioritize developing airport screening technologies. It also authorizes funding for pilot programs at airports, requires a human factors study on screener performance, and provides training for law enforcement officers on inflight counterterrorism procedures and identification of fraudulent documents. Additionally, it encourages international agreements for deploying Federal air marshals on international flights. The Aviation and Transportation Security Act authorizes the TSA to expedite installation of in-line baggage screening equipment at airports, increase funding for aviation security, and study wireless communication technologies for cabin crew safety notifications. The Aviation and Transportation Security Act mandates tamper-resistant pilot licenses with biometric identifiers, sets standards for screener staffing levels at airports, integrates screening workforce operations for efficiency, allocates $100 million for explosive detection system research, and directs TSA to implement improved systems. The Aviation and Transportation Security Act mandates guidelines for implementing security systems, prohibits certain carry-on items, and directs international efforts to limit the proliferation of shoulder-fired missiles worldwide. It also requires diplomatic efforts for non-proliferation, annual briefings on progress, and expedited certification for missile defense systems. The Aviation and Transportation Security Act mandates guidelines for security systems, prohibits certain carry-on items, and directs efforts to limit shoulder-fired missile proliferation. It requires expedited certification for missile defense systems on commercial aircraft, assesses vulnerability to MANPADS attacks, establishes a pilot program for blast-resistant cargo containers, authorizes funding for air cargo and airport security improvements, and encourages the development of advanced air cargo security technology. The National Intelligence Reform Act of 2004 and the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2005 mandate air cargo security measures, including research, development, and procurement of certified systems to inspect and screen air cargo on passenger aircraft. The DHS is directed to assess threats from international cargo shipments and establish secure facilities along aviation routes for diverting and securing potentially threatening aircraft. During the 108th Congress, aviation security measures were significantly enhanced, including increasing cargo inspections on passenger aircraft. However, concerns over general aviation security and air cargo procedures were not fully addressed through legislation. The 9/11 Commission briefly mentioned general aviation security but did not provide formal recommendations. Legislation during this time focused on airport and airspace restrictions. During the 108th Congress, legislation focused on airport and airspace restrictions, with some concerns over general aviation security not fully addressed. A security plan for general aviation flights at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport was required, but no timetable was set. Temporary flight restrictions over stadiums were made permanent, while legislation for general aviation security was seen as less comprehensive. Renewed concerns were raised over the risk posed by general aviation aircraft in response to a recent assessment by the FBI. During the 108th Congress, legislation focused on airport and airspace restrictions, with some concerns over general aviation security not fully addressed. A recent assessment by the FBI raised renewed concerns over the risk posed by general aviation aircraft. In response to the assessment, comprehensive legislation pertaining to air cargo security operations and oversight was not adequately addressed. The 109th Congress may be particularly interested in oversight of the TSA's implementation of its regulatory proposals. The 109th Congress may focus on oversight of the TSA's implementation of air cargo security rules and strategic plan to ensure desired objectives are met."
