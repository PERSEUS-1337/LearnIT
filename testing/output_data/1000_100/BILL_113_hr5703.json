    "content": "The \"Protect and Preserve International Cultural Property Act\" defines cultural property and identifies the appropriate congressional committees. It also includes findings and a statement of policy. Congress finds that protecting international cultural property is crucial for US cultural diplomacy, as it demonstrates respect for other cultures and the shared heritage of humanity. Instances of cultural property being lost, damaged, or destroyed due to various threats are highlighted, such as the ransacking of museums in Egypt and the looting of the Iraq Museum after the fall of Saddam Hussein. The ongoing civil war in Syria has led to the shelling of medieval cities, damage to UNESCO World Heritage Sites, and looting of museums and archaeological sites, resulting in the destruction of cultural sites and artifacts by ISIS/ISIL in Iraq and Syria. Many ancient artifacts, including amulets, sculptures, and cylinder seals, remain unrecovered. In Mali, Al-Qaeda affiliated group Ansar Dine destroyed tombs and shrines in Timbuktu, threatening ancient manuscripts. In Afghanistan, the Taliban destroyed the Bamiyan Buddhas, leading to global condemnation. In Cambodia, the Khmer Rouge systematically destroyed Buddhist temples, statues, and literature. In China, the Cultural Revolution led to the destruction of many antiques and parts of old Beijing. In Haiti, the 2010 earthquake destroyed important art, artifacts, and archives, as well as partially damaging the 17th century city of Jacmel. The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami caused massive loss of life and damaged or destroyed libraries, archives, and UNESCO World Heritage Sites in eleven countries. The destruction of cultural properties like the Temple of Koranak and the Old Town of Galle in Sri Lanka is a loss for all humanity. The United States Armed Forces have played a crucial role in preserving cultural property since President Franklin D. Roosevelt established the American Commission for the Protection and Salvage of Artistic and Historic Monuments in War Areas in 1943. The Military Government Section of the Allied armies, known as the Monuments Men, secured and returned art stolen by the Nazis during WWII. The U.S. Committee of the Blue Shield supports the protection of cultural property in armed conflicts and coordinates with various organizations. The United States policy aims to protect international cultural property at risk of destruction due to various factors, including armed conflict and natural disasters. This includes preventing the importation of pillaged or stolen cultural property and complying with international laws and regulations. The United States implements import restrictions through OFAC to prevent trafficking in stolen cultural property. SEC. 4. WHITE HOUSE COORDINATOR FOR INTERNATIONAL CULTURAL PROPERTY PROTECTION. The President appoints a White House Coordinator for International Cultural Property Protection to coordinate efforts among federal agencies, submit annual reports to Congress, provide policy recommendations, and resolve interagency differences efficiently. The White House Coordinator for International Cultural Property Protection works with various domestic and international actors to promote and protect cultural property. SEC. 5. INFORMATION ON ACTIVITIES TO PROTECT INTERNATIONAL CULTURAL PROPERTY. The Secretary of State must provide information to the White House Coordinator on efforts to protect international cultural property, including activities related to the Hague Convention during armed conflicts. This includes procedures to safeguard cultural property at risk and actions taken in conflicts involving the United States. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) must provide information to the White House Coordinator on efforts to protect international cultural property, including activities related to political unrest, armed conflict, and natural disasters. This includes coordination with other Federal agencies, international organizations, and nongovernmental organizations. The Secretary of Defense must provide information to the White House Coordinator on Department of Defense efforts to protect international cultural property, including directives, policies, and actions taken to prevent damage to cultural property during construction activities. The Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, must provide information on Department of Justice efforts to protect international cultural property, including statutes and regulations employed in criminal actions to prevent trafficking in stolen cultural property. The Department of Justice has conducted investigations on transnational organized crime and has taken actions to ensure the consistent and effective application of law in cases related to international cultural property, including those located in or imported into the United States. Authorization for federal agencies to engage in international cultural property protection activities with the Smithsonian Institution is granted under Section 6 of the Act. The Department of State, Defense, USAID, Homeland Security, Justice, Interior, National Archives, National Science Foundation, and other agencies can partner with the Smithsonian Institution to temporarily use their personnel for international cultural property protection activities. Federal agencies can cover the salaries and expenses of Smithsonian personnel assisting in these activities. The Smithsonian Institution can partner with various federal agencies to use their personnel for international cultural property protection activities, with agencies covering salaries and expenses. The Secretary of State is authorized to make grants for international cultural property protection activities in areas at risk of destruction. Additionally, emergency protection for Syrian cultural property is addressed. The President will apply import restrictions to archaeological and ethnological material of Syria as if Syria were a State Party to the Convention on the Cultural Property Implementation Act. These restrictions will take effect within 60 days of the enactment of this Act. The term \"State Party\" in the context refers to the definition in the Convention on the Cultural Property Implementation Act."
