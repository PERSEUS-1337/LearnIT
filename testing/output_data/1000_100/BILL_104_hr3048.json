    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Regulatory Flexibility Amendments Act of 1996\". Judicial review is addressed in the Act. Section 611 of title 5, United States Code, is amended to allow small entities to petition for judicial review of final rules that were certified to have no significant economic impact or had a regulatory flexibility analysis prepared. A court with jurisdiction over rule compliance can review the certification or analysis. The amended Section 611 of title 5, United States Code allows small entities to petition for judicial review of final rules certified to have no significant economic impact or with a regulatory flexibility analysis. The term 'affected small entity' refers to those adversely impacted by the final rule. The court can order the agency to prepare a final regulatory flexibility analysis if necessary. The court can order corrective action if the agency's certification or final regulatory flexibility analysis is found to be arbitrary, capricious, or not in accordance with the law. If the agency fails to prepare the required analysis or take corrective action within 90 days of the court's order, further measures may be taken. The court may stay a rule or grant relief consistent with section 604 requirements. When reviewing a rule, the regulatory flexibility analysis becomes part of the record. Judicial review of impact statements or similar analyses required by other laws is not barred. The amendment applies to final agency rules issued after the enactment date of the Act. SEC. 3. RULES COMMENTED ON BY SBA CHIEF COUNSEL FOR ADVOCACY. The SBA Chief Counsel for Advocacy must receive proposed rules and initial regulatory flexibility analysis from agencies before publication. The SBA Chief Counsel for Advocacy may transmit a statement of the effect of proposed rules on small entities to agencies, which must publish the statement and their response in the Federal Register. The proposed rule exempts certain rules issued by Federal banking agencies, the National Credit Union Administration, and the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight from specific requirements. Additionally, a conforming amendment is made to Section 603(a) of title 5, United States Code. Congress believes that the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration should have the ability to appear as amicus curiae in court cases reviewing rules."
