The ACTA will enter into force after the sixth instrument of ratification is deposited. Mexico signed the ACTA on July 11, 2012, requiring ratification in the Mexican Congress. The European Parliament voted against the ACTA on July 4, 2012, preventing the EU and its member states from joining. Several EU member states suspended or did not initiate domestic adoption of the ACTA in early 2012 due to protests by Internet free speech advocates. The European Commission placed the ACTA ratification process on hold on February 22, 2012, and submitted the agreement to the European Court of Justice for review. On January 25, 2012, the European Union and 22 member states signed the ACTA, with five member states not signing due to procedural issues. On October 1, 2011, several countries including Australia, Canada, Japan, Korea, and the United States signed the ACTA. The proposed Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) involves countries like the United States, Australia, Canada, the European Union, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, and others. Negotiations for the ACTA concluded in October 2010 after nearly three years. The agreement aims to combat intellectual property rights infringement and build on existing standards. Participants are preparing to sign the Agreement soon and work cooperatively towards its prompt entry into force. The Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) was negotiated outside of the WTO and focuses on enforcing trademarks and copyrights. It establishes a legal framework for intellectual property rights enforcement, including civil, border, and criminal measures for trademark counterfeiting and copyright piracy. The agreement also promotes international cooperation and best practices. The ACTA negotiation concluded in October 2010 after nearly three years. The ACTA negotiation concluded in October 2010, with countries having until May 1, 2013, to sign the agreement. All negotiating parties, except Mexico and Switzerland, have signed the agreement. The idea of negotiating the ACTA was conceived in 2006 by the United States and Japan to combat counterfeiting and piracy. The ACTA negotiation concluded in October 2010 with countries signing the agreement by May 1, 2013. The United States and Japan initiated the idea in 2006 to combat counterfeiting and piracy. The agreement was signed by several countries including Australia, Canada, Japan, Korea, Morocco, New Zealand, Singapore, and the United States. Morocco, New Zealand, Singapore, and the United States, along with the European Union, Mexico, and Switzerland, signed the ACTA with the goal of prompt entry into force. The European Union and 22 member states signed the agreement on January 25, 2012, followed by Mexico on July 11, 2012. The signatories are working towards domestic ratification to put the agreement into effect. No country has deposited an instrument of approval yet. The negotiating parties are submitting the ACTA through their domestic approval processes. The USTR negotiated the ACTA as an executive agreement, not requiring congressional approval unless statutory changes are needed. The European Parliament and all 27 EU member states must sign and ratify the ACTA for it to enter into force. The European Parliament voted against the ACTA on July 4, 2012. On July 4, 2012, the European Parliament voted against the ACTA, preventing the EU and its member states from joining the agreement. Several EU countries halted or postponed their adoption of the ACTA due to protests for Internet free speech. The European Commission paused the ratification process and referred the agreement to the European Court of Justice for review. There is a possibility of the ACTA being revived after the court ruling, with some participants claiming it won't require changes to their legal systems. Some countries claim that implementing the ACTA won't necessitate legal changes, while others may need to pass new laws to enforce its standards, such as granting customs officials authority to investigate trademark and copyright violations. Digital enforcement standards of the ACTA are linked to WIPO treaties, with Canada recently passing a copyright bill to incorporate these treaties into domestic law. The ACTA negotiation involves economically advanced countries that consider IPR-based industries important to their economies. Participants have acceded to the WTO TRIPS Agreement and implemented WIPO Internet treaties. The ACTA establishes a legal framework for IPR enforcement, international cooperation, and enhanced enforcement measures. The ACTA negotiation involves economically advanced countries that consider IPR-based industries important to their economies. Participants have acceded to the WTO TRIPS Agreement and implemented WIPO Internet treaties. The ACTA establishes a legal framework for IPR enforcement, international cooperation, and enhanced enforcement measures. The initial provisions chapter of the ACTA discusses the nature and scope of the agreement, its relationship to existing agreements, provisions on privacy and disclosure of information, and definitions of terms used in the agreement. It states that the ACTA shall not derogate from each Party's obligations under existing agreements, provides flexibility for each Party to implement more extensive IPR enforcement, and notes that the objectives and principles of the TRIPS Agreement apply to the ACTA. The Agreement under ACTA does not mandate applying obligations to intellectual property not protected under domestic laws. It includes general obligations for enforcement, civil enforcement, border measures, criminal enforcement, and enforcement in the digital environment. Parties are committed to effective IPR enforcement, avoiding trade barriers, and fair treatment. Proportionality in enforcement is required, considering seriousness of infringement and applicable measures. Civil enforcement mandates each Party to establish civil judicial procedures for IPR. The civil enforcement section of the Agreement under ACTA mandates each Party to provide judicial authorities with the power to issue injunctions, award damages to right holders, recover costs and attorneys' fees, order the destruction of infringing goods, and implement provisional measures to prevent infringement. The civil enforcement section of the Agreement under ACTA mandates each Party to provide judicial authorities with the power to issue injunctions, award damages to right holders, recover costs and attorneys' fees, order the destruction of infringing goods, and implement provisional measures, such as seizures, to prevent infringement. Additionally, the border measures section focuses on effective border enforcement of intellectual property rights without discrimination and barriers to legitimate trade. Each Party is required to adopt or maintain procedures for customs authorities to suspend the release of suspect goods and may request customs authorities to do so in certain situations. The Agreement under ACTA mandates each Party to provide procedures for customs authorities to suspend the release of suspect goods and may request customs authorities to do so in certain situations. The criminal enforcement section requires each Party to provide for criminal procedures and penalties in cases of willful trademark counterfeiting or copyright piracy on a commercial scale. The Agreement under ACTA mandates each Party to provide penalties for willful trademark counterfeiting or copyright piracy on a commercial scale, including imprisonment and monetary fines. It also requires authorities to seize suspected counterfeit goods and materials, order forfeiture or destruction of infringing goods, and seize assets derived from infringing activities. The digital enforcement section of the ACTA agreement mandates each Party to ensure effective enforcement against IPR infringement in the digital environment, while preserving freedom of expression and privacy. The ACTA agreement mandates each Party to ensure effective enforcement against IPR infringement in the digital environment, while preserving fundamental principles of freedom of expression, fair process, and privacy. Parties may order online service providers to disclose identifying information related to alleged infringement. Legal protection and remedies against circumvention of technological measures are required, along with the promotion of enforcement expertise and data collection. The curr_chunk discusses the expertise of competent authorities in collecting and analyzing data on IPR infringement, developing mechanisms for input from stakeholders, consulting with relevant parties to manage infringement risks at the border, promoting transparency in IPR enforcement, raising public awareness on IPR importance, and facilitating the destruction of infringing goods. The curr_chunk focuses on international cooperation in addressing challenges in cross-border trade of counterfeit and pirated products. It emphasizes promoting cooperation among competent authorities, exchanging information and best practices, providing capacity building and technical assistance, and avoiding duplication in cooperation activities. Additionally, an ACTA Committee is established for review and oversight. The ACTA Committee is established to review the implementation and operation of the agreement, proposed amendments, and terms of accession. The agreement remains open for signature until May 1, 2013, and will enter into force after the sixth instrument of ratification. The United States conducted the negotiation through the USTR. The USTR leads ACTA negotiations for U.S. trade agreements, consulting various agencies and stakeholders. The agreement was negotiated as an executive agreement, not requiring congressional approval unless it impacts U.S. law. The USTR ensured consistency with existing U.S. law during negotiations. The USTR states that ACTA is consistent with U.S. law, including copyright, patent, and trademark laws. It does not require new legislation from Congress for implementation. The congressional role in ACTA is rooted in the U.S. Constitution, as it concerns foreign commerce and intellectual property rights. The USTR states that ACTA is consistent with U.S. law, including copyright, patent, and trademark laws. It does not require new legislation from Congress for implementation. Congress has played an oversight and consultative role during the ACTA negotiation process and can engage in oversight of its implementation. The use of an executive agreement for ACTA negotiations may be a departure from past approaches to international trade negotiations on intellectual property rights. The United States has advanced IPR goals internationally through trade agreements, facing concerns about rising global IPR infringement. High costs of research and development in IPR-based industries contrast with low risks and high profits of infringement. Technologies like digital media have increased piracy, aided by growing Internet usage. Inadequate penalties in some countries fail to deter counterfeiting and piracy, making international IPR protection and enforcement a major issue. The United States emphasizes the importance of protecting intellectual property rights (IPR) internationally due to its significance to the economy and the negative consequences of counterfeiting and piracy. Economic, health and safety, and security reasons are cited as motivations for negotiating the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA). Adequate IPR protection is crucial for promoting innovation and competitiveness in industries. Advocates of strong international IPR regime argue that counterfeiting and piracy cause significant revenue and trade losses for legitimate industries. The difficulty in quantifying these losses is due to the secretive and illicit nature of IPR infringement, especially with digital media being distributed online. Companies may also be hesitant to disclose information about IPR infringement issues with their products. Some question the commercial rationale for the ACTA, as estimates for losses from IPR infringement are often industry-generated. Analysts doubt that sales of pirated goods directly result in revenue losses for legitimate firms, as some consumers may not purchase the legitimate version. Advocates of civil liberties argue that government discussions on ACTA should consider the economic benefits of exceptions like \"fair use\" in copyright law. Some public interest groups argue that IPR protection may favor private rights over broader economic and social welfare. Critics suggest unbalanced IPR rules could hinder information flow. Another reason for U.S. involvement in ACTA is health and safety concerns related to counterfeiting and piracy, with advocates warning about substandard counterfeit products. Public health advocates caution against conflating counterfeiting with health risks, emphasizing the importance of legitimate goods. Some express concern that increasing IPR protection may hinder access to affordable medicines. U.S. involvement in the ACTA also focuses on security concerns related to counterfeiting and piracy, which may be linked to organized crime syndicates engaging in various illicit activities. The United States pursues IPR objectives through various trade policy mechanisms, including multilaterally through the WTO, regionally and bilaterally through FTAs, and domestically through U.S. trade laws. The ACTA aims to enhance the commitments of the TRIPS Agreement and address concerns about counterfeiting and piracy linked to organized crime syndicates. The United States supports the negotiation of the ACTA to address gaps in the TRIPS Agreement regarding IPR challenges, especially in new technologies and digital piracy. There are ongoing debates about the balance of rights and obligations in the TRIPS Agreement. The U.S. pursues international IPR protection through regional and bilateral FTAs. The USTR seeks higher levels of protection in FTAs, leading to debates on IPR balance. Some IPR provisions in U.S. FTAs with Peru, Panama, and Colombia were revised post the Bipartisan Trade Agreement. U.S. FTAs have influenced the ACTA, with a focus on IPR enforcement provisions. The ACTA focuses on intellectual property rights (IPR) enforcement, including measures for trademark counterfeiting and copyright piracy. It differs from traditional trade agreements and aims to set standards for IPR protection. The negotiation process has sparked debates among stakeholders in various countries. Various stakeholder groups in different countries have concerns about the scope, transparency, and inclusiveness of the ACTA negotiation. US business sectors like entertainment, pharmaceuticals, luxury goods, and technology support the ACTA for stronger international IPR protection. However, internet service providers and civil society groups raise concerns about digital enforcement provisions and implications for trade, consumer privacy, and information flow. Some question the necessity of the ACTA alongside existing international IPR agreements like the WTO TRIPS Agreement. The ACTA aims to combat counterfeiting and piracy, expanding beyond traditional notions of trademark infringement to include piracy. Stakeholder groups have concerns about the scope and transparency of the ACTA negotiations, with some questioning the necessity of the agreement alongside existing international IPR agreements like the WTO TRIPS Agreement. The ACTA aims to combat counterfeiting and piracy, with negotiations including discussions on the inclusion of patents in the civil enforcement section. The European Union advocated for patent inclusion, while the United States opposed it, leading to a footnote in the final ACTA text allowing parties to exclude patents in civil enforcement. The ACTA negotiations involved discussions on including patents in civil enforcement, with the EU supporting it and the US opposing. The final text allows parties to exclude patents from civil enforcement. Additionally, there were differing views on including trademarks in digital enforcement, with the EU in favor and the US against. The final ACTA text largely excludes trademark counterfeiting in digital enforcement, focusing on copyright infringement. However, it includes a provision for online service providers to disclose information to identify subscribers involved in trademark or copyright infringement. The negotiation process for ACTA has raised concerns about transparency. Some critics argue that the ACTA negotiation lacked transparency and public input, with close consultations with industry representatives but not with consumer groups. The level of secrecy in the negotiations was unprecedented compared to other trade agreements. Calls have been made for increased transparency in the ACTA negotiations by Members of Congress and stakeholders. USTR, Senators Sanders and Brown urge USTR to allow public review and comment on ACTA proposals. USTR defended the lack of public disclosure during negotiations, citing the need for confidentiality to facilitate compromise. A draft of the digital enforcement chapter was shared with cleared advisors and selected groups under non-disclosure agreements. The ACTA negotiation process became more transparent as it advanced, with key elements publicly released in summaries after each round of negotiations. USTR took steps to increase transparency, such as establishing a dedicated ACTA web page and releasing public agendas before each negotiating round. USTR asserts close collaboration with Congress and stakeholders in developing the ACTA, holding meetings and seeking input from various experts and organizations. The USTR sought public comments on the ACTA and held a public meeting with the Department of Commerce to discuss it. Developing countries were not included in the ACTA negotiation, leading to concerns about the agreement's impact on their interests and rights, as expressed by China and India at WTO TRIPS Council meetings. The ACTA agreement may constrain flexibilities in the TRIPS Agreement, limit government's freedom to allocate resources for IPR enforcement, and incorporate ACTA standards in future agreements. Some developing countries question the selection of participants in the ACTA, especially those identified in the USTR's Special 301 report for inadequate IPR protection. The ACTA agreement aims to enhance IPR enforcement, with discussions on expanding to include more countries in the future. The final text includes terms for accession after the signatory period, allowing WTO members to apply. USTR hopes for more countries to join, reflecting a global consensus on strong IPR enforcement. The ACTA agreement aims to enhance IPR enforcement, with discussions on expanding to include more countries in the future. Critics speculate that developing countries may feel pressured to adhere to the ACTA for trade benefits. The debate surrounds the impact of increasing IPR protection on legitimate trade and consumer activities, with IPR-based industries supporting the ACTA for economic growth while consumer rights groups express concerns. Consumer rights, public health, and civil liberty groups argue that ACTA provisions may disrupt legitimate trade and consumer activity. However, negotiating parties maintain that ACTA respects fundamental rights, civil liberties, and contains safeguards to prevent barriers to trade. USTR stated that ACTA will not interfere with signatories' ability to uphold rights and liberties, will align with the TRIPS Agreement, and will not impede the transit of generic medicines or cover patents in the Section on Border Measures. The ACTA will not cover patents in the Section on Border Measures, and it will not require border authorities to search travelers' baggage or electronic devices for infringing materials. Critics are concerned about the potential impact on consumer privacy and the free flow of information, particularly regarding provisions that could lead to ISPs terminating customers' Internet accounts for copyright infringement. This has sparked controversy in the European Union, where some view Internet access as a fundamental human right that should only be revoked by judges. While IPR enforcement is crucial in combating online piracy, critics argue that requiring ISPs to filter communication places undue burdens on them. Civil liberties groups are concerned about the low threshold for terminating consumers' Internet access, advocating for proof of online piracy rather than just allegations. Recent debates on ISP obligations regarding IPR infringement have been fueled by legislation like the PROTECT IP Act and SOPA, which faced opposition and postponement due to civil society groups and Internet-based companies. The final ACTA text does not include provisions for a \"three-strikes\" rule or \"notice-and-takedown\" rules. Instead, it allows competent authorities to order ISPs to disclose information to identify subscribers allegedly involved in infringement. The ACTA also includes provisions on technological protection measures. The ACTA text emphasizes avoiding barriers to legitimate activity and preserving fundamental principles like freedom of expression and privacy. Concerns have been raised about potential negative impacts on trade in legitimate goods due to border enforcement provisions allowing customs officials to seize goods suspected of infringing IPR. Some countries do not currently grant customs officials ex-officio authority, while others do so in limited cases. Customs officials are authorized to seize goods violating copyrights and trademarks, but not for patent violations. Exclusion and cease-and-desist orders for patent-infringing goods are enforced by the U.S. International Trade Commission. Granting ex-officio authority to customs officials is seen as crucial by many business groups to combat counterfeit goods. Critics argue that this could lead to delays and increased trade costs. The ACTA negotiation discussed including patents in border enforcement, raising concerns about undermining trade in generic medicines. Public health advocates feared customs authorities making patent violation determinations could delay legitimate drug imports. Some groups worried about interference with parallel trade, citing seizures of generic medicines in Europe. The final ACTA text's border enforcement section clarifies that patents are not included in seizures for infringement. The ACTA's final text excludes patents and undisclosed information from the border enforcement section, focusing on trademarks and copyrights. Negotiated outside of existing multilateral frameworks, the ACTA has sparked debate over its efficiency in advancing global IPR protection. The advancement of trade negotiations in multilateral venues has stalled in recent years, with the WTO Doha Round and WIPO global patent agenda at a standstill. ACTA negotiating parties assert that the agreement is innovative and independent of current multilateral frameworks, while critics argue that holding negotiations outside of existing frameworks was intentional. Some question the future status of the ACTA as a stand-alone agreement or if it will be incorporated into the WTO. Negotiating parties hope for ACTA standards to be integrated into the WTO framework. There are concerns about the necessity of creating a new IPR agreement given existing international trade agreements and forums addressing global protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights. Supporters of the ACTA argue that it enhances IPR protection and enforcement beyond the WTO TRIPS Agreement, filling gaps in current frameworks. They believe a coalition of countries supporting stronger anti-counterfeiting measures can send a global message on IPR protection, dispelling the perception of unilateral U.S. efforts. The advancement of IPR efforts is primarily a unilateral U.S. initiative, with critics questioning the need for new trade agreements like the ACTA when existing international frameworks are not fully utilized. Some doubt the effectiveness of government-to-government agreements on IPR without increasing legal protections. The ACTA aims to address gaps in the enforcement of IPR laws globally, potentially impacting countries like Canada in enforcing IPR in the digital environment. The 112th Congress may consider its role in the ACTA approval process and whether implementation without congressional approval could raise constitutional issues. The ACTA raises questions for Congress regarding its approval process, oversight, and impact on areas covered by the agreement. Prioritizing forms of IPR infringement, commercial losses, health concerns, and resource allocation are key considerations for Congress. The proposed ACTA raises concerns for Congress regarding resource allocation, federal funds, U.S. trade policy, future IPR protection efforts, and implications for future trade agreements. Additionally, questions arise about the ACTA's impact on negotiating objectives, requirements for future FTAs, and USTR determinations. The European Parliament's rejection of the ACTA raises questions about its prospects for entering into force."
