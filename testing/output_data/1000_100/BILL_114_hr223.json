Funds cannot be used for water infrastructure activities unless it is a green infrastructure project improving habitat in the Great Lakes. No financial assistance can be received from State water pollution control funds or State drinking water funds for these activities. Federal departments or agencies must maintain funding for Great Lakes activities and identify new projects. The Administrator, along with the Great Lakes Interagency Task Force, reviews and revises the Initiative Action Plan every 5 years to guide activities for restoring and protecting the Great Lakes system. Consultation with the Great Lakes community is essential during this process. The Administrator consults with Great Lakes States, Indian tribes, and non-Federal stakeholders for input on the Initiative Action Plan. They are responsible for monitoring progress, reporting to the public, and making project information available on a public website. Additionally, they provide updates to specific congressional committees. The Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works receives yearly progress reports on the Great Lakes restoration Initiative Action Plan and funding allocations to federal departments and agencies. The Appropriations Act, 2010 authorizes $300,000,000 annually for fiscal years 2017-2021 for Great Lakes restoration. This funding does not expand the Administrator's authority under the Initiative Action Plan or the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement. The House of Representatives passed the bill on April 26, 2016. Karen L. Haas is the Clerk."
