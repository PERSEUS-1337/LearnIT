    "content": "According to the Federal Trade Commission, identity theft is the most common complaint from consumers in all 50 states, accounting for over 35% of total complaints received for calendar years 2004-2006. In 2006, out of 674,354 complaints, 36% were related to identity theft. Victims' information was misused for various types of fraud, including credit card fraud (25%), phone/utilities fraud (16%), bank fraud (16%), employment-related fraud (14%), government documents/benefits fraud (5%), loan fraud (5%), and other types of fraud (24%). Identity theft can result in damaged credit records and unauthorized charges. Identity theft victims may experience damaged credit records, unauthorized credit card charges, and bank account withdrawals. They may need to change phone numbers, social security numbers, and addresses falsified by impostors. Federal laws can help victims remove inaccurate credit information and unauthorized charges, while imposing criminal penalties on identity thieves using fraudulent documents. The Identity Theft Assumption Deterrence Act aims to prevent fraud related to identity theft. The Identity Theft Assumption Deterrence Act prohibits fraud related to identification documents, including producing or possessing false identification documents. It is also a federal crime to transfer or use another person's identification without lawful authority for unlawful activities. Committing or aiding unlawful activity that violates federal law or constitutes a felony under state or local law can result in fines or imprisonment up to 15 years. Offenses involving fraud with identification documents can lead to imprisonment of up to three years, but if related to drug trafficking or violence, the term could be up to twenty years. Acts of international terrorism can result in imprisonment as well. The Identity Theft Penalty Enhancement Act, signed in 2004, imposes up to 25 years of imprisonment for facilitating international terrorism. Aggravated identity theft, defined under Title 18 of the United States Code, carries a penalty of two years in addition to the original felony sentence. Offenses related to terrorism can result in an additional five years of imprisonment. The Identity Theft Penalty Enhancement Act of 2004 imposes up to 25 years of imprisonment for facilitating international terrorism and includes penalties for identity theft offenses involving an abuse of position. The act also authorizes appropriations for the investigation and prosecution of identity theft cases. The Fair Credit Reporting Act may assist victims in removing unauthorized charges from their credit files. The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) outlines consumer rights regarding credit reports, requires accuracy in reporting, and allows consumers to sue for violations such as inaccurate information disclosure by credit agencies. The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) allows consumers to sue credit reporting agencies for inaccuracies in their reports, especially in cases of identity theft. The FACT Act, signed in 2003, includes amendments to prevent identity theft and assist victims, creating a national standard for addressing consumer concerns. The FCRA includes provisions to prevent identity theft, such as requiring credit card issuers to follow specific procedures for address changes and truncating account numbers on receipts. Consumers can request fraud alerts and have social security numbers truncated on credit reports. Fraud alerts can be maintained for 90 days or up to seven years with an extended alert. The alert is included in the consumer's credit file and shared with all users of the report. Victims of identity theft can also have fraudulent information blocked from their credit reports with appropriate proof provided to consumer reporting agencies. Consumer reporting agencies must block information related to transactions if it may be a result of identity theft and notify the furnisher. Victims of identity theft can request information about the crime and businesses must provide transaction records upon request and verification of identity. The Fair Credit Billing Act does not specifically address identity theft but allows consumers to dispute charges. The Fair Credit Billing Act (FCBA) aims to protect consumers from inaccurate credit billing practices by allowing them to dispute unauthorized charges and request proof of purchases. Consumers can file claims with creditors to resolve billing errors, and are not required to pay disputed amounts until the issue is resolved. The Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA) provides a framework for resolving billing errors and unauthorized transactions in electronic fund transfers. It requires an investigation into consumer claims and obligates creditors to correct errors and credit the consumer's account. Similar to the Fair Credit Billing Act, the EFTA aims to protect consumers from financial losses due to unauthorized transactions. The Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA) limits a consumer's liability for unauthorized electronic fund transfers. If notified within two business days of loss or theft, liability is limited to $50 or the unauthorized transfer amount. Financial institutions must provide documentation of all transfers initiated by the consumer and investigate any reported errors within 60 days. The Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA) limits a consumer's liability for unauthorized electronic fund transfers to $50 if reported within two business days. Financial institutions must investigate reported errors within 60 days and notify the consumer of the results within 10 business days. If an error is confirmed, the institution must correct it within one day and may provisionally recredit the consumer's account. The President's Identity Theft Task Force recommended a plan in April 2007 to crack down on identity thieves, protect personal information, assist victims of identity theft, and deter theft through prosecution and punishment. The plan focuses on improving data security, making it harder for thieves to obtain consumer data, helping victims recover, and increasing prosecution efforts. The President's Identity Theft Task Force recommended amendments to federal criminal statutes to prosecute identity theft-related offenses more effectively. Recommendations include adding new crimes to the list of predicate offenses for aggravated identity theft, penalizing creators of malicious spyware, and enhancing sentences for identity thieves. The Real ID Rule, established in accordance with the REAL ID Act of 2005, sets standards for issuing driver's licenses and identification cards to meet federal requirements. It includes incorporating security features, verifying applicant identity and citizenship, and ensuring security standards for issuing offices. The Real ID Rule extends deadlines for states to comply with security benchmarks for issuing licenses and identification cards. States meeting requirements can get an extension until May 10, 2011. The rule mandates states to replace non-compliant licenses with REAL ID cards by December 1, 2014, for younger individuals and by December 1, 2017, for older individuals. Effective March 31, 2008."
