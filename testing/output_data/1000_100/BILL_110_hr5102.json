    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Our Nation's Trade, Infrastructure, Mobility, and Efficiency Act of 2007\" or the \"ON TIME Act of 2007\". Congress finds that the growth in international trade, especially containerized trade, is straining the nation's transportation network and causing traffic congestion near major US-international gateways. The value of international trade and the number of containerized trade shipments have been steadily increasing, with existing and potential future trade agreements expected to further exacerbate freight congestion. The United States is facing traffic congestion in cities of all sizes, leading to wasted hours and extra fuel costs amounting to $78 billion annually. Over 200 freight bottlenecks are causing $8 billion in economic losses and 243 million hours of delay each year. Maintaining the current transportation system requires significant efforts. To improve the transportation system's service levels, government investments are crucial. In 2006, $235 billion was invested, with projections of $304 billion in 2015 and $472 billion in 2030. The Act aims to address transportation needs in trade corridors, reduce freight congestion, and mitigate traffic along congested routes due to international trade growth. The Act aims to develop corridors to enhance freight transportation system reliability and improve the quality of life for United States citizens. Establishment and collection of national trade gateway corridor fee. The Secretary of Transportation will establish a national trade gateway corridor fee on imported articles, amounting to .075 percent of the article's value or $500, whichever is less, within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The Secretary of Transportation, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, will assess and collect a fee for eligible projects in transportation trade corridors for imported articles. The fee will be deposited in a specific account and will not apply after fiscal year 2017. Additionally, regulations will be established for an export fee in collaboration with the Secretaries of Homeland Security and Commerce. The Secretary of Commerce will issue regulations for a national trade gateway corridor fee on exported articles from the United States. The fee will be 0.75% of the article's value or $500, whichever is less, and will be collected by the Secretary of Transportation in collaboration with Homeland Security and Commerce. The Secretary of Commerce will assess and collect a fee for eligible transportation trade corridor projects. The fee will be deposited into the \"National Trade Gateway Corridor Fund\" account. The fee will not apply after fiscal year 2017. The Secretary of Commerce will collect a fee for transportation projects, deposited into the \"National Trade Gateway Corridor Fund\" account. The funds will be available for expenditures by the Secretary of Transportation to meet obligations of the United States under this Act before October 1, 2018. SEC. 4. APPORTIONMENT OF FUNDS. The Secretary of Transportation sets aside 2% of funds from the National Trade Gateway Corridor Fund for administrative expenses related to collecting fees on imports and exports. The remaining funds are apportioned to State departments of transportation for eligible projects in transportation trade corridors. The Secretary apportions funds collected from Customs ports of entry among states based on lane miles of Federal-aid highways in transportation trade corridors. The Secretary apportions funds among states based on vehicle miles traveled on Federal-aid highways in transportation trade corridors. Amounts granted to a State are available for a certain period. Amounts granted to a State for eligible projects in transportation trade corridors remain available for obligation for 6 years. Unobligated funds after this period will be allocated to other States for similar projects at the Secretary's discretion. SEC. 5. PROJECT SELECTION AND ELIGIBILITY. The Secretary of Transportation must issue project selection guidelines for State departments of transportation to follow in selecting eligible projects for grants under this Act. Guidelines include consulting with various stakeholders and adhering to planning processes. The Secretary of Transportation must develop a selection process and rating system for projects eligible for grants under this Act, ensuring transparency and accountability in the decision-making process. The grant program under this Act will be developed by the Secretary of Transportation, with a focus on transparency and accountability in project selection. The Secretary of Transportation may grant funds to a State department for projects in transportation trade corridors. Projects must meet specific construction standards and have a federal share of 80 percent. The non-Federal share of the cost for eligible projects under this Act cannot come from other Federal funds. Prevailing wage rates apply to projects receiving assistance under this section. SEC. 7. TRANSPORTATION TRADE CORRIDORS. The Secretary of Transportation, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, shall establish transportation trade corridors for Customs ports of entry, with specific criteria for their boundaries and limitations. These corridors may include areas in multiple contiguous states, extend up to 300 miles from the port of entry, and must be used for international trade-related motor vehicle and cargo movements. The Secretary of Transportation may establish a single transportation trade corridor for multiple ports of entry in close proximity. Within 180 days of enactment, proposed corridor boundaries must be published, with a 45-day comment period for public input. Final corridors must be established within a specified deadline. The Secretary of Transportation must establish final transportation trade corridors within one year of the Act's enactment. Periodic reviews and modifications are required to ensure appropriate boundaries for each Customs port of entry. The Secretary of Transportation must issue regulations within one year of the Act's enactment. Appropriations from the National Trade Gateway Corridor Fund are authorized for fiscal years 2009 through 2018. Grants for highway projects approved by the Secretary are contractual obligations of the Government. Definitions are provided in the Act. The Act defines an \"eligible project\" as a project eligible for assistance under title 23, United States Code, and includes construction or improvements to a publicly owned intermodal freight transfer facility. Projects within a port terminal are limited to surface transportation infrastructure modifications for direct intermodal interchange. The curr_chunk defines key terms related to transportation infrastructure, including \"Federal-aid highway,\" \"State,\" \"State department of transportation,\" and \"United States.\" These definitions are important for understanding the regulations and guidelines in the transportation sector."
