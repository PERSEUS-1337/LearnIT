    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"One Church, One Child Act of 2004\". It includes findings related to the Act. The Congress finds a shortage of qualified foster and adoptive parents, with a decrease in foster parents despite an increase in children in foster care. There is a dire shortage of adoptive parents, with many children awaiting adoption for an average of 44 months. The increase in adoptions from foster care since 1997 has created a growing need for post-adoption support. One Church, One Child is a national foster care and adoption ministry established in 1980 in Chicago, Illinois. It aims to provide services for at-risk children and support adoptive families. Over 140,000 children have been successfully placed in adoptive families through its programs. The One Church, One Child program provides recruitment, training, and support services for foster and adoptive parents. Limited federal funding has been received for programs based on this concept. A federally-funded grant program supporting the establishment of similar programs will increase the pool of qualified adoptive and foster parents, benefiting abused and neglected children. SEC. 479B of the Social Security Act introduces One Church, One Child Grants to support the establishment of programs for foster and adoptive parents. The Secretary will provide competitive grants to eligible entities to establish or expand programs that recruit and train foster and adoptive parents, and provide support services to children and families. Eligible entities include state or local governments, public agencies, nonprofit organizations, and private entities. Entities applying for grants must submit an application with project descriptions outlining programs for children and support services for adoptive and foster parents. Entities applying for grants must describe how they will coordinate with State and local entities for foster parent recruitment, maintain records, reports, and cooperate with audits as required by the Secretary. The term 'State' refers to each of the 50 States and the District of Columbia. The term 'State' includes 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands. Authorization of appropriations is limited to $20,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2005 to 2009. Grant funds must be expended within three years, with any unspent funds returned to the Secretary. Unused grant funds are redistributed by the Secretary. The Secretary shall redistribute funds among eligible entities with a need for additional funds to carry out programs. Religious organizations are considered equally for grants, as long as they comply with the Establishment Clause. State or local governments cannot discriminate against religious organizations seeking to participate in funded programs. Religious organizations are not required to change their internal governance or remove religious symbols to receive grants or participate in funded programs. Funds given to religious organizations cannot be used for sectarian activities. Religious organizations receiving funds must adhere to the same regulations as other nongovernmental organizations and keep the funds in a separate account. SEC. 479C.
