    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Caribbean Coral Reef Protection Act\" and states its policy. The United States policy is to deny financial resources to Cuba to prevent threats to national security, interests, allies, Florida's marine environment, and Cuban people's freedom. Additionally, foreign investments enhancing Cuba's petroleum resources will be deterred. The Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act of 1996 is amended to exclude aliens who contribute to Cuba's development of petroleum resources off its coast. The Secretary of State will deny visas and exclude aliens from the US who invest over $1,000,000 in Cuba's petroleum resources development. Spouses, minor children, or agents of these individuals are also affected. The Secretary of State can waive visa denials for individuals investing in Cuba's petroleum resources development for critical medical reasons, litigation, or if specific Act requirements are met. Definitions include the Cuban Communist Party as an 'agent' and 'instrumentality', and 'develop' refers to petroleum resource activities. Investment in Cuba's petroleum resources involves activities like entering contracts for development or supervision, purchasing ownership shares in development projects. The amendment allows for participation in royalties, earnings, or profits in petroleum development projects, as well as the sale or purchase of goods, services, or technology related to such development. The term 'petroleum resources' includes petroleum, natural gas, by-products, and liquefied natural gas. This amendment applies to aliens seeking admission to the United States after the enactment of the Act. IMPOSITION OF SANCTIONS AND PROHIBITION ON FACILITATION OF DEVELOPMENT OF CUBA'S PETROLEUM RESOURCES. If the President determines that a person has made an investment of $1,000,000 or more after January 10, 2005, contributing to Cuba's petroleum development, sanctions will be imposed, including prohibiting loans and guarantees from U.S. institutions. The sanctions imposed include prohibiting any financial transactions with sanctioned persons, as well as restricting the export of goods or technology to them under various statutes. Prohibitions on financial institutions may include preventing designation as a primary dealer in US Government debt instruments and serving as a repository for government funds. Sanctions may include prohibiting financial institutions from serving as a repository for US Government funds and from procuring goods or services from sanctioned individuals. Sanctions will be lifted if the President certifies that certain requirements of the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act have been met. The Democratic Solidarity (LIBERTAD) Act of 1996 outlines prohibitions on US persons aiding Cuba's petroleum development. The Secretary of State must report on investments exceeding $1,000,000 every 180 days. The LIBERTAD Act of 1996 prohibits US persons from aiding Cuba's petroleum development by investing over $1,000,000 in any 12-month period. Investments of any amount in conjunction with trafficking in confiscated US property are also prohibited. The Secretary of State must report on these investments every 180 days. The LIBERTAD Act of 1996 prohibits US persons from investing in Cuba's petroleum development over $1,000,000 in a year or any amount in confiscated US property. The Secretary of State must report on these investments every 180 days. Additionally, assessments of the environmental impacts of Cuba's petroleum resources development must be submitted annually to specific congressional committees. The Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate submitted a report assessing the impact of Cuba's petroleum development on the environment of submerged lands off Cuba's coast and Florida's marine environment. The Secretary of State will use environmental impact statements as a model for this assessment. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. This section defines key terms used in the Act, including terms like \"person\", \"property\", \"traffics\", \"investment\", and \"petroleum resources\". It also expands the definition of \"person\" to include foreign subsidiaries. Additionally, it includes the Cuban Communist Party under the terms \"agent\" and \"instrumentality\"."
