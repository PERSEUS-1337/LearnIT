    "content": "The \"Family Act of 2011\" is the short title of this Act. It includes findings related to families. Congress finds that infertility is recognized as a disease by the World Health Organization and is considered an emerging public health priority by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Approximately 3,000,000 individuals have infertility according to the CDC. Medical insurance coverage for infertility treatments is limited, with only 8 states requiring comprehensive coverage, and most employer-sponsored plans are exempt. In vitro fertilization is covered by only 19 percent of large employer-sponsored health plans. Out-of-pocket expenses for fertility treatments are significant, with coverage for fertilization at 19% of large employer-sponsored health plans and 11% of small employer-sponsored health plans, even in states with coverage mandates. SEC. 3. CREDIT FOR CERTAIN INFERTILITY TREATMENTS. An amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 introduces a new section providing a credit for infertility treatments. A credit of 50% of qualified infertility treatment expenses, up to $13,360 per eligible individual, can be claimed against the tax imposed for the taxable year. The credit for infertility treatment expenses is reduced based on adjusted gross income, without considering certain sections. No double benefit is allowed if a deduction or credit is taken elsewhere in the tax code. The credit for infertility treatment expenses is limited if reimbursement or compensation is received from federal, state, or local programs, or through insurance policies. The credit amount cannot exceed the regular tax liability for the taxable year. The tax credit for infertility treatment expenses is limited if reimbursement is received from government programs or insurance. The excess credit can be carried forward to the next taxable year. The tax credit for infertility treatment expenses can be carried forward to the next taxable year if it exceeds the limitation imposed for the current year, up to the 5th taxable year after the credit arose. Credits are used on a first-in first-out basis. The term 'qualified infertility treatment expenses' refers to amounts paid for in vitro fertilization treatment administered by a licensed medical practitioner for infertility diagnosed by a US licensed physician. Expenses for fertility preservation procedures conducted before medical treatments that may cause infertility are also included. The term 'infertility' refers to the inability to conceive or carry a pregnancy to live birth, including infertility caused by medical treatments. Expenses for fertility preservation procedures before treatments that may cause infertility are not considered qualified infertility treatment expenses. The term 'eligible individual' in this section refers to someone diagnosed with infertility by a licensed US physician. Married taxpayers must file joint returns, and adjustments for inflation apply to dollar limitations. The dollar amount for cost-of-living adjustments in taxable years is determined by multiplying a specified amount by the adjustment for the calendar year. If the resulting amount is not a multiple of $10, it is rounded to the nearest multiple of $10. Additionally, for taxable years after December 31, 2002, the income limitation amount is increased by a similar cost-of-living adjustment.

Conforming Amendments are made to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Section 23A allows for a credit for certain infertility treatments. Various sections of the Internal Revenue Code are amended to include references to section 23A. These amendments apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 2011."
