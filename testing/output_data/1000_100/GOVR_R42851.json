    "content": "The PACT Act requires remote retailers of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco to pay state and local taxes before delivering goods. Three retailers challenged the Act, citing violations of the Due Process Clause. Previous court cases have established the need for a connection between a state and the taxed entity. The PACT Act's requirement for remote retailers to pay state and local taxes is being challenged in court for violating due process. The U.S. Court of Appeals upheld a preliminary injunction in one case, while another case is pending appeal. Another court rejected the due process argument, stating that the PACT Act is a federal statute that requires compliance with state and local laws. The PACT Act's constitutionality is being questioned in court due to its requirement for remote retailers to pay state and local taxes. The court determined that the Act is similar to other federal statutes incorporating state law and that remote retailers must have minimum contacts with jurisdictions they ship products to. Congress may not have the power to require taxes from retailers without minimum contacts, raising questions about the Act's constitutionality. The Supreme Court in Quill emphasized that minimum contacts are crucial for jurisdiction in lawsuits against out-of-state defendants. It stated that taxes must be related to the taxing state's values. The PACT Act aims to regulate remote sellers of tobacco products and increase tax collection. The PACT Act aims to regulate remote sales of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco by deeming interstate sales as intrastate sales, requiring compliance with all state and local laws, including excise taxes and restrictions on sales to minors. It also mandates that remote sellers pay state and local governments prior to delivery. The PACT Act requires remote sellers to pay state and local taxes on sales of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco before delivery. State taxation of out-of-state businesses is governed by the Commerce Clause and the Due Process Clause. Congress can authorize state activities that comply with the Commerce Clause but not the Due Process Clause. The PACT Act requires remote sellers to pay state and local taxes on sales of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco before delivery. The Commerce Clause and the Due Process Clause are \"analytically distinct.\" Remote retailers have challenged the PACT Act under the Due Process Clause, which is governed by the Supreme Court's opinion in Quill. The Court considered whether out-of-state businesses need a physical presence in a state to satisfy minimum contacts for taxation purposes. The Court upheld Florida courts' jurisdiction over an out-of-state franchisee conducting business remotely in Florida, stating that physical presence is not necessary for jurisdiction. Modern commerce often involves business conducted solely through mail and wire communications across state lines, allowing for jurisdiction even without physical presence. The Quill case established that purposeful direction of business towards residents of another State can establish personal jurisdiction. The Quill case established that purposeful direction of business towards residents of another State can establish personal jurisdiction, as seen in the example of a retailer sending catalogues to North Dakota residents. In Red Earth, members of the Seneca Nation of Indians sought to challenge the PACT Act's tax requirements on their tobacco sales, claiming a violation of the Due Process Clause. The plaintiffs challenged the PACT Act's tax requirements on their tobacco sales, arguing a violation of the Due Process Clause. The United States contended that minimum contacts were established through the plaintiffs' websites and shipping into taxing jurisdictions. However, the court found issues with this argument, noting that not all plaintiffs had websites and that the websites were considered passive. The court ruled that a passive website selling tobacco products did not establish minimum contacts for tax collection, rejecting the argument that each sale created the necessary contacts. The court rejected the idea that a single sale could establish minimum contacts for tax collection, citing previous cases that showed a single sale was not enough. The court emphasized the importance of continuous and widespread solicitation of business in determining jurisdiction. The PACT Act broadens the jurisdictional reach of states and localities without regard to the Due Process Clause. The district court granted a preliminary injunction, which was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The issue at hand is whether Congress can require a vendor to submit to the taxing jurisdiction of any state into which it makes at least one sale, regardless of the extent of the vendor's contact with the state. The court upheld the preliminary injunction on the PACT Act, which requires a seller to collect state and local taxes based on one delivery. The Supreme Court has not definitively ruled on whether a single sale satisfies due process requirements. A court reviewing a preliminary injunction should uphold it when the constitutional question is close. In Musser's case, the plaintiff was a tobacco retailer operating in all 50 states. In Musser's case, the plaintiff, a tobacco retailer operating in all 50 states, sought a preliminary injunction under the PACT Act, arguing that it violates the Due Process Clause by requiring retailers to pay state and local taxes without minimum contacts with the jurisdictions. The district court denied the injunction, stating that the tax-payment requirement is imposed by Congress, not by individual states, and must be analyzed under federal legislation regulating interstate commerce. Congress has long required interstate businesses to comply with state and local laws when engaging in interstate commerce. This requirement does not violate due process and falls under Congress's authority to regulate interstate commerce. The court's analysis may be seen as mixing Congress's Commerce Clause authority with the issue of state taxation on out-of-state businesses without minimum contacts. The court concluded that the plaintiff had minimum contacts in all 50 states due to its interactive website, using the sliding scale approach from Zippo Mfg. Co. v. Zippo Dot Com, Inc. Personal jurisdiction is proper for businesses that conduct transactions over the Internet, while a passive website with basic information does not establish jurisdiction. The court in Musser's case found that the plaintiff had purposefully availed itself of doing business in all 50 states through its interactive website, where customers could place orders, pay, and have products delivered. This level of interactivity and commercial nature satisfied the minimum contacts requirement for personal jurisdiction. The court's reasoning suggests that minimum contacts could be met with a single sale through an interactive website. Gordon, a Seneca Nation member, owns a store and telephone order business selling tobacco products. He sought an injunction against the PACT Act's tax requirements, arguing it violates due process by not requiring minimum contacts. The district court initially denied Gordon's motion as untimely, but the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and remanded the case, deeming the motion timely. The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded the case to the district court, stating that Due Process violations can occur even with Congress authorizing state levies based on minimum contacts. The Supreme Court has clarified that Due Process and Commerce Clause inquiries are distinct. The government argued before the district court that national authorization of state levies on e-commerce may render concerns about presence and burden obsolete. The government argued that Gordon only needed minimum contacts with the United States, not individual states, for the PACT Act. They also claimed each tobacco sale into a state satisfied minimum contacts. The court disagreed, stating the PACT Act imposed a new duty on delivery sellers. The PACT Act imposes a new duty on delivery sellers to ensure state and local taxes are paid. The court rejected the argument that Congress can authorize violations of the Due Process Clause. The Musser's court collapsed the Due Process and Commerce Clause aspects of the PACT Act challenge. The court reviewed key due process cases to determine minimum contacts for personal jurisdiction. The court cited International Shoe Co. v. Washington and Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz to establish the criteria for proper jurisdiction based on purposeful directed efforts towards residents of another state. The court established that proper jurisdiction is based on purposeful directed efforts towards residents of another state, where contacts result from actions creating a substantial connection with the forum State. It is not unreasonable to require submission to litigation burdens in a forum where significant activities have been deliberately engaged in, creating continuing obligations with residents. A single act can support jurisdiction if it establishes a substantial connection with the forum, but acts with only an attenuated affiliation are not sufficient for foreseeable litigation. The district court emphasized the importance of foreseeability in due process analysis, citing World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson. The Supreme Court highlighted that defendants should reasonably anticipate being sued in a particular state based on their conduct. This predictability allows defendants to structure their actions with some assurance of where they may be held liable. Additionally, the court discussed Quill and the requirement of a definite link between a state and the person or transaction being taxed under the Due Process Clause. The Quill standard for due process requires a definite link between a state and the person or transaction being taxed. In Gordon, the court found that the business did not purposefully avail itself of the benefits of the economic market in the states where it sells products. The district court found that the PACT Act may violate due process as there is no clear connection between the state and the benefits received by Gordon, aside from the buyer residing there. In analyzing the constitutionality of the PACT Act, courts have considered whether it violates the Due Process Clause by subjecting out-of-state businesses to state taxation without minimum contacts. The opinion in Musser's may blur the distinction between the Commerce Clause and due process. The PACT Act's constitutionality is being analyzed in relation to the Due Process Clause, with concerns about subjecting out-of-state businesses to state taxation without minimum contacts. The opinion in Musser's may conflate the Commerce Clause and due process, raising questions about whether a single sale into a jurisdiction meets the minimum contacts requirement."
