    "content": "In the short run, the relationship between economic growth and the unemployment rate may be loose. Unemployment may not immediately decrease when economic growth picks up after a recession due to firms having underutilized employees on their payrolls. Employers can initially meet rising demand without hiring by increasing productivity of current employees, temporarily boosting labor productivity growth. In the long run, the relationship between real GDP growth and unemployment is determined by the rates of growth in the labor supply and labor productivity. Okun's law, established in the 1960s, states that there is a negative relationship between changes in real GDP growth and unemployment rates. If real GDP growth exceeds labor productivity growth, employment will rise, leading to a decrease in the unemployment rate. The long-run relationship between changes in GDP growth and unemployment is determined by the rate of growth in potential output. Potential output is the economy's capacity to produce goods and services when resources are fully utilized. When the unemployment rate is high, actual GDP falls short of potential GDP, creating an output gap. In the absence of productivity growth, as long as each new addition to the labor force is employed, growth in output will equal growth in the labor supply. If GDP growth equals labor force growth in the presence of productivity growth, more people will be entering the labor force than are needed to produce goods and services. The share of the labor force that is employed will fall, leading to a rise in the unemployment rate. The unemployment rate will only fall in the long run if GDP growth exceeds the combined growth rates of the labor force and productivity. Policymakers interested in lowering the unemployment rate need to know the rate of GDP growth, which depends on labor force and productivity growth rates. Labor force growth has slowed over time, from 1.6% between 1950 and 2000 to 0.7% per year between 2010 and 2020. Predicting productivity growth is more challenging than predicting labor force growth. Between 1947 and 1973, productivity grew at 2.8% annually, slowing to 1.4% between 1973 and 1995, then accelerating to 2.9% from 1995 to 2005. Since 2005, productivity growth has slowed to 1.6% annually. Real GDP growth above 2.5% is needed to lower the unemployment rate. The current recovery lies within but closer to the high-end of the range for the time it takes for the unemployment rate to start declining after an economic contraction. The current recovery lies within the high-end range for the time it takes for the unemployment rate to start declining after an economic contraction. The pace of decline in the unemployment rate has varied among postwar recessions, with some taking at least eight months to fall by one full percentage point. The slowest decline occurred after the recession that ended in November 2001, where it took about 3\u00bd years for the unemployment rate to fall by half a percentage point. The 1982 downturn began with the highest postwar unemployment rate of 10.8%, falling to 9.4% in eight months. There was a debate over Okun's law and economic growth impact on unemployment. Slow GDP growth in 2011 led to a stalled unemployment rate at 9.0%, but it dropped to 8.5% in December 2011 after output growth accelerated. In March 2012, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board noted a discrepancy between the decline in the unemployment rate and GDP growth in 2011. Despite GDP growth below 2 percent, the unemployment rate decreased, possibly due to a temporary adjustment for a previous deviation from Okun's law. Researchers at the New York Federal Reserve Bank found that Okun's law underpredicted the actual decline in the unemployment rate during previous recessions. Based on their analysis, Owyang and Sekhposyan suggest that the relationship between economic growth and unemployment may vary due to the stage of the business cycle. They caution against relying too heavily on simple calculations linking changes in the unemployment rate to output growth. In contrast, Ball et al argue that Okun's law holds true for both increases and decreases in output, and did not break down during recent jobless recoveries. Between 2009 and 2011, Ball et al found that Okun's Law held true during jobless recoveries, with large output gaps persisting. They believe Okun's Law has earned its name as a strong and stable macroeconomic relationship. Economist Robert J.

Gordon estimates potential output growth at 3.4% annually since 1875, but doubts that growth will be as rapid over the next 20 years due to diminishing gains from information technology investments. He projects a 2.4% rate of growth in potential output. Economists Susanto Basu and John G. Fernald also examined the outlook for growth in potential output, pointing out that household net worth declined significantly during the 2007-2009 recession, affecting the supply of labor. Economists Weidner and Williams analyzed the relationship between real economic growth and past recoveries. They found that potential output growth varied, with rapid growth in the 1960s-1980s, moderate growth in the 1990s-2000s, and sluggish growth after the Great Recession. Uncertainty in estimating growth in potential output is highlighted by factors such as labor supply, financial market disruptions, and investment risks. The Congressional Budget Office projected a slower potential output growth rate of 2.2% between 2012 and 2022, compared to the higher rate of 3.3% between 1950 and 2011. This lower projection is mainly due to reduced potential labor force growth, particularly from increasing retirements among the baby-boom generation. The CBO projected in August 2012 that real GDP growth will be below potential output until 2018. Unemployment is expected to remain above 8.0% through 2014, then decrease to 5.9% by 2017 as the output gap narrows."
