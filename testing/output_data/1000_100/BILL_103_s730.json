    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"United States-Canada Fair Grain Trade Act of 1993\". The Congress finds that Canadian grain exports under the United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement have caused financial losses to American farmers and disrupted domestic grain prices. The Trade Agreement includes consultations with Canada on the price setting policy of the Canadian Wheat Board affecting goods exported to the United States and requires immediate consultation with Canada to exclude transport rates under Canada's Western Grain Transportation. The United States has failed to make progress on consultations regarding the price setting policy of the Canadian Wheat Board and transport rates under Canada's Western Grain Transportation. This failure led to a flawed binational panel decision that undermines the United States-Canada Free Trade Agreement. The United States has incurred costs related to goods under the Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement. TITLE I--GRAIN TRADE NEGOTIATIONS\n\nSEC. 101. PRICE TRANSPARENCY. Negotiations with Canada to determine Canadian Wheat Board prices must be pursued by the President. If negotiations fail within 120 days, Canada will be considered in violation of the US-Canada Free-Trade Agreement. The import of Canadian grain to the United States will be suspended until successful negotiations are completed under the US-Canada Free-Trade Agreement. SEC. 102 of the Act mandates negotiations with Canada to exclude agricultural goods shipped via east coast ports from Canada's Western Grain Transportation Act. If negotiations fail within 120 days, imports of Canadian grain benefiting from transport rates will be suspended until successful negotiations are completed. The President must negotiate with Canada to define \"acquisition price\" in the US-Canada Free-Trade Agreement to include transportation subsidies, payments to producers by the Canadian Wheat Board, and other related expenses. If negotiations fail within 120 days, imports of Canadian grain with transport subsidies will be suspended. The term \"acquisition price\" must be clarified before imports of Canadian grain can resume after successful negotiations under the US-Canada Free-Trade Agreement. SEC. 104. Federal agencies must provide technical assistance to petitioners in countervailing duty cases regarding Canadian subsidies for wheat and barley exports to the US. SEC. 201. Export Enhancement Program can be used to promote grain exports. The Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 is amended to promote grain exports from the US by allowing exporters to compete with Canadian grain producers, considering transportation subsidies and pricing strategies. The Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 is amended to counteract transportation subsidies and pricing strategies used by the Canadian Wheat Board to sell wheat at a price below acquisition cost. The Canadian Wheat Board must ensure the sale of wheat at a price no less than the full acquisition cost until an agreement is reached with the Government of Canada. SEC. 202. AGRICULTURAL EXPORT PROGRAM PROTECTION. Title XV of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 is amended to include a new subtitle called \"Agricultural Export Program Protection\" with defined terms. The \"Agricultural Export Program Protection\" subtitle defines the term \"agricultural trade program\" as various export promotion and international food aid programs administered by the Commodity Credit Corporation, excluding certain programs under the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978. The term 'covered foreign commodity' refers to wheat, feed grains, or soybeans imported into the US. 'Entry' means the import or withdrawal from warehouse. 'Person' includes exporters, assignees, and participants in agricultural trade programs. 'Secretary' refers to the Secretary of Agriculture. The term 'Secretary' refers to the Secretary of Agriculture. 'United States agricultural commodity' has the same meaning as defined in the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978. SEC. 1582. Monitoring of domestic uses made of certain foreign commodities. The documentation for the entry of covered foreign commodities must include an end-use certificate meeting specific requirements. Consignees must submit quarterly reports certifying the percentage of the commodity used and confirming its usage as stated in the end-use certificate. The end-use certificates and quarterly reports required for covered foreign commodities must contain specific information as determined by the Secretary to ensure compliance with regulations. This includes details such as the importer of record and any transfer of ownership of the commodity. The end-use certificates and quarterly reports for covered foreign commodities must include details like the consignee's name and address, country of origin, description and quantity of the commodity, purpose of use, and transporter information. The quarterly reports for covered foreign commodities must include details such as end-use certificates held by the consignee, quantity used, export quantity, commingling with US commodities, and consignee's use during the quarter. The Secretary may require reporting of sales price for covered foreign commodities to facilitate enforcement of trade laws and agreements while ensuring confidentiality of purchasers. The Commissioner of Customs must not allow entry of covered foreign commodities without an end-use certificate. Penalties for violations include customs penalties and civil penalties up to $10,000 for knowingly breaking the rules set by the Secretary. The Secretary will establish regulations for enforcing the section, including rules for quarterly report submission. Violations may result in a civil penalty of up to $10,000. SEC. 1583. Compliance provisions under the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 apply to programs authorized in this subtitle. SEC. 1584. Suspension or debarment for using foreign agricultural commodities in certain agricultural trade programs. The Commodity Credit Corporation must offer a hearing before suspending or debarring a person from participating in an agricultural trade program for using a foreign agricultural commodity in violation of program terms. The Corporation may waive suspension or debarment if the person proves the use was unintentional and the quantity used was less than 1 percent of the total. The Commodity Credit Corporation may waive suspension or debarment if the person proves the unintentional use of a foreign agricultural commodity was less than 1 percent of the total quantity. This section and amendment will take effect 120 days after the enactment of the Act. The Commodity Credit Corporation may waive suspension or debarment if unintentional use of a foreign agricultural commodity was less than 1 percent of the total quantity."
