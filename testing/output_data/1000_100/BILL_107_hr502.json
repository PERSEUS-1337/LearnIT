The Congress finds that the Caribbean region is a significant tourist destination and its issues like unemployment, weak judicial systems, and environmental degradation impact the United States. The public sector in many Caribbean countries needs to improve efficiency, and economic growth in the region lags behind Latin America. The Caribbean region faces challenges such as a lack of highly trained labor, government red tape hindering private sector growth, heavy reliance on few exports and tourism, high transportation costs, and the need for a regional corporate strategy. Small Caribbean countries are experiencing economic and social stress due to declining banana exports. The decline in banana production and potential loss of EU trade preferences are causing economic and social stress in the Caribbean region. This is leading to displacement of small farmers and workers in the banana industry, putting pressure on the economies of these countries. To achieve growth, Caribbean countries need to become more competitive in the global market. The economic and social stress in the Caribbean region is leading to increased crime and illegal immigration to the United States. The United States is concerned about narcotics trafficking in the region and the inefficiency of legal systems. The ecosystems supporting the economies of the Caribbean countries are at risk. Environmental problems, HIV/AIDS prevalence, and economic stress are major issues in the Caribbean region. HIV/AIDS has spread to the general population in some countries, while others are at risk of a rapid acceleration of the epidemic. Inadequate waste management and land use practices contribute to environmental problems in the region. The Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act of 1983 aimed to promote democratic governments and economic growth in the region. A summit in Bridgetown, Barbados in 1997 led to a commitment to cooperation for future challenges. The Bridgetown Barbados Summit resulted in a Plan of Action focusing on trade, economic development, and justice and security. Leaders from Western Hemisphere nations met in Santiago, Chile in April 1998 to discuss economic benefits in the Americas. The United States aims to complete the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) process by 2005 to expand markets for goods and services and ensure safe destinations for foreign investment. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 is amended to provide assistance for the Caribbean region to promote economic development, diversification, trade enhancement, and environmental management.

Assistance under section 499O can support activities to improve governmental institutions in the Caribbean region, including providing technical assistance for customs services, revenue collection, specialized training for judges, and expanding the use of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms.

This includes developing regional business strategies, improving institutions for micro-enterprises, and promoting compliance with international trade agreements. Activities under section 499O aim to enhance economic diversification in the Caribbean region by promoting tourism industry development, agricultural sector diversification, and environmental management capacity building. This includes community-based tourism, sustainable tourism, public-private partnerships, improving production and marketing of non-traditional agricultural commodities, and strengthening environmental management services.
