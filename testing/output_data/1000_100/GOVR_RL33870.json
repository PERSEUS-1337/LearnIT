The President requested $324.2 million for FY2008, with $100 million for state grants and $224.2 million for national programs. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $526.0 million, including $310 million for state grants, while the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $492.5 million. The 107th Congress approved reauthorization legislation for the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act. For FY2006, Congress appropriated $568.8 million for the program, operating at FY2006 levels under a continuing resolution through February 15, 2007. The program aims to prevent drug abuse and violence in and around schools. The Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act aims to prevent drug abuse and violence in schools by awarding state grants and supporting national programs. Funding is provided to SEAs, LEAs, and Chief Executive Officers for creating prevention programs. $650 million was authorized for state grants in FY2002, with funds reserved for specific territories. The Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act allocates funding for state grants to prevent drug abuse and violence in schools. $650 million was authorized for state grants in FY2002, with funds reserved for specific territories such as the Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Indian youth programs, and programs for native Hawaiians. Remaining funds are distributed to states, DC, and Puerto Rico based on population and concentration grants, ensuring no state receives less than a certain percentage of the total allotted amount. The Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act allocates funding for state grants to prevent drug abuse and violence in schools. A limitation provision for national programs funding was included in the FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act but was negated for FY2006. In FY2007, the Administration did not suggest funding for state grants. 20% of the total state allotment goes to the Governor for competitive grants and contracts, with a limit of 3% for administrative costs. In FY2002, SEAs could use up to 3% of their allotments for administrative costs and an additional 1% for a management information system. LEAs must distribute 93% of funds for prevention programs, with 2% allowed for administrative costs. The PART program was designed to collect information on truancy rates, violence, and drug-related crimes in schools. SEAs can use up to 5% of funds for state activities such as capacity building and program improvement. PART is used to evaluate programs across federal agencies. The state grants component of the SDFSC program was rated \"ineffective\" due to lack of demonstrated effectiveness and funds being spread too thinly. Approximately 64% of LEAs received less than $10,000 per year, which was deemed insufficient for effective drug prevention and school safety programs. The program lacked measurable positive outcomes, leading to its proposed termination in FY2007 to prioritize higher-priority programs. The state grants program of the SDFSC was considered ineffective and funds were spread too thinly. The national program component was seen as more promising in achieving important results in drug and violence prevention. The Department of Education used national survey data to assess outcomes. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System data, along with SDFSC state grant recipients' implementation of research-based programs, will be used to determine the prevalence of teen drug use and violence nationwide. The ED is evaluating interventions rigorously and providing grants and technical assistance to improve data collection and analysis for SDFSC programs. National programs are authorized for FY2002 through FY2007 to prevent violence and illegal drug use. The Attorney General administers programs to prevent violence and drug use among students. Up to $2 million may be reserved for evaluating the national impact of the SDFSC program. The Safe Schools/Healthy Students initiative continues. The National Coordinator Initiative allows LEAs to recruit coordinators for drug prevention and school safety programs in all schools with notable issues. Funding for this initiative was expanded under NCLBA. Funding for the Safe Schools/Healthy Students initiative, which aims to reduce alcohol abuse in secondary schools and support mentoring programs for children in middle schools, was terminated in FY2004. National program funds may be distributed as formula grants to states based on school-aged population and ESEA Title I, Part A concentration grants. Competitive grants may also be awarded to LEAs to develop and implement programs for reducing alcohol abuse in secondary schools. The government has authorized various initiatives to assist children in middle schools, including grants for localities affected by hate crimes and the establishment of School Security Technology and Resource Center. Additionally, a National Center for School and Youth Safety will be created to provide emergency assistance. The government has authorized initiatives to assist middle schools, including grants for communities affected by hate crimes and the establishment of a School Security Technology and Resource Center. A National Center for School and Youth Safety will be created to provide emergency assistance, establish an anonymous student hotline, offer consultation on school safety, compile best practices for violence prevention, and reach out to rural and impoverished communities. The President requested $324.2 million for the SDFSC program in FY2008, with $100 million for state grants and $224.2 million for national programs. The House Appropriations Committee recommended a total of $526.0 million for FY2008, including $310 million for state grants and $216.0 million for national programs. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $492.5 million for the SDFSC program, with $310 million for state grants and $182.5 million for national programs. This is $276.5 million more than requested but $76.3 million less than the FY2006 appropriation. The President requested $317.3 million for the SDFS program in FY2006, with Congress appropriating $568.8 million, including $346.5 million for state grants and $222.3 million for national programs. The Administration did not request state grant funding for FY2007 due to fiscal constraints and a PART review finding the SDFSC state grants component \"ineffective.\" The President did not request funding for the mentoring program in FY2008. In FY2007, $19 million was requested for the mentoring program as it was the final year of a phase-out. Congress appropriated $49.3 million for mentoring in FY2006, with a slight reduction due to budget cuts. The Administration did not request funding for the Alcohol Abuse Reduction (AAR) program from FY2005 through FY2008, as it was considered duplicative. Congress allocated $32.7 million for AAR in FY2005 and FY2006, with a slight reduction to $32.4 million in FY2006. The House Appropriations Committee did not recommend funding for AAR in FY2007, but the Senate Appropriations Committee suggested $32.4 million. The program operated at FY2006 levels under a continuing resolution until February 15, 2007. The Gun-Free Schools Act (GFSA) was included in the SDFSCA due to its connection with the SDFSC program. The Gun-Free Schools Act (GFSA) was included in the SDFSCA due to its connection with the SDFSC program. Each state receiving funds under the No Child Left Behind Act must have a law requiring LEAs to expel students bringing weapons to school for one year. The chief administering officer can modify this on a case-by-case basis. LEAs must comply with expulsion requirements and report details to the ED Secretary to receive GFSA funds. The Gun-Free Schools Act (GFSA) requires LEAs to report students bringing firearms to school to the criminal justice system. Exceptions include firearms lawfully stored in locked vehicles on school property or used for approved activities with safety measures. Bills related to school safety in the 109th Congress mostly died, except for H.R. 3010, which mandated a study on violence prevention effectiveness by the ED Secretary. In the 109th Congress, various bills related to school safety were introduced, including H.R. 3010 mandating a study on violence prevention programs. Other measures included bills focusing on bullying prevention, school violence prevention, student and teacher safety, drug-free varsity sports, and fighting gangs. The Bullying and Gang Prevention for School Safety and Crime Reduction Act of 2005 (H.R. 283) and H.R. 284 were introduced in the 109th Congress to amend the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act (SDFSCA) to include bullying and gang prevention programs. These bills aimed to enhance school safety by creating accountability-based programs. The School Violence Prevention Act of 2005 (H.R. 3655) and the Student and Teacher Safety Act of 2006 (H.R. 5295) aimed to address bullying and harassment in schools by including them under the definition of violence and implementing prevention programs. H.R. 3655 was introduced by Representative Baca and H.R. 5295 was introduced by Representative Geoff Davis, both referred to the House Education and the Workforce Committee. The House passed H.R. 5295 in 2006, and it was then referred to the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee in the Senate. The Drug Free Varsity Sports Act of 2005 (S. 1974) introduced by Senator Bill Nelson aimed to conduct statewide pilot programs testing high school students for performance-enhancing drug use. LEAs would be required to have policies allowing searches of students under reasonable suspicion for weapons or drugs on school property to receive SDFSCA funds. The Fighting Gangs and Empowering Youth Act of 2006 introduced by Senator Menendez aimed to reauthorize SDFSCA, increase state grants authorization level, allocate funds for national programs, hire gang prevention coordinators, and prioritize mentoring program grants. The ED Secretary would prioritize mentoring programs for elementary and middle school children in rural and high crime areas, troubled homes, or schools with violence issues. An Anti-Gang Discretionary Grant would allocate $50 million for nonprofit groups to combat gang activity in schools and communities, with a focus on high-crime areas. H.R. 354, the Safe Schools Against Violence in Education Act, is the only bill related to SDFSCA introduced in the 110th Congress. H.R. 354, the Safe Schools Against Violence in Education Act (SAVE Act), introduced in the 110th Congress, aims to amend the ESEA to allow students in unsafe school environments to transfer to safer schools within the same district. The bill also includes provisions for counseling and removal of offenders. H.R. 354, the SAVE Act, allows students who become victims at school, on a school bus, or at a school function to transfer to a safe public school within the same district. The bill does not use the term \"persistently dangerous\" and includes provisions for counseling and offender removal. The Administration proposes consolidating the SDFSC national programs into one flexible discretionary grant program focusing on emergency planning, violence and drug-use prevention, school culture, and other emerging needs to improve the learning environment. Congress may also consider requiring K-12 schools to report school crime data to law enforcement agencies. The Department of Education's data on school crime and violence are based on surveys and studies, not actual reported crimes. Consideration may be given to transferring responsibility for school safety and crime data collection to the Department of Justice, which has expertise in public safety and crime analysis. The effectiveness of state grant programs in preventing illicit drugs and alcohol use, suicide, and other issues was found to be lacking, suggesting a need for restructuring. The responsibility for illicit drugs and alcohol prevention, suicide prevention, and related education programs could remain at the Department of Education in collaboration with public health experts at HHS. School safety, security, and emergency preparedness programs might be placed under the direction of DOJ due to its public safety expertise. Legislation allowing K-12 schools to apply for DHS funding for increased security against possible terrorist attacks is also being considered. State education officials may face pressure to define persistently dangerous schools in a way that local schools would never meet the criteria, leading to potential legal concerns across different states. School officials may underreport crime and violence to avoid being labeled as persistently dangerous, impacting their ability to obtain funding for violence prevention grants. The lack of data may prevent schools from qualifying for violence prevention grants. The 'persistently dangerous' component of NCLB lacks funding to help schools improve safety programs, while budgets cut funds for school safety."
