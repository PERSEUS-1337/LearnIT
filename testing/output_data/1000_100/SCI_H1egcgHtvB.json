    "content": "When translating natural language questions into SQL queries for database queries, contemporary semantic parsing models struggle to generalize to unseen database schemas. A unified framework based on relation-aware self-attention mechanism addresses schema encoding, schema linking, and feature representation in a text-to-SQL encoder. This framework improves exact match accuracy to 53.7% on the Spider dataset, compared to 47.4% for the previous state-of-the-art model. The model also shows qualitative improvements in schema linking and alignment, unlocking the potential of querying databases with natural language. Query databases with natural language has the potential to unlock the power of large datasets for users not proficient in query languages. Research focuses on translating natural language questions into executable database queries using annotated datasets like WikiSQL and Spider. Schema generalization is challenging due to non-overlapping databases between train and test sets. Schema generalization for text-to-SQL semantic parsing is challenging due to the need to encode schema information, including column types and relationships, and align natural language references to database columns/tables. While schema encoding has been studied, schema linking, which involves aligning references in questions to schema elements, is less explored. The challenge of ambiguity in linking references in text-to-SQL semantic parsing is illustrated in Figure 1. Resolving column/table references requires considering schema relations and question context. Previous work addressed schema representation by encoding foreign key relations with a graph neural network. However, this approach lacks contextualization with the question and limits information propagation during schema encoding. In this work, a unified framework called RAT-SQL is presented for encoding relational structure in database schema and questions. It utilizes relation-aware self-attention for global reasoning over schema entities and question words, along with structured reasoning over predefined schema relations. RAT-SQL achieves 53.7% exact match accuracy on the Spider test set, setting a new state-of-the-art among models. Semantic parsing of natural language to SQL queries has gained popularity with datasets like WikiSQL and Spider. RAT-SQL, with relation-aware self-attention, achieves state-of-the-art accuracy of 53.7% on the Spider test set. It enables accurate internal representations of question alignment with schema columns and tables. WikiSQL has simpler schema encoding compared to Spider due to lack of multi-table relations. Schema linking is more challenging in Spider due to richer natural language expressiveness and less restricted SQL grammar. The recent state-of-the-art models in semantic parsing achieve high accuracy on datasets like WikiSQL and Spider. IRNet and Bogin et al. focus on schema encoding and linking, using LSTM, self-attention, and graph neural networks for encoding. They employ AST-based decoders for query generation, emphasizing the importance of schema representation in natural language to SQL translation. The relational framework of RAT-SQL provides a unified way to encode arbitrary relational information among inputs, unlike Global-GNN which applies global reasoning between question words and schema columns/tables. RAT-SQL allows encoding arbitrary relations between question words and schema elements. The relation-aware transformer mechanism in RAT-SQL allows for encoding complex relationships between question words and schema elements using self-attention. This extends previous work by Shaw et al. (2018) which only focused on word sequences in machine translation. RAT-SQL is the first to apply relation-aware self-attention to joint representation learning with predefined and softly induced relations in input structures. The RAT-SQL framework applies relation-aware self-attention to encode complex relationships between natural language questions and database schemas. It aims to generate SQL queries based on the input question and schema, utilizing predefined and softly induced relations. The desired program P is represented as an abstract syntax tree T in the context-free grammar of SQL, with primary and foreign keys in the schema. Schema linking aligns question words with columns or tables, crucial for generating SQL queries. An alignment matrix is used to model latent alignment, biased towards string-match relations. The database schema is represented using a directed graph to support reasoning about relationships between schema elements. The database schema is represented as a directed graph with nodes representing tables and columns labeled with their names and types. An initial representation is obtained for each node using a bidirectional LSTM over the label words. The output of the LSTM is concatenated to form the node embedding. The initial representations of nodes are obtained using a bidirectional LSTM over label words. Self-attention, which is relation-aware, is then used to incorporate schema graph information into these representations. The encoder in our model utilizes relation-aware self-attention layers to process input elements. Each layer has its own set of weights, and after passing through the stack of encoder layers, we obtain descriptions of edge types in the directed graph representing the schema. Edges exist between nodes based on specific criteria listed in a table. The encoder in our model uses relation-aware self-attention layers to process input elements and obtain descriptions of edge types in the directed graph representing the schema. Different relation types are defined and mapped to embeddings to obtain values for each pair of elements in x. In schema linking, relation types are defined to align question text with schema columns/tables. Additional types are added beyond those in Table 1 to cover all pairs of elements in the graph. In schema linking, relation types are defined to align question text with schema columns/tables. Specifically, n-grams are matched to column/table names for different types of matches. A total of 33 types are considered, including exact match and partial match. Memory-Schema Alignment Matrix captures the correspondence between columns/tables in SQL queries and natural language questions. To improve model performance in schema linking, relation-aware attention is applied as a pointer mechanism between memory elements and columns/tables. Alignment matrices are computed to encourage sparsity and align question words with specific schema elements. An auxiliary loss function is used to strengthen the model's belief in the alignment, enhancing the correspondence between SQL queries and natural language questions. The model uses alignment loss to strengthen its belief in the correspondence between SQL queries and natural language questions. It generates SQL queries as abstract syntax trees using a decoder, updating the LSTM's state based on previous actions and embeddings. The model utilizes LSTM cells and multi-head attention for generating SQL queries as abstract syntax trees. It employs PyTorch for implementation and GloVe word embeddings for preprocessing, with bidirectional LSTMs and recurrent dropout for training. The model uses a recurrent dropout method with a rate of 0.2 and 8 relation-aware self-attention layers on top of bidirectional LSTMs. Parameters such as d x, d z, H, inner layer dimension, rule embeddings size, node type embeddings size, hidden size, and dropout rates are specified. The Adam optimizer with default values in PyTorch is used, along with a learning rate schedule and batch size of 20 for training up to 40,000 steps. The model in PyTorch is trained with a batch size of 20 for 40,000 steps using the Spider dataset. The training data includes examples from various datasets like Restaurants, GeoQuery, Scholar, Academic, Yelp, and IMDB. Evaluations are mostly done on the development set due to test set accessibility restrictions. Results are reported based on exact match accuracy and difficulty levels specified in the dataset. The model RAT-SQL is evaluated for accuracy on examples from various datasets and difficulty levels. It outperforms other approaches on the test set and comes close to beating the best BERT-augmented model. Performance drops with increasing difficulty, and there is potential for further improvement with BERT augmentation. The generalization gap between development and test was affected by a drop in accuracy on hard questions. An ablation study showed that schema linking significantly improves accuracy. The alignment between questions and database schema columns is crucial for model performance. In the final model, the alignment loss terms did not impact overall accuracy, despite earlier improvements. Hyper-parameter tuning may have eliminated the need for explicit alignment supervision. An accurate alignment representation has benefits, such as identifying question words for copying when needed. The model correctly identifies corresponding columns for key words in the alignment matrix. In this work, a unified framework is presented to address schema encoding and linking challenges in semantic parsing of text to SQL. The framework utilizes relation-aware self-attention to learn schema and question word representations based on their alignment with predefined schema relations, leading to significant state-of-the-art improvements. The RAT framework combines predefined schema relations and self-attended relations for text-to-SQL parsing, leading to state-of-the-art improvements. A joint representation learning approach is seen as beneficial for various tasks with predefined structure. An oracle experiment was conducted to assess decoder performance in selecting the correct column, even with schema encoding and linking enhancements. The oracle experiments showed that using \"oracle sketch\" and \"oracle cols\" significantly improved the decoder's accuracy in selecting the correct column or table. The results indicated that most questions had both column and structure errors, highlighting the need for further improvement in these areas."
