    "content": "The \"Swine Producers Market Loss Assistance Act of 1999\" includes sections on short title, table of contents, findings and purposes, definitions, market loss assistance, payment amounts, relationship to other payments, emergency requirements, livestock market reporting, and regulations. The Swine Producers Market Loss Assistance Act of 1999 highlights the adverse effects of changes in marketing relationships between swine producers and meat packers on swine prices. The concentration of the meat packing industry and increased imports of live swine have impacted slaughter capacity and prices in the United States. A swine market price crisis occurred from October 1, 1998, to December 31, 1998, due to these factors. In December 1998, the swine market faced challenges with a 10% increase in swine available for slaughter, an 8% decrease in packer slaughter capacity, and a 37% rise in Canadian swine imports to the US. The fourth quarter of 1998 saw the lowest live swine prices in the US spot market for the 20th century, dropping 37% compared to 1932. Swine producers experienced a $2.6 billion reduction in equity capital investment value in 1998. In 1998, swine producers received only $0.22 of the consumer pork dollar, marking the first time they received less than 30% of the total. Despite stable retail prices, pork consumption increased by 7%, the only meat protein to see a rise in per capita consumption that year. The purpose of the Act is to compensate swine producers for losses incurred due to adverse economic factors in the market. The swine market faced adverse economic factors and the Federal Government's failure to pursue foreign trade opportunities, leading to limitations on imports that negatively impacted the industry already under stressed market pricing conditions. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, definitions are provided for terms such as \"swine,\" \"swine producer,\" \"crisis period,\" \"packer,\" \"feeder pig,\" and \"swine operation.\" These definitions clarify the specific meanings of these terms within the context of the Act. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Agriculture in the United States, specifically for individuals who raised swine during the crisis period. SEC. 4. MARKET LOSS ASSISTANCE. The Secretary of Agriculture will provide financial assistance to swine producers to offset market losses during the crisis period. Eligibility requires maintaining a swine operation and marketing swine for slaughter. Certain producers, like those affiliated with publicly owned packers, are ineligible for assistance. The Secretary of Agriculture will provide financial assistance to swine producers to offset market losses during the crisis period. Eligibility requires maintaining a swine operation and marketing swine for slaughter. Assistance will be limited to eligible swine producers through an application process outlined in the Act and related regulations. Swine producers must submit necessary information for the Secretary to determine eligibility for assistance. SEC. 5. PAYMENT AMOUNTS AND PAYMENT LIMITATIONS. Assistance under this Act will be distributed fairly and equitably to swine producers who have incurred losses. Payments to eligible producers will not exceed $25.00 per slaughter-weight swine or $9.00 per feeder pig marketed during the crisis period. Payments will be calculated based on regulations issued by the Secretary. Payments to swine producers during the crisis period will be determined by multiplying the number of eligible swine marketed and slaughtered by $25.00, adding the number of eligible feeder pigs marketed multiplied by $9.00, and deducting payments received from another program. Payment limitations are set at $50,000 per swine operation. SEC. 6. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER PAYMENTS. Assistance provided under this Act is in addition to assistance, payments, and loans obtained under various other programs such as the Agricultural Market Transition Act, noninsured crop assistance program, crop insurance indemnities, and emergency loans for 1998 production. Payments made to swine producers under the Small Hog Operation Program of the Department of Agriculture will be deducted from payments made under this Act. SEC. 7. EMERGENCY REQUIREMENT; USE OF COMMODITY CREDIT CORPORATION.\n\nCongress designates amounts in this Act as an emergency requirement. The Secretary will utilize the Commodity Credit Corporation for Act provisions.\n\nSEC. 8. MANDATORY LIVESTOCK MARKET REPORTING.\n\nA new section on mandatory livestock market reporting is added to the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946. In this section, livestock is defined as cattle, sheep, and swine, whether alive or dead. Livestock product refers to any product derived from livestock, including boxed beef, boxed lamb, and pork-related value-added products. A packer is defined as a person involved in buying livestock for slaughter, processing livestock products, or marketing unmanufactured livestock products in commerce. The term 'prices, volume, and terms of sale' in the context of livestock includes various pricing factors and quality characteristics. The term 'Secretary' refers to the Secretary of Agriculture. Mandatory reporting is required for packers estimated to be involved in a significant portion of livestock transactions in the United States. The Secretary of Agriculture requires packers to report information on prices, volume, and terms of sale for domestic and imported livestock and livestock products. Packers must separately report domestic and imported items. The Secretary of Agriculture mandates packers to report price, volume, and sales terms for domestic and imported livestock products. Packers must comply with reporting requirements by the next business day. Noncompliance is unlawful, and the Secretary can verify information accuracy and enforce penalties for violations. The Secretary of Agriculture can issue a cease and desist order and impose a civil penalty of up to $10,000 for each violation by packers who violate reporting requirements. Factors considered for the penalty include the seriousness of the offense, the size of the business, and the impact on the packer's ability to operate. If necessary, the case can be referred to the attorney general after the appeal period. The Secretary may refer unpaid civil penalties to the Attorney General for recovery in court. Voluntary reporting is encouraged for packers not under mandatory reporting. Information received must be made available to the public in a timely manner. The paragraph outlines requirements for confidential reporting in transactions, protecting parties' identities and proprietary information. It also states that the reporting requirement will expire after three years. The Packers and Stockyards Act, 1921, as amended in 1999, is repealed. SEC. 9. REGULATIONS. The Secretary and the Commodity Credit Corporation must issue regulations promptly after the enactment of the Act to implement it. The regulations will address misrepresentations, appeals, and entitlement to benefits without following certain notice and comment provisions. The Secretary must issue regulations promptly to implement the Act, including addressing misrepresentations, appeals, and entitlement to benefits. The Secretary shall use the authority provided under section 808(2) of title 5, United States Code for congressional review of agency rulemaking."
