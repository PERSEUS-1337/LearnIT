UNICEF reported a 60% decrease in under-five mortality since 1960, but daily deaths among children under five remain high. The report focuses on USAID's global health programs for child survival and maternal health from FY2001 to FY2008. Despite a 60% decrease in under-five mortality since 1960, around 26,000 children still die each day. Most child deaths occur in developing countries, with nearly 90% caused by neonatal infections and five infectious diseases. Undernutrition is a significant underlying cause of these deaths. Maternal and child health are crucial indicators of overall health conditions. Supporters use MDGs to show the link between health and development, focusing on child and maternal mortality reduction. Progress in MDGs like undernourishment and clean water access affects maternal and child mortality rates. UNICEF reports lack of progress in child survival goals, especially in Africa. Child survival and maternal health are closely connected. UNICEF emphasizes the link between child survival and maternal health in Africa. Over 500,000 women die annually from pregnancy-related causes, with millions more suffering long-term effects. Developing countries have higher maternal mortality rates, with preventable deaths linked to inadequate diets, water, sanitation, literacy, and healthcare during pregnancy. Undernutrition contributes to 20% of maternal deaths, while obstetric complications cause 75%. Maternal mortality and morbidity rates are higher for mothers under 20 due to pregnancy complications like toxemia, anemia, and premature delivery. Adolescents have higher risk of delivering low birth weight babies and are more likely to die from childbirth compared to women in their twenties. Girls aged 15-19 are twice as likely to die from childbirth, while those under 15 are five times as likely. The United Nations estimates that adolescents give birth to 15 million infants annually. In Mali, the maternal mortality rate is higher for girls aged 15-19 (178 per 100,000 live births) compared to women aged 20-34 (32 per 100,000). Hemorrhage is a significant cause of maternal deaths in Africa and Asia. Regions with fewer skilled health attendants at birth have higher maternal mortality rates. Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest maternal mortality rate, with 43% of births assisted by skilled attendants. In many countries, maternal mortality rates are high, with significant disparities between different regions. Lack of skilled health workers contributes to higher mortality rates, especially in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. UNICEF reports that many countries lack the capacity to reduce maternal and child deaths, with only a few meeting the minimum health workforce standards. Access to healthcare, clean water, and nutritious food are crucial for improving child and maternal survival rates. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates a critical shortage of healthcare workers globally, with sub-Saharan Africa facing the greatest proportional shortage. WHO suggests that an additional 4.3 million health workers are needed worldwide, with African countries needing to increase their healthcare workforce by about 140% to meet the minimum threshold of 2.5 health care professionals per 1,000 people. The U.S. Agency for International Development leads efforts to improve child survival globally through research and interventions. USAID has committed over $6 billion in the past 20 years to support global child survival efforts, with a significant portion allocated to addressing key health issues causing child deaths in developing countries. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization highlights that nearly 10 million children die each year, with undernutrition contributing to half of these deaths. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) states that the majority of the 10 million children who die each year could be saved if not for hunger and malnutrition weakening their immune systems. WHO-supported studies show that undernourished children are more likely to die from infectious diseases. Good nutrition improves child survival, health, and cognitive development, while undernutrition impairs the immune system, leading to higher risks of death from common childhood illnesses. USAID's nutrition programs focus on micronutrient supplementation and fortification, including adding vital immune-building micronutrients to processed foods. They also fund research on biofortified crops to improve the nutrient content of basic foods. These programs are integrated with interventions like safe water and sanitation to combat common childhood illnesses and improve child survival. USAID emphasizes the importance of proper feeding practices for infants, stating that malnutrition-related deaths are often linked to poor feeding habits in the first two years of life. They highlight that less than one third of infants are exclusively breastfed for the recommended six months, leading to increased risk of diseases. USAID-supported studies show that exclusively breastfed infants have fewer childhood illnesses and are less likely to die from respiratory or diarrheal diseases. Continuing breastfeeding during illness also helps protect infants from energy and protein loss. USAID integrates safe infant feeding practices with HIV/AIDS programs, spending $30 million annually on nutrition programs. UNICEF recommends minimizing indoor pollution, adequate nourishment, exclusive breastfeeding, and Vitamin A and zinc supplements to prevent pneumonia. Children should receive full immunizations against infections like Hib and pertussis to prevent pneumonia. International health organizations aim to expand access to vaccines against Streptococcus pneumoniae. Since 2002, USAID has supported immunizations for nearly 500 million children and treated over 375 million cases of child pneumonia. The Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) strategy, developed by UNICEF and WHO with USAID support, integrates interventions for various childhood illnesses. Approximately 40% of the world's population, mainly in the poorest countries, are at risk of malaria, with over 500 million people severely ill each year. Malaria is most prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa but also affects other regions, causing significant mortality, especially among children. The President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) aims to reduce malaria deaths by 50% in targeted countries by 2010. USAID coordinates PMI activities with CDC to increase support for international malaria programs. The initiative's advancements are not reported by agency, making it difficult to distinguish USAID's contributions. In its first year, PMI reached over 6 million people and within two years, reached more than 25 million. Activities included indoor residual spraying, distributing insecticide-treated nets, training health workers, and purchasing anti-malarial tablets to reduce the impact of malaria in pregnancy. The risk of mother-to-child HIV transmission can be reduced to 2% with successful interventions. About 33% of HIV-positive pregnant women in resource-limited countries receive drugs for prevention. Nevirapine, costing $0.29-$0.40 per dose, is commonly used. Early diagnosis and ART for children are crucial as HIV progresses faster in them. The cost of ART for children is significantly higher than for adults, estimated at $260 per child annually. The cost of generic ARTs for children is around $260 per year, while for adults it is about $183. Fixed-dosed treatments are most effective but more expensive for children. The Clinton Foundation negotiated lower prices for pediatric ARTs, charging about $0.16 per day. Other treatments like Cotrimoxazole for pneumonia can also improve child survival among HIV-positive children. Cotrimoxazole, a drug used to treat pneumonia, reduces mortality in HIV-positive children by 30% at a cost of $0.03 per day or $10 per year. USAID has spent $6 billion on HIV/AIDS interventions in over 100 countries since 1986. PEPFAR has provided $289.2 million for care and support to 2.7 million orphans and vulnerable children, reaching 332,000 OVC through food and nutrition programs. PEPFAR's child-focus programs support training for those who care for OVC, promote the use of time- and labor-saving technologies, support income-generating activities, and connect children and families to essential health care and other basic social services. The Administration asserts that support for people living with HIV/AIDS who receive treatment, care, and support services should also be considered when analyzing support for children. Through September 2007, PEPFAR has committed $1.5 billion for programs offering care and support to people living with HIV/AIDS, with nearly $191.5 million dedicated to pediatric treatment for 85,900 children in FY2006 and FY2007. Since 2002, USAID has provided over $1.5 billion for treating child diarrhea with ORS, preventing infant HIV infections through PMTCT services, and controlling diarrheal disease by training health workers and promoting breastfeeding. USAID focuses on expanding community capacity to administer ORS and promoting hygiene to reduce diarrhea prevalence among children. Handwashing with soap can decrease diarrhea prevalence by 42% to 46%, but it is not common in poorer communities. USAID supports public-private partnerships to promote handwashing with soap and other hygienic practices, which can reduce diarrhea prevalence by 30% to 40%. The WHO emphasizes the cost-effectiveness of measles immunization, with the vaccine costing less than $1 per dose. In countries where rubella and mumps are prevalent, the measles vaccine is often combined with other vaccines. The cost of a bundled dose ranges from $0.65 to $1.50 if purchased through UNICEF. In 2006, 80% of children were vaccinated for measles, up from 72% in 2000. 478 million children received measles vaccinations from 2000 to 2006. Global measles mortality decreased by 68% during this time, with Africa seeing a 91% reduction in cases and deaths. USAID supports immunization programs but does not specify its approach to measles. USAID-supported immunization programs in over 100 countries train health workers, improve service delivery, and partner with organizations like GAVI and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Maternal health programs focus on ensuring healthy pregnancy outcomes through various interventions like nutritional supplementation, immunizations, and HIV prevention. USAID advocates for skilled birth attendance and community contingency planning for all births. USAID trains birth attendants to prevent infant deaths by facilitating infant breathing, resuscitating, and providing care for birth asphyxia, cord and eye care, and immediate breastfeeding. Community-based interventions teach families to recognize birth complications, arrange transportation to a hospital, find a blood donor, and save for healthcare costs. USAID addresses key causes of maternal mortality, with 32% attributed to postpartum hemorrhage. To prevent postpartum hemorrhage deaths, USAID urges communities to ensure mothers give birth with a trained health care practitioner who can administer drugs and apply life-saving techniques. USAID-supported programs train birth attendants to manage labor's third stage, preventing 60% of hemorrhages. Sepsis or infections cause nearly 10% of maternal deaths, with unhygienic delivery practices identified as a key factor. The study identified unhygienic delivery practices as a key cause of sepsis, with practices such as using unclean hands, herbs, or cloths during delivery contributing to the condition. USAID supports distributing delivery kits and training birth attendants to prevent sepsis. Additionally, USAID trains healthcare providers to recognize and treat hypertensive disorders, which account for a significant percentage of maternal deaths in various regions. Prolonged or obstructed labor can lead to complications for both the mother and baby, including obstetric fistula. Young girls and women in low-resource settings are at higher risk due to underdeveloped pelvic regions. Obstetric fistula can be prevented by delaying labor and providing proper obstetric care. Obstetric fistula prevention programs focus on delaying pregnancy, providing access to emergency obstetric care, and integrating with other maternal health programs. USAID has supported fistula prevention and repair programs since 1989 and 2005, respectively. Key activities include training on identifying labor complications, promoting access to emergency care, and reducing stigma around obstetric fistula. WHO estimates complications from unsafe abortions. Complications from unsafe abortions account for 13% of maternal deaths worldwide, with regional variations. USAID's international family planning programs have helped avert an estimated 4 million maternal deaths over the last 20 years. Appropriations to USAID's global health programs, including HIV/AIDS, grew significantly from FY2001 to FY2003. During FY2004 through FY2008, appropriations for HIV/AIDS programs increased by 65% and 24%, reflecting support for the President's International Mother and Child HIV Prevention Initiative. Majority of funds were directed to tuberculosis and malaria programs, with strong support for the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. Discussions about USAID's health programs focused on global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs, with some questioning the Administration's allocation towards other global health interventions. During FY2004 through FY2008, Congress provided $19.7 billion for global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs, while $4.6 billion was allocated to USAID's child survival, maternal health, family planning, and reproductive health initiatives. Appropriations for HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria far exceeded support for other health programs. Congress consistently increased funding for USAID's global health programs during President George W. Bush's administration. During President George W. Bush's administration, Congress supported targeted disease-specific global health programs, including the President's International Mother and Child HIV Prevention Initiative, PEPFAR, and the President's Malaria Initiative. While funding for HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs increased significantly, appropriations for child survival and maternal health initiatives remained relatively unchanged. Concerns were raised about the underfunding of life-saving interventions for women and children, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. The World Health Organization states that two-thirds of child deaths in sub-Saharan Africa are preventable through low-cost interventions. Concerns have been raised about the lack of funding for child survival and maternal health programs, urging Congress to increase support for a wider range of health issues, including voluntary family planning to improve maternal and child health. USAID highlights the benefits of family planning in reducing high-risk pregnancies, preventing HIV/AIDS, reducing abortions, and protecting the environment. Family planning can help improve the morbidity and mortality rates of adolescent girls in developing countries, where early marriage and childbirth are common. Research shows that young mothers are at higher risk of delivering low-birthweight babies and experiencing pregnancy complications. Girls aged 15-19 are at a higher risk of childbirth-related deaths compared to women in their twenties, with those under 15 being at an even greater risk. Young mothers are also more likely to develop obstetric fistula. In Kenya, 45% of all obstetric fistula cases are among adolescents. Delaying pregnancy until pelvic region is fully developed and performing caesarean surgery can prevent obstetric fistula. Repairing the condition costs about $300, which is prohibitive for many young girls and women in affected countries. Advocates suggest increasing spending on health systems to reduce maternal and child mortality by improving various health strategies and access to essential services. Improvements in health systems and availability of health workers are crucial for providing essential interventions like vaccinations to reduce mortality nationwide. Supporters urge Congress to coordinate health assistance with other donors and health ministries for better efficiency and outcomes. The International Health Partnership and related Initiatives (IHP+) promote collaboration among international health agencies, governments, and donors to improve health and development outcomes in developing countries. A compact is a contract between countries and development partners to support a national health plan with predictable financing. It binds donors and governments to one health plan, budget, and monitoring process. Critics highlight the importance of political will in health spending by developing countries. Many developing countries have minimal health spending due to a lack of political will. African leaders have pledged to increase health spending, with the Abuja Declaration aiming for at least 15% of national budgets to be allocated to healthcare. According to the Progress Report on the Implementation of the Abuja Declarations, 33% of AU States allocated 10% or more of their budgets to health care by 2004. Only Botswana met the 15% target. Some argue that structural adjustment programs and lending practices limit African governments' ability to increase health investments. Shrunken health budgets have led to a decline in health worker education and training opportunities, shortage of supplies, medicine, and vaccines, and a brain drain of African health workers. The impact of structural adjustment, conditional lending, and health reform on public health infrastructures is debated, with mixed results reported. Several bills introduced in the 110th Congress aimed to improve maternal and child health, including H.Amdt. 360 to H.R. 2764 which increased support by $5 million for FY2008. H.R. 5501 and S. 2731 authorized significant funding for international HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria interventions, with a focus on providing maternal and child services. The House passed a bill calling for linkages to NGOs implementing multi-sectoral approaches for HIV/AIDS education and testing in family planning and maternal health programs. The Senate version of the bill does not include language on family planning. Additionally, H.R. 1302 and S. 2433 aim to reduce global poverty and improve maternal and child health as part of a comprehensive strategy. The House passed bills focusing on improving maternal and child health in developing countries. H.R. 2266 and S. 1418 provide assistance for newborns, children, and mothers, while H.R. 1225 aims to enhance family planning programs. H.R. 2114 focuses on repairing young women's lives globally. H.R. 2114 and H.R. 2604 provide support to the United Nations Population Fund for women's health and dignity. S. 1998 aims to reduce child marriage globally. The bill S. 2682 directs U.S. funding to the United Nations Population Fund for maternal and child health purposes. H.Res. 1045 calls for reducing nuclear weapons, allocating savings towards child survival, hunger, and education. H.Res. 1022 affirms the House's commitment to promoting maternal health and child survival through international investment and participation. The resolution recognizes the importance of maternal health and child survival for families, societies, and global development."
