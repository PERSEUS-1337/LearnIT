    "content": "Most of the funding for HUD comes from annual appropriations by Congress to address housing problems for low-income households. Rental assistance programs like Public Housing, Section 8 Vouchers, and Section 8 project-based rental assistance make up a significant portion of HUD's funding. Block grant programs like HOME and CDBG help finance housing and community development activities for low-income families. Other specialized grant programs assist homeless individuals, including those with AIDS. HUD's programs assist homeless individuals, including those with AIDS, by providing funding through rental assistance programs and block grant programs. Surplus funds from the Federal Housing Administration have been used to offset HUD's budget costs, with additional emergency funding provided for recovery assistance after natural disasters. Table 1 shows HUD's total enacted appropriations over the past five years, with a 57% increase in regular funding in the past nine years. The growth rate has been increasing in recent years, with year-over-year increases of 5% or more each year. Adjusting for inflation, the \"real\" funding growth has been about 17% over the nine-year period. Most of the growth has occurred in the last two years. HUD's funding consists of various components, including regular annual appropriations, emergency appropriations, rescissions, and offsets. The majority of HUD's programs are funded through regular annual appropriations, which determine the funding for each program. Emergency appropriations are sometimes provided by Congress in response to disasters, in addition to regular annual appropriations. The cost of HUD's budget is determined by the interaction between new appropriations and offsets provided through rescissions, receipts, and collections. Net budget authority is the total amount of funding provided to HUD, including regular annual appropriations and offsets. The total net budget authority provided to HUD each year is not the best measure of funding for its programs. Despite a 57% increase in net non-emergency budget authority from FY2002 to FY2010, this increase is not solely due to increased appropriations for HUD programs. Regular annual appropriations from Congress also play a significant role in funding HUD's programs. Regular annual appropriations for HUD's programs grew by 37% from FY2002 to FY2010, mainly due to increases in Section 8 voucher and project-based rental assistance programs. Offsetting receipts and collections decreased by over 70%, and rescinded amounts dropped by 96%, contributing to the rise in net non-emergency budget authority. From FY2002 to FY2010, appropriations for Section 8 programs grew by over 70%, accounting for about 57% of HUD's regular appropriations in FY2010. Funding for other HUD programs also began to grow in FY2009 and FY2010. The decline in offsetting receipts is mainly due to decreases in receipts from FHA mortgage insurance programs. The HUD appropriations have decreased significantly from FY2004 to FY2010. The appropriations process starts with the President's budget request, followed by crafting legislation by the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. Continuing resolutions are enacted if appropriations are not completed before the fiscal year ends on September 30. The FY2011 appropriations process began in February 2010 and continued beyond the fiscal year. The FY2011 appropriations process for HUD began in February 2010 with the release of the President's budget and ended in April 2011 with the signing of P.L. 112-10 into law. The President's budget requested about $45.6 billion in net new budget authority for HUD, representing a 3% increase in appropriations for HUD programs. The President's budget requested funding increases for Section 8 programs, homeless programs, and HUD's research needs, while decreasing funding for programs for the elderly, disabled, and public housing repairs. The FY2011 HUD funding bill approved by the House would have provided about $1 billion more for HUD than requested by the President. The House and Senate bills for FY2011 HUD funding would have provided about $1 billion more than requested by the President. They rejected proposed cuts to housing programs for the elderly, disabled, public housing capital funding, and certain initiatives. The bills were not enacted before the end of the 111th Congress. The Senate bill for FY2011 HUD funding included a 1% increase in net new budget authority and a 5% increase in appropriations for HUD programs. It rejected proposed cuts to housing programs for the elderly and disabled, public housing capital funding, and the brownfields program. The bill also provided funding for the President's Transforming Rental Assistance initiative and Choice Neighborhoods Initiative. The bill was not enacted before the end of the 111th Congress, leading to a series of continuing resolutions to maintain funding at FY2010 levels. The continuing resolutions for FY2011 HUD funding extended funding through various dates, with the final CR expiring on March 4, 2011. The CR also extended FHA mortgage limit increases. A year-long CR was approved by the House on February 18, 2011, to fund the federal government through FY2011. H.R. 1 bill proposed funding cuts for HUD programs in FY2011, reducing aggregate appropriations by $5 billion (11%) compared to FY2010. The Senate failed to pass H.R. 1 or a Senate Amendment that would have increased HUD funding by nearly $6 billion. The Senate failed to pass H.R. 1 or a Senate Amendment that would have increased HUD funding by nearly $6 billion in FY2011. This would have represented a reduction of over $1 billion in net budget authority from FY2010, but an increase of about $900 million in aggregate appropriations compared to FY2010. The 112th Congress approved a short-term CR (H.J.Res. 44, P.L. 112-4) to fund the government through March 18, 2011, maintaining most accounts at FY2010 levels but reducing funding for some accounts, including the Community Development Fund for HUD. The Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program funding was reduced under H.J.Res. 44, resulting in a $195 million decrease from FY2010 levels. This reduction eliminated funding for congressional earmarks through Economic Development Initiatives (EDI) and Neighborhood Initiatives (NI). Subsequent short-term CRs (H.J.Res. 48 and P.L. 112-8) maintained most HUD accounts at FY2010 levels but continued the funding cut for the CDF. Additionally, no funding was provided for HUD's Brownfields Redevelopment account, previously funded at $17 million in FY2010. The Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act of 2011 extended funding through April 15, 2011. It reduced funding for public housing and specified restrictions on CDF funds. The law provided year-long appropriations for the Department of Defense and other government agencies, including HUD. It funded some HUD programs at FY2010 levels, reduced funding for some programs, and increased funding for Section 8 programs. Additionally, there was an across-the-board 0.2% rescission from non-defense discretionary accounts. The law allocated an estimated $41.1 billion in net new budget authority for HUD, a decrease of about 11%. The requested decrease in net new budget authority for HUD would only represent a 4% decrease in appropriations for HUD programs in aggregate, due to an increase in offsetting collections and receipts from the FHA mortgage insurance programs. The FHA insures mortgage loans made by private lenders to eligible borrowers, who pay upfront and monthly fees for the insurance. FHA insurance helps make mortgage credit more widely available and at a lower cost. The HUD budget includes two program accounts: the Mutual Mortgage Insurance/Cooperative Management Housing Insurance Fund account (MMI/CMHI) and the General Insurance/Special Risk Insurance Fund account (GI/SRI). The MMI Fund is the largest of the FHA insurance funds, covering single-family home loans, including the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) program. The GI/SRI Fund provides insurance for riskier home mortgages, multifamily rental housing, and special-purpose loans for hospitals and nursing homes. The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (FCRA) determines the cost of federal loan insurance by calculating the net present value of expected cash flows from insured loans. Cash inflows come from insurance premiums paid by borrowers, while outflows are payments to lenders for loan defaults. The subsidy rate is the net value of these cash flows expressed as a percentage of insured loan volume. The subsidy rate is calculated based on the difference between cash inflows and outflows from insured loans. It is expressed as a negative number if cash inflows exceed outflows, and as a positive number if outflows exceed inflows. This rate is applied to the expected loan volume to determine the credit subsidy needed for federal credit programs. Agencies must adjust initial subsidy estimates based on actual loan experience. The MMI Fund historically has a negative subsidy rate. The MMI Fund historically has a negative subsidy rate, generating money for the government. It has made more in fees than paid out in claims, not needing an appropriation from Congress to operate. The Fund is divided into Purchase and Refinance risk category and HECM risk category. The Purchase and Refinance category had a negative subsidy rate of -2.59% for FY2011, higher than the -0.62% estimated for FY2010. The Administration estimated that the Purchase and Refinance risk category of the MMI Fund would generate about $5.8 billion in negative credit subsidy in FY2011, partly due to proposed FHA reforms. The Congressional Budget Office projected a smaller negative credit subsidy of around $1.9 billion for the same category, including $960 million without proposed changes and an additional $902 million with reforms. The CBO projected a negative credit subsidy of around $1.9 billion for the Purchase and Refinance risk category of the MMI Fund in FY2011, including $960 million without proposed changes and an additional $902 million with HUD-proposed program reforms. The differences between the President's budget request and CBO's re-estimate are detailed in Table 3. FHA's estimates of negative credit subsidy for FY2011 were revised upward due to an increase in the annual premium that went into effect in April 2011. This change resulted in a -3.92% subsidy rate for the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund's Purchase and Refinance risk. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 moved the HECM program into the MMI fund, which is accounted separately. The MMI Purchase and Refinance risk category had a negative credit subsidy of -2.59%, while the MMI HECM risk category had a positive credit subsidy. FHA's estimates of offsetting receipts for the Purchase and Refinance risk category in FY2011 increased to nearly $10 billion by the time the FY2012 budget was released. In FY2011, HUD proposed changes to the HECM program to reduce the need for positive credit subsidies. This included increasing borrowers' annual insurance premiums and adjusting the formula for loan sizes. Legislation proposed lower credit subsidies than the Administration's estimate. The final FY2012 appropriations law (P.L. 112-10) directed HUD to adjust the HECM program to result in zero credit subsidy, reflecting increased demand for FHA-insured mortgages. FHA insured 18.7% of new single-family mortgages in FY2009, up from 2% in FY2006, with higher credit quality on newer mortgages. The FHA is facing rising default rates on past loans, putting strain on the MMI Fund. Congress mandated a 2% capital reserve ratio for the MMI Fund within 10 years, but it fell to 0.53% in FY2009. To address financial stability concerns, FHA proposed changes to its mortgage insurance programs. FHA proposed changes to its single-family mortgage insurance programs, including increasing the annual mortgage insurance premium. Congressional action is required for some changes, while others can be implemented administratively. FHA raised the annual insurance premiums charged to borrowers with different downpayment percentages after the enactment of P.L. 111-229 in 2010. Beginning on October 4, 2010, FHA raised annual insurance premiums for loans with a loan-to-value ratio below 95%. On April 18, 2011, the premiums were increased again based on downpayment percentages. The upfront mortgage insurance premium was also raised to 2.25% for loans endorsed on or after April 5, 2010, but later lowered to 1%. FHA proposed changes to downpayment and credit score requirements, including a 10% downpayment for credit scores between 500-579 and 3.5% for scores of 580 and above. They also suggested reducing seller concessions from 6% to 3%. These changes were open for public comments in a Federal Register notice published on July 15, 2010. The FHA proposed changes to downpayment and credit score requirements on July 15, 2010. They aimed to increase oversight and enforcement of requirements for FHA-approved lenders, including granting FHA broader authority to terminate lender approvals for excessive defaults and claims. The FHA Reform Act of 2010 (H.R. 5072) would have given FHA the authority to require lenders to indemnify FHA for non-conforming mortgages and cases involving fraud. The FHA Reform Act of 2010 aimed to address early defaults and claims by establishing a Deputy Assistant Secretary for Risk Management and Regulatory Affairs within FHA. This would abolish the current position of FHA chief risk officer and allow FHA to contract with outside credit risk analysis sources. Appropriations were authorized for staff to review lender performance. Additionally, HUD provides capital grants and rental assistance through programs for elderly and disabled residents. In the Section 202 program, property owners may provide supportive services to residents, while in the Section 811 program, supportive services are mandatory. HUD has funded over 106,000 units of Section 202 housing and 30,000 units of Section 811 housing. The President proposed no new funding for Section 202 or Section 811 housing in FY2011 to redesign the programs, resulting in reduced funding. Under the proposal, Section 202 and related programs would be funded at $274 million, down from $825 million in FY2010. In FY2011, the Conversion program would have been funded at $274 million, compared to $825 million in FY2010. The Section 811 program would have received $90 million, down from $300 million in FY2010. Both the House-passed appropriations bill (H.R. 5850) and the Senate committee-passed bill (S. 3644) would have maintained the same level of funding for Section 202 at $825 million. H.R. 5850 would have provided $300 million for the Section 811 program, while S. 3644 would have provided $200 million. The difference in funding levels was based on the treatment of Section 811 vouchers, with both bills moving funding for voucher renewals to the Section 8 tenant-based rental assistance account. In FY2011, $114 million was allocated for Section 811 voucher renewals, with $100 million less funding due to moving renewals to the Section 8 account. Congress appropriated $400 million for Section 202 and related programs, and $150 million for Section 811. $32 million was available to renew pre-2007 contracts, and $35 million through the Section 8 account. In FY2011, $114 million was allocated for Section 811 voucher renewals, with $100 million less funding due to moving renewals to the Section 8 account. Approximately $89 million was provided for Service Coordinators and $39 million for the Assisted Living Conversion program within the funds appropriated for Section 202. The Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program is funded through the tenant-based rental assistance account, being the largest assistance program administered by HUD. The Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program is funded through the tenant-based rental assistance account, with funding allocated for administrative costs incurred by Public Housing Authorities. Funding levels for voucher renewals and allocation to PHAs have been debated since FY2004, focusing on efficiency and serving as many families as possible while containing costs. In FY2010, Congress allocated over $16 billion for voucher renewals to PHAs based on prior year costs and utilization. Funding was sufficient for 99% of PHAs' formula eligibility, but some PHAs did not use all their vouchers in FY2009. As a result, only PHAs with decreased costs or reserve funding received enough funding in FY2010. The President's FY2011 budget requested $17 billion for voucher renewals, enough to fund 95% of all vouchers. Funding allocation would be based on prior year costs and utilization, with the Secretary having the authority to reallocate funds to PHAs with lower reserves to increase utilization and serve more families. The President's FY2011 budget requested $17 billion for voucher renewals, aiming to fund 95% of all vouchers and increase utilization. Congress was asked to lift the ban on \"over-leasing\" to allow PHAs to serve more families. The House bill allocated $150 million less for renewals than requested, citing lower inflation estimates. The committee report on H.R. 5850 indicated sufficient funding for voucher renewals, following the President's formula but without reallocation authority. The committee believes major authorization changes are needed outside of their jurisdiction. The bill maintains the prohibition on over-leasing but changes the funding formula to reflect prior calendar year spending. S. 3644, like H.R. 5850, would have funded renewals at less than the President's request, using calendar year spending. The Senate bill did not include reallocation authority, citing concerns about cost increases. The committee directed HUD to report on better monitoring of PHAs' financial management. Neither H.R. 1 nor the final FY2011 appropriations law (P.L. 112-10) made changes to the funding allocation formula from FY2010. Both provided less funding for renewals than requested by the President but more than in FY2010. The President's budget requested Congress to fund the renewal of mainstream vouchers for persons with disabilities in the Section 8 account, with HUD requesting $114 million for this purpose in FY2011. The House and Senate bills proposed to adopt the President's request, but H.R. 1 did not explicitly include funding for renewing Section 811 vouchers. The final FY2011 appropriations law appropriated less than a third of the amount requested by the President for Section 811 renewals. The final FY2011 appropriations law appropriated less than a third of the amount requested by the President for Section 811 renewals. The funds were directed to renew vouchers issued since 2007, with each PHA having a contract with HUD for authorized vouchers. Around 2.3 million authorized vouchers are allocated across PHAs, with Congress creating additional vouchers in some years for special populations or purposes. In recent years, incremental vouchers have been set aside for specific groups, such as families in the child welfare system and homeless veterans. The President's budget for FY2011 requested $85 million for new vouchers for supportive housing for families at risk of homelessness. The House and Senate bills from the 111th Congress included funding for the President's homelessness demonstration, $75 million for VASH vouchers for homeless veterans, and $66 million for families displaced by hurricanes. The Senate bill also allocated $16 million for the Family Unification Program. The Unification Program (FUP) provides vouchers to families in the child welfare system. H.R. 1 had no funding for new vouchers, but P.L. 112-10 allocated about $50 million for VASH vouchers. The project-based rental assistance account funds existing Section 8 contracts between HUD and property owners. No new contracts have been made since the 1980s, with Congress funding contracts for 20- to 40-year periods. In FY2011, the President requested over $9 billion for the project-based rental assistance account to renew expiring contracts and provide funding for amendment needs. HUD indicated that an estimated $662 million would be needed for amendments. In FY2011, the President requested over $9 billion for project-based rental assistance to renew expiring contracts and address amendment needs. The account has been funded using current year appropriations and advance appropriations since FY2009. Both the House and Senate bills proposed funding levels close to the President's request, with final appropriations falling just under $120 million short. President Obama's budget also included $350 million for a new \"Transforming Rental Assistance\" initiative aimed at streamlining HUD's rental assistance programs. The President's budget includes funding to streamline HUD's rental assistance programs by transferring housing units to a new form of project-based rental assistance with tenant mobility options. This new assistance is modeled after the Section 8 project-based voucher program and aims to transfer 300,000 units to this new form of assistance. The President's budget includes funding to transfer 300,000 housing units to a new project-based rental assistance program. The funding will be used to cover the difference in subsidy costs between current programs and the new program. The President's budget includes funding to transfer 300,000 housing units to a new project-based rental assistance program. The proposed budget allocates $50 million for combining PHA activities and promoting tenant mobility, $10 million for technical assistance and program evaluation. The draft legislation for the Preservation, Enhancement, and Transformation of Rental Assistance Act is available on HUD's website, but the funding for the Transforming Rental Assistance initiative was not included in the proposed legislation. Both H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 did not include the funding requested for the President's initiative, as concerns were raised about the proposal not being fully developed and the unknown future costs. The public housing program, established in 1937, provides rental units for low-income families. Despite no new developments, funds are allocated to over 3,100 PHAs owning 1.2 million units. HUD supports PHAs through operating and capital funds for maintenance and modernization. HOPE VI grants aid in demolishing outdated housing. Funding for the Transforming Rental Assistance initiative was not included in recent legislation. HOPE VI is a grant program for modernizing distressed public housing by demolishing and redeveloping to create mixed-income communities. The FY2011 budget requested increased funding for the Public Housing operating fund and decreased funding for the capital fund, citing sufficient funding for PHAs' eligibility and considering previous capital funding from the Recovery Act. The Administration argues that fully funding the operating fund will free up more capital funds for capital needs. H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 proposed funding the operating fund at the President's request with a $500 million increase for the capital fund. The Senate bill included a $50 million set-aside from the capital fund for grants to improve early childhood education in public housing. H.R. 1 suggested cutting the public housing capital fund by over $1 billion and the operating fund by almost $150 million compared to FY2010. The final FY2011 funding law funded the capital fund higher than H.R. 1 but less than FY2010. The FY2011 appropriations law funded the capital fund higher than H.R. 1 but less than FY2010, and funded the operating fund at about $10 million less than H.R. 1. The reduced appropriations for the operating fund may be voluntarily offset by PHAs' use of program reserves. The President's budget requested no new funding for HOPE VI, instead requesting $250 million for the Choice Neighborhoods Initiative, a new Obama Administration proposal modeled after the HOPE VI program. The FY2011 appropriations law funded the capital fund higher than H.R. 1 but less than FY2010, and funded the operating fund at about $10 million less than H.R. 1. The reduced appropriations for the operating fund may be voluntarily offset by PHAs' use of program reserves. In addition to PHAs, local governments, nonprofits, and for-profit developers would be eligible to compete for the funding aimed at revitalizing distressed neighborhoods. Congress provided $200 million to the HOPE VI account in FY2010, with a portion set aside for a Choice Neighborhoods demonstration. The House and Senate in the 111th Congress had differing positions on funding for HOPE VI and Choice Neighborhoods in FY2011. H.R. 5850 proposed $200 million for HOPE VI, while S. 3644 proposed $250 million for Choice Neighborhoods. HUD also circulated draft legislation for the Choice Neighborhoods Initiative. The House Financial Services Committee discussed the Choice Neighborhoods Initiative in March 2010. The committee ordered the Public Housing Reinvestment and Tenant Protection Act of 2010 (H.R. 5814) in July 2010, which included authorization for the initiative. The final FY2011 funding law allocated nearly $100 million for HOPE VI, with a set-aside from FY2010. The Housing Trust Fund was established in the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 to provide dedicated funding for housing. The Housing Trust Fund was created in 2008 to secure funding for affordable housing, with a focus on rental housing for extremely low-income families. Contributions from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were designated as the funding source, but were suspended in 2008 due to financial difficulties, leaving the Trust Fund without funding. Other sources of funding were allowed under P.L. 110-289, but the original contributions were crucial. Despite the creation of the Housing Trust Fund in 2008 to provide affordable housing, no funding has been directed to the fund yet. The President's budget requests for FY2010 and FY2011 included $1 billion for the Housing Trust Fund, but Congress did not provide any funding. Legislative proposals in the 111th Congress aimed to fund the Housing Trust Fund, but none were enacted. The Transformation Initiative was proposed in President Obama's FY2010 budget to strengthen HUD's research and technological capacities. It involves funding for research, program demonstrations, technical assistance, and information technology. Congress provided $20 million for mortgage fraud in FY2010 and authorized a 1% transfer authority for the initiative. In FY2010, Congress authorized a 1% transfer authority for the Transformation Initiative, which could have received up to $435 million but only received $239 million. In FY2011, the President requested $20 million for combating mortgage fraud and a 1% transfer authority, with potential funding of almost $470 million. However, both House and Senate bills limited the total funding available from transfers to less than half of the President's request. The House and Senate bills from the 111th Congress proposed limits on the Department of Housing and Urban Development's discretion in allocating funds for eligible activities. The Transformation Initiative must be envisioned beyond budgetary flexibility, with a focus on core department needs. Oversight of Transformation Initiative funding is deemed critical, with restrictions on fund usage and minimum funding levels for IT modernization and technical assistance recommended by the Committee. H.R. 1 did not include the authority for fund transfers. The final FY2011 appropriations law (P.L. 112-10) allocated $71 million for modernizing FHA's systems and updating computer programs for the Section 8 voucher program. The law also granted HUD the requested transfer authority under the transformation initiative, but from a more limited number of accounts than requested by the President. The Administration's budget for FY2011 included community development initiatives to transform the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) and related programs. The Administration's budget for FY2011 proposed changes to funding for community development programs, including a reduction in funding for Community Development Fund activities. The budget also included funding for new initiatives such as Catalytic Competition Grants and the Capacity Building Clearinghouse. Additionally, funding for the Rural Innovation Fund and earmarked programs like the Neighborhood Initiative and Economic Development Initiative would be eliminated. The Administration's budget for FY2011 proposed a $70 million reduction in CDF activities by defunding Neighborhood Initiative and Economic Development Initiative grants. Savings would fund Sustainable Communities Initiative, University Community Fund, and Catalytic Investments Competition Grants. No new funding was requested for the Brownfields Economic Development Initiative Account, arguing duplication with EPA's brownfield program. The House and Senate bills recommended a $4.382 billion and $4.450 billion appropriation for CDF activities, respectively. Both bills included funding for EDI and NI congressional earmarked projects. The Senate bill recommended $193 million for EDI and NI projects. Both bills also recommended continued funding for the Sustainable Communities Initiative and University Community Fund at their FY2010 levels. The final FY2011 appropriations law, P.L. 112-10, allocated $3.501 billion for the CDF account, a 21.2% decrease from FY2010. Funding for CDBG formula grants was reduced by 16.4%, and the SCI grant program by 33%. The law did not fund the BEDI program, but supported activities through the CDBG program. The CDF has funded community development programs like EDI and NI in the past. The CDBG program, authorized under the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, provides federal financial assistance for neighborhood revitalization and economic development. CDBG formula funds were awarded to various entities in 2010 for eligible activities benefiting low- and moderate-income individuals, addressing slums or blight, or health threats. The CDBG program provides federal financial assistance for neighborhood revitalization and economic development. The Administration proposed freezing funding for the program at its FY2010 level of over $3.9 billion for FY2011. Both H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 proposed funding the program slightly higher than the President's request. The House passed H.R. 1, reducing the CDF account by 66.3% below FY2010 funding level. It prohibited funds for earmarks and the Sustainable Communities Initiative. Allocation instructions were not included for the CDBG program components. The House-passed version of H.R. 1 reduced the CDF account by 66.3% below FY2010 levels. The final FY2011 appropriations law allocated $3.343 billion for CDBG formula funds, with a 0.2% mandatory cut and a 1% transfer to HUD's Transformation Initiative. The adjusted appropriations for CDF activities account for these changes. The Administration requested $148.5 million for a new initiative called Catalytic Competition Grants Program (CCGs) to support economic development projects in distressed areas. Unlike CDBG funds, CCG program funds would be awarded competitively to various entities for projects like reclaiming vacant property, supporting transit-oriented development, and assisting small businesses in targeted neighborhoods. The Administration requested $148.5 million for its Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI) in FY2011, aimed at funding regional integrated planning grants for metropolitan areas to develop sustainable communities. Neither H.R. 1 nor P.L. 112-10 appropriated funds for this proposal. The Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI) collaborates with federal agencies to award grants for metropolitan areas to improve housing, transportation, energy, and land use planning. Grants range from $500,000 to $3 million based on population size. Community Challenge Grants (CCGs) aim to reform building codes and zoning ordinances for sustainable growth. HUD has proposed grant awards not exceeding $2 million for sustainable growth and discouraging inefficient land use patterns. The Administration requested funds for a joint HUD-Department of Transportation research initiative in FY2011. Congress appropriated $10 million for research efforts in FY2010. The administration proposed capacity building as a new component of the SCI. The Administration proposed capacity building as a new component of the Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI), seeking support to improve technical capacity of various organizations and lenders. Both H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 recommended continued funding for SCI at $148.5 million, with a set-aside of $25 million for smaller metropolitan areas. Additionally, $25 million was suggested for the Rural Innovation Fund to assist housing finance agencies and rural nonprofit organizations. The bills proposed funding for various organizations to address housing and poverty-related issues, including setting aside $5 million for rural Indian tribes. They also supported HUD's Transformation Initiative and prohibited the use of Community Development Fund dollars for SCI activities. Despite this, $99.8 million was appropriated for SCI activities in FY2011, representing a 33% reduction from the previous year. The FY2011 funding level for Challenge Grants was reduced by 33% compared to FY2010. The Section 108 loan guarantee program allows states and entitlement communities to use their CDBG allocations as collateral for redevelopment activities. The program's loan commitment ceiling was proposed to double from $250 million to $500 million in FY2011 to help finance large-scale projects. The Administration proposed revamping the Section 108 loan guarantee program by charging a fee-based assessment to borrowers, eliminating the need for an appropriated credit subsidy. Congress rejected this proposal and recommended continuing the program as currently structured. H.R. 5850 suggested a loan commitment ceiling of $427 million with a credit subsidy of $10 million, while S. 3644 recommended a ceiling of $275 million with a subsidy of $6.4 million. P.L. 112-10 maintained the program at a commitment level of $275 million with a credit subsidy of $5.988 million. The Administration's budget for FY2011 proposed redesigning the Capacity Building for Community Development and Affordable Housing Program, supported by a credit subsidy of $5.988 million. The program would provide technical assistance and funds to local housing and community development organizations through national intermediaries. It may be used for training, education activities, grants, loans, and financial assistance to enhance the capabilities of community development corporations and housing organizations. The Administration's budget for FY2011 proposed increasing funding for capacity building by $10 million to $60 million. The proposal aimed to establish a stand-alone account for the program, with grant funds competitively awarded to intermediaries with expertise in housing and community development. Technical and financial assistance would be provided to CDCs, CHDOs, and local governments to enhance their capacity. The Administration's budget for FY2011 proposed increasing funding for capacity building by $10 million to $60 million. The proposal aimed to establish a stand-alone account for the program, with grant funds competitively awarded to intermediaries with expertise in housing and community development. Assistance would have been used to fund training, loans, grants, market research, organizational assessments, and other activities to benefit low- and moderate-income persons. Successful grantees would have been required to meet a 3:1 match from private sector sources. The Self-Help and Assisted Homeownership Opportunity Program (SHOP) account funds capacity building through SHOP, providing grants for self-help homeownership opportunities. HUD grants support national and regional organizations for home construction with sweat equity. Additionally, the account funds the Capacity Building for Community Development and Affordable Housing Program and the Housing Assistance Council. The Housing Assistance Council (HAC) supports local organizations in rural America with loans, research, and technical assistance for housing and homeownership opportunities. The President's FY2011 budget did not include funding for the SHOP account, but instead noted that activities traditionally funded through SHOP are eligible for the HOME Investment Partnerships Program block grant. The budget did request $60 million for a new Capacity Building account. The President's budget requested $60 million for a new Capacity Building account for various activities. H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 allocated $82 million for the SHOP account, including $27 million for SHOP, $50 million for capacity building (with $5 million for rural activities), and $5 million for HAC. FY2011 appropriations law continued funding at FY2010 levels with a total of $81.8 million for account activities. HUD allocated $49.9 million for Section 4 Capacity Building for Community Development and Affordable Housing, and $4.9 million for the Housing Assistance Council. Additionally, HUD planned to transfer $818,360 to the Transformation Initiative account. The Housing Counseling Assistance Program provides grants to HUD-approved agencies for various counseling services. Congress has increased funding for this program in recent years due to concerns. The funding for the Housing Counseling Assistance Program has increased in recent years, reaching $87.5 million in FY2010. The President's FY2011 budget requested $88 million for the program, and in the 111th Congress, H.R. 5850 included the same amount. S. 3644 proposed $100 million for housing counseling assistance, an increase of $12 million over the President's request. The House-passed bill H.R. 1 did not include funding for HUD's housing counseling program for FY2011, resulting in an $87.5 million decrease from FY2010. Critics argue that HUD housing counseling funding overlaps with the NeighborWorks National Foreclosure Mitigation Counseling Program funding. HUD has faced criticism for slow distribution of housing counseling grants. Congress has allocated separate funding for foreclosure mitigation counseling since FY2008. In FY2008, Congress allocated funding for foreclosure mitigation counseling to NeighborWorks America, not HUD. This funding became the National Foreclosure Mitigation Counseling Program (NFMCP). NeighborWorks is an independent nonprofit corporation that usually receives its own annual appropriation from Congress for community reinvestment activities. NeighborWorks America received $180 million in funding for mortgage foreclosure counseling activities through the National Foreclosure Mitigation Counseling Program (NFMCP) in 2008. Subsequent appropriations have been lower, with the President's budget requesting $113 million in FY2011. H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 included $113 million and $125 million for the NFMCP, respectively, with S. 3644 also allocating $24 million more for housing activities than the House-passed bill or the President's budget. The final FY2011 appropriations law (P.L. 112-10) maintained funding for the NFMCP at $65 million, with housing counseling agencies supporting foreclosure prevention initiatives like HAMP. Recipients of NFMCP funding can use up to 30% of their grants to counsel borrowers with high debt-to-income ratios eligible for HAMP. Native American Housing Block Grants (NAHBGs) are formula-based grants for Indian tribes to provide housing assistance primarily to low-income American Indian and Alaskan Native households. In FY2010, Congress provided $700 million for the NAHBG account, with set-asides for technical assistance and loan guarantees. In FY2010, $4.25 million was allocated for general technical assistance, $3.5 million for the National American Indian Housing Council (NAIHC) for training, and $2 million for loan guarantees. The President's FY2011 budget requested $580 million for Native American Housing Block Grants, a decrease of $120 million from FY2010. H.R. 1 proposed $500 million for NAHBG, $200 million less than FY2010. The final FY2011 appropriations law (P.L. 112-10) provided nearly $650 million to this account, over $50 million below the FY2010 enacted level but nearly $70 million higher than the President's FY2011 budget request. The enacted FY2011 appropriations law also maintained the set-asides within this account at FY2010 levels, less the 0.2% across-the-board rescission. The annual budget resolution acts as an agreement between the House and Senate establishing parameters within which Congress can consider legislation dealing with spending and revenue. The House and Senate budget committees divide their allocation among 12 subcommittees responsible for appropriations bills. They receive input from various sources to formulate the budget resolution, with a target completion date of April 15. The Senate Budget Committee reported a budget resolution for FY2011, but no further action was taken. The House Budget Committee did not report a resolution, leading to different proceedings in the House and Senate. The House and Senate proceeded differently in the absence of a budget resolution. The House adopted a budget enforcement resolution, while the Senate did not agree to enforceable spending allocations. The Dodd-Frank Act included $1 billion in funding for the Community Development Fund for NSP grants. The Dodd-Frank Act included $1 billion in funding for the Community Development Fund for Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP) grants, signed into law on July 21, 2010. The funds will be available starting October 1, 2010, considered FY2011 funds. Additionally, HUD was authorized to provide up to $1 billion in mortgage assistance through the Emergency Homeowners Loan Program (EHLP) for homeowners at risk of foreclosure due to income loss. The Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2010 (P.L. 111-212) provided $100 million for CDBG disaster relief funding for areas affected by severe storms and flooding from March 2010 to May 2010.
