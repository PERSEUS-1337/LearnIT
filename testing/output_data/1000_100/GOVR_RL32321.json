    "content": "After years of experience in peacekeeping and peacebuilding operations, analysts emphasize the importance of establishing a secure environment for sustainable peace. Military forces are crucial for initial security but civilian police (CivPol) are increasingly seen as more suitable for long-term stability. Civilian police (CivPol) are recognized as more suited for law and order tasks than military forces. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee acknowledges the importance of UN peacekeeping operations in promoting stability in post-conflict situations. Policymakers are addressing issues with CivPol use and considering improvements to the existing system and building new capabilities. Advocates propose facilitating recruitment and deployment of qualified personnel for complex post-conflict missions. The proposals aim to improve the recruitment and deployment of qualified personnel for complex post-conflict missions, emphasizing the need for appropriate training and skills. Key documents, including the Clinton Administration's PDD-71 and the UN's recommendations, suggest mechanisms to enhance existing CivPol systems. The Bush Administration has started implementing some measures outlined in these documents. The United Nations has started implementing some recommendations from the Brahimi Panel report to address issues with the U.N. civilian police system, including the creation of a reserve CivPol force and diversification of international police forces. Other proposed reforms are still under discussion. The evolution of international police in peacekeeping operations includes proposals for more robust civilian response mechanisms and the creation of a stability package to improve law enforcement systems. Policymakers are considering whether these recommendations could reduce reliance on U.S. military forces in post-conflict operations. The report discusses the expansion of policing in U.N. and U.S.-led operations in the 1990s, current mechanisms for providing CivPols, recommendations for improvement, and options for resolving problems in international peace operations. The international community has increasingly relied on CivPols for various functions, with a significant increase in UNCIVPOLs between 1994 and 2000. The number of currently deployed UNCIVPOLs has doubled in the past ten years, with 4,655 international civilian police assisting in U.N. peacekeeping missions as of February 29, 2004. Some analysts suggest deploying international civilian police to Afghanistan, Iraq, and Haiti. Five UNCIVPOL were deployed to Afghanistan as of the same date. U.S. assistance for law enforcement abroad is conducted under Section 660. U.S. assistance for law enforcement abroad is regulated by Section 660 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, with exceptions for post-conflict situations. International civilian police forces have been utilized for various purposes since the late 19th century. Since the late 19th century, international civilian police forces have been used for monitoring, supervising, training, and advising local forces. These forces have evolved through five phases to establish security, with functions summarized as Support for human rights, Monitoring, Advising, Reporting, and Training. International forces may be armed and granted arrest powers, known as \"executive authority.\" The evolution of international civilian police forces has involved expanding activities and mandates, including monitoring, training, and restructuring of police institutions. This evolution has gone through five phases, with the addition of constabulary units for hostile situations being a key development. The evolution of international civilian police forces has included expanding mandates to provide executive authority to international police in hostile situations, such as in Bosnia, East Timor, and Kosovo. This evolution reflects the international community's recognition of diverse security needs in peace operations. Policymakers now see ensuring public security as a joint responsibility with indigenous personnel in countries and organizations involved in interventions. Policymakers and analysts have identified gaps in peacekeeping mechanisms, particularly in recruitment and training systems. These gaps are a concern for U.S. policymakers and have led to recent legislative proposals. The United Nations faces challenges in recruiting well-trained and professional policemen from diverse countries with varying policing standards. Despite efforts to weed out unfit recruits, problems persist in finding personnel with necessary skills for complex missions. Analysts suggest additional training to establish a common set of policing skills and uniform standards. The presence of three security gaps in establishing law and order in peacekeeping and post-conflict situations is a significant challenge. The deployment gap, where police forces are not deployed quickly or in sufficient numbers, is a key issue that can hinder missions. Deficiencies in recruitment and training systems contribute to these gaps, particularly in situations where criminal networks are present or local authority has been replaced by international intervention. The deployment gap in peacekeeping missions has been a challenge, with delays in deploying police forces and recruiting personnel with specialized skills. This gap hinders missions, as seen in examples like Cambodia and Somalia where deployment took months. The United Nations has struggled to reach authorized mission sizes, with only about half of the required personnel recruited in some cases. Despite some improvements in deployment times, there is still a need to address gaps in deploying skilled personnel. The lack of necessary skills in police forces deployed in peacekeeping operations compromises their effectiveness. This is evident when military forces are unavailable or their mandate does not include law enforcement functions. Additionally, an institution gap exists where indigenous law enforcement systems lack adequate personnel and institutions for prosecution and punishment. Since the end of the Cold War, the international community has provided international police assistance through various mechanisms, with the United Nations being the principal actor. The lack of resources and personnel in post-conflict judiciaries and penal systems hinders effective prosecution and punishment, despite more efficient policing efforts. The United Nations international civilian police system, supported by UNCIVPOL officers from 65 nations, plays a crucial role in providing international civilian police assistance in multilateral operations. As of February 29, 2004, 4,655 UNCIVPOL officers from 65 nations were serving in eight U.N. missions. Jordan is the largest contributor with 553 officers, followed by the United States with 476. Other countries with over 100 officers include India, Germany, Turkey, Ukraine, Nepal, Malaysia, Romania, Pakistan, Argentina, Poland, and the United Kingdom. The majority of UNCIVPOL officers were serving in Kosovo, with other missions in Liberia, East Timor, Sierra Leone, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Cyprus, Georgia, and Afghanistan. Many nations also provided training and reform assistance individually or as part of multilateral efforts. The United States provided police assistance in U.S. peacekeeping operations in Somalia and Haiti under U.N. authority. European Union member states and organizations like OSCE and EU have also contributed to police training programs and missions. The OSCE and EU have provided police training and support in various countries as adjuncts to U.N. missions. Member States contribute police personnel voluntarily for peacekeeping operations authorized by the U.N. Security Council. The U.N. philosophy of CivPol is based on international standards for democratic community policing and human rights. The Civilian Police Division (CPD) within the U.N. Headquarters provides policy and planning for civilian policing activities in peacekeeping operations. The Civilian Police Division (CPD) at the U.N. Headquarters assists Member States with recruitment and selection of CivPol personnel, deployment, and rotation cycles. Training is handled by the UNDPKO training unit due to lack of budget. UNCIVPOL personnel in the field are under the command of the UNCIVPOL Police Commissioner. The Brahimi Panel report highlights issues with recruitment, training, and deployment of police personnel in U.N. peacekeeping, recommending actions for improvement. The U.N. aims to enhance its ability to deploy CivPols quickly and effectively through measures like creating ready rosters of qualified personnel, developing on-call expert lists, forming regional partnerships for joint training, and appointing national CivPol contacts. Conferences were held to address issues in U.N. policing operations, leading to proposals for improving recruitment, training, deployment, and related challenges. The UN aims to improve recruitment, training, and deployment of CivPols to address operational challenges. Recommendations from the Brahimi Panel and UNDPKO seminar include incorporating CivPol personnel under the U.N. standby arrangement system, pre-positioning equipment for rapid deployment, and addressing procedural and organizational impediments. Despite some implementation of reforms, significant problems persist in the UNCIVPOL system. The Brahimi Panel and UNDPKO seminar recommended reforms to address recruitment, training, and deployment issues in UNCIVPOL operations. Progress has been made in reforming the operational and internal management of UNDPKO. The new approach called for more qualified law enforcement personnel to work alongside other rule of law professionals. The Brahimi Panel report emphasized a \"doctrinal shift\" in UNCIVPOL operations, requiring law enforcement personnel to collaborate with rule of law experts to strengthen institutions. This shift may strain U.N. Member States by necessitating more specialized police experts. Some analysts raise concerns about the implementation of this approach within the U.N. CivPol system. The primary role of UNCIVPOL personnel is to build local police services capacity, as broad undertakings would infringe on national sovereignty. The United Nations has created a new rule of law unit to enhance peacekeeping operations, but progress in integrating rule of law components is viewed as \"lagging\" by some experts. The UNDPKO has faced challenges in deploying missions with a substantial criminal justice component. Recruitment issues in the current ad hoc system of civilian police recruitment for UN missions include uneven results in meeting minimum standards, lack of experience in community policing and human rights, and difficulties in recruiting officers with specialized skills. Recruitment issues in UN civilian police missions stem from a lack of a comprehensive strategy for determining mission needs, making it challenging to recruit officers with specialized skills. The current criteria for civilian police officers include a minimum age of 25, five years of service in a national police force with community policing experience, and proficiency in one of the official U.N. languages. The United Nations requires civilian police officers to meet specific criteria, including proficiency in an official U.N. language, possession of a driver's license, ability to operate a four-wheel drive vehicle, and meeting medical standards. Some officers still do not meet these requirements, despite U.N. efforts to improve recruitment quality. Selection Assistance Teams have been sent since 1996 to help Member States select police candidates and focus on language, driving, and firearms skills necessary for monitoring missions. The United Nations faces challenges in recruiting civilian police officers for monitoring missions, with some officers not meeting required criteria despite U.N. efforts. Specialized skills recruitment is particularly difficult, leading to high repatriation costs and deployment delays. Recommendations have been made to improve advance recruitment of personnel for better mission quality. The Brahimi Panel Report and UNDPKO seminar recommendations suggest establishing national and international ready rosters of trained CivPol personnel for quick deployment, aiming to improve the quality of recruits and expedite mission readiness. Success in implementing these recommendations has been mixed. The UN has made progress in strengthening UNSAS for international police personnel, but there is a need for more countries to create national pools of candidates for international operations. The Brahimi Panel Report recommends replacing bidding for slots with experienced candidates familiar with UN rules and procedures. The Brahimi Panel Report recommended the UN to maintain an on-call list of 100 police officers and experts for advance mission planning. UNDPKO established a 100-person roster for civilian police personnel in 2002. Training exercises have been held to improve the efficiency of the on-call system. Since 2003, SAT visits now include substantive skills in the selection criteria. Analysts have pointed to perceived shortcomings in U.N. procedures and processes that undermine recruitment efforts, including the absence of standardized criteria for determining the number of civilian police needed for missions. The criteria for missions like UNMIBH and UNMIK consider factors such as UNCIVPOL ratio, local crime statistics, police strength, and population. The audit also criticized UNDPKO for inconsistent assessment practices. The audit faulted UNDPKO for not consistently applying assessment systems to ensure skills matched missions. Civilian police personnel in missions like UNMIBH and UNMIK were assigned to non-policing functions, reducing police availability. Administrative functions accounted for 8% of police officers. Mission-preparedness training varies among police-contributing Member States and is sometimes inadequate, leading to effectiveness issues. The lack of standardized training and experience diversity can undermine the effectiveness of UNCIVPOL missions. Member States are responsible for providing pre-deployment training to civilian police personnel, with in-theater training covering standard procedures, safety, security, and human rights. Experts have identified three main reasons for inadequate pre-deployment training. Experts have cited three main reasons for inadequate pre-deployment training for civilian police personnel: lack of experienced trainers, insufficient resources for training programs, and varying national training standards. Recommendations include developing regional partnerships for joint training exercises and utilizing UN educational materials for rapid deployment readiness. The UNDPKO Training Unit has improved pre-deployment training by developing training publications and common training standards. PDD-71 identified training as an area where the United States could contribute to enhancing the capabilities of other nations in CivPol operations. PDD-71 recognized the need for international organizations to supplement national training for coalition peace operations. The State Department's INL office is tasked with providing tailored training packages to U.S. and international CIVPOL when requested, with appropriate funding. The State Department is working on a program to invite foreign police officers to train with the U.S. contingent. The deployment of UNCIVPOL is a complex process involving defining mission needs, recruiting qualified personnel, and coordinating contributions from multiple nations. Historically, deployment times have ranged from six to eighteen months due to resource limitations. The Brahimi Report identified reasons for deployment delays and recommendations to address them. The Brahimi Panel recommended rapid deployment of peacekeeping missions within 30 days for \"traditional\" missions and within 90 days for complex emergencies. A mission headquarters should be functioning within 15 days for complex emergencies, but there are uncertainties about meeting the 30-90 day deployment timeframe for military and police personnel. The Committee on Peacekeeping Operations highlighted constraints on rapid deployment, including the current U.N. system's limitations, the need for region-specific expertise, and the importance of contributing states' political will. Reforms are underway to improve the United Nations System for Standby Arrangements and develop a roster of civilian police personnel for quicker deployment. Additionally, equipment will be pre-packaged and stored at the U.N. Logistics Base in Brindisi, Italy for rapid deployment at the start of new missions. The United Nations has improved its procurement and management of strategic deployment stocks at the Logistics Base in Brindisi, Italy for peace missions. However, there is no program in place to prepare UNCIVPOL for rapid deployment. The U.S. CivPol program is managed by the Department of State's Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, which lacks a large national police force for deployment. The State Department recruits civilian police personnel from local law enforcement agencies through contractors like DynCorp International. DynCorp and Civilian Police International LLC have been contracted to maintain rosters of up to 2,000 personnel for deployment. PAE Government Services, Inc., and HomeLand Security Corporation have also been contracted for the same purpose. These companies will bid on contracts to deploy CivPol personnel for missions. The U.S. CivPol program is funded through various State Department bureaus and the Peacekeeping account. Officers receive a base salary of $50,000-100,000, with additional allowances for U.N. missions. The total cost per officer varies by mission, ranging from $100,000 in Kosovo to $150,000-$175,000 in Iraq. DynCorp is the private contractor providing police services in these areas. The cost of providing police services in Kosovo and Iraq includes officer salaries, equipment, transportation, and morale support. The United Nations covers expenses in Kosovo, while the Congressional Budget Office estimated the incremental cost per troop in Iraq. Deploying reserve component soldiers in Iraq costs more than maintaining them in peacetime. As of March 27, 2004, 1,016 U.S. CivPol and support personnel were involved in international CivPol missions in Kosovo, Liberia, East Timor, and Sierra Leone. Additionally, officers were deployed in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Israel. U.S. policymakers have acknowledged the need for reforms in international police programs. U.S. policymakers have recognized issues in recruiting and deploying qualified CivPol personnel. PDD-71 aims to enhance response capacities by improving operational activities and providing guidance for recruitment, training, management, and deployment of U.S. CivPol personnel. Analysts emphasize the need to improve the system despite some positive perceptions about the U.S. civilian police program. The Department of State has issued contracts for a reserve cadre of up to 2,000 U.S. law enforcement personnel for international police service. The contractor is responsible for recruitment, training, and deployment support to facilitate rapid deployment of qualified CivPols. This initiative aims to eliminate the need for repeated recruitment and training activities. The State Department has issued contracts for a reserve cadre of up to 2,000 U.S. law enforcement personnel for international police service. The contractor is responsible for recruitment, training, and deployment support to facilitate rapid deployment of qualified CivPols. The decision to award contracts to multiple companies for the new CivPol cadre program has raised concerns about potential delays and costs. The State Department has awarded contracts for a reserve cadre of up to 2,000 U.S. law enforcement personnel for international police service. Concerns have been raised about potential delays and costs with the new CivPol cadre program. The recruitment method for police officers has drawn from overextended municipal and state forces, leading to problems with adequate police staffing. Some analysts suggest that the United States could recruit a more professional and qualified police force by providing compensation to state and municipal governments for detailing officers to CivPol missions. This would require new legal arrangements as current law enforcement agencies receive no financial incentives for officers participating in such missions. Some argue that recruiting individual U.S. police officers instead of formed police units has led to a less cohesive U.S. police contingent in international police service. The selection criteria for civilian police candidates include U.S. citizenship, eight years of work experience as a sworn civilian law enforcement officer, an unblemished record, and physical fitness requirements. The Department of State requires candidates for international police service to have a standard transmission 4x4 vehicle, excellent health, a valid U.S. passport, and English communication skills. They must also be able to qualify with a 9mm semi-automatic handgun. Recruitment goals are being met, with a focus on specialized skills. The State Department CivPol cadre program aims to have 55% specialists in the total cadre, with qualifications including interpersonal, leadership, training, and negotiation skills. The CivPol cadre program requires officer qualifications such as interpersonal, leadership, training, and negotiation skills, as well as knowledge of international police standards. Training is provided annually to enhance policing skills and incentivize high-quality officers to join the program. Funding for training all members of the program is uncertain. The current U.S. CivPol program faces challenges in training due to varying levels of skills among recruited police officers from different departments. The pre-deployment training includes topics like UN peace operations, ICITAP, mission overview, team building, and human rights. Some experts find the training insufficient. The new State Department CivPol cadre program aims to improve training by meeting Police Officer Standards and Training (POST) certification requirements and international principles of democratic policing and human rights. The program includes training in policing skills, specialized and in-service training, driving, language, firearms tests, and additional annual training. The new CivPol cadre program includes additional annual training, which may lead to higher costs due to increased trainees and facilities. The U.S. CivPol contingent currently deploys within 30-45 days, falling short of the proposed 15-day deployment capability under new legislation. Maintaining current deployment capability under the new system is uncertain. The new CivPol cadre program aims to decrease deployment time by maintaining a database of commercial sources for equipment and providing advanced logistical support. However, it is unclear if these provisions will continue under the new system, and the potential for delays in deployments due to new bidding processes is uncertain. European countries deploy police from their national forces to international CivPol operations, except for the United Kingdom. European governments have recognized the need to reform deployment systems to improve international CivPol capabilities. The EU has developed goals to enhance the quality and timeliness of contributions to police missions, including a plan to create a 5,000 civilian reserve police force. The EU agreed to develop a 5,000 civilian reserve police force for international peace operations by 2003, within the context of the European Security and Defense Policy. The G\u00c3\u00b6teborg European Council adopted a Police Action Plan in June 2001 to establish common requirements for police selection, training, command, and control. EU Member States have committed to the Rapid Reaction Mechanism for flexible funding of civilian crisis management operations. EU Member States have committed up to 5,000 police officers for crisis management operations, with 1,400 available for rapid deployment within 30 days. They also pledged to provide 13 rapidly deployable police units and four headquarters units for missions. A joint exercise in Italy tested the interoperability of integrated police units. The EU launched its first ESDP mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2003, aiming to establish sustainable peace. The EU launched a police mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina with almost 500 police officers and 70 civilian experts from 33 states. The mission's annual budget is US $47.2 million. In the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the EU started a second police mission with 200 police and civilian personnel, with a budget of US$18.6 million for the first year. EU Member States have committed police officers for crisis management operations and exceeded the goal for rapid deployment. Some analysts are skeptical about the reformed EU crisis management capabilities. Some analysts doubt that the EU's reformed crisis management capabilities will significantly enhance its response, citing Member States' reluctance to relinquish national sovereignty. The OSCE has also bolstered its operational abilities, deploying CivPols in various countries and establishing the REACT program for rapid expert assistance. The OSCE has established the REACT program to deploy experts in conflict prevention, crisis management, and post-conflict missions. Participating States can create their own database of qualified civilian experts for rapid deployment within two to eight weeks. The program focuses on training, reform, and development of local police, emphasizing human rights, rule of law, and economic stabilization. The OSCE's 55 participating States have implemented the REACT program by creating national websites for recruitment and providing mechanisms for applications. Some States have given numerical commitments in specific expertise fields, following a framework of standards for educational and experience requirements. The OSCE developed a staffing matrix to assist in recruiting qualified candidates based on past and current field activities. The OSCE uses a staffing matrix to recruit CivPols with specific requirements including police training, experience, English proficiency, negotiation skills, mapping skills, and first aid experience. Desired skills include liaison experience with NGOs and ability to operate police radio equipment. Mission-specific requirements focus on specific skills. OSCE also recruits law enforcement administrators with 8-20 years of experience in law enforcement and police management. In the 108th Congress, Members introduced three bills to strengthen U.S. and international capabilities for CivPol missions and rule of law missions. H.R. 1414 aims to enhance UNCIVPOL capabilities, H.R. 2616 addresses issues with U.S. CivPol capabilities and proposes creating NATO capabilities for post-conflict efforts, and S. 2127 seeks to improve U.S. civilian response to crises abroad. Analysts suggest options to improve training, constabulary functions, and law enforcement institutions. H.R. 1414, the International Rule of Law and Antiterrorism Act of 2003, proposes substantial reform to make UNCIVPOL more effective and address recruitment and training issues. It calls for the establishment of a professional United Nations civilian police corps (UNCPC) for rapid deployment to peacekeeping missions. The bill proposes the establishment of a United Nations civilian police corps for rapid deployment to peace operations, composed of law enforcement professionals with appropriate training and resources. The bill aims to establish a United Nations civilian police corps for rapid deployment to peace operations, with a focus on improving the current system and addressing deployment and enforcement gaps. Proponents believe it will enhance the UN's ability to maintain a secure environment and reduce the need for combat. The bill proposes establishing a United Nations civilian police corps to improve peace operations by reducing the need for combat soldiers and enhancing the skills and accountability of personnel. Opponents are concerned about the cost and sustainability of a standing corps funded through mandatory assessments. Some concerns have been raised about giving the United Nations responsibility for a permanent UNCPC due to limited management capacity and potential infringement on national sovereignty. H.R. 2616, the Winning the Peace Act of 2003, proposes new mechanisms for security in post-conflict situations, including the establishment of a United Nations civilian police corps. The proposal suggests establishing a U.S. civilian police reserve to assist in post-conflict situations and train indigenous police forces. Another proposal calls for a new NATO mechanism to provide military and policing services in similar situations. Congress would establish a task force to develop the reserve, while the Administration would propose to NATO the training and equipping of selected units. The bill proposes training and equipping selected NATO units to provide security in reconstruction situations. It also suggests establishing an \"integrated security support component\" within NATO for this purpose. The personnel in this component should be capable of serving as a police force and performing tasks such as controlling belligerent groups, apprehending targeted persons, and supporting police investigations. The proposed legislation aims to support international capabilities for post-conflict reconstruction by establishing a civilian police reserve. Proponents debate whether to follow the State Department's private sector model or create a new U.S. government reserve force. Commercial contractors are favored for their quick response times in this context. Proponents of the government-created model argue that a government reserve is a more potent symbol of U.S. capabilities, while opponents raise concerns about the dedication and efficiency of commercial contractors in policing operations. Proponents of a government reserve argue it would be more responsive to U.S. policy, cohesive, and accountable. They believe a government agency could ensure better quality recruits and draw personnel from local and state police departments with a compensation system. The NATO constabulary capability could bridge enforcement gaps by providing necessary skills in post-conflict situations. However, concerns exist about using a military organization for policing functions, as it may send inappropriate signals over time. Some critics argue that creating a reserve within NATO may duplicate EU structures and add friction in US-European relations. Analysts suggest additional provisions for equipment, training, and coordination with the military to avoid delays in deployment and lack of conformity in policing styles. Some critics are skeptical of the need for police reserves and the commitment of U.S. police officers to them, arguing that it may draw upon existing resources and contribute to tensions with local and state governments. Senators Lugar and Biden introduced the Stabilization and Reconstruction Civilian Management Act of 2004 (S. 2127) to reorganize government structures for a more effective response to civilian foreign affairs. The Stabilization and Reconstruction Civilian Management Act of 2004 (S. 2127) aims to enhance the capacity of civilian foreign affairs agencies to respond to overseas crises by creating a Response Readiness Corps. This Corps would consist of personnel from the State Department and USAID, with a designated Response Readiness Reserve roster including federal employees and non-government personnel. Training would be provided for these missions, with a requirement for 10% of State Department and USAID personnel to be trained within three years of enactment. The legislation introduced by Senator Lugar does not specify the types of rule of law personnel to be recruited, and the balance between stability and reconstruction experts is unclear. Experts suggest that improved training and professionalization of CivPol personnel could help bridge the deployment gap, as pre-deployment training has not kept pace with the increasing scope and mandate of police missions. Training adjustments have been made on a case-by-case basis in places like Bosnia, Kosovo, and East Timor. Training adjustments were made on a case-by-case basis in Bosnia, Kosovo, and East Timor. PDD-71 proposed maintaining the capacity for tailored training packages for CivPol when requested, with some analysts recommending increased funding for police training. The State Department's new CivPol cadre bid solicitation included a provision for U.S. training of foreign police personnel, pending decisions on program details and funding. The option to address deployment and enforcement gaps is to increase international constabulary capabilities in nations that already have them and create new capabilities in nations that do not. Constabulary police perform tasks requiring less force than combat but more than routine law enforcement activities, including regulating people's movements for safety and intervening in civil violence or organized crimes. (H.R. 2616 proposes incorporating a constabulary unit within NATO.) Constabulary forces are essential for handling hostile situations in post-conflict areas. They are trained in both military and policing skills, equipped with communication and logistical support, and deploy rapidly as formed units. Analysts suggest establishing specialized paramilitary units for better enforcement capabilities. Specialized paramilitary units like the Italian carabinieri, French gendarmerie, and Spanish Guardia Civil are recommended for constabulary tasks in peacekeeping operations due to high deployment rates straining national police forces. Some argue for the U.S. army to develop its own constabulary force to support military police during peacekeeping missions. The U.S. Army is considering developing a peacekeeping capability despite resistance from Army leaders who prioritize warfighting missions. Analysts question the effectiveness of military forces that do not establish conditions for lasting peace. Advocates argue for adaptable forces capable of handling various conflict environments. Constabulary forces can serve as an intermediary security force for peace operations, handling violent situations beyond CivPol's capabilities. This can reduce reliance on combat soldiers for policing activities and shorten withdrawal time from post-conflict situations. Analysts are unsure if other countries would enhance their constabulary capabilities or if countries without them would develop them for deployment abroad. Some analysts believe countries are increasingly focused on meeting domestic needs, similar to U.S. localities stressed by deploying police officers abroad. The United States and other countries are concerned about meeting domestic needs and are considering developing a \"U.S. Force for Stability\" to address the institution gap in peace operations. Analysts suggest creating rapidly deployable units of law enforcement and rule of law personnel for sustainable security. The U.S. currently deploys personnel with justice and corrections experience through Department of Justice contracts funded by the State Department's INL CivPol program. The State Department's new CivPol cadre program aims to identify such personnel for deployment. Robert S. Perito, a special advisor at the USIP, advocates for integrating military and civilian personnel to form a \"U.S. force for stability\" to address security gaps in post-conflict interventions. The proposed force would consist of robust military forces and law enforcement personnel to break the cycle of impunity. The U.S. stability force proposed by Robert S. Perito would include robust military forces, civilian constabulary units, civilian police, and rule of law professionals. These forces would deploy concurrently to provide security from the outset and bridge deployment gaps. Civilian personnel would take over law enforcement functions once security conditions permit, with the military shifting to perimeter security after major combat operations. The proposed U.S. stability force by Robert S. Perito includes military, civilian constabulary units, civilian police, and justice experts to suppress lawlessness and restore public safety. The model aims for a transition from military to civilian control over law enforcement functions, similar to NATO and U.N. forces in Kosovo. Recommendations from a November 2003 National Defense University report also suggest deploying civilian personnel alongside combat forces for a quicker transfer of responsibilities. The report recommends creating a standing interagency stabilization and reconstruction team within the government, along with an \"on-call\" civilian crisis management corps. Another recommendation is the establishment of an Agency for Stability Operations reporting directly to the Secretary of State, responsible for preparing and managing Civilian Stability Operations Corps and Reserve. The Stability Operations Reserve proposes a \"stability force\" model with non-government civilians on-call for rapid deployment. Early deployment of rule of law personnel is seen as crucial for security and long-term stability in intervened or post-conflict countries. However, implementing this force would require significant changes in U.S. practices, including developing constabulary capabilities for the military and providing constabulary and police personnel for the international civilian police component. Perito proposes a new federal agency to provide constabulary and police personnel, recruiting active duty and retired officers as temporary federal employees instead of using contractors. This model could be controversial and offers advantages in establishing security rapidly in crisis countries, depending on recruitment and hiring methods. The ease of deployment for stability forces depends on recruitment methods. Federalizing personnel like CivPols may be more efficient than hiring through private contractors. Rapid deployment relies on recruitment arrangements, with benefits similar to U.S. military reserves. Sources: U.N. Peacekeeping Fact Sheets. The curr_chunk provides information on various resources for peacekeeping operations, including fact sheets from the U.N. Department of Peacekeeping Operations, information on EU Police, OMIK information from OSCE, and references to books on policing in peace operations. The dispatch of international police units to advise and train local forces dates back to the late 1800s. The first use of U.N. civilian police in peacekeeping was in the Congo in 1960, assisting with maintaining order. In 1962-63, the United Nations provided UNTEA to administer West New Guinea during the transition from Dutch to Indonesian rule. Philippine police officers were recruited to assist the local force. The UNFICYP in Cyprus, starting in 1964, was the first operation to use the term UNCIVPOL and the first multilateral U.N. police force. UNFICYP CivPols helped Cypriot police maintain order and security in sensitive areas to ease tensions. Monitoring mandates in Cambodia and other regions from 1989 to early 1992 focused on monitoring local police performance. Operations in Namibia and Western Sahara were among the earliest post-cold war missions. In 1992, post-cold war operations in Namibia and Western Sahara involved well-trained police forces. The United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) in Namibia monitored the electoral process for independence. UNCIVPOL missions included patrolling separately from local police and investigating complaints. UNTAG set the model for early monitoring missions in the early 1990s. In 1991, the U.N. Mission for the Referendum in Southwest Sahara (MINURSO) was established to conduct a referendum on the future status of the former Spanish colony, facing opposition from Morocco. Other monitoring missions in Angola and Cambodia occurred in challenging situations post-tenuous peace accords. Additional functions were occasionally deemed necessary by actors in the field, such as deploying police monitors in the U.N. Protection Force peacekeeping operation to the new states formed after the break-up of Yugoslavia. The U.N. peacekeeping operation in Cambodia (UNTAC) focused on monitoring political liberties and human rights violations, with a shift in responsibilities in the field. The U.N. peacekeeping operation in Cambodia addressed violations of political liberties and human rights. The U.N. Secretary-General's representative granted arrest powers to CivPols due to the failure of Cambodian police to apprehend suspects. However, delays in deployment and inadequate police numbers hindered the operation's effectiveness. The UNTAC police mission in Cambodia shifted its focus from law and order to monitoring elections. Limited training was provided for Cambodian police and judiciary due to resource constraints. The lack of an independent judicial system hindered the promotion of justice by UNTAC police. The Pol Pot regime systematically removed individuals punished by UNTAC police. Analysts proposed deploying integrated justice packages with justice, penal officials, and police officers. Police reform became pivotal in the U.N. Observer Mission in El Salvador, with unprecedented international support for civilian control of security forces. International police forces' reform role was established through peace accords in January 1992. The United Nations mediated peace accords in El Salvador in April 1990, ending a decade-long civil war. The accords focused on security affairs, including dismantling military-controlled security forces and creating a new National Civilian Police force. ONUSAL, operational since July 1991, provided UNCIVPOLs in March 1992 to assist in the transition and training of new police recruits. The United Nations oversaw the creation of a new police academy and force in El Salvador after the civil war. International contributions were coordinated by the UNDP, with the US and Chile providing assistance. The success of the new police force was seen as crucial for the country's reconciliation and democratization, despite encountering significant problems. The UN oversaw the creation of a new police force in El Salvador after the civil war, despite high crime rates and military interference. Subsequent missions, like the one in Mozambique, also focused on training and reform mandates for civilian police. After the formal UN operations in Mozambique, international police support continued through bilateral training programs, particularly by the Spanish Guardia Civil. Training and reform efforts were also seen in Rwanda, Somalia, and Haiti, with the US leading initiatives in Somalia through UNITAF to restore order after the collapse of the dictatorship of Siad Barre. After the collapse of Siad Barre's dictatorship, UNITAF began establishing an interim Auxiliary Security Force (ASF) in Somalia to enforce locally agreed upon laws and be controlled by the community. The ASF aimed to eliminate the need for UNITAF troops to serve as police, reduce confusion about their role, and minimize casualties on both sides. The establishment of a police force in Somalia by UNITAF aimed to address criminal activity, create jobs, and provide income to unemployed Somalis. The Somalipolice were encouraged to act independently with allied military forces as backup. Assistance for the ASF was provided by UNITAF, the United Nations, and individual nations, including salary payments, equipment provision, and refurbishment of police stations by the UNDP. Italian, Dutch, and German police experts also supported the new force with uniforms and equipment. The ASF in Somalia was supported by UNITAF, UNDP, and individual nations like Italy, providing uniforms and equipment. UNITAF military forces from Morocco, Botswana, and the UAE offered training and conducted joint patrols. The World Food Program supplied food rations. UNOSOM II took over in May 1993, with ASF operating in Mogadishu and 17 other cities. Plans were made to establish a 10,000 member Somali police force by the end of 1994, despite challenges from militant factions. The U.N. faced challenges in Somalia as General Mohamed Farah Aidid's faction posed a threat. Despite efforts to rebuild the Somali police, courts, and prisons, inadequate staffing and funding hindered progress. UNCIVPOL took time to arrive and faced obstacles in training and cultural differences. Programs with ICITAP for police training collapsed due to escalating violence and insecurity. The need for police development and reform in Somalia was recognized by the end of the 1990s. The Brahimi Panel Report in August 2000 recommended a shift in the use of civilian personnel in peace operations to focus on building local police capacity. Enforcement and institutional gaps were identified in Somalia and Haiti. The lack of commitment to support civilian police in Somalia led to the concept of an \"enforcement gap.\" Analysts found that having an adequate police force may not be enough to control violence in post-conflict situations without a widely-accepted peace accord. Military force was sometimes necessary to maintain law and order, either as the primary force or as a supplement to police. The Somalia operation highlighted various problems, including the need for an international civilian police force. Analysts believe that international civilian police forces struggle without an effective cease-fire, lack suitable training for local police, and face institutional gaps. In Haiti, U.S. and U.N. police reform efforts revealed challenges due to institutional gaps, with the Multilateral Force's police component aiming to establish a new Haitian national police force. A multinational force from 20 countries was formed to create and train a new Haitian national police force. The force supervised an interim public security force and vetted former members of Haiti's armed forces. The subsequent UN Mission in Haiti took over monitoring and training functions, with three follow-on missions sent over the next five years to continue professionalizing the Haitian police. Coordination between military forces and civilian police was crucial for establishing and maintaining public security during the training and deployment of the Haitian National Police. The multinational force trained and deployed the Haitian National Police, adjusting rules of engagement to deter violence. MNF military police conducted patrols and provided training to IPMs. The transition to the UN mission in Haiti was smooth, bridging the law enforcement gap. The UNMIH operation in Haiti provided rapid backup and technical assistance to the Haitian National Police, contributing to stability by deterring crime and political violence. Despite efforts to compensate for deployment gaps, institutional challenges such as overcrowded prisons and a corrupt judicial system hindered public security establishment. In Bosnia, Special Constabulary Units were created by the United Nations to address the \"Enforcement Gap\" from 1995-1999. The United Nations had full responsibility for international police assistance in Bosnia from 1995-2002 under the mandate of the December 1995 Dayton Accords. This assistance was carried out through the International Police Task Force (IPTF) to monitor, advise, and train law enforcement personnel in Bosnia. The International Police Task Force (IPTF) was responsible for monitoring, advising, and training law enforcement personnel in Bosnia from 1995-2002. The European Union took over these responsibilities in 2003 through the EU Police Mission (EUPM). The 1,721 unarmed IPTF CivPols lacked enforcement powers and struggled to maintain public order among hostile groups in Bosnia. The International Police Task Force (IPTF) faced challenges in Bosnia due to the lack of enforcement powers. The slow deployment of IPTF personnel was compensated by assistance from the NATO peacekeeping Implementation Force (IFOR). The early 1996 transfer of control of certain areas of Sarajevo was a test for both IPTF and IFOR. The IPTF faced challenges in Bosnia due to a lack of enforcement powers, leading to a perception of failure and loss of credibility. The slow deployment of personnel and inability to act on violations resulted in a flight of Bosnian Serbs from Sarajevo suburbs. This highlighted an \"enforcement gap\" as IFOR refused to act in a law enforcement capacity. The IPTF struggled to recover from these setbacks, making it difficult to gain popular confidence. In late 1996, the smaller NATO Stabilization Force (SFOR) replaced IFOR in Bosnia, providing backup for the IPTF in maintaining public order. Specialized paramilitary units from foreign nations like France, Italy, and Spain were integrated into the IPTF to handle exceptional law enforcement situations. The Multinational Specialized Unit (MSU) was formed in Bosnia in 1998 to fill the gap between military capabilities and unarmed police monitors. The success in Bosnia led to the formation of similar units in Kosovo and East Timor. In 1999, the mandates and powers of international civilian police were expanded in Kosovo and East Timor, granting them executive authority powers. After the coalition air war against Serbia, NATO and the United Nations took responsibility for stabilizing Kosovo and providing security through KFOR and UNMIK. The OSCE oversaw and trained the Kosovo Police Service. In East Timor, UNTAET provided civil administration functions. In East Timor, UNTAET provided civil administration from 1999 to 2002 during its transition to independence from Indonesia. A security vacuum was avoided with the mandate for U.N. forces and INTERFET to exercise executive authority. The necessity of executive authority in the absence of a local police force is debated. In cases where there is no local police force to monitor or train, the availability of international civilian police personnel is limited. Recruiting and deploying such police forces with executive authority can be challenging, especially when local police forces are deemed unsuitable. Sovereignty considerations also play a significant role in decision-making."
