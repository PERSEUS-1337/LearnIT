The Congress finds that the number of airline passengers on US carriers is expected to grow to 1 billion by 2008. The number of certified large air carriers has decreased, with 6 of the largest carriers forming 3 large networks. Only 2/3 of communities with scheduled air service in 1978 still have it, with half served by smaller airlines feeding hub airports. The Fares Consumer Report for the 3rd Quarter of 1997 identified 75 major city pairs with fare increases of 30% or more, leading to a decrease of 863,500 passengers. A 1998 Department of Transportation study revealed that large US air carriers charge double at hub airports without low fare competition compared to those with low fare competitors. Complaints about airline travel filed with the Department of Transportation have risen by over 25% from the previous year. Complaints against large US air carriers increased from 6,394 in 1997 to 7,994 in 1998. The 1997 National Civil Aviation Review Commission reported worsening flight delays, with a 20% increase in delays of 15 minutes or longer in 1996 compared to 1995. Forecasts show a 52% increase in passenger enplanements between 1996 and 2006, with 4.2% annual growth in revenue passenger miles. A 1998 Department of Transportation study found that large US air carriers charge about 60% more at hub airports without low fare competition. The Congress has directed the Secretary of Transportation to prohibit unfair and deceptive practices in the airline industry, particularly focusing on the large United States air carriers charging about 60 percent more to passengers traveling to or from small communities compared to those traveling between large communities. The Congress has directed the Secretary of Transportation to prohibit unfair and deceptive practices in the airline industry, particularly focusing on the large United States air carriers charging about 60 percent more to passengers traveling to or from small communities compared to those traveling between large communities. This is outlined in Section 3, which addresses fair practices for airline passengers. Section 41712 of title 49, United States Code, is amended to include specific practices for certificated air carriers, such as informing passengers about oversold flights, allowing the use of portions of a ticket, and delivering checked baggage within 24 hours. The amended Section 41712 of title 49, United States Code, requires certificated air carriers to provide various consumer protections, including delivering checked baggage within 24 hours, giving full access to fares, notifying passengers of flight delays, accurately informing passengers of flight disruptions, and refunding unused tickets. The amended Section 41712 of title 49, United States Code mandates certificated air carriers to refund the full purchase price of an unused ticket within 48 hours, disclose information on frequent flyer programs, and report violations to the Department of Transportation. The term 'confirmed reserved space' is defined as a specific date and flight. The term 'confirmed reserved space' refers to a specific date and flight requested by a passenger and verified by the carrier for accommodation."
