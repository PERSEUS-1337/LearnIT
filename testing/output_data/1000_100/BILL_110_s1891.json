    "content": "IMMUNITY FOR REPORTS OF SUSPECTED TERRORIST ACTIVITY OR SUSPICIOUS BEHAVIOR AND RESPONSE. Immunity is granted to individuals who report suspected terrorist activity or suspicious behavior in good faith and based on reasonable suspicion. They are protected from civil liability under any law for making such reports, except for false reports made knowingly or with reckless disregard for the truth. Authorized officials who respond to covered activity in good faith also have qualified immunity from civil liability. Authorized officials who respond to reported activity in good faith are granted qualified immunity from civil liability under Federal, State, and local law. This immunity does not affect their ability to assert any other defense, privilege, or immunity available to them. In this section, authorized officials are granted qualified immunity from civil liability. They can recover reasonable costs and attorney fees if found immune. Authorized officials are defined as employees or agents of passenger transportation systems or relevant government departments. The term \"covered activity\" refers to any suspicious transaction, activity, or occurrence involving a passenger transportation system or vehicle indicating potential law violations related to threats to passenger safety, security, or terrorism. Passenger transportation includes public transportation as defined by law. The term \"passenger transportation system\" includes various modes of transportation such as over-the-road bus, school bus, intercity passenger rail, passenger vessel, waterborne transportation, and air transportation for passengers. The term \"vehicle\" is defined in section 1992(16) of title 18, United States Code. This section will take effect immediately upon enactment and applies to all activities and claims occurring after that date."
