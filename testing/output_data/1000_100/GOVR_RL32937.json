    "content": "In the 109th Congress, legislation has been approved to reauthorize and revise the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Block Grant, including changes to the Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program. S. 667 and H.R. 240 were reported by the Senate Finance Committee and House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources, respectively. The CSE program, enacted in 1975, is administered by the Office of Child Support Enforcement in the Department of Health and Human Services. The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program is administered by the Department of Health and Human Services and funded by general revenues. All 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands operate CSE programs. Families receiving TANF benefits, foster care payments, or Medicaid coverage automatically qualify for CSE services. Child support collected on behalf of nonwelfare families goes to the family. Between FY1978 and FY2003, child support payments collected by CSE agencies increased significantly. The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program saw a significant increase in child support payments collected from FY1978 to FY2003. The program handles at least 50% of all child support cases and provides various services including parent location, paternity establishment, and collection of support payments. Despite the growth, the program still only collects 18% of child support obligations it is responsible for. The Child Support Enforcement program handles various services including support orders, collection and distribution of payments, establishment and enforcement of medical support. Collection methods include income withholding, intercept of tax refunds, liens against property, and reporting to credit bureaus. Legislation enacted in 1992 and 1998 established federal criminal offenses for noncustodial parents who fail to financially support their children. States are required to implement expedited procedures for child support enforcement. The Child Support Enforcement program enforces support orders through various methods, including intercepting payments from sources like unemployment and workers' compensation, seizing assets, and suspending licenses of noncompliant parents. Legislation mandates states to implement expedited procedures for enforcement, including quarterly data matches with financial institutions to seize resources of noncustodial parents in arrears. P.L. 104-193 authorized the Secretary of State to deny passports of debtor parents and required states to enact UIFSA. The federal government reimburses states for CSE program costs and laboratory paternity testing. P.L. 105-200 established a new incentive payment system for effective child support programs. The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program, established in 1998, has a statutory limit of $446 million for incentive payments in FY2005. The program focuses on cost-recovery, service delivery, promoting self-sufficiency, and parental responsibility. It helps secure financial support for children from noncustodial parents, leading to self-sufficiency and reduced reliance on public assistance. Child support payments are a significant income source for single-parent families, constituting 17% of family income on average and up to 30% for poor families. Both S. 667 and H.R. 240 aim to enhance the Child Support Enforcement program to increase economic independence for former welfare families and provide stable income for single-parent families. The bills focus on simplifying CSE rules, strengthening family-first policies, and revising enforcement tools. The Senate bill includes a more extensive list of provisions compared to the House bill. The CSE provisions in S.667 and H.R. 240 require families receiving TANF benefits to assign their child support rights to the state. This includes child support accrued before and during TANF receipt. The assigned child support is kept by states and the federal government as reimbursement. Nonwelfare families applying for CSE services do not have to assign their child support rights and receive all collected payments. The assignment process for child support rights involves the state receiving all child support collected on behalf of families receiving TANF benefits. The date of the assignment determines which arrearages are permanently or temporarily assigned to the state. Under S. 667, only child support accrued during TANF receipt is assigned to the state, with pre-assistance arrearages returning to the family when they leave TANF. H.R. 240 does not change child support assignment rules, while distribution rules determine the order of payment for child support collections during TANF receipt. The 1996 welfare law repealed the $50 required pass through and gave states the choice to decide how much of child support payments collected on behalf of TANF families to send to the family. States also decide whether to treat child support payments as income to the family. States have discretion over their share of child support collections, but are required to pay the federal government's share. As of August 2004, 18 states were fully paid TANF Families. Both bills aim to direct more child support to TANF families, with federal incentives for a \"family-first\" policy. The bills differ in federal cost-sharing and whether to support current policies or encourage new ones. S. 667 proposes federal cost-sharing for the entire cost. The Senate Finance Committee's bill, S. 667, proposes federal cost-sharing for pass-through and disregard policies used by states to pay child support to TANF families. States can pay up to $400 per month per child (or $600 for two or more children) without reimbursing the federal government. The House bill, H.R. 240, incentivizes states to increase child support payments to TANF families. The House bill incentivizes states to increase child support payments to TANF families by providing federal cost-sharing for pass-through payments above the state's previous contributions. The federal government's cost-sharing is limited to $100 per month or $50 more than the state's previous share, and states must disregard child support collections when determining TANF benefits for families. The \"family-first\" policy requires states to prioritize distributing child support collections to former TANF families before reimbursing the state and federal government. Child support accrued before and after TANF benefits go to the family, while support during TANF goes to the state. This prioritization aims to support families once they leave the TANF program. Child support accrued during TANF goes to the state, while support before and after TANF benefits goes to the family. S. 667 and H.R. 240 propose giving states the option to distribute the full amount of child support collected to former TANF families, including arrearages. This aims to reduce dependence on public assistance by promoting exit from TANF and preventing re-entry. The federal government would share costs with states for paying child support arrearages to families first. The House bill and S. 667 propose giving states the option to distribute full child support amounts to former TANF families, including arrearages. Both bills also include provisions for passport denial, Social Security benefits, veterans' benefits, and using the federal income tax refund offset program for child support collection. The House bill and S. 667 propose expanding states' ability to collect child support payments, including authorizing the HHS Secretary to compare information of noncustodial parents with insurers and seize financial assets. Additionally, S. 667 allows assisting states to establish child support interstate cases based on requests for assistance from other states. The House bill and S. 667 aim to enhance child support collection by allowing the comparison of noncustodial parents' information with insurers and seizing financial assets. They also enable states to establish child support interstate cases upon request. Additionally, the bills include provisions for reviewing and adjusting child support orders, reporting procedures for locating custodial parents, and designating Indian tribes for access to the Federal Parent Locator Service. H.R. 240 proposes a $25 annual provision. The Federal Parent Locator Service is addressed in both H.R. 240 and S. 667. H.R. 240 proposes a $25 annual fee for individuals receiving CSE services. S. 667 includes provisions to increase funding for CSE access and visitation programs, adopt a later version of UIFSA, and allow Texas to operate its CSE program without a federal waiver.
