    "content": "The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) was established by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 to protect pensions of participants in private sector defined benefit plans. PBGC insures single-employer and multiemployer pension plans, covering about 37 million participants in FY2018. In FY2018, PBGC insured 25,000 DB pension plans for 37 million people and paid benefits to 1.4 million individuals. It is the trustee of 4,919 single-employer plans and provided financial assistance to 78 multiemployer pensions. PBGC pays a maximum benefit to plan participants, with most receiving their full pension benefit. 49% of participants in terminated multiemployer plans have benefits below the PBGC guarantee, while 51% have benefits exceeding it. PBGC is a government-owned corporation with a three-member board of directors chaired by the Secretary of Labor. The Director of PBGC is appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. ERISA also provides for a seven-member Advisory Committee, appointed by the President, for staggered three-year terms. The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21; P.L. 112-141) altered some of the governance structures of PBGC, including setting the term of the PBGC Director at five years and establishing a Participant and Plan Sponsor Advocate within PBGC. PBGC is required by ERISA to be self-supporting and receives no appropriations from general revenue. The main source of PBGC revenue is premiums set by Congress and paid by private-sector employers sponsoring DB pension plans. Other income sources include assets from terminated plans, investment income, and recoveries from underfunded plans. The Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980 requires PBGC's finances to be included in federal budget totals. Employers of private-sector pension plans pay various premiums to PBGC. The sponsors of single-employer and multiemployer pension plans pay premiums to PBGC. Single-employer plans pay flat-rate and additional premiums based on underfunding. Terminated plans pay a per-participant premium for three years. Premiums for 2019 include a flat-rate premium of $80 per participant and a variable-rate premium for underfunded plans. The sponsors of single-employer DB pension plans pay a termination premium of $1,250 per participant per year for three years after plan termination. Multiemployer plans pay a flat-rate premium of $29 per participant in 2019. PBGC only covers DB plans that meet IRC Section 401 requirements for tax benefits. DC plans like 401(k) and 403(b) are not insured by PBGC. Pension plans must meet specific requirements to be qualified under the IRC, including providing determinable benefits, non-discrimination against highly compensated employees, and coverage of a minimum number of employees. Certain types of pension plans are excluded from PBGC insurance, such as governmental plans, church plans, and plans with fewer than 25 participants. PBGC operates separate insurance programs for single-employer and multiemployer pension plans. In the single-employer program, PBGC becomes trustee of terminated underfunded plans, while in the multiemployer program, PBGC provides loans to insolvent plans. An employer can voluntarily terminate a single-employer plan in either a standard or distress termination. PBGC may involuntarily terminate an underfunded plan if the sponsor is unable to fund its pension obligations. A company may voluntarily end its pension plan if the plan's assets are sufficient to cover benefit liabilities. PBGC's role is to confirm termination requirements have been met, and benefit liabilities include vested and nonvested benefits. When a pension plan terminates, benefits are distributed to participants through annuity contracts or lump-sum payments. Any excess assets may be recovered by the employer through an asset reversion, subject to an excise tax. If the plan is underfunded and terminates involuntarily, it goes into PBGC receivership. When a pension plan terminates involuntarily, it goes into PBGC receivership. PBGC becomes the trustee, takes control of assets, and pays benefit liabilities from recovered assets and its funds. Distress terminations require specific criteria to be met for plan termination. The criteria for distress termination of a pension plan include seeking liquidation in bankruptcy, filing for reorganization in bankruptcy court, PBGC determining termination is necessary for debt payment, or to avoid burdensome pension costs due to workforce decline. These requirements were added by SEPPAA in 1986 and modified by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) may terminate a plan involuntarily if it does not meet minimum funding standards, cannot pay benefits, has a substantial owner who received a large distribution, or if PBGC expects unreasonable losses. The PBGC may terminate a plan if it cannot pay benefits currently due, to protect participants' interests, avoid financial deterioration, or prevent an increase in PBGC's liability. From FY1974 to FY2016, PBGC became trustee of 4,769 single-employer DB pension plans out of terminations. Most terminations are standard, with only a small fraction resulting in claims against PBGC. Following distress or involuntary termination, the plan sponsor and their controlled group members are jointly liable to PBGC for the plan's shortfall, which is the plan's liabilities minus its assets at termination. The liability is payable in cash or securities, and failure to pay may result in a lien on the employer's property. If the sponsor is in bankruptcy, PBGC cannot create a lien. When an underfunded plan terminates, PBGC has the same legal standing as other creditors of the plan sponsor. PBGC's ability to recover assets is limited, and the benefits it pays depend on the statutory limit on guaranteed benefits, the terminated plan's assets, and recoveries from the plan sponsor. PBGC guarantees nonforfeitable retirement benefits and certain death, survivor, or disability benefits that were owed or in payment status at the plan termination date. Only monthly installment retirement benefits are guaranteed. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 phased in PBGC guarantees for contingent benefits over five years. ERISA sets a maximum pension guarantee of $67,295 a year for workers aged 65 in plans terminating in 2019, adjusted annually for wage growth. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 phased in PBGC guarantees for contingent benefits over five years. The maximum pension guarantee is adjusted annually based on age and type of benefit received. The benefit is decreased if received before age 65 and increased if received after age 65. Examples of PBGC's annual maximum benefit for different ages and benefit types are provided in Table 3. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 phased in PBGC guarantees for contingent benefits over five years. The maximum pension guarantee is adjusted annually based on age and type of benefit received. Basic benefits are guaranteed, including benefits at normal retirement age, early retirement, disability benefits, and survivor benefits. Vested benefits are insured, with an average monthly benefit of $606 for retirees in FY2015. Over 80% of PBGC recipients in single-employer plans received their full benefits, with an average reduction of 28% for those whose benefits were reduced. Terminated plan assets are allocated to pay benefits according to a priority schedule. Terminated plan assets are allocated to pay benefits based on a priority schedule established by statute. Nonguaranteed benefits are paid before guaranteed benefits, with priority given to participants receiving pension payments for over three years. PBGC also pays a portion of unfunded, nonguaranteed benefits based on assets recovered from the employer. In the case of multiemployer plans, PBGC insures plan insolvency rather than termination, providing financial assistance when a plan's resources are insufficient to cover benefits. PBGC provides loans to multiemployer plans when their available resources are insufficient to pay benefits, with repayment required if the plan recovers from insolvency. Only one multiemployer plan has repaid any financial assistance received from PBGC. The benefit guarantee limit for participants in multiemployer plans is determined by multiplying a flat dollar rate by years of service. For a participant with 30 years of service, the guaranteed limit is $12,870. PBGC estimated that 79% of participants in plans receiving financial assistance received their full benefit, but only 49% would receive full benefits in plans needing assistance in the future. Among ongoing plans, the average benefit is almost twice as large. The PBGC's net financial position at the end of FY2018 was -$51.4 billion, with assets of $112.3 billion and liabilities of $163.7 billion. PBGC's main assets include its trust fund and revolving funds, which are used to pay for participants' benefits. The average benefit in plans receiving financial assistance is almost twice as large as in terminated plans, indicating potential benefit reductions for participants in the future. PBGC's main liabilities are future benefits payments in the single-employer program and financial assistance to insolvent plans in the multiemployer program. The single-employer program had a deficit of $23.3 billion by the end of 2004, but showed a surplus in FY2018 due to increased employer premiums. The multiemployer program had a surplus from FY1982. PBGC reported deficits in the multiemployer program since FY2002, projecting insolvency by FY2025 with less than 1% chance of solvency in FY2026. Both single-employer and multiemployer programs are high-risk according to GAO. In FY2015, 825,000 participants received monthly payments with an average of $536. Retiree payees received an average of $606, while beneficiary payees received $307. 40,000 participants received a lump-sum payment averaging $2,054. In FY2015, 40,000 participants received a lump-sum payment averaging $2,054. PBGC's single-employer program showed a surplus of $2.44 billion in FY2018, attributed to factors like investment income and increased premium income. The financial assistance provided to multiemployer plans from FY1995 to FY2018 saw 78 plans receiving assistance in FY2018. Approximately 62,300 participants received assistance in FY2018, with 27,800 expected to receive benefits in the future. The deficit in the multiemployer insurance program increased significantly from $8.3 billion in FY2013 to $65.1 billion in FY2017, before decreasing to $53.8 billion in FY2018. This increase was due to the likelihood of insolvency in large distressed pension plans. The PBGC's financial flows are based on premium and interest income, benefit outlays, and trust and revolving funds. Trust funds hold pension plan assets, while revolving funds contain premiums and trust fund transfers for benefits. Assets of terminated plans are transferred to PBGC's nonbudgetary trust fund, managed by private-sector money managers. The PBGC's investment policy allocates 30% to equities and 70% to fixed income assets. Trust fund investments were $70.2 billion in FY2018. Three revolving funds hold premiums, returns, and transfers for benefits, totaling $33.2 billion in assets. Revolving funds are invested in U.S. Treasury securities. The PBGC's revolving funds hold $33.2 billion in assets, with Fund 1 at $2.1 billion, Fund 2 at $2.1 billion, and Fund 7 at $29.3 billion. These funds are on-budget accounts, with increases or decreases appearing as federal receipts and outlays. Stakeholders criticize recent premium increases, as they feel the funds are used to offset other federal spending and may discourage employers from maintaining their pension plans. PBGC's FY2017 Projections Report estimated the single-employer program's deficit to shrink over the next 10 years. The PBGC projected that the single-employer program's deficit would shrink over the next 10 years, with a $26 billion surplus estimated in 10 years. However, the multiemployer program is likely to run out of money by FY2025, with a 90% chance of insolvency before the end of FY2025 and a 99% chance by 2026. Several large multiemployer pension plans are at risk of insolvency, with an estimated future financial assistance exposure of $53.8 billion. Premium levels may not be sufficient to support insolvent plans, potentially exhausting PBGC's ability to provide assistance. The Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014 allows insolvent plans to reduce benefits to sustain through premium collections only, improving PBGC's financial condition. Insolvent plans without assets would not require financial assistance from PBGC, reducing future assistance expectations. Uncertainty remains in how benefit suspensions and plan provisions will be implemented. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 created a Joint Select Committee on Solvency of Multiemployer Pension Plans to improve plan solvency and PBGC's financial condition. The committee did not meet the deadline for formulating recommendations. Historical data on single-employer program premium levels is provided in Table A-1. Table A-2 provides historical data on multiemployer program premium levels."
