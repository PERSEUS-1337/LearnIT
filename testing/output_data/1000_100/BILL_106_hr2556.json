    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Telecommuting and Air Quality Act\" and includes a grant program for designing a pilot program to improve air quality through telecommuting. The Secretary of Transportation will grant a nonprofit entity to design a pilot program for improving air quality through telecommuting. The program will be administered in collaboration with the EPA and the Department of Energy. Proposed Ozone Precursor Credit-Trading Pilot Program defines key terms related to telecommuting and air quality improvement. The term \"VMTs\" refers to vehicle-miles-traveled. The pilot program aims to evaluate methods for reducing ozone precursor emissions through telecommuting, with employers able to transfer emission reductions to others via certificates. The pilot program aims to reduce ozone precursor emissions through telecommuting, allowing emission credits to be traded in a commercial forum for regulated entities to obtain. These entities can then present the credits to the government to demonstrate reductions in emissions. The pilot program aims to reduce ozone precursor emissions through telecommuting, allowing emission credits to be traded between employers and regulated entities in specific geographic areas like the greater metropolitan regions of Washington D.C. and Los Angeles. The Federal Government would explore means to facilitate the transfer of emission credits for compliance with the Clean Air Act. The Secretary, in consultation with the grantee, will select three additional areas for the pilot program in Los Angeles, California. Grantees must consult with local governments and business organizations in the selected geographic areas. A study and report on the potential impact of the pilot program on telecommuting and reducing vehicle miles traveled (VMTs) must be submitted to Congress and the Secretary. The pilot program aims to reduce vehicle miles traveled (VMTs) in selected geographic areas, with positive effects on transportation policies, energy conservation, air quality, and quality of life. $250,000 is authorized for the grant in fiscal year 2000."
