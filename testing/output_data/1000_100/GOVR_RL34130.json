    "content": "The 2008 farm bill expanded on renewable energy policies established in the 2002 farm bill, which included an energy title. This title authorized funding for research on agriculture-based renewable energy and promoted the adoption of renewable energy systems. Interest in renewable energy has increased due to rising petroleum prices and growth in biofuels production, particularly corn-based ethanol. Policymakers see agriculture-based biofuels as a way to boost rural economic development and reduce energy import dependence. The 2008 farm bill expanded federal support for biofuels like ethanol and biodiesel in response to energy import dependence. It reflects the increased role of biofuels mandated by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, with a focus on cellulosic feedstocks and a goal of 36 billion gallons of renewable fuels by 2022. The emphasis on cellulosic ethanol reflects concerns about economic and environmental issues with corn starch-based ethanol. High commodity prices since 2007 have led to increased livestock feed costs, export prices, and domestic food price inflation. Ethanol production in 2010 used 40% of U.S. corn production, leading to a competition with petroleum in the marketplace. The \"food versus fuel\" debate intensified during the 2008 farm bill debate. The \"food versus fuel\" debate intensified during the 2008 farm bill debate as food price inflation accelerated both in the U.S. and globally, highlighting potential problems with replacing gasoline consumption with corn-based ethanol. Federal programs supporting renewable energy production, including the RFS and federal tax credits for biofuel blenders, have legislative origins outside of the farm bill. The Jobs Creation Act of 2004 and the 2010 Tax Relief Act extended tax credits for biofuels production. The 2008 farm bill expanded programs for biofuels, including corn starch-based ethanol and biodiesel. It contains a distinct energy title covering various energy and agricultural topics, with a focus on renewable energy in Title VII and tax and trade provisions in Title XV. The 2008 farm bill maintains the structure of Title IX from the Senate-passed version, with 13 new provisions in section 9001. The 2008 farm bill includes 3 sections, with key provisions related to biofuels such as tax credits for cellulosic ethanol production, promotion of feedstock production, grants for research and production, and studies on market and environmental impacts. The 2008 farm bill energy title includes provisions for increased biofuels use, expansion of bio-based marketing programs, support for rural energy efficiency, reauthorization of biofuels research programs, and financial incentives for advanced biofuels production. The 2008 farm bill energy title includes provisions for increased biofuels use and support for advanced biofuels production through programs like BCAP and the Biorefinery Assistance program. Funding for advanced biofuels research is also increased under programs like the Agricultural Bioenergy Feedstock and Energy Efficiency Research Initiative. Cellulosic ethanol is produced from cellulose, hemicellulose, or lignin derived from plants. Various agricultural products can be used as feedstock, including prairie grasses, fast-growing woody crops, and waste biomass materials. Cellulosic feedstock like switchgrass offers environmental benefits over corn-based ethanol. Currently, commercial-scale production of cellulosic ethanol is limited to a few small refineries. Due to slow progress in cellulosic ethanol production, the EPA has reduced RFS mandates from 2010 to 2012. The 2008 farm bill extends tax credits for ethanol production, including a $1.01 per gallon credit for cellulosic ethanol to encourage investment. The ethanol blender tax credit and import tariff for ethanol were extended by the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 to spur investment in cellulosic ethanol production. The tariff protects U.S. ethanol from lower-cost imports and offsets the blender tax credit available to any ethanol blended into gasoline in the United States. The Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 extended the ethanol blender tax credit and import tariff for ethanol to promote investment in cellulosic ethanol production. Section 708 of H.R. 4853 further extends these provisions until the end of 2011, with the tariff exceeding the blender tax credit by nine cents, imposing a punitive duty on imported ethanol. The farm bill includes provisions for reports on the impact of increased ethanol production on agricultural and rural economies. The 2008 farm bill authorizes over $1 billion in mandatory funding for various biofuels programs, including the Biorefinery Assistance Program, Bioenergy Program for Advanced Biofuels, Rural Energy for America Program, and Biomass Research and Development Act. This funding is a significant increase from the 2002 farm bill. The 2008 farm bill authorizes over $1.7 billion in discretionary funding for energy-related provisions, a significant increase from the 2002 farm bill. The Biorefinery Assistance Program sees a $600 million increase in authorization. Mandatory funding comes from USDA's Commodity Credit Corporation, while discretionary programs are funded annually through the appropriations process.

The list provides details on energy programs for FY2010 through FY2012, their funding levels, and eventual availability based on budget authority provided by Congress."
