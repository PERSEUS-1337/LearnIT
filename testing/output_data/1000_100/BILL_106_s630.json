Definitions include \"contract\" and \"irrigation district.\" The Act of May 10, 1926 defines terms like \"project\" as the Flathead Irrigation Project, \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of the Interior, and \"Tribe\" as the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes. The Secretary is required to offer a contract within a year of the Act's enactment. The Secretary must offer a contract to the irrigation district to operate and manage the project, including all rights and powers. The contract must identify trust responsibilities to the Tribe and ensure the United States can fulfill those responsibilities. The irrigation district must maintain instream flows to preserve fisheries and continue existing repayment obligations unaffected by the Act, with an option for accelerated payment. The Act requires the irrigation district to maintain instream flows for fisheries and uphold repayment obligations. It also includes provisions to amend repayment contracts, separate revenues for operation costs, and revoke the contract if the district damages tribal trust assets.

The Secretary must negotiate with the irrigation district promptly to enter into a contract within a year. The contract will transfer ownership of equipment and supplies paid for with project funds to the irrigation district. An inventory list of all supplies and equipment must be provided to the district.
