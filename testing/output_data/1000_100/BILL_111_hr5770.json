    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Arctic Marine Shipping Assessment Implementation Act of 2010\". The Congress acknowledges the increasing accessibility of the Arctic Ocean to shipping due to various factors. It is important for the United States to collaborate with Alaska and Arctic neighbors to ensure safe and environmentally protective shipping in the region. The United States aims to ensure secure shipping in the Arctic Ocean, protect sovereign and security interests, allow access for research vessels, maintain peaceful relations, and establish international cooperation for reliable shipping. For nearly 500 years, mariners and sea-faring nations have sought national and global benefits from sea routes in the Arctic similar to those provided by the Panama and Suez canals. Expanded shipping in the Arctic will present risks to residents, and coordinated shipping regulations are needed to protect United States interests. Proven models for international cooperation in managing regional waterways exist, such as joint administration of the St. Lawrence Seaway with Canada and cooperation between the Coast Guard and its Russian counterpart for fisheries enforcement. The United States has interests in the Arctic that rely on icebreaker platforms of the Coast Guard, which need replacement. Sovereign interests in the Arctic Ocean and Bering Sea regions may grow with a US claim for an extended continental shelf. Building new icebreakers, international cooperation for aids to navigation, shipping regulations, and oil spill prevention are essential. Efforts to protect United States interests in the Arctic Ocean and adjacent seas, including approval from the International Maritime Organization, require long lead times. Initiating these efforts now, following the completion of an Arctic Marine Shipping Assessment by the Arctic Council, is crucial due to the extensive current use of these waters by vessels from various nations. The Arctic Marine Shipping Assessment Implementation is crucial for protecting US interests in the Arctic Ocean and adjacent seas, following approval from the International Maritime Organization. The purpose of this section is to ensure safe and secure maritime shipping in the Arctic, including aids to navigation, vessel escorts, spill response capability, and maritime search and rescue. The Secretary of the department operating the Coast Guard is encouraged to negotiate agreements through the International Maritime Organization with Arctic nations to promote coordinated action for maritime safety and oil spill prevention. The Committee on the Maritime Transportation System coordinates domestic transportation policies in the Arctic for maritime safety, including vessel tracking and search and rescue. The Secretary of the department operating the Coast Guard can enter agreements and contracts to support these efforts, including icebreaking operations. The Secretary of the department operating the Coast Guard promotes safe maritime navigation through icebreaking where needed. Demonstration projects can be conducted to reduce emissions and train mariners for ice navigation and Arctic operations. Authorization of appropriations is provided for these purposes. Authorization of appropriations for seasonal operations in the Arctic and demonstration projects under subsection (f) is provided for the Secretary of the department operating the Coast Guard and the Secretary of Transportation. Additionally, analyses for Arctic polar ice-breaking mission requirements are to be conducted within a specified timeframe by the Commandant. The Commandant of the Coast Guard is required to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of extending the service life of existing icebreakers, constructing new ones, or a combination of both. Additionally, an analysis of the impact on mission capacity and the ability of the United States to carry out icebreaking missions is also mandated. The Commandant of the Coast Guard must submit a report within 90 days after the High Latitude Study is completed, detailing the impact on mission capacity and the ability to maintain a presence in the Arctic if icebreaker fleet recapitalization is not fully funded. The Commandant of the Coast Guard is required to submit reports to Congress within 1 year of the enactment of the Act, containing analyses and recommendations related to section 93(a)(24) of title 14, United States Code. SEC. 4. ASSESSMENT OF NEEDS FOR ADDITIONAL COAST GUARD PRESENCE IN HIGH LATITUDE REGIONS. The Secretary of the department overseeing the Coast Guard must submit a report to specific committees within 270 days of this Act's enactment, evaluating the necessity for increased Coast Guard capabilities in high latitude regions. This assessment should cover all mission areas, such as search and rescue, marine pollution response, fisheries enforcement, and maritime commerce. The report should include evaluations of current Coast Guard assets, including those from the Deepwater program, and projected needs for forward operating bases in high latitude regions. The report must assess the need for Coast Guard capabilities in high latitude regions, including infrastructure, personnel, logistics, communications, and icebreaking fleet performance and conditions. The report must include a detailed estimate of acquisition costs for icebreaking assets in high latitude regions, as well as cost estimates for renovating and modernizing the existing icebreaking fleet. The report must include a detailed estimate of acquisition costs for icebreaking assets in high latitude regions and renovating the existing icebreaking fleet to replace the Coast Guard's current fleet. The term \"Arctic\" in this Act is defined the same way as in the Arctic Research and Policy Act of 1984."
