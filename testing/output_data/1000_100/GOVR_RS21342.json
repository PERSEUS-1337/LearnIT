    "content": "The diversity visa lottery encourages legal immigration from countries other than major sending countries to the US. It allocates immigrant visas based on family ties and employment needs. The program was added to the Immigration and Nationality Act in 1990 to promote new and varied migration. The lottery began in FY1995 and offers 55,000 visas annually to countries with low immigrant admissions in the past five years. The USCIS allocates visas based on regional populations, with a 7% limit per country. Recipients become legal permanent residents. The diversity lottery, established in 1990, offers 55,000 visas annually, with a temporary reduction under NACARA. The ceiling for immigrant visa numbers was set at 50,000 to accommodate unsuccessful asylum seekers from El Salvador, Guatemala, and certain European countries under special NACARA rules. In FY2002, 42,829 individuals were admitted or adjusted as LPRs with diversity visas, representing 4% of all LPRs. The top five countries for diversity visas in FY2002 were Albania, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Poland, and Ukraine. In FY2002, 42,829 individuals were admitted or adjusted as LPRs with diversity visas, representing 4% of all LPRs. The top sending countries for diversity visas during this period were Albania, Nigeria, Russia, and Ukraine. European immigrants comprised a significant portion of diversity visa recipients, contrasting with family-based and employment-based immigrants. African immigrants received a high percentage of diversity visas compared to family-based and employment-based visas. To be eligible for a diversity visa, an alien must meet certain education or work experience requirements and be from a qualified foreign state. Diversity visa winners undergo reviews by Department of State consular officers and DHS inspectors. The State Department conducts reviews of diversity visa winners to ensure eligibility and compliance with exclusion criteria under the INA. The FY2005 lottery was announced on August 19, 2003, with a 60-day electronic application period. Paper forms were not accepted for the first time. The FY2005 diversity visa lottery had ineligible countries including Canada, China, Colombia, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Haiti, India, Jamaica, Mexico, Pakistan, the Philippines, Russia, South Korea, the United Kingdom, and Vietnam. Instructions had to be followed precisely to avoid disqualification, with over 2 million applications disqualified in FY2003 for non-compliance. Multiple applications from the same individual are grounds for disqualification, except for spouses who can submit separate entries. The FY2005 diversity visa lottery allowed spouses and unmarried children under 21 to submit separate entries. Derivative beneficiaries must be listed on the petition and visas are counted against the 50,000 cap. Winners were selected randomly by computer, with notifications expected between May and July 2004. If a winner dies before obtaining LPR status, the visa is revoked and derivative beneficiaries lose eligibility. Winners of the FY2005 diversity visa lottery must act quickly to file necessary documentation to demonstrate admissibility as LPRs before September 30, 2005. In-person interviews are expected to begin in October 2004. Some question the continuation of the lottery, preferring the 55,000 visas be used for backlog reduction in other visa categories. Supporters argue the diversity visa provides opportunities for immigrants from a variety of countries. Critics argue for amending the INA to exclude nationals from terrorism-sponsoring countries from the diversity visa lottery due to background check difficulties and terrorism concerns. Supporters believe the policy should be uniformly applied, pointing out that LPRs from such countries are not restricted in other visa categories. The issue of who should bear the costs of operating the lottery has also been raised, with suggestions for a fee to enter the lottery in addition to the visa application fee. The diversity visa lottery has faced criticism for being vulnerable to fraud and misuse, but the State Department is working to address these concerns. Some argue that a fee should be charged to enter the lottery."
