The Secretary may make grants to States for prevention and control, with a preference for states with a high incidence of West Nile Virus. The amended Section 319 of the Public Health Service Act allows for grants to States for prevention and control of West Nile Virus and related arboviral diseases. Funds can be used for developing mosquito control plans and programs on vector-borne diseases. The amended Section 319 of the Public Health Service Act allows for grants to States for prevention and control of vector-borne diseases. States must provide matching funds of at least 50% for the program costs. Non-Federal contributions for grants under Section 319 of the Public Health Service Act must be at least 50% of program costs, which can be in cash or in-kind. Federal contributions or services subsidized by the Federal Government cannot be included. The grant funds should supplement, not supplant, State and local funds for similar activities. The Secretary may waive requirements for a State if economic conditions justify it. States receiving funds must involve localities in mosquito control plans. At least 85% of grant amounts must improve local public health. The grant funds must ensure that at least 85 percent is spent locally or on local public health for West Nile Virus and related diseases. Technical assistance can be provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to support mosquito control programs and disease containment, with a limitation of 20 percent of funds. The Secretary, in consultation with health and mosquito control organizations, will develop guidelines for sustainable mosquito control programs, limited to functions deemed appropriate by the Director. The Director will determine guidelines for building public health infrastructure, including programs to identify new disease cases, track disease spread, provide laboratory support, increase surveillance for arboviruses, conduct educational campaigns, and outline mosquito control procedures. Evaluation will also be conducted. The Secretary will evaluate the program established for sustainable mosquito abatement and submit a report to Congress within 18 months of the enactment of the West Nile Virus and Arboviral Disease Act. Authorization of appropriations is granted for fiscal years 2003 and 2004 to carry out the program for sustainable mosquito abatement. Additional funding is authorized for control programs in response to the West Nile Virus or related arboviruses that pose a public health emergency. The program for sustainable mosquito abatement is authorized for fiscal years 2003 and 2004, with the possibility of extension based on evaluation. SEC. 249.
