    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 399.16 of the Public Utilities Code is amended to allow various electricity products from eligible renewable energy resources within the WECC transmission network service area to comply with renewables portfolio standard procurement requirements. These products can be differentiated based on their grid operation impacts and must meet project viability principles for a balanced portfolio procurement. Eligible renewable energy resource electricity products must meet specific criteria, including interconnection with a California balancing authority or dynamic electricity transfer agreement. Unbundled renewable energy credits earned by electricity generated by an entity excluded from being an electrical corporation, meeting specific criteria, and used at a wastewater treatment facility owned by a public entity. The generating facility must meet certain criteria and the electricity generated must be used at a public entity-owned wastewater treatment facility. The generating capability of a wastewater treatment facility earning renewable energy credits must be put into service after January 1, 2016. The facility cannot participate in a specific bioenergy program and the electricity generated must be scheduled into a California balancing authority. Retail sellers must meet specific requirements for procurement of eligible renewable energy resources, with increasing percentages for compliance periods. Products must meet content requirements for a balanced portfolio. For contracts executed after June 1, 2010, limits are set on the percentage of eligible renewable energy resource electricity products that must meet specific content requirements. Electric service providers have additional restrictions for crediting these products to compliance periods after January 13, 2011. Any contract or ownership agreement executed before June 1, 2010, counts towards procurement requirements if certain conditions are met, including approval by the commission for electrical corporations. Contract amendments after June 1, 2010, must not increase capacity or change the renewable energy resource. Extensions are allowed for contracts with a 15-year procurement commitment. A retail seller can request a reduction in procurement content requirements from the commission if they cannot comply due to uncontrollable conditions. The commission can lower the requirement but not below 65 percent after December 31, 2016. A public entity selling renewable energy credits cannot make marketing claims about the renewable attributes of the electricity that earned the credit. All renewable attributes are transferred to the purchaser of the credit. The electricity generated by a public entity and sold as renewable energy credits must be included in the total retail sales of the buyer for renewables portfolio standard procurement obligations."
