    "content": "The Urban Jobs Act of 2011 may be cited as the ``Urban Jobs Act of 2011''. Congress finds that one-third of minority youth are unemployed, the labor force participation rate is lower for individuals without a high school diploma, African-American and Hispanic students have a lower graduation rate, high school dropouts cost the nation billions in lost wages, and only 52 percent of students in large cities graduate from high school. The national high school graduation rate is 70 percent, falling short of the 60 percent average for urban districts. High school dropouts earn significantly less over a lifetime and are more likely to end up in prison.
