    "content": "Increased average fuel economy standards. Increased average fuel economy standards are being amended to ensure that non-passenger automobiles meet a minimum fuel economy standard of 27.5 miles per gallon for model year 2022 and beyond. The Secretary shall prescribe average fuel economy standards for passenger automobiles manufactured by a manufacturer for model year 2022 and subsequent years, with a minimum standard of 35 miles per gallon. The alternative minimum standard for passenger automobiles in model year 2022 and beyond shall be the greater of 27.5 miles per gallon or 92 percent of the average fuel economy projected by the Secretary for combined domestic and foreign fleets. The Secretary will project the average fuel economy for combined domestic and foreign fleets of vehicles manufactured for sale in the United States, to be published in the Federal Register. The alternative minimum standard applies to domestically manufactured passenger automobiles if the standard based on vehicle attributes would allow compliance with a less stringent standard. The Secretary will provide a transition period for manufacturers to comply with attribute-based standards for passenger automobiles or a single corporate average fuel economy level. The amendments will take effect upon the enactment of the Act, with existing standards transitioning accordingly. The Act mandates that existing standards for passenger automobiles will remain in effect until new standards are established. Technical and conforming amendments are made to Chapter 329 of title 49, United States Code.

The Secretary of Transportation will establish a credit transferring program for manufacturers to transfer fuel economy credits within their fleet to non-compliant categories. Transferred credits can be used in the same model years as when they were earned, with a maximum increase in compliance category. The credit transferring program allows manufacturers to transfer fuel economy credits within their fleet to non-compliant categories, with a maximum increase of 1.0 mile per gallon in any single model year. Credits can only be transferred if earned in model year 2010 or later, and transfers are limited for certain categories of automobiles. The term 'compliance category of automobiles' refers to the 3 categories for which compliance is separately calculated: passenger automobiles manufactured domestically, passenger automobiles not manufactured domestically, and non-passenger automobiles. SEC. 3. FUEL CONSERVATION EDUCATION PROGRAM. The Secretary of Transportation will partner with industry groups to create a public education campaign on fuel conservation for drivers. The campaign will be accessible through various channels and the Secretary will cover up to 50% of the costs, with the option to accept private funds. Authorization of Appropriations: Sums may be appropriated to the Secretary of Transportation as necessary for this section."
