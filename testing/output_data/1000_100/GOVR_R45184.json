Factors contributing to this decline include reduced teen sexual activity and increased use of contraceptives. Congress remains interested in the issue due to its high social and economic costs. Disparities persist in teen birth rates among racial and ethnic subgroups and across states. This report discusses Congress's approach to preventing teen pregnancy. Teen birth rate refers to live births per 1,000 teen girls aged 15-19, while teen pregnancy rate includes pregnancies per 1,000 teen girls aged 15-19, including live births, abortions, and fetal losses. Birth data cover all U.S. births, while pregnancy data are estimates based on various reporting systems and surveys. The CDC and Guttmacher Institute publish teen pregnancy rates annually, with 4.7% of the 3.8 million births in the US in 2018 being to teenagers aged 15-19. The US teen birth rate peaked in 1957 at 96.3 and has generally declined since 1991, with a few exceptions in 2006 and 2007. The teen birth rate in the US declined significantly from 1991 to 2018, dropping by 72%. In 2018, the rate reached a historic low of 17.4 births per 1,000 teens aged 15 to 19. The decline was most notable in recent years, with a 58% decrease from 2007 to 2018. Additionally, repeat teen births have also decreased over time. The teen birth rate in the US has significantly declined, reaching a historic low of 17.4 births per 1,000 teens aged 15 to 19 in 2018. Repeat teen births have also decreased, with the number of subsequent teen births declining by nearly 54% from 2004 to 2015. Hispanic youth had the highest prevalence of repeat teen births, followed by non-Hispanic black and white youth. Teen mothers are now less likely to be married, with the birth rate for unmarried teens aged 15 to 19 dropping from 31.0 per 1,000 in 2010 to 16.0 per 1,000 in 2018. Despite the overall decline, certain racial and ethnic groups still have relatively high teen birth rates. The teen birth rate varied by race and ethnicity, with Hispanic, non-Hispanic black, and non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native teens having more than double the rate of non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander teens. The rates declined for all racial and ethnic groups from 1991 to 2018, with larger decreases for certain groups. From 2007 to 2018, birth rates fell by 55% for non-Hispanic white teens, 40% for non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native teens, and 58% for non-Hispanic black teens. In 2018, teen birth rates varied by state and territory, with Massachusetts having the lowest rate (7.2) and Arkansas the highest (30.4). Eighteen states had rates below 15 per 1,000 teens aged 15 to 19, including California, New York, and Virginia. Teen birth rates varied by state and territory in 2018. The highest rates were in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas, while the lowest rates were in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Utah, and Vermont. From 2007 to 2018, teen birth rates decreased by 19% to 67% in each state or territory. Despite the decline, teen birth rates in rural areas remain higher than in urban areas. The U.S. teen birth rate is higher than that of most other industrialized countries, such as the United Kingdom. Research suggests that economic conditions and income inequality may contribute to the high teen birth rate in the United States compared to other industrial countries. The use of contraceptives among teens is lower in the U.S. than in other developed countries. Factors such as improved contraceptive use, including the use of condoms and multiple methods, have contributed to a decline in teen pregnancy rates from the 1990s to 2007. The risk of teen pregnancy has decreased due to increased contraceptive use among sexually active teens, especially those aged 15 to 17. Factors like expanded educational opportunities for women and improvements in contraceptive technology have influenced behavioral changes. Teen birth rates have been on a long-term downward trend, possibly due to a combination of these factors. The long-term downward trend in teen birth rates is attributed to factors like increased contraceptive use and improved educational opportunities for women. Some suggest that the recession and the influence of social media also played a role in the decline. Teen birth rates have declined despite the popularity of a TV show promoting risky behavior. Teen pregnancy prevention programs may have contributed to the decrease, but their impact is not fully understood. Teen parents often face educational and financial challenges, with many living in poverty and relying on public assistance. Teen parents face educational and financial challenges, often living in poverty and relying on public assistance. Lower education levels decrease economic self-sufficiency for teen parents, who are more likely to come from disadvantaged backgrounds. Teen sexual activity increases the risk of STIs, with adolescents aged 15 to 19 having high rates of infection. Teen parents face challenges such as poverty and reliance on public assistance. They have high rates of STIs and their children may have poorer outcomes. Teen childbearing also has societal impacts, with cost savings from avoiding unintended pregnancies estimated through simulation analysis. The decrease in teen fertility rates from 1991 to 2015 resulted in averted pregnancies among teenagers, leading to estimated total savings of $4.4 billion. This analysis considered cost savings to Medicaid related to labor and delivery, postpartum care, and infant care, as well as benefits from programs like TANF, SNAP, and WIC. Further research on the impacts of decreased teenage pregnancy could provide valuable insights for teen parents, their children, and society."
