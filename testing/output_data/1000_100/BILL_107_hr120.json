The \"Social Security and Medicare Lockbox Act of 2001\" prohibits the use of surpluses for any other purpose until solvency legislation is enacted. The \"Social Security and Medicare Lockbox Act of 2001\" prohibits the use of baseline budget surpluses until solvency legislation is enacted. Baseline budget surpluses are defined as the sum of on- and off-budget surpluses in the most recent baseline budget projections by the Congressional Budget Office. The baseline budget projection includes current year levels of outlays, receipts, and surplus/deficit for both on-budget and off-budget items. The use of baseline budget surpluses is restricted until solvency legislation is passed. The use of baseline budget surpluses is limited based on legislation affecting revenues, direct spending, and appropriations bills. The term 'social security solvency certification' refers to a certification by the Board of Trustees of the Social Security Trust Funds that the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund are in actuarial balance for a 75-year period. The curr_chunk discusses the Medicare solvency certification and the super majority requirement amendments to the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. It defines Medicare solvency certification as a certification by the Board of Trustees of the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund. The super majority requirement amendments include inserting \"312(g),\" after \"310(d)(2),\". The Act will take effect upon enactment and apply to fiscal year 2001 and beyond."
