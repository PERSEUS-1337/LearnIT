    "content": "The consent of Congress is given to an interstate forest fire protection compact known as \"THE GREAT PLAINS WILDLAND FIRE PROTECTION AGREEMENT\" between State, Provincial, and Territorial wildland fire protection agencies. The Great Plains Wildland Fire Protection Agreement aims to prevent and control forest fires in the region by maintaining adequate firefighting services and providing reciprocal aid among member states like South Dakota, North Dakota, Wyoming, and Colorado. The compact becomes effective once ratified by two or more member states. The Great Plains Wildland Fire Protection Agreement allows state foresters to act as compact administrators, coordinating forest fire prevention and control efforts among member states. Each state can develop its forest fire plan under this compact. ARTICLE IV states that if a state forest fire control agency requests aid from another member state, the requested state may provide assistance while ensuring protection at home. ARTICLE V is not provided in the condensed text. \"If member states provide outside aid as requested under this compact, employees will have similar powers, duties, and immunities as those in the receiving state. There is no liability for acts or omissions during the aid, except as specified in the compact.\" Under this compact, any member state providing aid will be reimbursed for expenses incurred, including equipment operation, materials, transportation, and employee costs. The assisting state may also choose to assume these costs or provide services without charge. Each member state must ensure workers' compensation benefits in line with state requirements. The compact ensures that minimum legal requirements are met for all employees and contract firefighters sent to a requesting state. The term \"employee\" includes volunteers and auxiliaries within the forest fire fighting forces. Administrators can establish procedures for claims and reimbursement in accordance with member state laws. \"ARTICLE VI outlines procedures for claims and reimbursement in accordance with member state laws.\" The compact does not allow any member state to reduce their forest fighting forces, equipment, services, or facilities. Each state must maintain adequate resources for forest fire protection as if the compact were not in place. States are still empowered to enact laws for fire prevention and control. The compact ensures that states maintain adequate resources for forest fire protection and does not affect existing relationships with the US Forest Service. \"Representatives of the United States Forest Service may attend meetings of the compact administrators. The provisions of Articles IV and V of this compact regarding reciprocal aid in combating forest fires apply between states party to this compact and other states that have given assent to mutual aid provisions.\" The compact remains in force until a state takes action to withdraw, with a six-month notice period for withdrawal to be effective."
