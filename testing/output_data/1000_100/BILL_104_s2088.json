The \"Child Care Infrastructure Act of 1996\" introduces a credit for employer-provided child care expenses under section 38 of the Internal Revenue Code. The credit covers costs for operating a qualified child care facility, including employee training, scholarship programs, increased compensation, and dependent care services. A qualified child care facility is defined as a facility that provides dependent care assistance and meets all applicable laws and regulations. The \"Child Care Infrastructure Act of 1996\" introduces a credit for employer-provided child care expenses under section 38 of the Internal Revenue Code. A qualified child care facility must be open to employees, not the principal business of the taxpayer, and accessible to employees without restrictions. The tax code prohibits discrimination in favor of highly compensated employees regarding the use of employer-provided child care facilities. If there is a recapture event for a qualified child care facility, the taxpayer's tax will increase by a percentage of the decrease in credits allowed for prior years. The taxpayer's expenditures for the facility were zero, and the applicable recapture percentage is determined from a table. The applicable recapture percentage is determined from a table based on the number of years since the recapture event occurred. The recapture event for a qualified child care facility includes the cessation of operation or change in ownership. The recapture percentage is determined based on the number of years since the event. The recapture liability can be assumed by the new owner of a facility, making them responsible for any tax liabilities. The tax for the year will only be increased for credits related to this section. The increase in tax under this subsection will not affect any credits used to reduce tax liability, and adjustments will be made for carryforwards and carrybacks. The increase in tax will not be considered for determining the amount of any credit under subpart A, B, or D. Additionally, the increase in tax will not apply if a qualified child care facility ceases operation due to a casualty loss that is restored. The tax increase under this section will not impact credits used to reduce tax liability, and adjustments will be made for carryforwards and carrybacks. The tax increase will not be considered when calculating credits under subpart A, B, or D. Furthermore, the tax increase will not apply if a qualified child care facility stops operating due to a casualty loss that is restored. Special rules apply for aggregation, pass-thru in estates and trusts, and allocation in partnerships. No double benefit is allowed through reduction in basis. The basis of property is reduced by the amount of any credit determined under this section. If there is a recapture amount for property with reduced basis, the basis is increased by that recapture amount. The term `recapture amount' refers to any increase in tax determined under subsection (d). No other deductions or credits are allowed with respect to the credit determined under this section. This section does not apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1999. Conforming amendments are made to Section 38(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The employer-provided child care credit under section 45D is added to the tax code. The employer-provided child care credit under section 45D is effective for taxable years starting after December 31, 1996."
