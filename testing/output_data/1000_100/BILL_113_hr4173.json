The Act establishes the Brownfield Redevelopment and Economic Development Innovative Financing program, allowing the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to guarantee loans for brownfield redevelopment projects. Eligibility requirements include submitting an application to the Secretary. The Act establishes the Brownfield Redevelopment and Economic Development Innovative Financing program. To be eligible for a guaranteed loan under the Program, a master plan meeting specific requirements must be submitted, along with a certification for environmental remediation and any other information requested by the Secretary. The loan must be used for redevelopment costs, including site acquisition. The Brownfield Redevelopment and Economic Development Innovative Financing program allows for the acquisition, remediation, relocation, and site preparation of brownfield sites. However, entities responsible for contaminating a site are not eligible for loan guarantees under the Program. The BRAC redevelopment project can only have one guaranteed loan at a time, with a principal amount between $25,000,000 and $150,000,000. The loan's interest rate is negotiated between the lender and borrower, and the duration is determined by the Secretary. The loan duration ranges from 20 to 30 years, with no repayment required for the first 10 years. Repayment must start within 15 years. The master plan must detail the brownfield redevelopment project and its activities. The brownfield redevelopment project must include a schedule of activities, a budget, and demonstrate major redevelopment impact on the community, including non-Federal funds commitment, job creation, environmental remediation, economic impact, and affordable housing creation. The brownfield redevelopment project must demonstrate the creation of affordable housing, reduction of vehicle congestion and emissions, integration of green technology, improvement in air quality, and incorporation of complete streets planning and transit-oriented development. Additionally, evidence of non-Federal investment commitments through zoning or other documentation, and an approved remediation action plan from the Environmental Protection Agency or its designee, are required. The Secretary will establish selection criteria for local governments, redevelopment agencies, and BRAC projects to receive loan guarantees under the Program. Projects with existing Federal assistance will be given favorable consideration. The full faith and credit of the United States is pledged to guarantee payments. The Secretary will process loan guarantee requests under this section similarly to the process for guarantees under the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974. The Federal Government will not be liable for environmental remediation as a result of loan guarantees made under this section. To be eligible for a loan guarantee under section 108 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, an applicant must demonstrate a viable repayment schedule and provide sufficient collateral. The Secretary may not require a pledge of grants as collateral and can allow other forms of collateral at the applicant's discretion. Congressional oversight is required before final approval of any loan guarantee. The Secretary must notify relevant Congressional committees of loan guarantee approvals. Definitions for \"BRAC redevelopment project\" and \"brownfield\" are provided. The Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 defines terms like \"local redevelopment agency,\" \"remediation action plan,\" \"Program,\" and \"Secretary.\" These definitions are crucial for understanding the Brownfield Redevelopment and Economic Development Innovative Financing program. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development will issue regulations within 6 months to carry out the Program. $100,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2015 for loan guarantees, available through fiscal year 2019."
