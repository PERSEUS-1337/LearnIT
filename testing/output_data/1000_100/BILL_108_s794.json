    "content": "The Act titled \"Automobile Fuel Efficiency Improvements Act of 2003\" includes phased increases in fuel economy standards. The \"Automobile Fuel Efficiency Improvements Act of 2003\" mandates phased increases in fuel economy standards for passenger automobiles, with standards ranging from 25 to 40 miles per gallon based on model years. The \"Automobile Fuel Efficiency Improvements Act of 2003\" mandates phased increases in fuel economy standards for passenger automobiles, with standards ranging from 25 to 40 miles per gallon based on model years. The section is amended to increase the standard otherwise applicable and realign the text of paragraph (1) as paragraph (2) for non-passenger automobiles. The amendment mandates phased increases in fuel economy standards for automobiles, with standards ranging from 17 to 27.5 miles per gallon based on model years. Additionally, a new paragraph is added requiring the Secretary to increase the average fuel economy at least 18 months before each model year after 2015. The Secretary must submit a report to Congress if fuel economy standards are not increased within 24 months after the latest increase, providing an explanation for the delay. The report is due within 90 days after the 24-month period expires. SEC. 3. INCREASED INCLUSIVENESS OF DEFINITIONS OF AUTOMOBILE AND PASSENGER AUTOMOBILE. SEC. 3. INCREASED INCLUSIVENESS OF DEFINITIONS OF AUTOMOBILE AND PASSENGER AUTOMOBILE. (a) Automobile.--Paragraph (3) of section 32901(a) of title 49, United States Code, is amended to increase weight limits. (b) Passenger Automobile.--Paragraph (16) of the same section is amended to define \"passenger automobile\". The definition of a \"passenger automobile\" is amended to exclude vehicles with a primary load carrying device, seating capacity of more than 12 persons, seating capacity of more than 9 persons behind the driver's seat, or equipped with a cargo area of at least 6 feet in interior. The definition of a \"passenger automobile\" is amended to exclude vehicles with a primary load carrying device, seating capacity of more than 12 persons, or equipped with a cargo area of at least 6 feet in interior length that does not extend beyond the frame of the vehicle and is an open area or is designed for use as an open area but is enclosed by a cap and is not readily accessible directly from the passenger compartment. The amendments apply to automobiles manufactured for model years after the enactment of this Act. SEC. 4. CIVIL PENALTIES. Increased penalty for violations of fuel economy standards under section 32912 of title 49, United States Code. The penalty amount is increased to $10 and will be adjusted annually based on the price index. The penalty for violations of fuel economy standards is increased to $10 and will be adjusted annually based on the Consumer Price Index. Amendments to the section include rounding the penalty amount to the nearest $0.10 and reorganizing subparagraphs. These changes apply to automobiles manufactured for model years after the enactment of this Act. SEC. 5. ACCURATE FUEL ECONOMY TESTING. Biennial Report on Testing Quality: The Secretary of Transportation must submit a report to Congress every odd-numbered year on the accuracy of automobile fuel economy testing and any changes in testing methodology. The Secretary of Transportation must submit a biennial report to Congress on changes in testing methodology for automobile fuel economy and their expected effects on accuracy. The Secretary and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency must consult on the preparation of this report. The first biennial report on testing quality under section 32920 of title 49, United States Code, must be submitted to Congress in 2005. The Secretary of Transportation is required to conduct a study to determine the most accurate automobile fuel economy testing process for highway, urban, and combined use at the John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center. The Secretary will compare fuel economy ratings for different automobile uses and submit a report to Congress within two years of the Act's enactment. The determination and comparisons made under subparagraph (A) and an estimate of the average adjustment to automobile fuel economy ratings needed to conform closely to the most accurate testing process. The Secretary of Transportation must prescribe a revised testing procedure for measuring automobile fuel economy within 180 days of a required report to Congress. This procedure will apply to determine the average fuel economy of automobiles manufactured after 2006. The Secretary of Transportation will amend fuel economy standards for automobiles manufactured after 2006 based on a revised testing procedure that provides more accurate measures of actual fuel economy. The Secretary will ensure that the revised fuel economy standards are as stringent as the original standards set in section 32902 of title 49, United States Code. SEC. 6. STANDARDS FOR EXECUTIVE AGENCY AUTOMOBILES. Section 32917 of title 49, United States Code, is amended to establish fleet average fuel economy standards for non-passenger and passenger automobiles. The amendment to Section 32917 of title 49, United States Code, establishes fleet average fuel economy standards for non-passenger and passenger automobiles, with specific adjustments to definitions and requirements. The President must regulate that at least 20% of passenger automobiles leased or bought by executive agencies have a fuel economy rating 5 miles per gallon higher than the average standard. Additionally, starting in fiscal year 2009, at least 10,000 vehicles in the executive agencies' fleet must meet certain fuel efficiency criteria. In a fiscal year, vehicles in the executive agencies' fleet must have a fuel economy at least 5 miles per gallon higher than the average standard for that model year."
