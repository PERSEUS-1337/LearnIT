    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Protecting Patient Access to Emergency Medications Act of 2016\". The Congress recognizes the importance of controlled substances for emergency medical services to save lives and improve health outcomes. Mobile emergency medical services require time-sensitive care for critical injuries and illnesses in the field. There have been few DEA investigations related to diversion in this sector. Regulatory oversight is crucial to prevent diversion of controlled substances in emergency medical services. Oversight should be tailored to unique care delivery models and promote uniformity in rules and enforcement to establish clear guidelines. Emergency medical services agencies include governmental, nongovernmental, private, and volunteer agencies. SEC. 312 of the Controlled Substances Act adds provisions for emergency medical services. SEC. 312 of the Controlled Substances Act defines key terms related to emergency medical services, including emergency medical services, emergency medical services agency, and emergency medical services practitioner. The Controlled Substances Act defines terms related to emergency medical services, including medical director, medical oversight, standing order, and verbal order. The Controlled Substances Act defines terms related to emergency medical services, including verbal order, online medical direction, and registrant emergency medical services agency. These terms clarify the roles and responsibilities within emergency medical services. The Attorney General can register emergency medical services agencies to allow practitioners to dispense controlled substances to users in need of emergency medical services. This registration is done at the agency level, requiring only one registration per state, instead of individual practitioners or medical directors registering separately. Guidance is provided to registrants for compliance. The Attorney General tailors guidance for registrant emergency medical services agencies to recognize existing medical care delivery and service models. Registrant agencies must have one or more medical directors for oversight, who must be physicians. The medical director of an emergency medical services agency must be a licensed physician in the state where they practice. Their responsibilities may include making decisions on patient transportation, approving medical protocols, and overseeing patient care provided by agency practitioners. The medical director of an emergency medical services agency is responsible for evaluating, treating, and intervening with patients, providing online medical direction, establishing drug formularies, overseeing medical education and training programs, and ensuring quality improvement within the agency. Emergency medical services practitioners of a registrant emergency medical services agency can administer controlled substances in schedule II, III, IV, or V under standing orders or online medical direction issued by medical directors or licensed physicians. Emergency medical services practitioners can receive verbal orders from the medical director in specific patient situations or during mass casualty incidents. The director allows emergency medical services practitioners to administer controlled substances without needing a written prescription for known individuals. The agency must keep standing orders on file for documentation purposes. The registrant emergency medical services agency must have a policy for documenting verbal orders and controlled substance administration in patient care charts, which should be made available to the Attorney General upon request. Controlled substances can be received by the agency without a written prescription for known individuals. The registrant emergency medical services agency can receive, move, deliver, and store controlled substances at designated locations within the agency. Movement or delivery of controlled substances within the agency does not classify the agency as a distributor under the Act. The registrant emergency medical services agency can store controlled substances at designated locations within the agency, and may not store them at any other location. This section does not affect requirements under titles XVIII or XIX of the Social Security Act, nor limit the Attorney General's authority to enforce controlled substance diversion."
