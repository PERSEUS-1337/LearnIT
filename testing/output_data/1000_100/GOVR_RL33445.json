    "content": "On March 8, 2006, U.S. Trade Representative Rob Portman announced the intent to negotiate a free trade agreement with Malaysia. Eight rounds of talks have been held, with a proposed ninth round postponed. Efforts to complete the negotiations before the end of the Bush Administration were unsuccessful due to issues like Malaysia's government procurement policies. The negotiations for a free trade agreement between the U.S. and Malaysia have faced challenges, including issues with Malaysia's government procurement policies, market access for U.S. companies in services sectors, intellectual property rights protection, and access for U.S. exports. Despite efforts to resolve trading issues, controversies persisted in Malaysia in 2008, with some topics like rice imports remaining unresolved. The financial crisis in the U.S. also impacted the negotiations. In 2008, concerns arose in Malaysia about opening up financial markets to U.S. companies during FTA negotiations. Various interest groups, including SMEs, called for termination of the FTA, citing harm to Malaysian businesses. Opposition party member Tony Pua suggested a \"white paper\" be presented to parliament to ensure negotiation transparency. Israel's military operation in Gaza further complicated the future of the proposed FTA. Israel's military operation in Gaza led to calls in Malaysia for a boycott of U.S. products and suspension of FTA talks due to U.S. support for Israel. Malaysia's Minister of International Trade and Industry announced a temporary halt to FTA negotiations with the U.S. until further instructions from the Cabinet, citing U.S. support for \"Israel's cruelty to Palestinian people.\" The Obama Administration's intentions regarding the FTA negotiations with Malaysia were unclear. Minister Muhyiddin informed that negotiations for the U.S.-Malaysia FTA would resume after Obama's inauguration. President Obama emphasized workers' rights and environmental issues in trade talks. Ron Kirk was nominated as U.S. Trade Representative to ensure agreements protect workers' rights and the environment. Initially, three rounds of talks were planned for 2008, but only two were held as scheduled. The third round of U.S.-Malaysia FTA talks was postponed at the request of the United States in 2007. There was a perception in Malaysia that the Bush Administration did not prioritize relations with Malaysia or FTA negotiations. Ambassador Keith reassured the press of the U.S. commitment to Malaysia despite concerns raised about the low-level delegation sent to Malaysia's National Day celebrations. On December 30, 2007, U.S. Assistant Trade Representative Barbara Weisel confirmed the U.S.'s goal to conclude the U.S.-Malaysia Free Trade Agreement by summer. The Bush Administration planned to seek congressional approval once negotiations were finished. Malaysia and the United States began their seventh round of negotiations in Kuala Lumpur on January 14, 2008, aiming for progress without a set deadline. Ambassador Keith hoped for completion by the middle of the year. Ambassador Keith hoped for the completion of negotiations by mid-2008. The seventh round of talks discussed key issues like investment, trade, intellectual property rights, and legal matters. Both the US and Malaysia expressed optimism about reaching a free trade agreement by summer. Progress made during the talks was seen as encouraging by officials. The FTA negotiations between the US and Malaysia showed progress, with optimism for a conclusion by summer. However, later reports indicated less optimism, with no set deadline for the talks. Ambassador Keith mentioned a potential shift in focus to other FTA agreements if the deal with Malaysia was not finalized by July. The lack of a decision on the next round of talks added to concerns about the status of the negotiations. The United States and Malaysia discussed the next steps in their FTA negotiations, with Minister Rafidah suggesting that further meetings may not be necessary. The eighth round of talks took place in Washington, DC, focusing on various trade-related topics. Political events in both countries impacted the negotiations. Political events in both nations, including the upcoming U.S. presidential elections and Malaysia's general elections, influenced the FTA negotiations. The uncertain status of proposed U.S. FTAs with Colombia and South Korea also played a role. The key issue for the July 2008 talks was foreign access to Malaysian government procurement contracts. Other topics under discussion included competition policy, environment, labor, and financial services. During the eighth round of negotiations for the Malaysia-U.S. FTA, progress was made in exploring business collaboration and capacity-building in the services sector. Malaysia's exclusion of rice from the FTA talks was highlighted, with Minister Muhyiddin emphasizing no compromise in sensitive areas like agriculture. The U.S. hoped Malaysia's government procurement reforms would advance FTA negotiations. In October 2008, Minister Muhyiddin announced Malaysia's willingness to discuss government procurement in FTA negotiations with the U.S. The U.S. took a pragmatic approach due to issues with other FTAs. Plans for the ninth round of negotiations were postponed after the U.S. presidential elections. In November 2008, Malaysia's FTA negotiations with the U.S. were postponed until the new Obama Administration took office. The U.S. expressed interest in concluding the FTA as soon as possible under the new administration. Malaysia, a predominantly Muslim nation, has a history of supporting the Palestinian struggle against Israeli oppression. Malaysia strongly condemns Israel's military actions in Gaza and calls for a boycott of U.S. goods and services. Popular opposition in Malaysia grows, with specific boycott targets including Coca Cola, KFC, McDonalds, and Starbucks. Former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and other political figures support the boycott. On January 10, 2009, the Malaysian Bar Council urged a \"review\" of the FTA negotiations with the United States to protest what was seen as U.S. support for \"Israeli atrocities against Palestinians.\" Minister Muhyiddin suspended the FTA negotiations in response to events in Gaza, with Prime Minister Badawi requesting a formal briefing on the decision. Minister Muhyiddin later indicated that the FTA negotiations had been postponed at the request of the United States. Muhyiddin postponed FTA negotiations at the request of the United States until after the presidential inauguration. Key unresolved topics include intellectual property rights protection, market access for U.S. automobiles and agricultural goods in Malaysia, trade in services, and government procurement policies. Malaysian IPR regulations and enforcement are of interest to U.S. exporters, particularly software and pharmaceutical companies. The Business Software Alliance estimated 59% software piracy in Malaysia in 2007, causing $311 million in losses. Malaysia is on the Special 301 Watch List since 2001 to monitor IPR improvements. USTR noted Malaysia's commitment to IPR enforcement but urged further improvements, including the creation of a specialized IPR court. Malaysia is concerned about U.S. preference for \"TRIPs plus\" provisions in the U.S.-Malaysia FTA negotiations. The United States prefers \"TRIPs plus\" provisions in the U.S.-Malaysia FTA, aiming for tighter restrictions on compulsory licensing and data exclusivity. Malaysia is hesitant due to concerns about undermining its ability to use compulsory licensing for necessary drugs. Opposition in Malaysia, particularly regarding HIV/AIDS treatment, fears that an FTA could lead to costly patented drugs and discourage new drug introductions. Malaysia has utilized TRIPs' compulsory licensing provisions to provide affordable anti-retroviral drugs for HIV/AIDS patients. Malaysia's automobile industry, including manufacturers like Proton and Perodua, has been promoted by the government for years. The industry is successful internationally, with vehicles marketed in over 40 countries. Malaysia protects its automobile manufacturing industry with high tariffs and trade barriers, distinguishing between national and non-national cars. The Malaysian government promotes the automobile industry, favoring national car manufacturers with rebates and import permits. However, to comply with WTO and ASEAN agreements, some protections have been dismantled. Tariffs of 30% are imposed on assembled vehicles from outside ASEAN, with excise taxes ranging from 80-200% on automobiles. During negotiations, Malaysia is likely to raise the issue of U.S. measures protecting its domestic automobile industry. The U.S. currently maintains a special 25% tariff on imports of pickup trucks. The U.S. Automotive Trade Policy Council supports the proposed FTA as an opportunity to break into a market historically protected domestic producers. Malaysia has stated that rice is considered a \"strategic crop\" and would not be included in the FTA, and tariffs on other agricultural goods would not be lowered to protect its farmers, planters, and fishermen. Malaysia is steadfast in designating rice as a strategic crop and will not include it in any FTA with the United States to protect its farmers, planters, and fishermen. The US is pressuring Malaysia to remove restrictions on agricultural trade, including SPS measures. Financial services, particularly foreign ownership limits in banks, are also a contentious issue in the negotiations. Malaysia maintains foreign ownership limits on insurance companies and banks, with a 51% cap for companies established before 1998 and a 30% limit for new entrants. The country has made some concessions in financial services, such as allowing foreign banks more flexibility in credit and branch openings. The recent financial crisis in the United States has raised concerns in Malaysia about the risks of increased foreign participation in its financial sector. Foreign ownership limits exist in various industries, such as telecommunications and professional services, benefiting government-controlled firms like Telekom Malaysia. Foreign companies can acquire up to a 30% equity stake in fixed line operations and value-added telecommunications services. Licensed professionals, including lawyers and architects, face restrictions on practicing Malaysian law and operating in the country. Malaysia imposes restrictions on foreign professionals and companies in various industries. Foreign architects and engineers may only be licensed for specific projects, while foreign accounting firms must work through Malaysian affiliates. The country uses a positive list approach for service sectors, and foreign companies often need a local partner for bids to be considered. Malaysia is not part of the WTO Government Procurement Agreement and aims to increase bumiputera participation in the economy. The procurement awarding process is seen as non-transparent. In July 2006, Malaysian government procurement restrictions for bumiputera businesses became a major issue in negotiations. Malaysian negotiators lacked authorization to open the procurement market, while Malaysian companies sought access to the larger U.S. government procurement market. The U.S. offered limited access to bid on $250 billion in contracts to address the issue. The Malaysia government procurement market is valued at approximately $20 billion. Government procurement was not a major topic in negotiations in 2008, as the Malaysian government was reviewing its position. The proposed U.S.-Malaysia FTA is of interest to Congress due to the need for approval, potential trade liberalization, controversial provisions, and impact on trade flows affecting U.S. businesses and farmers. The U.S.-Malaysia Free Trade Agreement (FTA) is of interest to Congress and various industries, with support from some U.S. lawmakers and business groups. However, objections have been raised by Malaysian and U.S. labor unions, farmers, fishermen, and academics. Malaysia's role in trade, countering radical Islamic organizations, and its democratic secular Muslim state status are key factors in the agreement. The U.S.-Malaysia Free Trade Agreement (FTA) is part of the Bush Administration's strategy to promote free trade and economic growth. The proposed FTA aligns with APEC's goal of free and open trade in the Pacific. Some view FTAs as an alternative to the stalled Doha Round of WTO talks. The USTR has outlined four major goals for the U.S.-Malaysia FTA. The USTR outlined four major goals for a U.S.-Malaysia FTA, including creating new opportunities for U.S. manufacturers, strengthening economic partnerships, and advancing strategic goals. Other benefits mentioned were cementing the economic relationship, increasing exports, and enhancing job creation. The Ministry of International Trade in Malaysia is leading the negotiations with objectives to seek better market access for goods and services. The Ministry of International Trade in Malaysia aims to enhance bilateral trade and investment flows, improve market access for Malaysian goods and services, boost competitiveness of producers, and build capacity through technical cooperation in the proposed U.S.-Malaysia FTA. Malaysian industries support the FTA for increased access to the U.S. market. Malaysia hopes to benefit from greater access to the U.S. market through the proposed U.S.-Malaysia FTA. This agreement is expected to increase inward foreign direct investment and improve U.S. access to Southeast Asian economies. Malaysia already has FTAs with several countries and is in negotiations for more, including with Chile. The U.S. and Malaysia initiated negotiations for a bilateral FTA in June, aiming to strengthen relations and advance strategic interests in Asia. Malaysia's role as a moderate, democratic Muslim nation is significant in U.S. foreign policy. Prime Minister Abdullah emphasized the importance of guarding against extremism and promoting moderate Islam. The proposed FTA is seen as a way to reinforce cooperation and enhance ties between the two countries. The proposed U.S.-Malaysia FTA aims to strengthen relations and advance strategic interests in Asia. Malaysia plays a key role in protecting maritime shipping lanes. Opposition to the FTA has emerged from various groups in both nations, including labor unions and environmental organizations. Labor organizations are pushing for meaningful protections for workers' rights and environmental standards in bilateral free trade agreements. They want agreements to include enforceable protections for core workers' rights, bring labor laws up to International Labor Organization standards, and have a dispute settlement mechanism to prevent partner countries from reversing labor gains. Barack Obama showed support for these concerns during his presidential campaign. During his presidential campaign, Barack Obama expressed support for labor unions' concerns about labor provisions in FTAs with Colombia and South Korea. Malaysia's labor conditions have faced international criticism, with only 9.5% of the labor force represented by trade unions. Immigrant workers in Malaysia, mainly from Indonesia, reportedly face abuse and exploitation. There is organized opposition to a U.S.-Malaysia FTA from Malaysians. Organized opposition to a U.S.-Malaysia FTA has been seen in Malaysia, with petitions from farmers and fishermen expressing concerns about the potential harm to their industries. A coalition of opposition parties, workers, and small businesses called for a halt to negotiations until a study on the economic and social impact is conducted. Special interest groups like Public Citizen also oppose FTAs, citing concerns about labor conditions and the negative effects of past agreements like NAFTA. In Malaysia, concerns about the cost of pharmaceutical drugs, especially for HIV/AIDS treatment, are raised due to possible provisions in the FTA that may increase prescription drug prices. U.S. relations with Israel could also complicate negotiations as Malaysia does not have diplomatic ties with Israel and requires export licenses for goods sent there. U.S. support for Israel's military operations has led to calls to suspend FTA negotiations. During recent congressional consideration of proposed FTAs, opposition concerns have been addressed through implementing legislation or commitments from the Administration. For example, in the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA), the Bush Administration promised actions to address labor, sugar, and textile interests' concerns. This included allocating $40 million for labor and environmental enforcement assistance in FY2006 and maintaining this funding level through FY2009. Additionally, the Administration assured that the DR-CAFTA would not impact the sugar program through FY2007. The text discusses the operation of the sugar program through FY2007 and promises made for the textile and apparel industry in the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002. Free trade agreements aim to reduce barriers to trade and investment by eliminating tariffs, import quotas, and non-tariff barriers. They also provide access to services, open markets for investment, protect intellectual property, address government regulations, and include a dispute settlement process. FTAs aim to reduce trade barriers and benefit exporters, investors, and consumers. They can create winners and losers, affecting companies and workers in import-competing industries. The US has negotiated FTAs with various countries, including Malaysia, to promote tariff-free trade. An FTA with Malaysia would open markets restricted by tariffs and non-tariff barriers, benefiting U.S. exports like semiconductors and computer parts. However, competitive products like motor vehicles and polyethylene face high duties in Malaysia. For more details on tariff rates, refer to Appendix C. Malaysia's potential impact of an FTA with the United States depends on various factors, including tariff rates, bilateral trade flows, and existing trade relations. Malaysia has been one of the fastest-growing economies, with a GDP and per capita income larger than most countries with recent FTAs with the U.S. In 2007, Malaysia's per capita income was $6,724. In 2007, Malaysia's per capita income was $6,724, with a purchasing power parity estimated at $13,570 by the World Bank. The United States is Malaysia's largest trading partner and foreign investor. Malaysia was the tenth largest trading partner of the United States in 2007, with U.S. exports surpassing those to Colombia and Peru. U.S. investment in Malaysia totaled $1.8 billion in the first 10 months of 2008, making it the second largest foreign investor after Australia. FTAs can redirect trade towards involved countries and increase overall trade by reducing tariffs and trade barriers. FTAs can boost trade by lowering tariffs and trade barriers, leading to a substitution effect. U.S. exports to Malaysia remained steady at $10 billion from 2000 to 2005, then increased to $12.5 billion in 2006 before dropping to $11.7 billion in 2007. U.S. imports from Malaysia grew until 2006 but declined in 2007. The U.S. trade deficit with Malaysia widened by 63.5% from 2001 to 2006 but narrowed by 10.7% in 2007. According to Malaysia, exports to the United States increased from $20 billion in 2000 to $30 billion in 2006, then dropped to $27.5 billion in 2007. Imports from the United States rose from $13.6 billion in 2000 to $16.4 billion in 2006, decreasing in 2007. Malaysia's trade surplus with the United States was $6.5 billion in 2000 and $11.6 billion in 2006. The U.S. is Malaysia's top export market, followed by Singapore, Japan, and China. Malaysia's exports to the U.S. decreased from 19.7% to 15.6% in the last three years, while China's share increased from 6.6% to 8.8%. Malaysia's top import sources are Japan, China, and Singapore, with the United States falling to fourth place since 2005. Malaysia has FTAs with Japan and Singapore and is negotiating with other countries. China has an FTA with ASEAN, including Malaysia, and a trade agreement with Malaysia. The proposed FTA with the United States would align U.S. exporters with those from China, Japan, and Singapore. Malaysia is not a major services trading partner for the United States. Despite being Malaysia's top export market for merchandise goods, the United States has not had a significant services trading partnership with Malaysia. Total services trade with Malaysia has been less than $2 billion per year from 2000 to 2004, only surpassing $2 billion in 2005. Malaysia's role in overall services trade with the U.S. is relatively small, representing less than half a percent of the U.S. services export market and providing less than a third of a percent of U.S. services imports. However, U.S. service sectors like telecommunications, financial services, and insurance providers are interested in gaining better access to Malaysia's domestic market. A U.S.-Malaysia FTA could strengthen the existing trade relationship between the two countries. The discussed FTA would enhance access for U.S. service providers to Malaysia's market. U.S. companies had invested over $15 billion in Malaysia by 2007, with a focus on manufacturing, particularly in computer and electronic equipment. U.S. investments in chemical manufacturing in Malaysia have also been increasing, with approved projects totaling billions of dollars. The U.S. investment in Malaysia focused on electronic equipment and chemical industries. The U.S.-Malaysia FTA faced challenges due to the expiration of the President's Trade Promotion Authority. Various scenarios were considered for the proposed FTA with Malaysia to be reviewed by Congress. Congress may consider extending, renewing, or revising Trade Promotion Authority for the U.S.-Malaysia FTA. Alternatively, they could pass temporary or limited TPA for the agreement, as done with the Uruguay Round Agreements. Another option is to consider the FTA without TPA, allowing for potential amendments to the implementing bill. Legislative policy options include consultations with the Executive Branch, oversight hearings on U.S. trade policy, and working with interest groups. The U.S. trade policy involves relations with Malaysia and other nations, consultations with interest groups, and potential changes in the draft agreement before signing. Tariff rates comparison between U.S. and Malaysia is complex due to thousands of products with varying rates. Average MFN tariff rates apply to most countries and members of the World Trade Organization. The average MFN tariff rates for Malaysia and the United States differ, with Malaysia's average tariff rate at 8.1% higher than the United States' 4.8%. Both countries have peaks in tariff rates on certain products, with Malaysia maintaining high rates on items of interest to U.S. agriculture. The Malaysian tariff rates for grains, rice, oranges, apples, wheat flour, prepared food, beef, pork, ham, yogurt, chocolate products, and baby food range from 5% to 168%. In contrast, the United States imposes a 350% tariff on tobacco products exceeding the import quota, with a 12.1% tariff within the quota. Malaysia's average MFN tariff rate is 8.7%, higher than the United States' 4.0%, particularly high in sectors supported for industry growth like transport equipment at 25.6%. The average Malaysia tariff rates for transport equipment, non-electrical machinery, and electrical machinery are significantly higher than the U.S. rates. Average applied tariff rates are indicators of a nation's actual level of tariff protection, which can be lower or higher than MFN rates due to various factors. In 2006, Malaysia had an average applied tariff rate of 8.4%, more than twice the U.S. rate of 3.7%. The applied tariff rate for industrial goods in Malaysia is 9.1%, compared to 3.7% in the United States."
