    "content": "Increasing pressures on water supplies are leading to changes in operations at Corps facilities to meet municipal and industrial demands. Corps reallocations at Lake Lanier are causing conflict between Alabama, Florida, and Georgia. The agency is considering reallocating storage for M&I use at dams in various states, with more requests expected. Reallocation involves tradeoffs, affecting benefits and stakeholders. States and local entities play a significant role in M&I water supply development, as recognized in the 1958 Water Supply Act. The 1958 Water Supply Act recognized state primacy in developing water supplies for domestic, municipal, industrial, and other purposes. The federal government has primarily invested in flood control, navigation, irrigation, dams, and diversion facilities. Since the 1960s, federal dam construction has slowed due to high costs, ecological and social impacts, and site availability. Recent reservoir planning focuses on balancing objectives for existing reservoirs rather than new projects. Congress authorizes the Army Corps of Engineers to build dams and water infrastructure. The Army Corps of Engineers operates dams and reservoirs to meet authorized purposes and comply with federal laws. Congress has specified purposes for each project, including M&I storage for some reservoirs. Additional requirements for Corps facilities include fish and wildlife protection and recreation benefits. The Corps has limited authority to provide M&I water supply under the 1958 WSA and the Flood Control Act of 1944. The Corps has limited authority to provide M&I water supply under the 1958 WSA and the Flood Control Act of 1944, focusing on reservoir storage reallocation. In the 1958 WSA, Congress granted the Corps authority for M&I water supply but restricted decision-making without congressional approval. Modifications to reservoir projects for water supply that significantly impact the project's original purposes require Congress's approval. The provision of water supply must align with authorized purposes, and any major changes necessitate congressional authorization. Congress did not define what constitutes a serious effect or major change. The Corps developed guidance for determining when reallocations of storage in reservoir projects for water supply purposes do not require congressional approval. The criteria include limiting the reallocation to 15% of total storage capacity or 50,000 acre feet for domestic, municipal, or industrial water supply uses. This guidance was added to the manual in 1977 and was not previously defined by Congress. In 2007, lawsuits related to Lake Lanier were consolidated and transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida. A court order in 2009 addressed whether the Corps violated the 1958 WSA by not seeking congressional approval for changes in Lake Lanier operations for water supply. The court largely agreed with litigants that the Corps needed approval for operational changes affecting authorized purposes. The court found that the Corps had reallocated over 21% of Lake Lanier's storage without congressional authorization since the mid-1970s, totaling roughly 260,000 acre-feet. Operational changes shifted storage from hydropower to M&I supply, leading to contracts with water providers for withdrawals. The court determined that the Corps exceeded its authority to reallocate, raising concerns about water reallocation at other Corps facilities with 11 million acre-feet designated for M&I water. The Corps has reallocated storage space for M&I water at various reservoirs, with Lake Texoma being a significant example. Over 50,000 AF of storage space has been reallocated at Lake Texoma, with multiple reallocations approved through discretionary authority and congressional approval. The largest reallocation of 84,099 AF from hydropower to M&I use was negotiated with stakeholders and included compensation arrangements. The Corps reallocated storage space for M&I water at various reservoirs, including Lake Texoma. The reallocation at Lake Texoma did not significantly harm its authorized purposes and did not require major structural modifications. The transfer was done under the 1958 WSA without congressional approval, exceeding the 50,000 AF limit. The reallocation at Cowanesque Lake was unique, involving a mix of project-specific direction from Congress and the Corps' discretionary authority. The reallocation of storage space for M&I water at various reservoirs, including Lake Texoma, was discussed under the Corps' 1958 WSA discretionary authority. Evaluating potential effects on authorized purposes and operational changes is a key concern raised by a 2009 court order questioning Corps evaluations related to Lake Lanier operations. The sufficiency of Corps reallocation analyses is a general concern beyond the scope of this CRS report. The 2009 court order raised concerns about unauthorized withdrawals and operational actions supporting M&I uses at Corps facilities, particularly Lake Lanier. The reallocation of storage space for M&I water at various reservoirs under the Corps' 1958 WSA discretionary authority has been a contentious issue. The sufficiency of Corps reallocation analyses is a general concern beyond the scope of this CRS report. The reallocation of storage space for M&I water at Corps facilities has been a contentious issue, with concerns about unauthorized withdrawals and operational actions at Lake Lanier. Most reallocations have occurred without national attention or litigation, either through the Corps' authority or congressional direction. The use of discretionary authority and reservoir operations raise questions about how reallocations are evaluated and performed, especially as interest in M&I reallocation grows. The reallocation of storage space for M&I water at Corps facilities raises questions about how to handle ongoing unauthorized withdrawals, financial agreements with stakeholders, and transition plans. Decisions on M&I reallocations involve tradeoffs and considerations for stakeholders like recreation interests and hydropower customers. Congress faces broader water policy questions regarding M&I water supply at Corps facilities, including how to charge for storage space and credit for return flows. The broader water policy questions for Congress include the appropriate federal role in municipal water supply, potential impacts of climate change on water resources, and the need to assess current infrastructure operations and laws. The complexity arises from differing opinions on responses and challenges in enacting changes due to various affected constituencies."
