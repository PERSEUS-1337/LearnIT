    "content": "The Health Coverage Tax Credit (HCTC) covers 72.5% of the premium for eligible taxpayers, who are responsible for the remaining 27.5%. It can be used towards qualified health insurance, is refundable, and advanceable. To claim the HCTC, taxpayers must be in specific eligibility groups and not enrolled in certain types of health insurance. The Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program provides assistance to workers who lose their jobs due to international trade. Workers between 55 and 64 who receive payments from the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) are eligible for TAA benefits. To qualify for TAA, workers must petition the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) and demonstrate that their job loss was due to a qualified cause. If approved, workers receive Trade Readjustment Allowance (TRA) payments. Eligibility for unemployment insurance (UI) and Trade Readjustment Allowance (TRA) is limited to 130 weeks combined. Workers aged 50 and older may qualify for Reemployment Trade Adjustment Assistance (RTAA) which supplements wages for up to two years. Alternative Trade Adjustment Assistance (ATAA) is a similar wage-insurance program. Eligibility for the Health Coverage Tax Credit (HCTC) is tied to receiving TAA benefits. The Health Coverage Tax Credit (HCTC) eligibility is limited to individuals receiving TRA, RTAA, or ATAA cash benefits. PBGC benefits are for workers whose defined-benefit pension plans were insured and taken over by PBGC. PBGC pays pensions using plan assets and insurance reserves to former workers and their survivors. The Health Coverage Tax Credit (HCTC) is available to individuals receiving TRA, RTAA, or ATAA cash benefits. Eligibility for the HCTC is restricted, with limitations on those enrolled in certain health plans or programs such as Medicare, FEHBP, Medicaid, or CHIP. Additionally, individuals cannot be eligible for Medicare Part A or coverage through the U.S. military health system to qualify for the HCTC. The Health Coverage Tax Credit (HCTC) is available to individuals receiving TRA, RTAA, or ATAA cash benefits. Eligible taxpayers can use the HCTC for health insurance covering their spouse and dependents. Family members can receive the HCTC for up to two years after specific events. The HCTC can only cover part of the premium for qualified health insurance. The HCTC can be used for qualified health insurance covering spouses and dependents, with coverage options including COBRA, group health plans through a spouse's employer, individual health insurance, and coverage funded by a VEBA. State-qualified health plans are also available if the state has established them. State-qualified health plans (identified by letters B-H) are available for individuals in states that have established these options. These plans must provide specified consumer protections to qualifying individuals, defined as HCTC-eligible individuals. State-qualified health plans (identified by letters B-H) in certain states must offer specific protections to HCTC-eligible individuals with prior creditable coverage, including guaranteed issue, coverage regardless of preexisting conditions, equal premiums, and similar benefits. Certain types of coverage are excluded from qualifying as qualified health insurance. The Health Coverage Tax Credit (HCTC) program covers various types of insurance, including accident, disability, liability, workers' compensation, and more. The IRS administers the program, with involvement from federal and state agencies like the Department of the Treasury, DOL, and PBGC to determine eligibility and provide monthly payments to coincide with insurance premiums. The Department of Labor (DOL) assists Treasury in identifying eligible individuals for the Health Coverage Tax Credit (HCTC). DOL coordinates One-Stop Career Centers that offer services to job seekers, including information on benefits like the HCTC. State workforce agencies (SWAs) administer unemployment and Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) benefits, and SWAs mail HCTC information packets to eligible TAA beneficiaries. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) also identifies potential HCTC beneficiaries and shares their information with the IRS, who then sends program kits to eligible individuals. The IRS mails program kits to eligible individuals for the Health Coverage Tax Credit (HCTC). Taxpayers with qualified health insurance can claim the credit when filing their tax returns or receive advance payments monthly. The HCTC is refundable, allowing taxpayers to receive the full amount they are eligible for, regardless of tax liability. Choosing the HCTC makes individuals ineligible for the premium tax credit under the Affordable Care Act. The IRS published summary statistics in its 2014 Statistics of Income report for the Health Coverage Tax Credit (HCTC) under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. In tax year 2013, 13,693 tax returns claimed the HCTC, totaling approximately $52.3 million. For the 2016 filing season, 13,015 e-filed tax returns claimed the credit. Taxpayers claiming the HCTC must complete Form 8885 and provide proof of payment for qualified health insurance. The credit amount reduces taxes owed and is refundable if it exceeds the tax liability, providing a tax refund to the taxpayer. To receive advance payments of the Health Coverage Tax Credit (HCTC), individuals register with the program and must be enrolled in a qualified health insurance plan. The program confirms eligibility, sends an invoice for the taxpayer's share of the premium, and individuals make payments to Treasury. Treasury then pays 100% of the premium to the health insurance plans."
