    "content": "The Motor Donor Act, also known as the National Organ Donor Registry, amends the Public Health Service Act to establish a national organ donor registry. The subpart aims to increase organ and tissue donor registrations, improve information on donation, ensure accurate information on individual wishes, and provide grants to states for donor registries. The subpart establishes a national organ and tissue donor registry called the Registry, containing information on individuals who wish to be donors, including personal details and a unique identification number. During the initial 2-year and 4-year periods after the Motor Donor Act's enactment, the Secretary will coordinate with States and organ procurement organizations to share data and provide links between the Registry and State agencies. The Motor Donor Act aims to coordinate with States and organ procurement organizations to establish organ and tissue donor registries through the driver's license process. Organ procurement organizations will have 24-hour access to the Registry through a password provided by the Secretary. Additionally, the Secretary is required to create a website within 3 years of the Act's enactment. The Motor Donor Act requires the dissemination of a pamphlet to US citizens with tax returns, providing information on organ donation and a Registry website. Participation in the Registry does not impact organ allocation. The Motor Donor Act establishes a Registry for individuals to express intent for organ donation. Participation in the Registry is not legally binding consent, and individuals can cancel their participation at any time. The Secretary must inform individuals of their right to cancel and the procedure for doing so. The Secretary can remove individuals from the Registry if they cancel participation. Grants are available for States to establish State registries linked to the motor vehicle driver's license application process. States must submit applications to the Secretary to be eligible for grants. Each state must establish procedures for individuals to make legally binding organ and tissue donation gifts when applying for a driver's license. These procedures must comply with specific requirements outlined by the Secretary. State driver's license applications must include an option for individuals to designate their intent to be an organ and tissue donor. The application should contain a question asking if the individual wishes to have their donor designation in the State registry. State procedures require affirmative responses on driver's license applications to note organ donor preference in the State registry or on the license. Information of affirmative responders is forwarded to the Registry. State procedures mandate that information on organ donor designation must be submitted within 100 days of designation, including any changes in designation or address. Individuals who choose not to have their organ donor designation included will not have their information forwarded to the Registry. Access to this information by organ procurement organizations is also outlined in the State procedures. The Secretary gives priority in awarding grants to States collaborating with organ procurement organizations. Donor information is recorded in individual computer records and accessible 24/7 to organ procurement organizations without any fees.
