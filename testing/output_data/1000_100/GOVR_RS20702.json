    "content": "The Water Resources Development Act of 2000 authorized federal agencies to participate in Everglades restoration projects under the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. Changes in water quantity and quality since the 1950s have significantly impacted the region's ecology, leading to water shortages during the dry season. The Everglades in Florida, impacted by lower rainfall in 2007, are facing increased frequency of water shortages due to rising demand. The network of wetlands once spanned 220 miles from Orlando to Florida Bay, with slow-moving creeks feeding into the Kissimmee River. Water flowed south to Lake Okeechobee, then through marshes to Florida Bay, acting as natural filters and recharging aquifers. The Everglades supported a diverse range of species due to its abundant moisture, rich soils, and subtropical temperatures. The Everglades in South Florida were once a diverse ecosystem supported by abundant moisture, rich soils, and subtropical temperatures. However, by the mid-1800s, it was viewed as an unproductive swamp. Human interventions like the Central and Southern Florida project have drastically altered the Everglades' water regime with canals, levees, and water control structures. This project, authorized in 1948, aimed at flood damage reduction and water management needs in South Florida. The Everglades ecosystem has changed due to the Central and Southern Florida project, leading to reduced water flow during the dry season and increased flow during the rainy season. This alteration, combined with urban and agricultural development, has caused the Everglades to shrink by half its original size, threatening plant and animal species. Water quality is also degraded by pollutants like excess nutrients, metals, and pesticides, leading to a decline in native vegetation and an increase in invasive species. Changes in freshwater flows have disrupted coastal estuaries and reef systems. Restoration activities, including acquiring lands and a multi-species recovery plan, are being undertaken by the federal government and the State of Florida to address the health of the Everglades. The South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force coordinates restoration activities with goals to \"get the water right,\" restore natural habitats, and ensure compatibility of built and natural systems. The estimated cost for achieving these goals in South Florida is nearly $20 billion, with a significant portion allocated to the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP). The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) focuses on restoring natural hydrologic functions and water quality, capturing and storing freshwater for use during the dry season. It calls for removing levees and canals, building reservoirs, storage wells, and pumping stations to redistribute water. Title VI of WRDA 2000 approved CERP and authorized $700 million in federal funds for initial projects. The Administration proposes CERP projects for authorization in WRDA. WRDA 2007 authorized Indian River Lagoon and Picayune Strand projects, totaling $2.0 billion. Title VI of WRDA 2000 established cost-sharing for construction and O&M of CERP projects. Federal agencies receive appropriations for CERP activities through annual bills. The status of appropriations for CERP activities is available in CRS reports. Concerns remain over implementation, prioritization of projects, federal efforts, and mitigation for excess phosphorous. $0.37 billion in federal funds and $1.63 billion in state funds have been allocated to CERP projects since WRDA 2000. Some stakeholders are concerned that the state's Acceler8 effort to prioritize CERP projects may focus too much on meeting water supply needs, potentially neglecting ecosystem restoration investments. Proponents argue that the priority projects have benefits for both water supply and restoration, and federal funding pace is too slow. Federal water resources policies support federal participation in ecosystem restoration. Some stakeholders are concerned about specific Everglades restoration projects primarily benefiting locally rather than nationally. Increasing costs, especially in land acquisition, are a worry for stakeholders, with proponents of Acceler8 advocating for quicker action. Concerns also exist about federal funds being tied up in CERP, potentially limiting funds for other national ecosystem restoration projects. Traditional Corps projects for navigation and flood control are also worried about the impact of these rising costs. Delays in completing CERP projects raise concerns about the feasibility of Everglades restoration. The interdependency of CERP and non-CERP projects for ecosystem restoration goals is highlighted, with potential delays in the Modified Waters Deliveries Project affecting water flows for CERP components. WRDA 2000 restricts appropriations for CERP components until Mod Waters is complete, adding to the controversy surrounding potential restoration delays. The controversy surrounding potential delays in Everglades restoration is linked to a Florida state law authorizing a plan to mitigate phosphorus pollution. Critics argue the plan may compromise restoration efforts by extending deadlines, while proponents see it as a realistic strategy. Congressional appropriations for restoration are conditioned on achieving water quality standards, with potential reductions if standards are not met. This indicates congressional oversight in the restoration process. Some environmental groups question the effectiveness and necessity of the complicated and costly Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) in achieving water quality standards for federal lands in Florida. Concerns include the lack of measures to improve water quality in the Everglades and the focus on water supply over ecological restoration. Despite revisions to include restoration activities earlier, opposition from some groups and scientists persists. Some groups supporting CERP in Florida are concerned about the funding source for the project, specifically opposing the use of land acquisition funds for other CERP projects. They emphasize the importance of acquiring land early in the restoration process to prevent irreversible damage from development. Questions have also been raised about the management of Lake Okeechobee, flood management in central Florida, and the integration of sea level rise and climate change impacts into CERP planning. The impacts of sea level rise and climate change have been integrated into the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) to ensure the future of the Everglades ecosystem. CERP uses adaptive management and pilot projects to address uncertainties in ecosystem restoration outcomes. This includes testing aquifer storage and recovery (ASR), a water management strategy never used on such a large scale before. Aquifers are used in ASR under CERP to store surface water for later use during dry periods. Pilot projects testing this method are ongoing, but their effectiveness in early water storage projects remains uncertain."
