    "content": "Energy and Water Development funding for FY2010 was provided in H.R. 3183, which became P.L. 111-85 when signed by President Obama on October 28, 2009, totaling $33.5 billion. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (P.L. 111-5) also allocated $44.3 billion for programs in the Corps of Engineers, Bureau of Reclamation, and Department of Energy. President Obama's proposed FY2011 budget for Energy and Water Development programs was $35.3 billion. The House Appropriations Subcommittee approved funding at $34.7 billion, while the Senate reported out S. 3635 (S.Rept. 111-228) on July 20, 2010. The House and Senate passed a continuing resolution to fund government programs at the FY2010 level until March 18, 2011. H.R. 1 was introduced to continue funding through FY2011 with specified exceptions. The House Appropriations Committee announced Energy and Water Development funding at $29.9 billion in H.R. 1. The House passed H.R. 1 with a funding level of $29.9 billion. The Senate rejected both H.R. 1 and S.Amdt. 149, leading to the introduction of H.R. 1473, which was signed into law on April 15 (P.L. 112-10) with funding of approximately $32.2 billion for Energy and Water Development programs. The Department of Energy (DOE), Bureau of Reclamation, and various independent agencies were involved in budget allocations for energy and water development from FY2004 to FY2011. Tables provide budget details for different titles, with discussions on key program issues. Funding levels from bills like H.R. 1 and S.Amdt. 149 were included in the overall tables, with no specified funding below major program levels. The FY2011 budget request for the Army Corps of Engineers was below the agency's final appropriations. The Senate Appropriations Committee provided $5.32 billion, slightly below the FY2010 appropriation. The House Appropriations Subcommittee allocated $5.28 billion. The House-passed Continuing Resolution proposed reducing funding to $4.8 billion, but the final resolution provided $5.05 billion for the Corps. The Continuing Resolution, P.L. 112-10, allocated $5.05 billion for the Army Corps of Engineers, which was $152 million higher than the President's request but $411 million lower than the FY2010 level. Funding for the Corps is project-specific, with about 85% directed to specific projects. Projects must be authorized in a Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) to receive appropriations. The backlog of authorized projects ranges from $11 billion to over $80 billion. The backlog of authorized projects for the Army Corps of Engineers ranges from $11 billion to over $80 billion. This backlog raises policy questions about the disconnect between authorization and appropriations processes and how to prioritize activities. Since 2005, the Corps has received approximately $18.7 billion in supplemental appropriations, including funds for post-hurricane emergency repairs in Louisiana and the Gulf Coast region. In 2008 and 2009, the Army Corps of Engineers received significant funding for hurricane protection and flood control in the Gulf Coast region. The Obama Administration's FY2011 request included $1.69 billion for construction projects, a reduction from the previous year. The Corps has a backlog of authorized projects ranging from $11 billion to over $80 billion, leading to questions about prioritization and funding allocation. The Obama Administration's FY2011 request for construction projects was below the FY2010 enacted level. The request included two new construction starts, following the previous administration's policy of limiting new starts to focus on completing ongoing activities. The Senate Appropriations Committee allocated $1.9 billion for construction, using unobligated balances from prior years for funding. The House subcommittee bill proposed funding construction at $1.851 billion. The House subcommittee bill allocated $1.851 billion for construction, slightly more than the Administration's request. The bill also included a provision prohibiting the Corps from using appropriations for new starts. The Inland Waterway Trust Fund is facing a deficit, with needed funding exceeding incoming collections. Current law designates federal responsibility for construction and major rehabilitation of inland waterways, with funding split between the IWTF and federal general revenue fund. The Inland Waterway Trust Fund (IWTF) received additional federal funding in FY2009 and FY2010 to ensure solvency. Previous proposals to increase revenues by replacing fuel tax with a lock user fee have been criticized by Congress. The FY2011 Budget limited IWTF spending to current fuel tax revenues, rejecting the user fee approach. The Senate Appropriations Committee agreed with the temporary solution of budgeting only current year fuel tax. The Senate Appropriations Committee supported the Administration's temporary solution of budgeting only current year fuel tax revenues for the Inland Waterway Trust Fund. Concerns were raised about the level of appropriations for federal activities in the Everglades and the progress of restoration efforts. The FY2011 Obama Administration request for the Corps' component of south Florida Everglades restoration work is $180 million, the same as the FY2010 appropriation. The Senate Appropriations Committee bill proposed reducing the funding for Everglades restoration from $180 million to $155 million due to delays and cost savings considerations. The Administration has not implemented across-the-board reductions for savings and slippage since FY2006. Savings are accounted for due to project delays, non-federal financing, or projects costing less than estimated. In FY2006, Congress stopped applying an S&S rate to decrease reprogramming allocations among projects. The FY2011 budget request did not include reductions for S&S, but the Senate Appropriations Committee markup included reductions for various Corps accounts. The Obama Administration requested $43.0 million for the Central Utah Project Completion Account in FY2011. The FY2011 request for the Bureau of Reclamation totaled $1.064 billion in gross current budget authority. The FY2011 budget request for the Bureau of Reclamation totaled $1.064 billion in gross current budget authority, with a net discretionary authority of $1.015 billion after an offset for the Central Valley Project Restoration Fund. An additional $167 million was estimated to be available for FY2011 from permanent and other funds, bringing the total to $1.182 billion. The total discretionary budget request for Title II funding was approximately $1.107 billion, with varying appropriations from different bills. The Obama Administration requested $913.6 million for the Water and Related Resources Account for FY2011, a reduction from FY2010 of $37.6 million. H.R. 1 proposed funding the account at $911.6 million, approximately $39 million below the FY2010 enacted level. Section 4028 of the bill would have eliminated funding for a dam removal study in the Klamath basin. Section 4075 of H.R. 1 would have eliminated funding for a dam removal study in the Klamath basin and barred funding for biological opinions related to the Central Valley Project and the California State Project. It also prohibited funding for the San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement Act. These provisions were not included in the final enacted version of P.L. 112-10. Reclamation manages numerous dams and projects in 17 western states, providing water for irrigation, farmland, and a population of 31 million. They are the largest wholesale water supplier in the region and the second-largest hydroelectric power producer in the nation. Reclamation facilities also offer flood control, recreation, and wildlife benefits, but face controversy over their impact on species and water users. The budget is mainly project-based, with few overarching programs. In FY2010, the House Committee on Appropriations criticized Reclamation for being a \"caretaker agency\" and lacking leadership in water supply management. The challenges of balancing needs, increasing demand, and changing hydrology require active leadership. The Central Valley Project (CVP) in California, one of Reclamation's largest projects, has faced water delivery limitations due to drought and environmental restrictions. Previous appropriations bills have included amendments to prevent new Biological Opinions on project operations. Reclamation faced criticism in FY2010 for its handling of new Biological Opinions (BiOps) on project operations affecting fish species like Delta Smelt and salmon. An amendment in appropriations aimed to prevent restrictions on the Central Valley Project (CVP) and State Water Project (SWP) due to these BiOps. The Operations Criteria and Plan (OCAP) from 2004 allowed increased pumping from the Delta, potentially endangering protected species under the Endangered Species Act. Other factors like invasive species and pollution also impact fish populations. Critically low numbers of Delta Smelt led to court-imposed limits on water pumping. Low water deliveries to certain districts worsened unemployment. Proposed FY2010 amendments to prevent BiOps in the CVP were not enacted, but a bill allowed water transfers among CVP contractors without meeting specific conditions. The Administration requested $40.0 million for the California Bay-Delta Restoration Account (Bay-Delta, or CALFED) for FY2011, with funds targeted at water use efficiency, water quality, water storage, conveyance, and ecosystem restoration. Funding for CALFED subaccounts varied, with some areas seeing declines while others saw increases. The enacted Continuing Resolution provided the same amount as the President's FY2011 budget request. Reclamation proposed a $72.1 million allocation for the San Joaquin River Restoration Fund for FY2011, a significant increase from the previous year. The Fund, authorized by the San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement Act, aims to implement fisheries restoration and water management provisions of a settlement agreement. Funding sources include a reallocation of Central Valley Project Restoration Fund receipts and accelerated payment of capital repayment obligations from Friant water users. Construction of Friant Dam in the 1940s blocked salmon migration and dewatered parts of the San Joaquin River, leading to the disappearance of spring-run Chinook. The San Joaquin River Restoration Fund aims to restore the salmon run and minimize water supply impacts on Friant Division contractors. The Senate Appropriations Committee allocated an additional $8 million for San Joaquin River restoration in FY2011. The Committee markup included an additional $8 million for San Joaquin River restoration, in addition to the $72 million allocation. The House-passed CR (H.R. 1) prohibits funding for the settlement agreement in FY2011. Reclamation proposed funding for the WaterSMART Program in FY2011, focusing on water conservation and planning. The FY2010 Water Conservation Initiative included WaterSMART Grants, Basin Studies, and Title XVI Projects. Reclamation proposed a $27.4 million increase for FY2011. The Senate Appropriations Committee decreased funding levels for WaterSMART programs. P.L. 112-10 did not specify funding levels for WaterSMART. The Energy and Water bill has funded DOE programs since FY2005, including research on renewable energy, nuclear power, general science, environmental cleanup, and nuclear weapons programs. The bill now includes programs for fossil fuels, energy efficiency, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and energy statistics. FY2010 appropriations funded DOE programs at $27.1 billion, with additional unexpended funds from the ARRA. The Obama Administration requested $29.6 billion for FY2011, while the House-passed H.R. 1 Continuing Resolution would have funded DOE programs at $24.6 billion. The final legislation, P.L. 112-10, appropriated $26.3 billion for DOE programs, including funding for EERE and Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability (EDER) programs. The EERE program saw a reduction in funding by $416.9 million, while the EDER program received $144.7 million, a cut of $27.3 million. The DOE requested $50 million for a new science and engineering education program called RE-ENERGYSE to train a skilled clean energy workforce. The program aims to address the lack of education in emerging energy trades and increase U.S. competitiveness by developing green technology programs at universities and community colleges. The $50 million request for the RE-ENERGYSE program includes $35 million for higher education programs in clean energy development and $15 million for technical training and education at community colleges. It also supports K-12 education activities to engage students and educators in addressing long-term environment and energy challenges. The DOE proposed a RE-ENERGYSE program with $115 million funding in FY2010, aiming to educate and inspire students to pursue clean energy careers and adopt sustainable practices. Congress did not fund the program due to concerns about its alignment with other departments' activities. The program lacked sufficient details and background research according to the House Committee on Appropriations. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended zero funding for the proposed RE-ENERGYSE program in FY2010, citing a lack of details and background research. Instead, they suggested $7.5 million for a study to define education and workforce needs and assess program complementarity with other federal agencies. The Solar Program did not receive funding for FY2010 or FY2011. The Solar Program would have received a net funding increase of $55.4 million in the FY2011 request, with the majority going to the Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) subprogram for a demonstration project. This project aims to accelerate CSP deployment in the desert Southwest by two to three years, adding about 1,000 megawatts of new capacity. Additionally, the Photovoltaic (PV) R&D Program would have received an increase of $23.5 million for the PV Manufacturing Initiative. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $50.0 million for the CSP demonstration project as part of the PV Manufacturing Initiative to accelerate PV technology cost reduction and commercialization. The Wind Program would receive a net increase of $42.5 million, with $49.0 million allocated for offshore wind development to address various barriers and accelerate market deployment of over three gigawatts of planned projects. This marks the first major wind demonstration project proposed by the Department of Energy since the early 1980s. The DOE proposed a major wind demonstration project in the early 1980s, specifically the Cape Wind project, which has faced delays. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended funding for at least two offshore wind demonstration projects. The Geothermal Program would see an increase of $11.0 million, with a focus on collaborative R&D activities addressing geophysical risks and low temperature geothermal efforts. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended funding increases for various DOE programs, including $13.9 million for the Vehicle Technologies Program and $8.7 million for the Building Technologies Program. The Energy Efficient Building Systems Design Hub would receive a modest increase from $22.0 million to $24.3 million. This funding is part of the omnibus climate/energy bills H.R. 2454 and S. 1733 of the 111th Congress. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended funding increases for various DOE programs, including the Vehicle Technologies Program and the Building Technologies Program. The Building Design Hub would receive a lower amount of $16.0 million. The committee directed GAO to assess the ENERGY STAR program. The Industrial Technologies Program would see a net increase of $4.0 million, with a new Manufacturing Energy Systems subprogram established with $10.0 million in funding. The Federal Energy Management Program would increase by $10.3 million to support DOE efforts in meeting goals set by the Energy Independence and Security Act. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended funding increases for various DOE programs, including efforts to meet goals set by the Energy Independence and Security Act. The Weatherization Program would have grown by $90.0 million, with most of the increase supporting the Administration's goal to weatherize more low-income households. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended a $90.0 million increase for the Weatherization Program to support the goal of weatherizing more low-income households. This funding would allow for the weatherization of an additional 13,200 households at an average cost of $6,500 per household. Additionally, $4.2 million would support the completion of a multi-year evaluation of the program. The State Energy Program would receive a $25.0 million increase to expand current activities, while the Facilities Program would see a net increase of $38.5 million, primarily for the completion of the Energy Systems Integration Facility at NREL. The Senate Committee on Appropriations supported a $60.0 million increase for Program Direction, with $54.8 million allocated for salaries and benefits. The number of transactions at DOE is expected to double from FY2009 through FY2011. Program Support would receive a $42.3 million increase, with $21.0 million going towards the Strategic Priorities and Impact Analysis subprogram. The FY2011 increase for the Strategic Priorities and Impact Analysis (SPIA) subprogram focuses on policy analysis of EE and RE technologies as solutions to climate change. It includes cross-cutting projects from all EERE programs for enhanced coordination. The funding increase also supports the Low-Carbon Energy Systems project to meet climate goals. Additionally, $15.0 million is allocated to expand support for the International subprogram, addressing energy security, economic goals, and climate change through partnerships. The FY2011 increase for the International subprogram focuses on addressing energy security, economic goals, and climate change through partnerships with developing countries like China, India, and Brazil. New initiatives would support global technology deployment and climate change mitigation, including the China and India Clean Energy Research Centers and programs under the Major Economies Forum. The funding increase would also enhance regional partnerships in Asia-Pacific, the Americas, Island Nations, and Africa. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended reduced funding for Program Management and congressionally directed projects, with cuts to the Hydrogen/Fuel Cell Program and Market Transformation subprogram. However, they recommended restoring DOE's proposed cut to maintain FY2011 funding at the FY2010 level for the Water Power Program. The Water Power Program faced a proposed $9.5 million cut, about 19% of its funding, for FY2011. This program focuses on marine and hydrokinetic technologies to generate electricity, with funds allocated for technology development and market acceleration. Despite the proposed cut, the Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended an additional $20.0 million, with $15.0 million designated for conventional hydropower. The DOE is shifting support towards cross-cutting technology efforts over specific industry activities. The Senate Committee recommended $14.0 million for the Industries of the Future program, with a focus on energy storage. The Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability would receive $185.9 million in funding for FY2011, with an increase in the Energy Storage subprogram. Energy storage is gaining attention as a solution to electric power infrastructure issues. The FY2011 increase in funding for storage research will focus on lithium-based batteries for stationary applications, aiming to reduce costs and develop new analytical methods for identifying promising locations for energy storage systems. The Senate Committee recommended the exact amount of funding requested for programs, with an additional $4.3 million allocated. The Obama Administration's FY2011 funding request for nuclear energy research and development totaled $824.1 million, including advanced reactors, fuel cycle technology, and infrastructure support. P.L. 112-10 provided $732.1 million for those programs, with an additional $88.2 million requested for safeguards and security at DOE's Idaho nuclear facilities. The nuclear energy R&D program focuses on generation, safety, waste storage, management, and security technologies to meet energy and climate goals. Opponents have criticized the program as wasteful. The Obama Administration's FY2011 funding request for nuclear energy research and development totaled $824.1 million. Critics argue that DOE's nuclear research program provides wasteful subsidies to an industry they believe should be phased out. The Nuclear Power 2010 Program has been completed with no further funding, but a new Reactor Concepts Research, Development, and Demonstration Program has been established to develop small modular reactors and improve existing nuclear power plants. Fuel Cycle Research and Development funding is set to increase by 47.8% to $201 million. The FY2011 budget request for nuclear energy research and development includes a 47.8% increase in funding for Fuel Cycle Research and Development to $201 million. Additional funding will be used for research on spent nuclear fuel disposal, nuclear fuel cycle options, and a new program area called Nuclear Energy Enabling Technologies (NEET) funded at $99.3 million. Generation IV Research and Development is split between NEET and Reactor Concepts RD&D, while funding for university nuclear education and research remains at $5 million. The FY2011 budget request for nuclear energy research includes $3 million for International Nuclear Energy Cooperation and $195 million for Reactor Concepts RD&D, which includes funding for the Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP) demonstration project and research on advanced reactors. The NGNP is a high-temperature gas-cooled reactor project authorized by the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The NGNP project, authorized by the Energy Policy Act of 2005, aims to produce high-temperature heat for various applications. The FY2011 budget request allocated $103 million for NGNP, with plans for a decision on final design and construction by the end of FY2011. No design funds were requested for FY2011, and a cost-shared contract for construction is expected in FY2012. The FY2011 budget includes funding requests for the Advanced Reactor Concepts program ($21.9 million) and the Small Modular Reactors Program ($38.9 million). The Advanced Reactor Concepts program aims to improve reactor performance in sustainability, safety, economics, security, and proliferation resistance. It will focus on fast reactors and reactors using various heat-transfer fluids like liquid sodium. International collaboration will continue under the Generation IV International Forum. Small reactor concepts are proposed as alternatives to existing commercial reactors exceeding 1,000 megawatts of electric. The budget justification proposes funding for Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) as alternatives to large commercial reactors. SMRs could be built in factories to reduce costs and installed in small increments for easier financing. The Department of Energy (DOE) plans to award financial assistance to two SMR designs through a competitive solicitation. Additionally, the DOE's Light Water Reactor Sustainability Program will receive funding for research on extending the life of existing commercial light water reactors beyond 60 years. This program will focus on studying the aging of reactor materials and analyzing safety margins of aging plants. The Fuel Cycle Research and Development Program conducts long-term research on technologies for managing spent nuclear fuel, with a funding request of $201 million in FY2011. Under the George W. Bush Administration, the program focused on developing the UREX reprocessing technology to recycle plutonium and uranium into new nuclear fuel. The AFCI program under the Obama Administration aims to develop technology options for various nuclear fuel cycle approaches, including direct disposal and recycling. The program will also focus on research for storage, transportation, and disposal of nuclear waste. This research will support alternatives to the Yucca Mountain spent fuel repository. The Fuel Cycle R&D Program is researching alternatives to the Yucca Mountain spent fuel repository. They are studying various geologic disposal media and developing advanced fuels for reactors. The NEET program focuses on a range of nuclear energy technology issues, including reactor materials and weapons proliferation. Development, research is to be conducted on new reactor materials, weapons proliferation risks of fuel cycle options, advanced nuclear plant manufacturing methods, and advanced sensors and instrumentation. The Energy Innovation Hub for Modeling and Simulation is to be moved to NEET with increased funding. The Obama Administration requested a decrease in funding for Fossil Energy Research and Development in FY2011. The DOE Office of Fossil Energy plans to restructure the FY2012 Coal subprogram to focus more on carbon capture and storage technologies. The FutureGen project, originally aimed at demonstrating clean coal-based power generation with CO2 capture, has been abandoned. The FY2011 request had no funding for the Carbon Capture Initiative. The DOE has redirected $1 billion in funding from the FutureGen project to refit an existing plant in Illinois for CO2 capture. The Clean Coal Technology program is in its final stages with no further funding requested for FY2011. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended a 24% increase in the Fossil Energy budget, including funding for new research programs. The committee supports research projects for high-quality fuels from coal/biomass with higher carbon emissions than petroleum fuels. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve, authorized in 1975, consists of caverns in Louisiana and Texas for emergency crude oil supply. The SPR is filled to its 727 million barrel capacity. The Northeast Heating Oil Reserve stores 2 million barrels of heating oil. The federal government stores 2 million barrels of refined home heating oil in above-ground facilities in Connecticut, New Jersey, and Rhode Island. Since 1994, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) has been filled with royalty-in-kind (RIK) oil acquired by the Department of Energy. Congress passed legislation in May 2008 to suspend RIK fill unless crude oil prices dropped below $75/barrel. The sharp decline in crude oil prices led to the resumption of filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) with nearly 10.7 million barrels purchased in 2009. The SPR reached capacity with over 6.1 million barrels delivered by January 2010. The RIK Program was phased out in September 2009, leading to the cancellation of upcoming natural gas sales contracts. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 required expansion of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to 1 billion barrels, with a possible site in Richton, MS for an additional 160 million barrels. The Administration proposed suspending spending on SPR expansion in FY2011, redirecting $71 million for non-expansion operations. This decision was based on EIA projections of declining U.S. petroleum consumption and import dependence, reducing the FY2011 SPR budget to $138.9 million from $243.8 million in FY2010. The Administration proposed suspending spending on SPR expansion in FY2011, redirecting $71 million for non-expansion operations. Congress approved $11.3 million for the NHOR in FY2010, and the Administration has proposed the same amount for FY2011. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $209.9 million for the SPR, and did not support cancellation of $71 million in prior appropriated funds for the proposed expansion of the Richton, MS, SPR site. P.L. 112-10 set the SPR spending level at the Senate Committee figure, $209.9, but rescinded a total of $86.8 million from prior year appropriations. DOE requested $5.121 billion for FY2011 for basic research in various program areas. The Department of Energy (DOE) requested $5.121 billion for the Office of Science in FY2011, an increase from the previous year. Different recommendations were made by the House and Senate Appropriations Committees in the 111th and 112th Congress. The President's Plan for Science and Innovation aimed to double R&D funding for the Office of Science and two other agencies by FY2016. The funding for the Office of Science and two other agencies increased by 4.4% in FY2011, falling short of the 7.2% annual rate needed for doubling in 10 years. The appropriation in P.L. 112-10 was lower than FY2010 levels. The requested funding for basic energy sciences was $1.835 billion, up 12.1% from FY2010. Energy Frontier Research Centers (EFRCs) would have seen a $40 million increase, with a new energy innovation hub on materials for batteries and energy storage receiving $34 million. In FY2011, the Office of Science and energy storage received increased funding. The Administration proposed eight energy innovation hubs, but only three were funded by Congress. The aim of the hubs is to address basic science and technology for the nation's energy future. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $1.739 billion for basic energy sciences in the 111th Congress. High-energy physics received a 2.3% increase in funding. In FY2011, high-energy physics requested $829 million, up 2.3% from the previous year. Proposed increases included funding for construction projects at Fermilab and support for the Large Hadron Collider. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $820 million and requested a report on expected benefits and funding needs for the projects. Biological and environmental research requested $627 million, up 3.8% from the previous year, with proposed increases for climate modeling and genomic science. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $614 million and provided funding for an artificial retina project. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $614 million for FY2011 funding. It allocated $11 million for an artificial retina project and transferred $15 million to nuclear medicine research. The request for nuclear physics was $562 million, up 5.0% from the previous year. Construction at the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) would receive $36 million. In the 111th Congress, the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $554 million for advanced scientific computing research, an increase of 8.1% from the previous year. There was a proposed increase of $35 million for leadership computing facilities at national laboratories, offset by a decrease of $6 million for research prototypes due to the conclusion of a partnership with DARPA. The request for fusion energy sciences was $380 million, a decrease of 10.8% from the previous year. The Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) in France faced delays causing a drop in funding from $135 million in FY2010 to $80 million in FY2011. The project, with partners including China, the EU, India, Japan, Russia, South Korea, and the US, has a total estimated cost of $1.45 billion to $2.2 billion. The expected start-up date for ITER was pushed to November 2019. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $384 million for fusion energy sciences in the 111th Congress, expressing concerns about ITER's cost and schedule. The Advanced Research Projects Agency\u2013Energy (ARPA-E) was established to support energy technology research projects, receiving funding in FY2009. Its mission is to overcome technological barriers in energy development. President Obama's FY2011 budget called for termination of DOE's Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management. The Obama Administration decided that developing the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository in Nevada is not feasible, leading to no funding being requested for the project in FY2011. Despite DOE's attempt to withdraw the license application, the NRC rejected the motion, citing the need for full consideration as required by the NWPA. The full NRC commission is now reviewing the withdrawal request. The NRC commission is considering the withdrawal of the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository application, which is opposed by states with defense-related waste. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future will evaluate alternatives to Yucca Mountain, funded by Congress with $5 million. The Commission will study options for temporary storage, treatment, and permanent disposal of highly radioactive nuclear waste, with a draft report due in 18 months and a final report in two years. DOE's Office of Nuclear Energy will lead future waste management activities. Substantial funding has been requested for NE to conduct research on nuclear waste disposal technologies and options. Nuclear utilities have won court decisions upholding DOE's obligation to meet waste removal deadlines. DOE estimates liability payments could reach $11 billion if waste removal begins by 2020. The DOE established the Innovative Technology Loan Guarantee Program to support energy projects with new technologies. Subsidy costs for loan guarantees, ranging from 1% to 10%, must be paid upfront by projects. The FY2009 omnibus funding measure provided DOE with loan guarantee support. The FY2009 omnibus funding measure (P.L. 111-8) provided DOE with loan guarantee authority of $47 billion, with allocations for nuclear power, energy efficiency, renewables, coal, carbon capture, and uranium enrichment. President Obama's FY2011 budget proposed increasing the loan guarantee ceiling for nuclear power plants to $54.5 billion. The first preliminary nuclear loan guarantee was announced in 2010 for the Vogtle nuclear power plant project in Georgia. The conditional guarantee agreement for the Vogtle nuclear power plant in Georgia would provide $8.33 billion in financing for two reactors, with a proposed increase to $54.5 billion for nuclear loan guarantees. Critics argue that this could divert resources from cleaner energy technologies. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act created a temporary loan guarantee program for renewable energy projects. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act established a loan guarantee program for energy projects, with $6 billion initially allocated for subsidy costs. $2 billion was later transferred to the \"cash for clunkers\" program, and $1.5 billion was rescinded for other purposes. The remaining $2.5 billion is expected to support loan guarantees totaling $25 billion. President Obama also requested an additional $500 million for energy efficiency and renewable energy loan guarantees. The DOE budget justification estimates that the $500 million appropriation for subsidy costs would support renewable energy and energy efficiency loan guarantees totaling $3 billion-$5 billion. DOE also requested $58 million for administrative costs, which are to be fully offset by receipts. P.L. 112-10 reduced the loan guarantee authority for Section 1703 non-nuclear technologies to $7.3 billion, bringing the total loan guarantee ceiling to about $9.3 billion. Nuclear loan guarantees remain at $18.5 billion, and uranium enrichment totals $4 billion. Remaining appropriations for subsidy cost payments under the Section 1705 loan guarantee program are to expire at the end of FY2011, but P.L. 112-10 provides $170 million with no expiration to pay subsidy costs. P.L. 112-10 provides $170 million with no expiration for subsidy costs for renewable energy and efficiency projects under the Section 1703 program. It also authorizes up to $1.183 billion in loan guarantees for these projects, in addition to the remaining $31.8 billion in Section 1703 authority. The additional funding is available to projects that applied under the expiring Section 1705 before February 24, 2011. The program provides loans to automobile manufacturers and parts suppliers for plant capacity investments to improve fuel economy. DOE requested $10 million in FY2011 for administrative expenses, mostly covered by P.L. 112-10. Congress established the Stockpile Stewardship Program in FY1994 to preserve US nuclear weapons competencies. The FY2010 National Defense Authorization Act amended the program's purpose to ensure nuclear weapons safety and security. The Stockpile Stewardship Program, operated by the National Nuclear Security Administration, ensures the safety, security, and reliability of the nuclear weapons stockpile without underground testing. Funding for the program is outlined in the Weapons Activities account, with additional programs managed outside of this account. The program aims to increase the reliability, safety, and security of the nuclear weapons stockpile. The stockpile management program aims to increase the reliability, safety, and security of the nuclear weapons stockpile. Changes to the stockpile must align with program objectives and design parameters. Stewardship activities occur at the nuclear weapons complex, which includes three laboratories and four production sites managed by NNSA. The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) manages eight sites including Plant, TX; Savannah River Site, SC; and Y-12 Plant, TN, and the Nevada Test Site. The FY2011 request document includes data from NNSA's Future Years Nuclear Security Program (FYNSP) projecting budgets for FY2012-FY2015. Despite Cold War reductions, Congress has pushed for further changes in the Complex for increased efficiency, security, and cost reduction. NNSA submitted a report in January 2007 outlining plans for transforming the Complex, known as \"Complex 2030.\" The House Appropriations Committee demanded a comprehensive nuclear defense and nonproliferation strategy, a specific nuclear stockpile description, and a long-term expenditure plan before considering further funding for Complex 2030 and the Reliable Replacement Warhead program. The Senate Appropriations Committee criticized the inadequate linkage between warheads, the Complex, and strategy, rejecting the premature deployment of the Complex 2030 consolidation effort. The Congress agreed to develop a comprehensive nuclear weapons strategy for the 21st century. NNSA announced its plan, Complex Transformation, which includes reducing the weapons program footprint, closing or transferring structures, reducing weapons workers, dismantling weapons faster, and building new facilities. The House Appropriations Committee emphasized the need for a modern nuclear deterrent strategy, determining the size and nature of the nuclear stockpile, and the nuclear weapons complex to support future needs. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended eliminating funds for the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) and made changes to individual programs in its FY2009 report. The FY2010 and FY2011 budgets did not request RRW funds, with the FY2011 budget request for Weapons Activities being $7,008.8 million. The Department of Defense canceled the development of RRW due to it not aligning with Presidential commitments to move towards a nuclear-free world. In FY2010, the Department of Defense allocated $6,384.4 million for nuclear forces. The White House planned to invest $80 billion over the next decade to sustain and modernize the nuclear weapons complex. Projections for weapons stockpile and infrastructure costs were outlined for FY2011 to FY2017. In FY2010, the Department of Defense allocated $6,384.4 million for nuclear forces. The White House planned to invest $80 billion over the next decade to sustain and modernize the nuclear weapons complex. Projections for weapons stockpile and infrastructure costs were outlined for FY2011 to FY2017. In the 112th Congress, H.R. 1 proposed reducing the requested increase in funding for Weapons Activities by $312.4 million, which was contentious. A compromise was reached with Senate Republicans to support the New START treaty by increasing funding for Weapons Activities substantially from FY2010 to FY2020 to modernize the nuclear weapons complex and maintain nuclear weapons. The President's FY2012 budget requested an increase in funding for Weapons Activities to $7,629.7 million. The issue of funding for Weapons Activities was resolved for FY2011 in P.L. 112-10, which provided $6,946.4 million, a reduction below the initial request. This program involves direct work on nuclear weapons in the stockpile, including monitoring, maintenance, refurbishment, and dismantlement. Life Extension Programs (LEPs) are also part of this program. Life Extension Programs (LEPs) under DSW aim to extend the life of warheads through design, certification, and replacement of components. An LEP for B61 mods 7 and 11 bombs was completed in FY2009, and ongoing work is being done for the W76 warhead for the Trident II submarine-launched ballistic missile. The FY2010 appropriation was $223.2 million, with a $249.5 million request for FY2011. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended the requested amount and required reports on completed studies. Stockpile Systems program involves maintenance, component replacement, and assessment for all warheads. The FY2011 budget request for weapon maintenance and replacement is $649.4 million, with significant increases for the B61 bomb, W78 warhead, and W87 warhead. B61 funds are allocated for system sustainment and phase 6.2/6.2A study. The latter aims to extend the life of components and enhance surety. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended the requested amount for Stockpile Systems, with a focus on surveillance activities to monitor the status of nuclear weapons. A robust surveillance program is necessary to maintain confidence in the performance of nuclear weapons without underground testing. The study will evaluate options for improving safety and control features, ensuring compatibility with modern aircraft like the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The House Appropriations Committee did not recommend funds for a controversial study on the B61-12 variant in the FY2010 appropriations cycle. The Senate bill included the requested amount, and the conference bill allocated $92.0 million for B61 stockpile systems activities, with $32.5 million designated for a study of nonnuclear components for the proposed B61-12. Upon completion of the Nuclear Posture Review and confirmation of the requirement for the B61-12, an additional $15,000,000 can be reallocated for the study. The conference agreement allocated $92.0 million for B61 stockpile systems activities, with $32.5 million designated for a study of nonnuclear components for the proposed B61-12. An additional $15,000,000 can be reallocated for the study upon completion of the Nuclear Posture Review and confirmation of the requirement for the B61-12. The NNSA was directed to submit a report on safety and security features for a refurbished B61, along with a cost-benefit analysis. The President and Congress aim to reduce the stockpile, leading to the need for weapons dismantlement and disposition. This involves interim storage, dismantlement, and disposition of warhead components and materials. The FY2010 current appropriation for weapons dismantlement and disposition is $96.1 million, with a decrease in dismantlements and component dispositions in the FY2011 request of $58.0 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $64.4 million, with $27.5 million allocated to restore weapons dismantlement activities at Pantex. Components of the program have been relocated within DOE or to different budget categories in recent years. The major activity in FY2009 was the Pit Disassembly and Conversion Facility (PDCF), which was moved to a different account for FY2010. The FY2010 budget includes funding for the Pit Disassembly and Conversion Facility (PDCF) to convert plutonium pits into oxide for use in nuclear reactors. The Waste Solidification Building (WSB) is now part of the Fissile Materials Disposition Program. Stockpile Services cover Production Support, R&D, Certification, and Plutonium Sustainment. The FY2010 budget includes funding for the Pit Disassembly and Conversion Facility (PDCF) to convert plutonium pits into oxide for use in nuclear reactors. Stockpile Services provide the foundation for production capability and capacity within the nuclear security enterprise, including funding for Plutonium Sustainment to maintain plutonium technical base skills and restore the capability to build up to 10 pits per year. The FY2011 request was $941.5 million, with the largest increase for Plutonium Sustainment. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended reducing the request by $30.5 million for the Pit Disassembly and Conversion Facility (PDCF) to convert plutonium pits into oxide for use in nuclear reactors. Within the funds provided, at least $74.0 million shall be used to support surveillance, no more than $160.0 million for plutonium sustainment, and $84.1 million for weapons assembly, disassembly, and dismantlement at Pantex. These efforts provide specialized scientific knowledge and technical support to the nuclear weapons stockpile work. The Science Campaign aims to improve warhead performance assessment without nuclear testing, readiness for nuclear tests, and maintain scientific infrastructure. The FY2011 request for the Science Campaign at the nuclear weapons laboratories is $365.2 million, with a focus on improving scientific capabilities and experimental infrastructure for assessing nuclear explosives package performance. The Advanced Certification program within this campaign will see a significant increase in funding to improve weapons certification processes and study system requirements. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended reducing the requested funding for certain experiments at the Nevada Test Site and the Dual-Axis Radiographic Hydrodynamic Test Facility. The Z facility at Sandia will receive $53.3 million, with an additional $10.0 million for experiments on plutonium. The Z facility in Albuquerque is crucial for studying material reactions under high temperature and pressure, and is described as critical for maintaining a safe nuclear stockpile. The Engineering Campaign aims to develop capabilities for improving safety, reliability, and performance. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended increasing the funding for the Engineering Campaign to develop capabilities for assessing and improving the safety, reliability, and performance of nuclear weapons. The FY2010 appropriation was $150.0 million, with a $141.9 million request for FY2011. The committee also provided funds to simulate a nuclear environment and support the Inertial Confinement Fusion Ignition and High Yield Campaign. The campaign aims to create high temperatures and pressures in the laboratory to support weapons-related research and attract scientific talent. The National Ignition Facility (NIF) is the centerpiece of this effort, allowing for high energy density physics experiments to validate theoretical models without nuclear testing. Despite initial controversy and technical issues, NIF has made significant progress. The National Ignition Facility (NIF) faced significant cost growth and technical problems initially, but controversy waned as the program progressed. In January 2010, scientists successfully fired 192 laser beams at a target, heating it to 6 million degrees Fahrenheit. This marked a significant advance in the $3.5 billion facility's work. The FY2010 appropriation was $457.9 million, with a $481.5 million request for FY2011. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended the requested amount and supported the creation of an independent advisory board for NIF experiments. The NNSA utilizes models of nuclear weapons to simulate testing, aiming for a comprehensive understanding of weapon lifecycle. Some doubt simulation's reliability and advocate for a return to testing. The FY2010 appropriation was $567.6 million, with a $615.7 million request for FY2011. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended the requested amount. Additionally, the Readiness Campaign focuses on improving manufacturing safety and efficiency, with a FY2010 appropriation of $100.0 million and a $112.1 million request for FY2011. The FY2010 current appropriation is $100.0 million, with a $112.1 million request for FY2011. The largest dollar increase is for Stockpile Readiness, with advances in manufacturing lithium parts and ensuring capability at the Savannah River Site. The largest dollar decrease is for Tritium Readiness due to the fixed-price contracting approach. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended reducing the Tritium Readiness component of the campaign from $50.2 million to $30.2 million for FY2011. Concerns were raised about technical challenges with tritium production at the Watts Bar reactor. The program funds infrastructure and operations at Complex sites, with a FY2011 request of $1,849.0 million. Operations of Facilities is the largest subprogram, with a FY2011 request of $1,258.0 million. The FY2011 budget request for NNSA includes funding for activities at multiple sites and programs, Material Recycle and Recovery, and Construction. Institutional Site Support funding decreased from $120.1 million in FY2010 to $41.0 million in the FY2011 request. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended increasing RTBF funds by $71.0 million above the request to address gaps at Pantex and Y-12 facilities. The committee increased funding for facilities to prevent layoffs and disruptions to schedules. They restored funding for the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center and expressed concern about NNSA's use of funds for a replacement facility for the Kansas City Plant. The most costly item in Construction is the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Facility Replacement (CMRR) at Los Alamos National Laboratory, which would replace the over 50-year-old Chemistry and Metallurgy Research (CMR) building. The House Appropriations Committee stated that proceeding with the CMRR project as currently designed will strongly prejudice research into plutonium and pit production at Los Alamos. The Senate and House Appropriations Committees expressed concerns about the CMRR project at Los Alamos National Laboratory, stating that it lacks a coherent mission and adequate safety measures. Delays in funding may force continued operations in the existing facility. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $125.0 million for the CMRR project at Los Alamos National Laboratory, despite concerns about its mission and safety measures. NNSA stated that the current capabilities at the CMR are restricted, while others argue that the existing Plutonium Facility 4 could fulfill some of the work. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding for various programs under Weapons Activities, including Secure Transportation Asset and Nuclear Counterterrorism Incident Response, with requested amounts for FY2011. The Facilities and Infrastructure Recapitalization Program (FIRP) focuses on restoring and revitalizing the physical infrastructure of the nuclear security enterprise by eliminating legacy deferred maintenance. The FY2010 appropriation was $93.9 million, with a $94.0 million request for FY2011. Site Stewardship aims to ensure environmental compliance and energy efficiency, with a FY2010 request of $90.4 million. The House Appropriations Committee supported the program but reduced funding to $62.4 million due to budget limitations. The Senate bill allocated $61.3 million and denied funding for the stewardship planning initiative. The FY2011 request for the stewardship planning initiative was $105.5 million, but the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended reducing it by $5.0 million. The Defense Nuclear Security element saw a reduction in funding due to efficiencies achieved through risk-informed decisions, with the Senate Appropriations Committee recommending $668.0 million for operations and maintenance, and reducing the requested amount for construction by $9.0 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended reducing the requested amount for construction by $9.0 million to $43.0 million for safeguards and security upgrades related to the CMRR project's nuclear facility. Cyber Security funding aims to ensure information technology and management security safeguards are in place to protect NNSA information assets. Nonproliferation and national security programs under the National Nuclear Security Administration support U.S. efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons worldwide. The National Nuclear Security Administration's funding for programs in FY2010 was $2.137 billion, up from $1.482 billion in FY2009. The increase was mainly due to returning major construction projects to the Fissile Materials Disposition program. The Nonproliferation and Verification R&D program received $317.3 million in FY2010 and requested $351.6 million for FY2011. Nonproliferation and International Security programs, including international safeguards and treaties, had a FY2011 request of $155.9 million, down from $187.2 million in FY2010. In FY2010, $187.2 million was appropriated for International Materials Protection, Control, and Accounting (MPC&A) to reduce the threat of unsecured Russian weapons. The Elimination of Weapons-Grade Plutonium Production program aimed to persuade Russia to shut down reactors producing weapons-grade plutonium, with two reactors already closed in 2008. The Fissile Materials Disposition program focused on disposing of U.S. surplus weapons plutonium by converting it into commercial fuel. The program focuses on disposing of U.S. surplus weapons plutonium by converting it into fuel for commercial power reactors. Funding for the program was controversial due to lack of progress on disposing of Russian plutonium. The Obama Administration requested $701.9 million for the program in FY2010 and $1,030.7 million in FY2011 to continue construction of the Savannah River project and dispose of Russian surplus weapon-grade plutonium. The FY2011 budget includes $1,030.7 million for the Savannah River project and $100 million for research on a gas-turbine modular helium reactor in Russia. The Global Threat Reduction Initiative aims to convert research reactors to use low-enriched uranium and protect nuclear materials. The Office of Environmental Management was established in 1989 for cleanup of nuclear weapons production facilities. The Office of Environmental Management oversees the cleanup of federal nuclear energy research laboratories and facilities involved in nuclear weapons production. Cleanup efforts are ongoing at larger, more complex facilities with high-level radioactive waste storage and severe contamination. As of FY2010, 18 facilities still require cleanup, with estimated costs to complete ranging between. The estimated costs to complete cleanup at remaining facilities could range between $192.8 billion and $247.2 billion. Additional funds may be needed for operating, maintaining cleanup remedies, and monitoring contaminant levels. Long-term activities for radioactive waste containment may need to be continued indefinitely. Some facilities under the Office of Environmental Management have been transferred to other offices or the Army Corps of Engineers. The cleanup of FUSRAP sites is funded within the civil works budget of the Corps. Once cleanup is complete, the Corps handles activities for the first two years, then jurisdiction is transferred back to DOE. The Department's Office of Legacy Management manages long-term operation, maintenance, and monitoring at FUSRAP sites and facilities cleaned up under the Office of Environmental Management. Funding for these offices is discussed in detail. The Defense Environmental Cleanup, Non-Defense Environmental Cleanup, and Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund received $5.69 billion in FY2011, a decrease from the President's request. The funding for the Office of Environmental Management primarily comes from the Defense Environmental Cleanup Account. Additionally, $22.7 million in unobligated balances of funds were rescinded in FY2011. In FY2011, P.L. 112-10 rescinded $22.7 million in unobligated balances from previous fiscal years for DOE's Office of Environmental Management. The funds were from the Defense Environmental Cleanup, Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund, and Non-Defense Environmental Cleanup accounts. Cleanup challenges exist at DOE's nuclear weapons production facilities like Hanford, Savannah River Site, and Idaho National Laboratory. These facilities have complex cleanup needs due to decades of nuclear weapons production. The Hanford, Savannah River Site, and Idaho National Laboratory have the greatest funding needs among DOE's Office of Environmental Management facilities. Cleanup at these sites may not be complete until 2062, 2040, and 2044 respectively due to the substantial volumes of high-level radioactive wastes stored there. Hanford has 54 million gallons of waste, Savannah River Site has 33 million gallons, and Idaho National Laboratory has nearly 1 million gallons. The Idaho National Laboratory has 1 million gallons of high-level wastes intended for permanent disposal in a geologic repository. However, challenges in waste removal and treatment have caused delays in construction of waste treatment facilities, raising concerns about environmental risks. Some tanks at Hanford have leaked wastes into groundwater discharging into the Columbia River, prompting routine water quality monitoring. There is also interest in funding sources for cleanup of uranium enrichment facilities under the Office of Environmental Management. The Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund was established by the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to clean up enrichment facilities in Paducah, KY; Portsmouth, OH; and Oak Ridge, TN. Funding comes from special assessments on nuclear utilities and federal government payments. The Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund was established to clean up enrichment facilities in Paducah, KY; Portsmouth, OH; and Oak Ridge, TN. The fund is funded by special assessments on nuclear utilities and federal government payments. Congress has continued federal payments to the fund through annual appropriations, but the issue of reauthorizing utility assessments and federal payments remains unresolved. The Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund has insufficient funds for future cleanup costs, with only $4.5 billion available compared to DOE's estimated $13.9 billion to $27.7 billion needs. The President proposed reinstating nuclear utility assessments to increase resources, with OMB estimating $200 million in assessments for FY2011 and $2.2 billion over a 10-year period. Congressional reauthorization is needed for the assessments to resume collection. In the 111th Congress, bills were introduced but not enacted to reauthorize nuclear utility assessments. The Senate Appropriations Committee questioned the need for reinstating assessments due to the existing balance of the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund. The President requested $730.5 million for cleanup in FY2011, assuming $200 million in offsetting receipts from nuclear utility assessments. P.L. 112-10 included $507.0 million in appropriations from the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund in FY2011, a decrease from the President's request. In FY2011, the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $550.0 million for the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund, noting the lack of legislation for $200 million in offsetting receipts. P.L. 112-10 allocated $33.6 million for the fund, significantly lower than the President's request of $496.7 million. The federal payment comes from the Defense Environmental Cleanup Account. The 1992 law requires DOE to pay for cleanup costs even if the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund is depleted, potentially necessitating additional federal funds in the future. Responsibility for long-term maintenance is transferred to DOE's Office of Legacy Management. The Office of Legacy Management manages pensions and benefits for former contractor personnel at nuclear sites. Funding for the office is within the Other Defense Activities Account, with potential increases needed for cleanup of nuclear facilities. The Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs) were established to sell power generated by dams operated by federal agencies. Priority for PMA power is given to \"preference customers\" such as municipal utilities and cooperatives, who receive power at the lowest possible rates. The PMAs are responsible for covering their costs. The PMAs are responsible for covering expenses and repaying debt and federal investment in generating facilities. The FY2011 budget request for PMAs was $118.5 million, a $4 million decrease from FY2010. Receipts from PMAs were reclassified from mandatory to discretionary, offsetting expenses for WAPA, SWPA, and SEPA. SWPA requested $12.7 million and WAPA requested $105.5 million in discretionary funding. SEPA's receipts are expected to cover operating costs in FY2011. Additionally, $220,000 was requested for Falcon and Amistad operations and maintenance, with $23 million in collections from Colorado River basins. The FY2011 budget proposed Bonneville accrue expenditures of $3.763 billion for operating expenses, $77 million for Projects Funded in Advance, $758 million for capital investments, and $387 million for capital. BPA is a self-funded agency under authority granted by P.L. 93-454, the Federal Columbia River Transmission System Act of 1974, and receives no appropriations. However, it funds some of its activities from permanent borrowing authority, which was increased in FY2003. ARRA further increased the amount of borrowing that BPA conducts under the Transmission System Act. The budget for Bonneville in FY2011 includes $758 million for capital investments and $387 million for capital transfers. ARRA provided $10 million in non-reimbursable appropriations to WAPA for activities authorized in section 402. WAPA now has borrowing authority from the Treasury up to $3.25 billion for new transmission lines to deliver renewable energy resources. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) requested $1.053 billion for FY2011, a decrease of $13.3 million from the previous year. The budget included $272.5 million for new reactor activities to handle new nuclear power plant license applications. No new commercial reactor construction applications had been submitted to NRC since the 1970s, but recent volatile fossil fuel prices have prompted renewed interest. Since the 1970s, there have been no new commercial reactor construction applications submitted to the NRC. However, volatile fossil fuel prices and incentives from the Energy Policy Act of 2005 led to a surge in license applications for 30 reactors since September 2007. The NRC's proposed FY2011 budget included funding for the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository, but the Obama Administration's decision to cancel the project has led to a request for funds to cover the costs of adjudicating the license withdrawal motion and closing Yucca Mountain licensing support activities. The NRC's FY2011 budget request included funding for regulation of operating reactors, with activities such as safety inspections, license renewals, and security oversight. Homeland security spending within the NRC is set to increase by $3.8 million in FY2011. The Policy Act of 2005 extended the requirement for 90% of NRC's budget to be offset by fees on licensees. Expenditures from the Nuclear Waste Fund for waste repository licensing and general homeland security are not subject to the offset. The FY2011 request would result in a net appropriation of $138.3 million, a decrease from FY2010. P.L. 112-10 provides for a net appropriation of $138.1 million, including the inspector general's office."
