The Congress finds that cellular and molecular processes can be utilized to develop new products, processes, and systems that benefit society, enhance national security, and boost the economy. Engineering biology requires a diverse set of skills and long-term research for breakthroughs, necessitating government investment. The Federal Government can support the advancement of engineering biology through the development of tools and technologies. A National Engineering Biology Initiative is crucial to advance research, technology goals, and ensure optimal returns on Federal investment. Other countries' investments in engineering biology pose a risk to the US's competitive lead in this field. The Act defines key terms such as \"Advisory Committee,\" \"biomanufacturing,\" \"engineering biology,\" \"Interagency Committee,\" and \"Program\" for the National Engineering Biology Research and Development Program. The National Engineering Biology Research and Development Program is established under SEC. 4. The President will implement a National Engineering Biology Research and Development Program to advance societal well-being, national security, and economic productivity. This program aims to advance research at the intersection of biological, physical, and information sciences, support social science research, expand the number of researchers with engineering biology training, accelerate commercialization of research by the private sector, and improve interagency coordination related to engineering biology. The Federal Government's National Engineering Biology Research and Development Program includes sustained support for research, education and training of students in interdisciplinary sciences and engineering. The National Engineering Biology Research and Development Program includes activities to track outputs and economic benefits, accelerate translation and commercialization of products, and support entrepreneurship education and startup companies. The National Engineering Biology Research and Development Program includes outreach to undergraduate and minority-serving institutions, research collaborations, and consideration of ethical, legal, environmental, and societal issues in program activities. The National Engineering Biology Research and Development Program includes addressing ethical, legal, environmental, and societal issues related to engineering biology, integrating research on these topics, ensuring wide dissemination of research results, and incorporating public input through mechanisms like citizen panels and consensus conferences. An interagency committee on engineering biology will be designated by the President. The interagency committee on engineering biology, including representatives from various agencies, will oversee the planning, management, and coordination of the National Engineering Biology Research and Development Program. They will coordinate federal research activities, establish goals and priorities, and ensure interagency collaboration. The National Engineering Biology Research and Development Program will establish goals and priorities, develop a strategic plan every 5 years, and support interdisciplinary research, education, outreach, and societal issues related to engineering biology. The National Engineering Biology Research and Development Program aims to move research results into practical applications for societal benefit and U.S. competitiveness. It will propose an interagency budget, utilize Federal programs like SBIR and STTR, and consider recommendations for achieving its goals. The Interagency Committee for the National Engineering Biology Research and Development Program will consider recommendations from various groups and prepare an annual report for Congress detailing the Program budget and spending for participating agencies. The annual report to Congress will include details on research facilities, instrumentation, implementation of the plan by Federal agencies, and the number of Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Technology Transfer awards supporting the Program. SEC. 5. ADVISORY COMMITTEE. The President shall designate an advisory committee on engineering biology research and development with at least 12 members from various sectors to assess the progress, balance of activities and funding, Program priorities, and ethical issues. The Advisory Committee on engineering biology research and development will report findings and recommendations every 3 years to address societal issues and improve the Program. The Federal Advisory Committee Act does not apply to this Committee. SEC. 6. EXTERNAL REVIEW OF ETHICAL, LEGAL, ENVIRONMENTAL, AND SOCIETAL ISSUES. The Director of the National Science Foundation will convene a workshop with the National Academies to review ethical, legal, environmental, and societal issues related to engineering biology research. The workshop aims to assess current research, identify gaps, and provide recommendations. A summary report will be transmitted to Congress within 2 years of the Act's enactment. The Senate will receive a summary report on the findings of a workshop convened to review ethical, legal, environmental, and societal issues related to engineering biology research. SEC. 7. AGENCY ACTIVITIES. The National Science Foundation supports basic research at the intersection of biological, physical, and information sciences, research on environmental and social effects of engineering biology, provides instrumentation support, and awards grants for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. The Department of Commerce establishes a bioscience research program as part of the Program. The bioscience research program aims to advance engineering biology and biomanufacturing through standard reference materials, user facility access, and technical expertise. The Department of Energy conducts basic research, development, and commercial application activities as part of the Program. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration conducts research in engineering biology fields, including synthetic biology, related to Earth and space sciences, aeronautics, space technology, and space exploration as part of the Program. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration conducts research in engineering biology fields related to Earth and space sciences, aeronautics, space technology, and space exploration. The Program also includes awarding grants for institutions to support graduate students and postdoctoral fellows conducting engineering biology research in an industry setting. The Environmental Protection Agency will support research on how engineering biology products, processes, and systems will impact the environment."
