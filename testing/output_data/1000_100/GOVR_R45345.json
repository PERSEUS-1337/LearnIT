Protection for IC whistleblowers is crucial to safeguard classified information and promote ethical work environments. Whistleblowing can lead to cost savings, ethical work environments, and prompt corrective actions. Whistleblower protections in the Intelligence Community (IC) only apply to lawful disclosures that adhere to reporting procedures for classified information. They do not cover leaks to the media or foreign governments, differences in policy or strategy, or adverse personnel decisions unrelated to protected disclosures. Procedures are defined by Congress and the executive branch to ensure security of classified information for IC whistleblowers. The Intelligence Community (IC) whistleblower protections focus on ensuring security for classified information and address whistleblower process and protections for IC contractors, Armed Forces members, and federal employees. There are concerns about transparency in IC internal processes and adequacy of protections for IC contractors. The Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act of 1998 established a process for IC whistleblowers but lacked specific protections. Subsequent legislation has aimed to address perceived gaps in whistleblower protections. The Intelligence Community whistleblower protections have evolved over the years to provide specific protections for IC whistleblowers, including provisions in the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010, Presidential Policy Directive (PPD)-19, and the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014. Additional protections are provided for members of the Armed Forces assigned to elements of the IC through 10 U.S.C. \u00a71034 and Department of Defense Directive 7050.06. Congress passed P.L. 115-118 in January 2018, amending the National Security Act of 1947 and the Intelligence Reform Act to further enhance whistleblower protections. The Intelligence Community whistleblower protections have evolved over the years to provide specific protections for IC whistleblowers. The Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act of 1998 addressed gaps in protections for IC contractors and excluded members of the Armed Forces assigned to an IC element. It amended previous acts to enable IC government employees or contractors to report complaints or information to the Inspector General of their agency. The ICWPA defines formal processes for submitting complaints to ensure protection of classified information. It requires the IG to report credible complaints to the CIA Director or head of the establishment, who must then report to congressional intelligence committees. If the IG fails to report accurately, employees or contractors can submit complaints directly to Congress after following certain procedures. The ICWPA outlines processes for whistleblowers to report complaints to Congress via the relevant IC agency IG, but lacks specific provisions for protecting whistleblowers from reprisal. The IAA for FY2010 included the first general provisions for whistleblower protection, establishing the Office of the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community. Section 405(a)(1) of the IAA added a new Section 103H to the National Security Act of 1947, allowing lawful disclosures to the IGIC. The Inspector General of the Intelligence Community is authorized to receive and investigate complaints or information regarding violations of laws, rules, mismanagement, waste of funds, abuse of authority, or dangers to public health and safety within the intelligence community. The identity of the employee making the complaint must be kept confidential unless unavoidable during the investigation or disclosed to the Department of Justice. No reprisal or threat of reprisal should be taken against the employee for reporting such complaints. The Inspector General of the Intelligence Community can investigate complaints about violations within the intelligence community. Employees can report complaints or information to the Inspector General without fear of reprisal, as long as the complaint is not knowingly false or made with willful disregard for the truth. Contractors and federal employees of IC elements are covered under this provision. PPD-19, signed by President Obama in 2012, provides protections for IC whistleblowers with access to classified information, safeguarding them from reprisals for lawful disclosures. It defines a protected disclosure as information reported to a supervisor or the Inspector General within the employee's chain of command. PPD-19, signed by President Obama in 2012, protects IC whistleblowers from reprisals for lawful disclosures. It allows employees to report violations or misconduct to designated officials without fear of retaliation, including actions that could affect their access to classified information or result in personnel actions. IC elements must have a process for employees to seek review of any reprisal actions taken against them. PPD-19, signed by President Obama in 2012, protects IC whistleblowers from reprisals for lawful disclosures, ensuring the security of classified information. The review process involves the IC element Inspector General determining if personnel actions were in reprisal for disclosures, with recommendations for corrective action. Agency heads must consider IG findings but are not required to accept recommendations. IC agencies must certify a review process allowing employees to appeal actions affecting access to classified information alleged to be retaliatory. PPD-19, signed by President Obama in 2012, protects IC whistleblowers from reprisals for lawful disclosures. It allows for external review by an IG panel chaired by the IGIC if the agency review process is exhausted. The panel's decision may lead to corrective action by the agency. The IGIC must report annually to congressional intelligence committees on determinations and recommendations. Training on whistleblower protections is required for employees with access to classified information. Title VI of the FY2014 IAA codified provisions of PPD-19, providing statutory protections for IC whistleblowers. Title VI of the FY2014 IAA protects IC whistleblowers from retaliation for lawful disclosures to specified entities, but does not specifically mention protections for contractors. A lawful disclosure is defined as a violation of federal law, rule, or regulation, mismanagement, or gross waste of funds. Section 602 of Title VI protects government employee whistleblowers from retaliatory revocation of security clearance for making lawful disclosures. It requires the development of appeal policies for whistleblower security clearance decisions. The provision allows whistleblowers to retain their employment status pending appeal, but does not permit judicial review or a private right of action. The section does not mention contractors and was first signed in 2014, with updates in 2016. ICD-120, Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection, signed in 2014 and updated in 2016, provides guidance for PPD-19. It includes protections against reprisal for IC employees making protected disclosures, allows appeals for security clearance decisions, and maintains employment status during pending decisions. The provision covers contractors and members of the Armed Forces. The provision for an employee alleging reprisal includes requesting an External Review Panel chaired by the IGIC after exhausting the internal agency review process. IC-wide communications and training on whistleblower protections are required. Section 1034 of Title 10 U.S. Code provides protections against retaliation for protected communications by Armed Forces members within IC elements. Unlike the ICWPA, Section 1034 allows communication with various entities but lacks a process for protecting classified information. The curr_chunk discusses the protection of Armed Forces members who make protected communications, specifying prohibited personnel actions in reprisal. It enables the DOD to mitigate hardship for members following alleged reprisals and requires the inspector general to provide updates to relevant parties. The DOD Inspector General is also required to establish uniform standards for investigations into allegations of prohibited actions. The curr_chunk discusses the need for uniform standards in investigating prohibited personnel actions and training for Inspectors General staff. It highlights inconsistencies in whistleblower protection for contractors in existing legislation, with recent efforts to address gaps in coverage. Senator McCaskill introduced two bills, S. 2002 and S. 794, to provide protections for IC employees and contractor employees on contracts with federal agencies. S. 2002 aimed to prevent discrimination against employees making protected disclosures, while S. 794 sought to extend whistleblower protections to contractor employees working with IC elements. The amendment to the Federal Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, P.L. 115-118, provides protections for IC contractor whistleblowers, allowing them to make lawful disclosures to specified authorities. These protections are similar to those for IC employees under Title VI of the IAA for FY2014, but previously did not include provisions for contractors. Section 110 provides protections for IC contractors who make lawful complaints against retaliatory personnel actions, including appointment, promotion/demotion, disciplinary actions, and more. These protections cover complaints related to violations of Federal laws, gross mismanagement, waste of funds, abuse of authority, or danger to public health or safety. Contractors of the FBI, including those in the Intelligence Branch, are also covered by these protections. Section 110 of Title 50, U.S. Code provides protections for IC contractors who make lawful whistleblower disclosures against retaliatory actions, including revocation of security clearances. H.Amdt. 894, 113th Congress, redirected $2 million to fund the IC Whistleblower and Source Protection Directorate within the OIGIC to enhance investigative capabilities for fraud, waste, and abuse. The measure addressed an underfunded capability to enable responsive follow-up on whistleblower complaints."
