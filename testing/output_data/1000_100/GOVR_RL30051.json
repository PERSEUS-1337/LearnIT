    "content": "The report discusses key base closure developments from the 105th to the 107th Congress, including the signing of legislation in December 2001 for a new base closure round in 2005. The closures and realignments from previous BRAC commissions have resulted in significant savings. The 1995 round of base closures was followed by a recognition of the need for more closures due to decreasing defense spending and force structure. Secretary of Defense William Cohen called for two more rounds in 1999 and 2001, emphasizing the need to downsize DOD's base structure to align with force reductions. The 1995 round of base closures led to a recognition of the need for further reductions in domestic infrastructure by 21%. Secretary of Defense Cohen emphasized the importance of closing more bases to achieve a proper balance between infrastructure and force structure, as well as to secure significant savings for future readiness and weapons acquisition programs. However, there was a lack of enthusiasm on Capitol Hill for new rounds of closures due to concerns about economic and political fallout in their districts. On June 12, 1997, the Senate Armed Services Committee narrowly failed to approve a proposal for two more rounds of base closing in 1999 and 2001. Senator Carl Levin and others pledged to push for more base closings to reduce excess infrastructure for new weapons funding. The full Senate later voted against the initiative, delaying new base closings until DOD developed accurate cost measurement techniques. Senator Byron Dorgan, Senator Trent Lott, and Senator Tom Daschle sponsored a provision requiring DOD to submit a cost/savings report to Congress in a timely manner for possible base closings in 2001. Representative Joel Hefley opposed new base closure rounds for at least five years, questioning DOD's savings estimates due to upfront closure costs. DOD officials claimed net savings, but the Congressional Budget Office could not confirm this in a December 1996 report. The Congressional Budget Office could not confirm the savings estimates for possible base closings in 2001. Despite opposition from Congressional opponents, senior DOD officials and the President pushed for new rounds of base closures to make funds available for priority weapons programs. Defense Secretary Cohen and Gen. John Shalikashvili called for more base closures in September 1997. The Defense Reform Initiative (DRI) announced by senior Pentagon officials included two rounds of base closures in 2001 and 2005, aiming for annual savings of $2.8 billion. This was part of a larger effort to save $6 billion annually through outsourcing, paperless contracting, and reducing personnel. Support for base closures came from the 1997 report \"Transforming Defense: National Security in the 21st Century.\" The DOD-sponsored National Defense Panel urged Congress and the Defense Department to quickly restore the base realignment and closure process, calling for closures to begin earlier than the current 2001-2005 proposal. Secretary of Defense Cohen emphasized the importance of additional BRAC rounds for financing and accelerating the transformation of U.S. military capabilities. President Clinton's actions regarding the closure of two Air Force maintenance depots were highly contentious. President Clinton faced opposition to his plan to transfer workloads from underutilized depots to save costs. He proposed privatization-in-place to prevent job losses in California and Texas, leading to accusations of political meddling. Legislators from Oklahoma, Georgia, and Utah opposed the privatization plan. Oklahoma, Georgia, and Utah opposed the privatization plan due to concerns about job loss and vulnerability of depots to closure. President Clinton's intervention in 1995 continued to fuel resentment among some Members until the end of his second term. Congressional opponents cited his actions as a reason for their opposition to new base closure rounds. Some Members tried to block DOD's plans to privatize maintenance work at McClellan and Kelly air force bases. The House and Senate committees approved a bill prohibiting privatization at depots unless certain conditions were met. Efforts to remove depot-related restrictions in the defense authorization bill were unsuccessful. Senator Inhofe tried to restore depot restrictions in the Senate bill but later withdrew. The House and Senate committees approved a bill prohibiting privatization at depots unless certain conditions were met. Efforts to remove depot-related restrictions in the defense authorization bill were unsuccessful. Senator Inhofe tried to restore depot restrictions in the Senate bill but later withdrew. In conference committee, the depot-related language in the House bill became a major obstacle to reaching final agreement on the FY1998 defense authorization bill. A compromise was reached, increasing the limit on depot work by private contractors from 40% to 50%. The House and Senate committees approved a bill prohibiting privatization at depots unless certain conditions were met. Efforts to remove depot-related restrictions in the defense authorization bill were unsuccessful. A compromise was reached, increasing the limit on depot work by private contractors from 40% to 50%. The House passed the conference report by a vote of 286 to 123, and the Senate later passed it by a vote of 90 to 10. President Clinton signed the bill into law on November 18 (P.L. 105-85), which included language prohibiting DOD from planning and implementing new base operations. The Dorgan Amendment prohibited the Department of Defense from planning new base closures until a report on costs and savings was submitted. The report was delivered ahead of the deadline in April 1998. Secretary of Defense Cohen emphasized the need for new base closure legislation, stating that the current base structure was 23% in excess. The Secretary of Defense highlighted the imbalance between force and base structures, with significant reductions in military personnel compared to base infrastructure. The base closure report indicated that costs were lower than estimated for previous rounds, emphasizing the need for new legislation to address excess base capacity. The base closure report projected significant savings from shutting down bases during BRAC's 1988-1995 rounds, with estimated net total savings of $14 billion through 2001 and annual savings of $5.6 billion thereafter. The Department of Defense and General Accounting Office later revised these figures upward. Additional savings of $3 billion a year were expected from the 2001 and 2005 closure rounds. The report recommended applying the model of previous base closure commissions for these rounds. The controversy over base closures escalated with a memo citing White House involvement in encouraging Lockheed Martin to keep maintenance work at McClellan Air Force Base. Members opposed new closures, using strong language like \"dead on arrival\" and \"smoking gun.\" Reaction on Capitol Hill to the April 2, 1998 report's call for two new base closure rounds was met with strong resistance. The House National Security Committee and the Senate Armed Services Committee were divided on the issue, with the Senate committee defeating a proposed new round of base closures in 2001. Senators McCain and Levin considered seeking support for a floor amendment during Senate consideration of the FY1999 defense authorization bill, but ultimately abandoned their efforts due to majority opposition. The Senators abandoned their initiative to restrict the Pentagon from closing bases with a certain number of civilian personnel. Amendment No. 2981 aimed to delay or block the Department of Defense from quickly moving to close bases. The Inhofe amendment aimed to delay or block the Department of Defense from closing bases by reducing civilian employees to less than 225. It also opposed new closure rounds until previous actions were completed. The Congressional Budget Office reviewed DOD's base realignment and closure report, finding savings estimates consistent with Congress's requests. The Congressional Budget Office reviewed DOD's report on base closure savings, noting that future closure rounds could result in significant savings. However, DOD provided limited analysis on potential closures and their impact on local communities. The General Accounting Office reviewed DOD's report on BRAC costs and savings, giving DOD good grades overall. GAO emphasized that the report provided a rough approximation of costs and savings, noting that DOD's data systems do not capture all savings associated with BRAC actions. The GAO found that DOD's data systems do not capture all savings from BRAC actions. DOD's analysis shows no long-term issues affecting military capabilities due to BRAC. Communities affected by prior BRAC actions are rebounding economically. DOD's proposal for additional BRAC rounds in 2001 and 2005 is similar to past rounds. The legislative proposal for two more BRAC rounds is a good starting point for future legislation. The 106th Congress debated authorizing new rounds of base closings. Senator John McCain sponsored a bill for two new rounds in 2001 and 2003, citing excess infrastructure capacity in the DOD. He emphasized the potential savings from closing and realigning bases. The bill proposed significant changes to the BRAC selection process. The 106th Congress debated authorizing new rounds of base closings in 2001 and 2003, with changes to the BRAC selection process. Secretary of Defense William Cohen emphasized the importance of base closures for improving efficiency and saving money. The 106th Congress debated authorizing new rounds of base closings in 2001 and 2003 to save money and improve efficiency. Despite appeals for closures, many Members of Congress opposed new rounds due to constituent fears. The Senate Armed Services Committee rejected authorizing new closings during the FY2000 defense authorization bill mark-up. During the 106th Congress, Senators McCain and Levin made a failed attempt to revive their base closure initiative, which had been blocked for the third year in a row. Despite DOD's efforts to gain support for shutting down more bases, opposition remained strong. The Administration's FY2000 DOD budget proposed closing bases in 2003 and 2005, citing the strong national economy as an opportune time. Secretary of Defense Cohen emphasized the need to improve the base closing process to win Congress's support. The base closing process needed improvement due to bureaucratic obstacles in transitioning to private use. Failure to close more bases could cost the Pentagon $20 billion better spent on upgrading weapon systems and enhancing U.S. fighting forces. Despite efforts by Senators McCain and Levin, Congress did not authorize new closure rounds in 2000. An amendment for two new rounds in 2003 and 2005 was rejected in a Senate vote of 63 to 35. Politics were pledged not to interfere in future base closure decisions. In the early stages of the 107th Congress, Senators Levin and McCain introduced a bill to authorize new rounds of base closures in 2003 and 2005. The Taxpayers for Common Sense supported the initiative, estimating potential savings of up to $21 billion by closing excess military bases. Senator Hutchison expressed a different viewpoint in an editorial article. Senator Hutchison expressed a different viewpoint in an Austin TX editorial article, highlighting increasing restrictions on U.S. military training abroad and questioning the wisdom of closing more domestic military bases prematurely. The Department of Defense urged Congress to approve another round of base closures due to excess capacity, with a proposal for a single round of base closings and consolidations starting in 2003. The Department of Defense proposed a new initiative in 2001 to reduce excess infrastructure by closing and consolidating military bases. The Senate Armed Services Committee approved a new round of base closures in September 2001. In September 2001, the Senate approved a new round of base closures and realignments in 2003, despite opposition citing the current war on terrorism and economic uncertainty. General Shelton and Secretary Rumsfeld emphasized the need to convert excess infrastructure into war-fighting ability. The Senate approved a new round of base closures in 2003 despite opposition due to the war on terrorism and economic uncertainty. Senator John McCain emphasized trust in military leadership, while Representative James Hansen opposed the provision in the House. In a stalemate over base closures, Senator John McCain warned of a potential veto by the President if no compromise was reached. Eventually, senior negotiators agreed to a compromise on December 10, 2001, and the defense authorization bill was signed into law on December 28, 2001. The bill retained most of the 1990 BRAC Act language with some important changes and modifications. The 2005 Secretary of Defense Authorization Act requires submission of force structure plans, review of military installations, certification of need for closure and realignment, and prioritization of military value in decision-making. The 2005 Secretary of Defense Authorization Act requires prioritization of military value in recommendations for closing or realigning military installations. The Act also increases the number of members on the commission to 9 and allows the Secretary of Defense to testify on proposed base additions. Privatization-in-place of closed or realigned bases is prohibited unless recommended by the commission. Additional closure rounds were proposed in 1999 and 2001 to reduce excess infrastructure. In 2001, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld won approval from Congress for a new round of Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) in 2005. Communities near military bases are concerned about the survival of their installations and are developing defensive and offensive strategies to keep their military units at home or acquire units from other parts of the country. Range encroachment is a growing concern for many communities. The impact of \"range encroachment\" near military bases is a growing concern as urban growth, competition for air space, and protection of endangered species may de-value installations, making them potential candidates for closure in 2005. The BRAC timeline outlines the process for closure, including criteria publication, nomination deadlines, and congressional approval."
