The \"Catastrophic Wildfire Prevention Act of 2012\" aims to expedite wildfire prevention projects on Federal lands to reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfires, protect endangered species, and provide efficiency tools for project streamlining. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines \"at-risk community\" and \"at-risk forest\" as areas with a high risk of wildfire impacting key ecosystems, wildlife, or habitats on Federal lands. The term \"authorized wildfire prevention project\" refers to measures developed for hazardous fuels reduction, forest health, restoration, watershed restoration, or habitat protection on at-risk forests or threatened species habitat. It may include grazing and timber projects. Federal land is defined as covered land under the Act. The term \"Federal land\" includes land of the National Forest System and public lands. It excludes land where vegetation removal is prohibited by Federal law, except in certain designated areas. The term \"Secretary concerned\" refers to the Secretary of Agriculture. The term \"threatened and endangered species habitat\" refers to Federal land where natural fire regimes are important for endangered species or where wildfire poses a threat to them, as identified in species recovery plans or Federal Register notices. The curr_chunk discusses the process of determining the status of a species as endangered or threatened, as well as designating critical habitat for them. SEC. 4. AUTHORIZED WILDFIRE PREVENTION PROJECTS. The Secretary must implement wildfire prevention projects in at-risk forests and endangered species habitats, focusing on reducing surface, ladder, and canopy fuels. Projects on endangered species habitats aim to enhance protection from wildfires and comply with guidelines. In authorized wildfire prevention projects, timber harvesting, thinning, and domestic livestock grazing may be used to reduce fuel loads and prevent wildfires. Grazing standards are waived for these projects, and in at-risk forests, the goal is to improve land condition towards class I. The section discusses the prevention of wildfires by managing ladder and canopy fuel loads. It states that conducting wildfire prevention projects does not require revisions to land management plans. Additionally, it mentions the consideration of public petitions for designating federal land as at-risk forest or endangered species habitat. SEC. 5. PUBLIC REVIEW AND ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS. The Secretary must publish a notice of proposed wildfire prevention projects in the Federal Register for public comment. Specific written comments related to the project can be submitted within 30 days. Within 60 days of the notice, the final project will be designated after considering received comments, and a notice of the final project will be published. Only those who commented on the proposed project can submit additional comments. The Secretary must comply with environmental laws for wildfire prevention projects, including the National Environmental Policy Act and Endangered Species Act. Special rules apply to certain projects. Special rules apply to certain wildfire prevention projects involving timber harvesting or grazing. The Secretary must prepare an environmental assessment within 30 days of notice publication. Failure to meet the deadline deems the project compliant with the National Environmental Policy Act. Livestock grazing projects have specific project length requirements. Compliance with the environmental assessment requirements for timber harvest projects is deemed sufficient for a minimum of 20 years. The Secretary is not obligated to consider alternatives in the assessment. Compliance with these requirements satisfies various environmental laws. SEC. 6. ADMINISTRATIVE AND JUDICIAL REVIEW.\n\nAdministrative review of authorized wildfire prevention projects follows the special process under the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003. Judicial review is conducted according to the Act as well.\n\nSEC. 7. THREATENED AND ENDANGERED SPECIES DESIGNATIONS.\n\nBefore listing species under the Endangered Species Act, the Secretary must assess the impact on forest fuel loads and include wildfire risk analysis in recovery plans and habitat determinations."
