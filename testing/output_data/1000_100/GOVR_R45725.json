It protects U.S. shipyards and sailors but is debated for raising costs and limiting ship availability. Recent issues include Puerto Rico's economic challenges, the El Faro ship sinking, and domestic oil transportation debates. The Jones Act of 1920 requires U.S.-built, owned, and crewed vessels for domestic cargo transport. It has been debated for its impact on costs and ship availability. Recent issues include Puerto Rico's economic challenges, the El Faro ship sinking, and domestic oil transportation debates. The law's effectiveness in achieving national security goals has also been questioned, with discussions on increasing efficiency and reducing regulatory burdens in the maritime sector. The Jones Act, enacted in 1920, requires U.S.-built, owned, and crewed vessels for domestic cargo transport. Laws favoring U.S.-flag fleets over foreign fleets date back to the early days of the United States, with regulations on vessel ownership and transportation enacted as early as 1789. The country initially had a shipbuilding advantage due to ample timber supplies, but lost it as wooden ships were replaced by iron. In the late 1800s, the advantage in U.S. foreign trade shifted to Scotland and England as wooden sailing ships were replaced by iron steamships. Congress debated the decline in U.S. vessel trade share and the rise of competition from railroads in coastal shipping. The \"free ship\" movement proposed allowing foreign-built vessels under the U.S. flag, but opponents argued that higher U.S. crew costs would hinder trade resurgence. In 1912, Congress enacted a measure allowing foreign-built vessels for U.S.-flag international service. Since 1912, the domestic build requirement has mainly applied to vessels on domestic voyages. In response to shippers' attempts to avoid high-cost U.S. vessels, Congress tightened the language concerning coastwise transport. For example, in 1891, a shipper loaded merchandise on a foreign-flag ship bound for Antwerp, Belgium, then transferred to another foreign-flag ship bound for Los Angeles to save on freight charges. In 1893 and 1898, Congress amended the coastwise law to prevent shippers from routing cargo through foreign ports to avoid coastwise laws. Despite this, U.S. shippers continued to use foreign-flag vessels in the Alaska trade by moving cargo between the United States and Vancouver, Canada, by rail. In 1920, the Merchant Marine Act required Alaska-bound cargo to move through the Port of Seattle, amending the coastwise language to cover shipments \"by land and water\" between \"U.S. points.\" These amendments are still in effect today. The Jones Act, passed in response to the debate over the cost of building ships in the United States versus foreign countries, aimed to support the American merchant marine by banning foreign-built ships. The act was influenced by a minority report expressing the view that allowing American merchants to acquire ships at the lowest possible price, whether built domestically or abroad, was essential for competing in global commerce. The Jones Act aimed to support the American merchant marine by banning foreign-built ships, in response to the debate over the cost of building ships in the United States versus foreign countries. The act emphasized the importance of allowing American merchants to acquire ships at the lowest possible price to compete in global commerce. A 1922 government report showed that U.S.-built ships cost 20% more than foreign-built ones, increasing to 50% in the 1930s. The cost differential between U.S. shipyard prices and foreign yards increased over the years, with U.S.-built vessels costing significantly more. This price gap has led to challenges for Department of Defense officials in acquiring military sealift ships, prompting them to opt for more affordable used foreign-built cargo ships instead. U.S. shipyards do not compete on price or vessel characteristics with foreign yards due to the high cost of domestic shipbuilding. The cost differential between U.S. shipyard prices and foreign yards has increased, with U.S. crewing costs being a significant factor. U.S.-flag ships have an estimated operating cost differential of over $6 million per ship per year compared to foreign-flag ships, including crewing, insurance, and maintenance costs. The Merchant Marine Act of 1920 addressed surplus government cargo ships from World War I and outlined enduring maritime policy goals. The Merchant Marine Act of 1920, outlined enduring maritime policy goals to ensure the United States has a merchant marine capable of supporting national defense and commerce. This reflected the country's emerging power status at the time, especially during World War I when European nations faced ship shortages due to war efforts. The Jones Act of 1920 emphasized the need for the United States to have its own merchant marine to avoid dependency on other nations' vessels. It applies to domestic waterborne shipments, requiring U.S. citizen crewing and ownership for Jones Act ships. Some U.S. territories are exempt from the Jones Act, allowing foreign-flag ships to transport cargo between these islands and other U.S. points. The Jones Act of 1920 requires U.S. citizen crewing and ownership for domestic waterborne shipments. Some U.S. territories are exempt, allowing foreign-flag ships to transport cargo between these islands and other U.S. points. The Coast Guard enforces U.S.-build, ownership, and crewing requirements for vessels, while Customs and Border Protection determines what falls under the act. The Jones Act of 1920 mandates U.S. citizen crewing and ownership for domestic waterborne shipments. The Act requires the use of \"U.S.-built\" vessels, defined by the Coast Guard as having major components fabricated in the U.S. and assembled in the U.S. This includes the hull, superstructure, and propulsion machinery. For oceangoing ships, U.S. shipyards can import engines from foreign manufacturers as they are considered components attached to the hull, not integral parts. Components that are self-supporting and do not compromise the vessel's integrity can be manufactured abroad but must be attached in a U.S. shipyard. The Coast Guard allows up to 1.5% of the steel weight of hull and superstructure components to be manufactured abroad. The Coast Guard permits certain foreign-built components in the construction of vessels as long as they do not exceed the steel weight limit. Shipyards seek confirmation from the Coast Guard through determination letters detailing the extent of permissible foreign components. Congress directed the Coast Guard in the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2018 to address this issue. In the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2018, Congress directed the Coast Guard to publish determination letters regarding the use of foreign-built components in ship construction. Shipyard unions, known as \"kit ships,\" sued the Coast Guard in 2007 over this issue, but the court ruled in favor of the Coast Guard citing historical interpretations dating back to the late 1800s. The lawsuit stemmed from a partnership between a Philadelphia shipyard and a South Korean shipbuilder to build Jones Act tankers using the Korean builder's designs and services. Since 2006, General Dynamics NASSCO of San Diego has partnered with Daewoo Shipbuilding of South Korea to procure vessel designs and materials for Jones Act ships. The use of foreign components in shipbuilding has been a point of contention, with shipyards arguing that it could reduce costs and benefit the domestic fleet. The United States is the largest cruise ship market, but most Americans board foreign-flag cruise ships due to CBP regulations. Most Americans board foreign-flag cruise ships at U.S. ports because CBP regulations allow non-Jones Act compliant ships that have visited distant foreign ports. This regulatory interpretation dates back to a 1910 Attorney General's opinion and a 1985 rulemaking by the U.S. Customs Service. Passengers on cruise ships departing from a U.S. port can visit other U.S. ports if they also stop at a nearby foreign port. The Jones Act is not violated if the main purpose of the voyage is not domestic transportation. \"Voyages to nowhere\" involve no other port visits, staying within 3-mile U.S. territorial waters to comply with the Jones Act. CBP requires vessels within 3 miles of U.S. waters to be Jones Act-compliant. If vessels go beyond 3 miles into international waters, they do not need to comply. However, charter fishing boats must still be Jones Act-compliant even in international waters. CBP's definition of a passenger on passenger vessels is also a key aspect of Jones Act compliance. The Jones Act defines a passenger as anyone aboard a vessel who is not a crew member or owner. This includes individuals on tour boats, yachts, or construction workers being transported to a site. CBP's interpretations also impact lightering and offshore supply vessels within 3 nautical miles of U.S. territorial waters. Within U.S. territorial waters, lightering vessels can be foreign-flagged if they are 60 to 80 miles offshore. Lightering operations within the 3-mile zone require Jones Act-compliant vessels. Offshore supply vessels servicing oil rigs must also be Jones Act-compliant within the 200-mile zone for offshore natural resource activities. Only oil rigs attached to the seabed are considered \"U.S. points\" within this zone. In 2008, Congress required that OSVs servicing MODUs be U.S.-owned and -crewed, but need not be U.S.-built. CBP determines if OSVs must be Jones Act-compliant based on whether they transport supplies or workers to the oil rig or are involved in installing equipment for rig operation. Vessels laying cable or pipeline in U.S. waters do not need to be Jones Act-compliant. While OSVs transporting supplies and rig workers must be Jones Act-compliant, vessels involved in installing rig equipment or conducting surveys can be foreign-flagged. The application of the Jones Act to offshore wind farms beyond 3 miles from shore is unclear, with wind farm developers guided by CBP's interpretations. The Department of Energy has highlighted the challenge of nonavailability of Jones Act-compliant Tower Installation Vessels (TIVs) for offshore wind farm development, especially in deeper waters. U.S. wind developers either import equipment or use Jones Act-compliant vessels alongside non-Jones Act-compliant TIVs for installation. CBP's interpretation of the Jones Act has influenced coastal maritime activities, including the transformation of merchandise at intermediate foreign ports. The Jones Act does not apply to vessels transporting products that have been transformed into a new product at an intermediate foreign port. This exemption is based on a 1964 Customs Service ruling involving California rice being processed in the U.S. Foreign-flag tankers can transport these products, even if a portion of the cargo is between two U.S. points. In 1935, Congress prohibited Jones Act-qualified vessels from being sold to foreign owners or registered under a foreign-flag, ensuring they could never be used in U.S. domestic trade again. This provision protects Jones Act carriers from competition if coastal shipping demand increases, as it takes two years to build a new ship. Additionally, in 1940, Congress expanded the Jones Act to cover towing vessels like river tugs and salvage vessels. In 1988, Congress specified that waterborne transport of valueless material requires use of a Jones Act-qualified vessel. Congress has enacted exemptions to the Jones Act, waiving restrictions when no Jones Act-qualified operator is available. For instance, in 1984, Congress exempted passenger travel between Puerto Rico and any other U.S. port if no Jones Act-qualified operator could provide comparable service. Congress has enacted exemptions to the Jones Act, allowing foreign-flag cruise ships and LNG tankers to provide domestic service. Exemptions have also been granted for iron ore and grain transport during times of high demand, as well as for oil spill cleanup operations when Jones Act-qualified vessels are insufficient. An insufficient number of Jones Act-qualified vessels are available. Congress has enacted waivers for two vessel designs used in foreign trade with domestic legs that would fall under the Jones Act. One exemption was for a ship designed for international voyages carrying river barges (LASH technology). Another exemption allowed the movement of empty containers between U.S. ports for international shipments. The Jones Act requires U.S.-built, -crewed, and -owned ships for transshipment of loaded international containers. This practice is common abroad but not in the United States, leading to increased demand for rail and road connections to ports. Congress has authorized exemptions to the Jones Act for specific vessels. Since 1989, Congress has granted Jones Act waivers to at least 133 specific vessels in 16 separate legislative acts. These waivers are typically found in maritime-related legislation and often involve vessels that are not commercially significant, such as small cargo or passenger vessels owned by nonprofit entities. In 2011, waivers were granted to three LNG tankers built in the US in the late 1970s that became foreign-registered due to technicalities in meeting Jones Act requirements. Domestic shipping restrictions were waived during World War I, World War II, and the Korean War for national defense reasons. In 1991 and 2011, waivers were granted on national defense grounds to expedite oil shipments from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in response to the Persian Gulf War and a conflict in Libya. The executive branch has also waived the Jones Act for fuel resupply after natural disasters, such as Hurricanes Katrina, Harvey, Irma, and Maria. MARAD checks for the availability of Jones Act-qualified vessels before granting certain waivers, and national defense waivers have been prompted by the lack of heavy-lift vessels in the Jones Act fleet. The CBP has denied Jones Act waivers for specific heavy-lift vessels used in offshore oil rig construction, despite safety concerns raised by the Coast Guard and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement. Waivers have been granted on national defense grounds for various reasons, including expedited oil shipments during conflicts and natural disasters. MARAD checks for Jones Act-qualified vessels before granting waivers, with national defense waivers being prompted by a lack of heavy-lift vessels in the Jones Act fleet. In instances where national defense waivers have been issued, they have been based on high standards and not for economic reasons. While waivers have been granted for fuel shortages, they have not been given to prioritize domestic supply lines over offshore ones. Members of Congress once sought to extend the Jones Act to the U.S. Virgin Islands due to vulnerability concerns, and in 2014, northeast refineries considered a waiver to ship crude oil from Texas. In 2018, the United States exported between 40-80 million barrels of crude oil per month on foreign-flag tankers, imported about 150 million barrels per month from overseas sources, and shipped about 15 million barrels per month domestically on Jones Act tankers. The U.S. has begun exporting LNG by ship while still importing it, with no domestic shipments. Puerto Rico seeks a Jones Act waiver to receive LNG from the mainland. The Jones Act covers various types of ships, including oceangoing ships and offshore supply vessels. As of March 2018, there were 99 oceangoing ships in the Jones Act-compliant fleet, with the largest category being tankers. Of the 57 tankers in the fleet, 11 carry Alaskan crude oil to the West Coast, 44 carry refined products along the Atlantic Coast, and 2 are chemical or asphalt tankers. The dry cargo fleet includes 24 small to medium-sized container ships and 7 ships with ramps for carrying. The Jones Act fleet consists of various types of ships, including container ships, roll on/roll off vessels, and dry bulk vessels. The fleet has decreased in size since 1950, with a significant drop in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The U.S. merchant marine was described as \"too small, too old, and too unproductive\" in a 1967 congressional hearing. The Lyndon B. Johnson Administration called for the repeal of the Jones Act, stating that flooding the industry with Federal dollars and protection is not the way to revitalize it. Domestic ships have lost market share to railroads and pipelines despite their economic advantages. Ocean carriers can move more cargo per trip and per gallon of fuel than land modes, offering lower costs for shippers willing to sacrifice transit time for reliable delivery schedules. The Jones Act fleet is mainly involved in domestic trade. The Jones Act fleet operates in markets where shippers have few alternatives, serving Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. Despite aiming to sustain a growing merchant marine, it has not met the policy goals of providing shipping service on essential routes and having the safest vessels. The Jones Act fleet does not meet policy goals of providing essential shipping service and having the safest vessels. Certain ship designs, like \"project cargo\" vessels, are not represented in the fleet, hindering the transportation of oversized equipment. The Department of Defense has used waivers to move specialized cargo on foreign-flag vessels due to the lack of suitable vessels in the Jones Act fleet. The Jones Act fleet faces challenges in competing internationally due to higher costs and aging ships. There is a lack of modern vessels, including LNG tankers, despite new domestic markets. The fleet's limited capacity for moving shale oil production coastwise contributed to pressure for lifting the crude oil export ban in 2015. In response to high costs, a unique vessel design called an articulated tug has been developed in the U.S. market. The U.S. market has developed a unique vessel design called an articulated tug barge (ATB), with over 150 ATBs operating in the Jones Act trades. ATBs are more capable than flatwater barges in handling sea swells but less reliable and efficient over longer voyages compared to tanker ships. They pose a higher risk of grounding and provide less time to prevent spilled oil from reaching shorelines. ATBs now carry more cargo, predominantly oil, on coastal voyages than the tanker fleet. The El Faro, a Jones Act cargo ship that sank in a 2015 hurricane, had open lifeboats due to its 1975 build date. The Coast Guard expressed concerns about the condition of the U.S.-flag fleet, noting that many ships are in substandard condition and older, making them more prone to breakdowns. The Jones Act fleet is relatively young due to recent shipbuilding efforts to comply with emissions requirements. Just over one-third of oceangoing fleet is 21 years old or older, down from two-thirds in 2007. The Great Lakes fleet, consisting of 33 dry bulk ships, is considerably older. The Great Lakes fleet consists of 33 dry bulk ships carrying iron ore, limestone, and coal for steelmaking and cement. The U.S. fleet includes 1,000-foot freighters built between 1972 and 1981, while the second-largest class of ships, around 700 feet long, is older, with some vessels dating back to the 1940s or 1950s. Ships on the Great Lakes have longer lifespans than oceangoing vessels, and Jones Act-compliant ships are narrower due to the Soo Locks in Michigan. Domestic tonnage on the Great Lakes has decreased since the 1950s. The Canadian Great Lakes fleet saw a decline in new ship additions due to a 25% import tariff on ships. After the tariff was repealed in 2010, over 35 new dry bulk ships were constructed in other countries for service on the Great Lakes. The fleet on the nation's inland rivers consists of thousands of tugs, dry cargo barges, and tank barges carrying mostly bulk commodities. Since 1990, overall tonnage on the system has been flat or declining slightly, with a leading barge manufacturer ceasing operation in 2018 due to decreased demand for coal deliveries. The Dredging Act of 1906 requires U.S.-built, -operated, and -crewed vessels for dredging in U.S. waters. Congress amended the Jones Act in 1988 to include valueless material as \"merchandise,\" necessitating Jones Act-qualified vessels for transporting dredge spoil. The ban on foreign-built dredgers and operators in U.S. waters significantly increases the cost of dredging U.S. harbors. Despite increased federal spending on navigation dredging, there has not been a corresponding increase in the volume of material dredged. Factors contributing to cost increases include a limited supply of dredging vessels, rising fuel and material costs, labor expenses, and stricter environmental regulations. The U.S. privately owned fleet is older and smaller compared to leading European dredging firms, which have more advanced equipment and larger fleets. The European firms have a larger and more advanced fleet of hopper dredges compared to the U.S. fleet. The U.S. privately owned hopper dredge fleet is older, with over three-quarters of the vessels being over 20 years old. When the Army Corps bids harbor work requiring a hopper dredge, one of the four U.S. firms is the sole bidder over a third of the time. Dredging projects in the U.S. market can incur high costs due to mobilization and demobilization of equipment, which can amount to more than one-third of total project costs. Foreign firms use heavy-lift vessels to transport their dredge fleets to the next project. The offshore supply vessel fleet in the Gulf of Mexico consists of about 1,800 vessels, with annual construction averaging 32 vessels over the last decade. Foreign-built vessels are used for rig construction in deeper waters due to the lack of similar vessels in the Jones Act fleet. These vessels require dynamic positioning propulsion systems for stability. The Jones Act fleet also lacks vessels for installing wind towers in deep waters. The Jones Act ships' crews are seen as potential support for military sealift in times of war or national emergency. Congress has enacted programs to designate other fleets for sealift support, but the shrinking U.S. mariner pool raises concerns about crewing a reserve sealift fleet. In 2014, Congress directed the Department of Transportation and Defense to develop a national sealift strategy, which is still pending. Jones Act mariners, with six months of shore leave per year, could be called upon to crew a reserve fleet. The Jones Act crew of oceangoing ships, totaling 3,380 merchant mariners, could crew a reserve fleet for military sealift purposes. This would be in addition to mariners from the U.S.-flag privately owned international fleet and the Military Sealift Command fleet. MARAD estimates there is a sufficient mariner pool to crew the reserve sealift fleet for up to 180 days. MARAD estimates a shortfall of about 1,800 mariners for a prolonged sealift effort lasting up to 180 days. The mariner pool is barely sufficient for an immediate surge but insufficient for a longer sealift effort, a consistent finding for decades. This was also the case in 2004 and 1991 when the mariner pool was larger. The Jones Act's maritime policy indicates a desire for a commercial crew to support military sealift purposes. The Jones Act's maritime policy aims for a commercial fleet that can provide sealift in times of war. Three other fleets for military sealift purposes are the RRF, MSC, and MSP, consisting of predominantly foreign-built ships. The RRF has 46 ships on standby with a skeleton crew of 600 mariners, needing an additional 1,200 mariners when activated. MSC fleet, controlled by TRANSCOM, has about 50 ships carrying military cargoes. MSP ships, established in 1996, receive an operating subsidy. The military sealift fleet, established in 1996, receives an operating subsidy of about $5 million per vessel per year. They heavily rely on government cargoes reserved for them by law. While Jones Act operators must purchase costly U.S.-built ships, the sealift fleet is mostly composed of more economical foreign-built ships. There is a suggestion to require the sealift fleet to be built domestically to provide oceangoing shipbuilding capability. The sealift fleet may need to be built domestically, with the higher cost shared nationally. Lower-cost coastwise ships could compete with other transportation methods, increasing the mariner pool and repair work for U.S. shipyards. The military seeks cargo ships with flexible capabilities, such as ramps or onboard cranes, to handle various cargo types and sizes. The military's sealift fleet consists of versatile product tankers, Ro/Ro ships with ramps for moving tanks and trucks, and container ships for ammunition and supplies. Commercial fleets prefer specialized and larger ships for cost efficiency, replacing general cargo ships with container ships lacking onboard cranes. This shift may pose challenges for commercial mariners in foreign ports without shore-based cranes. The largest container ships require deep water ports, limiting accessibility. The military's ideal vessel designs differ from those of commercial carriers due to cost pressures and regulations. Commercial carriers prioritize fuel efficiency and use engines that operate at lower speeds, limiting military sealift capabilities. Crew skill sets and engine licensing also contribute to the growing disparity between the two sectors. The Jones Act contributes to military sealift by preserving shipyard industrial base for building and repairing ships. U.S. shipyards face challenges due to limited orders and lack of economies of scale, with some struggling to maintain employment and orders. The Navy heavily relies on shipyards for orders, with a focus on building smaller vessels like tour boats, ferries, and tugs. However, shipyards lack the capacity to repair large ships, leading to delays in the readiness of the government-owned sealift fleet. Many vessels in the fleet are in need of repair, with some failing safety inspections and being deemed unseaworthy. The Navy's plan to recapitalize the reserve fleet includes building new vessels in domestic shipyards, repairing ships to extend their service life, and purchasing used foreign-built ships due to cost and time constraints. The Tariff Act of 1930 imposes a 50% duty on nonemergency repairs on U.S. flag ships done in foreign shipyards, but many U.S.-flag international trading ships opt for foreign repairs despite the duty. Ships undergo repairs in foreign yards as the total cost, even with a 50% duty, is lower than in domestic shipyards. A U.S.-flag operator confirms this is still true in 2018."
