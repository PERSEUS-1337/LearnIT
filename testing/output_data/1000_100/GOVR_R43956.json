Administered by the Civil Division of the Department of Justice, over 30,000 claims totaling nearly $2 billion have been approved, with the majority related to atomic weapons testing. The Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) provides one-time cash benefits to individuals exposed to ionizing radiation from atomic weapons testing or uranium industry work between 1942 and 1971. Over 30,000 claims totaling nearly $2 billion have been approved, with the majority related to atomic weapons testing. The program will sunset on July 10, 2022, and all benefit applications must be filed before that date. Between 1951 and 1962, the Atomic Energy Commission conducted 1,054 atomic weapons tests, with 928 tests at the Nevada Test Site. 100 of these tests were atmospheric, releasing radioactive material into the atmosphere. The largest atmospheric test at NTS was the Hood Test. The largest atmospheric test at the Nevada Test Site was the Hood Test on July 5, 1957, with an energy yield equivalent to 74,000 tons of TNT. Benefits under the RECA program include $75,000 for onsite participants, $50,000 for downwinders, and $100,000 for uranium workers. These are one-time lump sum payments not adjusted for inflation and not subject to federal income tax. The RECA program provides compensation and medical benefits to uranium workers exposed to radiation. Eligible individuals can receive $50,000 in compensation and medical benefits under EEOICPA. Benefits are paid to the claimant or their survivors in order of precedence. The RECA program provides compensation and medical benefits to uranium workers exposed to radiation. Eligible individuals can receive $50,000 in compensation and medical benefits under EEOICPA. Benefits are paid to the claimant or their survivors in order of precedence, including children, parents, grandchildren, and grandparents. Only eligible survivors listed above can receive RECA benefits, and onsite participants must meet exposure and disease requirements to qualify. The curr_chunk discusses the various test sites and official zones where nuclear tests were conducted, including the NTS, Bikini Atoll, Enewetak Atoll, Johnston Island, Christmas Island, Trinity Test Site, and others. It also mentions designated locations for decontamination and fallout monitoring. Individuals who were onsite during atmospheric nuclear testing at NTS and held specific occupations and performed designated activities are eligible for certain benefits. Individuals who participated in activities related to atmospheric detonations of nuclear devices, decontamination, cloud tracking, garrison duties, or radiological safety monitoring at Enewetak Atoll during specific timeframes may be eligible for RECA benefits if they developed certain cancers due to ionizing radiation exposure. To qualify for RECA benefits as a downwinder or uranium miner, specific exposure and disease requirements must be met. Downwinders must have been physically present near NTS for a specified period and contracted certain cancers after exposure to ionizing radiation. Uranium miners must have worked in a uranium mine for a minimum period or been exposed to a certain level of radiation. To qualify for RECA benefits, uranium miners must have been exposed to at least 40 working-level months of radiation between 1942 and 1971 and developed specific respiratory diseases or lung cancer. Uranium millers and ore transporters may also qualify if they meet exposure and disease criteria. A uranium miller or ore transporter must have worked in a uranium mill or transporting uranium ore from 1941 to 1971 in specific states listed in Table 4. They must have developed certain conditions after radiation exposure, such as lung cancer, renal cancer, or respiratory diseases. The DOJ's Civil Division handles RECA program eligibility and benefit claims. The RECA program requires written documentation of illnesses for benefit claims, with detailed requirements on types of documents. Native American applications must consider Native American law and customs. Application decisions are made within 12 months by an assistant director at the DOJ Civil Division. The 2000 RECA amendments authorized grants for cancer screenings and medical documentation assistance. RESEP clinics in five states and one for Native Americans provide these services. Applicants are not required to be screened at RESEP clinics. Denied applicants can appeal to the DOJ. An applicant denied RECA benefits can appeal to the DOJ within 60 days. The appeals officer appointed by the assistant attorney general will review the appeal and make a decision to affirm, reverse, or remand the case. If dissatisfied, the applicant can seek judicial review in the U.S. district court. Representation by licensed attorneys or non-attorney representatives of tribal organizations is allowed, with the latter not permitted to charge fees. The RECA statute limits fees for attorneys representing claimants, with different percentages based on the date of the contract. Attorneys can recover costs for unsuccessful claims and expenses for successful claims. The RECA program has been providing benefits for 25 years to onsite participants and downwinders. The RECA program, in its 25th year, provides benefits to onsite participants, downwinders, and uranium workers. Legislation has been introduced to expand eligibility for downwinders and provide benefits to uranium workers exposed to radiation after 1971. No statutory changes have been made since 2000, but these issues will likely keep RECA on the congressional agenda. Currently, to qualify for benefits as a downwinder, one must have been present in designated counties in Arizona, Nevada, or Utah during atmospheric testing at NTS. Residents of other areas, including those closer to NTS or near the Trinity test site in New Mexico, are not eligible for benefits. Residents outside of the current downwinder eligibility area affected by fallout from atomic weapons testing have tried to seek compensation through civil courts but were unsuccessful. This led to the creation of the RECA program in 1990. Legislation introduced in 1979 aimed to provide compensation to civilian downwinders affected by atmospheric testing at NTS. The proposed bill, H.R. 4766, aimed to make the United States liable for damages caused by atmospheric atomic testing at NTS to downwinders with cancer, onsite participants, and affected sheep herds in 1953. Eligibility for compensation included downwinders with specific types of cancer determined by the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare within a defined geographical area around NTS. This area encompassed parts of Nevada, Utah, California, Arizona, and was outlined in a map provided in the bill. The bill H.R. 4766 aimed to hold the United States accountable for damages from atomic testing at NTS, providing compensation for downwinders, onsite participants, and affected sheep herds. Eligibility was based on specific cancers within defined geographic areas in Arizona, Nevada, and Utah. The original RECA statute had a smaller downwinder eligibility area, which was expanded with the 2000 RECA amendments to include additional areas in Arizona and Utah. Members of Congress have introduced bills to further expand the downwinder eligibility area. In response to congressional bills, efforts have been made to expand downwinder eligibility areas for individuals affected by atomic weapons testing, including those in Colorado, Idaho, Montana, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, Guam, and fallout from the Trinity test. In 2002, HRSA requested a study on the health effects of radiation exposure from the National Research Council. The NRC issued a final report in 2005 on the health effects of radiation exposure, recommending a science-based approach to determine downwinder eligibility for RECA benefits. Factors such as location, time spent outdoors, and milk consumption affect individuals' exposure to fallout. The NRC report recommended a model of probability of causation to evaluate individual claims for benefits under the RECA program, focusing on the ingestion of Iodine 131 through contaminated milk consumption. This model would estimate each applicant's absorbed dose of radionuclides using various factors, allowing every person in the country to apply for benefits based on the probability that their specific cancer was caused by radiation exposure.

This model would estimate each applicant's absorbed dose of radionuclides using various factors, allowing every person in the country to apply for benefits based on the probability that their specific cancer was caused by radiation exposure. Congress may need to set thresholds for benefits or award varying levels based on probabilities, but no legislation has been introduced to change RECA eligibility from geography-based to probability-based. The presumptive eligibility model used by RECA may be favored by some advocates for compensation. The NRC recommended a probability of causation model for evaluating claims under the RECA program, indicating that exposure to radiation from fallout is unlikely to have been a substantial cause of cancer. Changes in eligibility criteria based on scientific evidence may result in fewer successful claims. RECA benefits for uranium miners, millers, and ore transporters are currently available. The original RECA legislation set a cut-off date of December 31, 1971 for uranium worker eligibility due to the end of federal procurement of uranium for atomic weapons. Private ownership of uranium for nuclear power plants has been legal since 1964, creating a market for mined uranium post-1971. Efforts have been made to expand RECA eligibility for uranium workers exposed to radiation after 1971. Efforts are being made to expand RECA eligibility for uranium workers exposed to radiation after 1971, with advocates arguing that despite improved safety regulations, miners remain at elevated risk for radon-induced diseases due to higher exposure limits than recommended by NIOSH. The RECA program aims to provide restitution to individuals affected by atomic weapons tests and uranium mining for the US nuclear weapons program. Advocates are pushing for an expansion of RECA to cover post-1971 uranium activities, but this may extend beyond the program's original intent. Illnesses from commercial uranium activities may already be covered by state workers' compensation systems.
