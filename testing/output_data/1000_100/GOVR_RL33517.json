    "content": "Under the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, the President can propose to rescind funding from an appropriations act by sending a special message to Congress. If Congress does not approve the rescission within 45 days, the funding must be made available for executive agencies. President George W. Bush advocated for a line-item veto to address excessive earmark projects. The Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006 (LLIVA) was introduced to Congress on March 6, 2006, proposing expedited rescission where one house must vote on presidential rescission proposals. Enhanced rescission, previously available under the Line Item Veto Act of 1996, favored the President's spending reductions unless Congress enacted a disapproval bill. Expedited rescission bills require a two-thirds majority in both chambers to override a presidential veto. These bills focus on procedural changes in Congress to ensure immediate consideration of the President's rescission request. The expedited rescission approach is seen as transferring less power from Congress to the President compared to other methods. In the past, the House has passed expedited rescission bills, such as H.R. 2164 in the 102nd Congress in 1992. H.R. 2164, passed in 1992, allowed the President to propose rescissions within three days of signing an appropriations act. H.R. 1578, passed in 1993, had no limit on the amount that could be rescinded, with provisions for expedited judicial review. In the second session of the 103rd Congress, H.R. 4600 passed the House in 1994 with a substitute amendment for expedited rescission procedures. The bill allowed submission of a special rescission message at any time and authorized special messages from the President proposing the repeal of targeted tax benefits within 20 days of enactment. The White House introduced a draft expedited rescission bill titled the Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006, allowing the President to propose rescission of discretionary budget authority, direct spending items, or repeal of targeted tax benefits under new legislative provisions. The Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006 (LLIVA) grants the President flexibility in submitting and packaging special messages for rescissions without time constraints. Rescission requests must be used for deficit reduction, and adjustments to committee allocations and spending caps are required within five days of enactment. The LLIVA allows for fast-track consideration of the President's proposed rescissions. The Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006 (LLIVA) allows the President to introduce a proposed bill under fast-track procedures, with limited debate and no amendments allowed. The bill must be reported within five days without substantive revision, and a vote on final passage must occur by the 10th day of session following introduction. The LLIVA introduced a bill allowing the President to withhold budget authority for rescission or suspend direct spending for up to 180 days. This provision is unique in expedited rescission bills and aims to give Congress time to consider the President's request before funds are released. Critics of the 180-day withholding mechanism argue that it could lead to the return of policy deferrals, originally allowed in the ICA but invalidated by court decisions. Supporters believe a shorter period than 180 days would be sufficient for Congress to act on the President's request. Supporters of the 180-day provision in the LLIVA stress that it is the maximum period for funding deferral, with the option for early release if the President deems it necessary. The LLIVA states that its provisions are severable for judicial review, meaning unconstitutional parts can be struck down while the rest remains in force. The act would be effective upon signing and apply only to future spending or tax provisions. Several measures with expedited rescission provisions have been introduced in the 109th Congress, including the omnibus budget reform measure H.R. 2290. This measure, introduced by Representative Jeb Hensarling, authorizes the President to propose rescinding any identified \"wasteful\" budget authority in an appropriations act. The President could also propose reducing discretionary spending limits under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. The provisions for the special message and accompanying draft approval bill are similar to those in the LLIVA, but H.R. 2290 limits the President to just one message for each proposal. H.R. 2290 would limit the President to one message for each appropriations act, unless accounts fall under multiple appropriations subcommittees. Representative Mark Udall introduced H.R. 4699, the \"SLICE Act of 2006,\" to enable the President to propose spending reductions for Congress to debate and vote on. The President could submit multiple special messages and approval bills for appropriations acts containing accounts under different subcommittees. Senator John Kerry introduced S. 2372, similar to the Line Item Veto Act of 1996, allowing the President to propose cancellation of discretionary budget authority, new direct spending items, and limited tax benefits. The President could propose cancellations and submit draft bills for each item to be cancelled within days of the applicable law. Expedited procedures would ensure a vote on final passage of an approval bill within 10 legislative days. Representative John Spratt introduced H.R. 5667, which includes a legislative line item veto similar to bills in the 1990s. H.R. 5667, introduced by Representative John Spratt, would allow the President to propose cancellations of discretionary spending and limited tax benefit provisions. It includes an expedited process for congressional consideration and allows for separate votes on spending items or tax provisions. The House Budget Committee and Rules Committee both approved the bill with amendments. On June 22, the House approved H.R. 4890 by vote of 247-172. Senator Judd Gregg introduced the Stop Over Spending Act with budget process reforms. The Senate Budget Committee marked up S. 3521 and voted 12-10 to report the bill favorably. Table 1 provides a comparative overview of major features in three expedited rescission bills. The House approved H.R. 4890 and Senator Judd Gregg introduced the Stop Over Spending Act with budget process reforms. The Senate Budget Committee marked up S. 3521 and voted to report the bill favorably. The expedited rescission bills have some differences in provisions, such as deadlines for submission of special messages and limits on the number of messages allowed. The SenateBudget Committee version limits the President to four special messages per year, while the House-passed version allows for five special messages per act or 10 for omnibus measures. The House version is more permissive in total messages, while the Senate bill is more lenient in timing. The House version allows the President to withhold funds for up to 90 days, with a 45-day extension, while the Senate bill limits withholding to 45 days. The LLIVA has no sunset termination date, unlike the House-passed version. The LLIVA, as introduced, had no sunset termination date, while the House-passed version expires after six years and S. 3521 after four years. Both versions narrow the scope of targeted tax benefits compared to the Administration's proposal. H.R. 4890 covers revenue-losing measures affecting a single beneficiary, while S. 3521 defines targeted tax benefits as affecting a particular group of taxpayers. The Senate Budget Committee version and the 1996 act would require the Joint Committee on Taxation to identify targeted tax benefits, while the House-passed version would require the chairmen of the Ways and Means and Finance Committees to identify such provisions. The President could only propose a rescission of identified tax benefits. H.R. 4890/S. 2381 would allow the President to propose any targeted tax benefit that he identified. Another change in the House-passed version is its relationship to the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, as it would repeal the ICA except for certain sections. The bills H.R. 4890/S. 2381 and S. 3521 would amend Title X of the ICA by replacing the Line Item Veto Act of 1996. The issue at hand is whether the expedited rescission framework in the bills would enhance or replace the President's rescission authority under the ICA. A manager's amendment by Representative Paul Ryan clarified that any cancelled amount from a trust fund or special fund would be returned. The bills H.R. 4890/S. 2381 and S. 3521 aim to amend Title X of the ICA by replacing the Line Item Veto Act of 1996. A manager's amendment clarified that cancelled amounts from trust funds or special funds would be returned to their original source. H.R. 4890 changes were made during committee markups, while S. 3521 includes provisions prohibiting the President from resubmitting rejected items but allowing resubmission of cancellations if Congress fails to act. The provisions for expedited consideration of special messages proposing rescissions of funds have remained similar over the years. Various versions of expedited rescission bills in the 109th Congress seek to ensure a vote on final passage of the approval bill within 10 days. In the early 1990s, there were bills with provisions for consideration of substitute rescissions or allowing a motion to strike a rescission with sufficient support. None of the expedited rescission bills in the 109th Congress, except H.R. 5667, include new direct spending or targeted tax benefits if the cancellation proposal is submitted after the effective date. In the 109th Congress, expedited rescission bills varied in scope, with some including discretionary budget authority, direct spending, and targeted tax benefits. H.R. 4699 proposed adding transportation projects to possible cancellations. The Line Item Veto Act of 1996 had a broad scope, allowing rescission of any amount of discretionary budget authority or new direct spending items. Some supporters raised concerns about the Act's constitutionality. The expedited rescission approach, particularly for discretionary spending, is seen as constitutionally sound. The LLIVA includes a severability provision to protect the act if any part is found unconstitutional. The President's authority for special rescission messages could still be valid even if certain cancellations are overturned. The Bush Administration continues to push for expedited rescission bills. The Bush Administration is actively seeking the enactment of a version of the LLIVA in the 109th Congress. President Bush called on the Senate to pass the line item veto legislation to target pork in spending bills and enhance fiscal discipline."
