    "content": "Many governments recognize the international risks posed by environmental degradation and climate change, leading to the negotiation of international agreements to protect the environment and promote sustainable growth. While industrialized countries are called upon to take the lead, it is acknowledged that efforts from wealthier nations alone may not be sufficient. Lower-income countries may lack the resources and expertise to implement environmental measures, making international financial assistance crucial. International financial assistance is crucial for lower-income countries to address global environmental problems. The UNFCCC, ratified by the United States in 1992, requires higher-income Parties to provide new and additional financial resources to developing countries for meeting their obligations. Adequacy and predictability in fund flow are emphasized in implementing these commitments. The United States has provided financial and technical assistance for climate change activities in developing countries through bilateral and multilateral programs. Assistance has been delivered through various agencies such as USAID, State Department, Millennium Challenge Corporation, Export-Import Bank, and others. Contributions have also been made to environmental funds at international institutions like the Global Environment Facility and the Green Climate Fund. The Green Climate Fund (GCF), UN Development Program, UN Environment Program, UNFCCC's Special Climate Change Fund, Least Developed Country Fund, World Bank's Climate Investment Funds, and Forest Carbon Partnership Facility are key entities for climate finance. The GEF, established in 1991, is an operating entity for international environmental agreements like the UNFCCC. The relationship between UNFCCC and GEF is outlined in a memorandum of understanding. The George H. W. Bush Administration supported the establishment of the GEF in 1991. The United States has made commitments to all six GEF resource replenishments, totaling $2.732 billion. U.S. disbursements to the GEF since 1994 have totaled approximately $2.2 billion. In 2009, the COP to the UNFCCC in Copenhagen took note of the Copenhagen Accord, and in Cancun the following year, adopted many of its elements, including Fast start financing. The agreement includes commitments by developed countries to provide $30 billion for climate finance in 2010-2012 and aims to mobilize $100 billion annually by 2020. Funding sources can be public, private, bilateral, or multilateral. The Paris Agreement in 2015 built upon the Convention to combat climate change. The Paris Agreement in 2015 builds upon the Convention to combat climate change by bringing all nations into a common framework to combat climate change, support developing countries, and mobilize financial support for climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts. Developed countries are obligated to seek financial support, and all parties are encouraged to provide voluntary financial support regardless of economic standing. The agreement emphasizes the need for developed countries to take the lead in mobilizing climate finance from various sources, representing a progression beyond previous efforts. The COP Decision reaffirms the pledge of developed countries to provide $100 billion annually by 2020 for climate finance, with a new goal to be set by 2025. President Trump's intention to withdraw from the Paris Agreement in 2017 could not be completed before November 4, 2020. The Green Climate Fund (GCF) was established as an operating entity under the UNFCCC in 2011 to assist developing countries in climate finance. The Green Climate Fund (GCF) was designed during the 2011 COP in Durban, South Africa to assist developing countries in combating climate change through grants and concessional financing. It operates independently from the UNFCCC with its own board, trustee, and secretariat. The GCF is funded by developed country Parties to the Convention and other public and private sources, totaling approximately $10.3 billion. It became operational in 2014. The Green Climate Fund (GCF) became operational in the summer of 2014 with approximately $10.3 billion pledged for its initial capitalization. The U.S. Department of State made contributions of $500 million on two occasions in 2016 and 2017. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 allows the President to use the Economic Support Fund to provide assistance for economic or political stability. The Trump Administration's FY2018 budget proposes to eliminate U.S. funding for the GCF. The FY2018 budget request, released on May 23, 2017, proposes to eliminate U.S. funding for the Green Climate Fund (GCF) in alignment with President Trump's promise to cease payments to the United Nations' climate change programs. Despite the U.S. disbursement of $1 billion to the GCF under the Obama Administration, the Trump Administration has not confirmed if it will retain its board membership. Future U.S. engagement with the GCF will be decided as part of the wider internal process to further develop policy on climate. The GCF's relationship to the US climate finance commitments is not directly tied to the $100 billion goal, as funds can come from various sources. While GCF funding may contribute to the goal, it is not expected to solely provide the entire amount. The decision on future US engagement with the GCF will be part of a broader internal policy development process. The GCF would not interfere with bilateral climate change assistance to developing countries, but would complement other multilateral mechanisms. Private capital, development bank instruments, and carbon markets are seen as critical for mobilizing assistance at the pledged level. The GCF board will determine its complementarity with other U.N. multilateral mechanisms in future negotiations. The U.S. withdrawal from the PA and financial commitments to UN climate change programs may impact multilateral choices and funding allocations. Potential benefits include fiscal savings from the annual $1 billion climate finance provided by the U.S. government. The U.S. provided about $1 billion annually for climate finance in the developing world, accounting for approximately 3% of the foreign operations budget. Critics question the effectiveness of international financial assistance in spurring economic development and mitigating climate change risks. Reductions in financial assistance could benefit other priorities and sustain markets for GHG-intensive products. Some stakeholders argue for U.S. sovereignty in decision-making. Some stakeholders argue that U.S. withdrawal from commitments under the PA redefines international relations, emphasizing sovereignty, national interest, and control of domestic economics. Potential repercussions include higher costs of future climate-related catastrophes and economic inefficiencies, especially in developing countries. Some argue that climate finance in developing countries benefits U.S. businesses supporting low-emissions technologies and reduces global economic activity for these goods and services, including U.S. exports. Additionally, reductions in international financial assistance could increase vulnerability to climate change impacts in lower-income countries, affecting both the countries and U.S. interests. The United States can increase global environmental leadership through financial commitments under the PA, influencing international economic and environmental policies. Withdrawal from the PA would not release the US from general commitments under the UNFCCC to provide financial resources for developing countries. The Trump Administration's withdrawal from the Paris Agreement and cessation of U.S. payments to UN climate change programs could impact international efforts to help developing countries combat climate change. The decision relies on assumptions about program efficiencies and the ability of other nations, regional governments, and the private sector to compensate for the lack of U.S. assistance. Ultimately, U.S. contributions to developing countries for climate change activities are determined by Congress. Congress plays a crucial role in international climate change assistance by authorizing programs, enacting appropriations, providing guidance, and overseeing U.S. interests. Congressional committees responsible for this assistance include the U.S. House of Representatives Committees on Foreign Affairs, Financial Services, and Appropriations, as well as the U.S. Senate Committees on Foreign Relations and Appropriations."
