    "content": "The \"Hong Kong Reversion Act\" aims to support Hong Kong's autonomous governance and well-being after its reversion to China in 1997. It outlines circumstances for the US President to modify laws if China fails to uphold Hong Kong's autonomy. The Joint Declaration of the UK and China on Hong Kong's reversion in 1997 guarantees autonomy, human rights, and elections for Hong Kong. Despite assurances from senior Chinese officials for a smooth transfer of Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty and respect for the \"one country, two systems\" policy, there are concerns about attempts to infringe upon Hong Kong's autonomy. This includes initial proposals to obtain confidential files on civil servants. The curr_chunk discusses various concerning actions by the Government of the People's Republic of China regarding Hong Kong, including dissolving the Legislative Council, restricting speech and association, warning religious institutions, and obtaining confidential files on civil servants. The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China decided on February 23, 1997, to repeal or amend certain Hong Kong ordinances, including the Bill of Rights Ordinance, the Societies Ordinance of 1992, and the Public Order Ordinance of 1995. Despite commitments in the Joint Declaration, the UK's actions, such as the agreement on the Court of Final Appeal, have damaged Hong Kong's future autonomy. The reversion of Hong Kong to China has implications for US national interests and the rights of Hong Kong people. The US has a responsibility to protect its interests during and after the transition, as well as ensuring the human rights of Hong Kong residents. The United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 is relevant in this context. The United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 ensures the continuity of US laws regarding Hong Kong's special status as a Special Administrative Region of China. It allows the President to modify the application of US laws if Hong Kong is not sufficiently autonomous. The United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 aims to maintain Hong Kong's autonomy by treating it as a separate legal entity from China, as agreed upon in the Joint Declaration. The Act requires the Secretary of State to assess the implementation of the Joint Declaration. The Secretary of State evaluates the implementation of the Joint Declaration, emphasizing that the future of Hong Kong depends on China's commitment to maintaining freedoms and allowing self-governance. SEC. 4. CONGRESSIONAL DECLARATIONS. Congress declares the close working relationship between the US and Hong Kong governments, urging continued cooperation. The US also emphasizes the importance of preserving Hong Kong's autonomous customs territory and calls on China to respect its autonomy. The United States urges China to respect Hong Kong's autonomy, including allowing port calls for US naval vessels and protecting the free press and access to information in Hong Kong. The United States calls for elections in Hong Kong to be conducted according to laws approved by the people or their representatives, citing the need to honor the Joint Declaration and ensure a democratically-elected legislature. The United States supports the Bill of Rights Ordinance in Hong Kong, emphasizing the importance of preserving the freedoms of the Hong Kong people. It calls for revisions of Hong Kong law to be left to a democratically-elected legislature and urges adherence to the International Covenant on Human Rights. The United States welcomes the Chief Executive-designate of Hong Kong's commitment to public consultation on new legislation replacing sections of existing ordinances. It urges that the new laws reflect the wishes of the people of Hong Kong and comply with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The United States urges China to respect the autonomy of Hong Kong's government institutions and fight corruption. SEC. 5. Presidential determination under the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 and additional reporting requirements. In determining Hong Kong's autonomy for treatment under U.S. laws, the President considers Hong Kong and China's actions based on assessments and reports required by the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992. The Secretary of State must include specific information in reports to Congress as per the Act. The United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 requires the Secretary to assess the existence of a freely elected legislature in Hong Kong and the successful conclusion of agreements and treaties. This assessment includes evaluating the ability of Hong Kong people to participate in elections without restrictions and ensuring the electoral system is fair. The United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 requires assessing agreements and treaties between the US and China, including a bilateral investment treaty, extradition treaty, consular access agreement, preservation of US consulate, mutual legal assistance agreement, prison transfer agreement, and civil aviation agreement. Cooperation from Hong Kong agencies is also crucial. The United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 requires assessing agreements and treaties between the US and China, including cooperation from Hong Kong agencies in areas such as customs enforcement, drug interdiction, and prevention of money laundering. The Act also mandates evaluating the preservation of good governance, rule of law, and autonomy in Hong Kong, including any efforts to undermine the Bill of Rights. The United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 requires assessing agreements and treaties between the US and China, including cooperation from Hong Kong agencies in areas such as customs enforcement, drug interdiction, and prevention of money laundering. The Act also mandates evaluating the preservation of good governance, rule of law, and autonomy in Hong Kong, including any efforts to undermine the Bill of Rights. The Secretary must assess violations of laws, interference in autonomy, corruption, and suppression of press freedom in Hong Kong. Additionally, the Secretary must determine if the customs territory of Hong Kong is administered autonomously. The Secretary must report on violations of United States textile laws, export control laws, and unauthorized diversions of high technology exports from the US to Hong Kong. Additionally, the report must address the unprecedented diversion of Chinese exports through Hong Kong for preferential treatment in US markets and misuse of Hong Kong's customs territory for the foreign policy or trade goals of China. SEC. 6 prohibits the use of funds for Hong Kong provisional legislature members in US Information Agency programs. The term \"Hong Kong provisional legislature\" refers to the body appointed in 1996 to replace the elected Legislative Council. SEC. 7 defines the term \"Joint Declaration\" as the agreement between the UK and China on Hong Kong, signed in 1984."
