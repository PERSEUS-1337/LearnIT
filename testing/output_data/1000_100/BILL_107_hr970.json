COMPREHENSIVE PREVENTION TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE GRANTS.\" The Secretary can provide grants to States for prevention programs meeting high scientific standards. States must submit a plan detailing grant selection criteria, funding only well-documented programs, and disseminating research-based materials. The State educational agency will evaluate and measure the results of prevention programs, ensure local programs meet requirements, and assure funds supplement other available resources. The State educational agency will evaluate prevention programs and ensure compliance with requirements, including criteria set by the Secretary. The Secretary reserves and allocates funds for each fiscal year to carry out the subpart, with reallocation to States that do not meet plan requirements. Funds can only be used to implement programs under this subpart. Each State educational agency receiving funds under this subpart must provide competitive grants to local educational agencies. Grants prioritize those with demonstrated need, support startup costs for prevention plans, and ensure equitable distribution. The State educational agency must distribute awards equitably to different geographic regions, including urban and rural areas, and schools serving elementary and secondary students. The agency can use up to 5 percent of funds for administrative expenses, evaluation, and technical assistance, including informing local educational agencies about effective prevention approaches. \"Local awards are distributed equitably to various geographic regions, urban and rural areas, and schools serving elementary and secondary students.\" To be eligible for a subgrant, a local educational agency must submit an application and a plan demonstrating how it will implement prevention programs based on reliable research to address various issues and improve student performance. The subgrant application must demonstrate a prevention program that addresses the mental, emotional, social, and physical health of children and adolescents, using developmentally appropriate activities and interventions. It should also involve parents, educators, and professionals in planning, provide staff training, set measurable goals, and have clear evaluation methods. The subgrant application must have measurable outcome goals, a clear evaluation plan, and use external technical support. It should also identify how other resources will be used to coordinate services for the prevention effort."
