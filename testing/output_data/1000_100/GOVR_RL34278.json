    "content": "During the first session of the 110th Congress, the Administration requested $196.5 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations for FY 2008, with $189.3 billion for military operations and $6.9 billion for international affairs. Congress had approved $86.8 billion for defense and $1.5 billion for international affairs by December 2007. $102.5 billion for defense and $5.4 billion for international affairs are still pending approval. The Administration's initial request for military operations funding was in February 2007, with an additional request for $5.3 billion for MRAP. Congress is expected to address the remaining requests in a spring 2008 supplemental appropriations bill. In February 2007, the Administration requested $5.3 billion for MRAP vehicles and $45 billion for emergency defense and international affairs funding in October 2007. Congress approved the regular FY2008 defense appropriations act in November, which helped finance day-to-day activities and war-related operations for the Army and Marine Corps. However, without supplemental funding, the Army was at risk of running out of funds due to the high pace of operations in Iraq. The Administration requested additional funding for the Army and Marine Corps to avoid running out of money by February and early April, respectively. The Defense Department considered various options to extend operations, including transferring funds or invoking the \"Feed and Forage Act.\" A $70 billion \"bridge fund\" approved by Congress temporarily resolved the issue, providing about 37% of the requested amount for Army and Marine Corps operations. Defense officials estimate that funding for Army military personnel and operation and maintenance will last until mid-June and end of June/early July, with options to extend operations further by transferring funds or invoking standing authorities. The Administration submitted requests for FY2008 emergency supplemental appropriations. The Administration requested $141.7 billion in emergency supplemental funding for the Defense Department, $3.3 billion for the State Department, and $325 million for other agencies in the FY2008 budget. This request complied with Section 1008 of the FY2007 national defense authorization act, requiring a detailed justification of funds for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Defense Department estimated the full-year costs of continuing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan at a similar pace to 2006, acknowledging it was a rough projection. The Administration requested additional funding for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, including $5.3 billion for Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles and $45.9 billion for various activities related to ongoing conflicts. This brought the total emergency supplemental appropriations requested to $195.6 billion. The Administration requested $195.6 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations for FY2008, mainly for military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and related foreign affairs programs. Congressional debate in early 2007 focused on supplemental appropriations for FY2007, with a revised request submitted in March and a compromise bill approved in May. The FY2008 emergency supplemental funding included $5.2 billion for Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles, in addition to defense funding and a $70 billion \"bridge fund\" from the previous year. Congressional action on the funding began in September and was finalized shortly before Christmas. The FY2008 defense appropriations bill, P.L. 110-116, provided $460 billion for Defense Department activities, including funding for Army and Marine Corps operations. An additional $11.6 billion was allocated for MRAP vehicles. However, no extra funding was included for ongoing military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The House also approved the \"Orderly and Responsible Iraq Redeployment Appropriations Act\" on November 14, 2007. The bill, H.R. 4156, provided $50 billion for U.S. military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. It required the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq within 30 days and a plan to withdraw most troops by December 15, 2008. Remaining forces in Iraq were limited to force protection, training, and pursuit of terrorists, with prohibitions on deploying untrained units and torture extended to all U.S. government agencies. The Senate rejected the bill on November 16, 2007. The Senate refused to close debate on a motion to proceed to consideration of H.R. 4156, effectively killing the measure. They also rejected a motion to proceed to consideration of H.R. 2340, a substitute offered by Senator McConnell for $70 billion for the Defense Department without requiring withdrawal from Iraq. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates warned of limited operations without additional funding. The Defense Department announced a transfer of $4.5 billion to the Army and Joint IED Defeat Organization to extend operations until February 23. Without additional funding, the Army and Marine Corps would have to halt non-essential operations soon. The House approved amendments to the foreign operations appropriations bill for FY2008. The House approved amendments to the Senate-passed bill, providing $485 billion in regular and emergency appropriations for programs covered by all regular appropriations bills except defense. Another amendment allocated $31 billion in emergency defense appropriations for Operation Enduring Freedom. The Senate adopted an amendment by Senator McConnell to provide $70 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations for the Department of Defense for overseas operations, without limits on where the money could be used. The House approved the Senate amendment to the bill, clearing it for the President to sign into law as P.L. 110-161 on December 26, 2007. This resolved a dispute over war funding and prevented the Defense Department from shutting down Army and Marine Corps operations in early 2008. The Defense Department warned of shutting down Army and Marine Corps operations in early 2008 due to lack of funding. Secretary of Defense Gates announced furloughs of civilian and contractor personnel. Emergency supplemental appropriations of $70 billion averted the shutdown until at least June 2008, providing funds for Army and Marine Corps operations. The FY2008 Defense Appropriations Act (P.L. 110-116) provided supplemental funding to sustain Army and Marine Corps operations until June and August 2008 respectively. The Army is projected to exhaust funds in its military personnel account by mid-June, prompting the Defense Department to consider transferring funds or slowing operations to extend funding. At least $11.4 billion is available for fund transfers between accounts. The Defense Department is considering transferring funds between accounts to extend Army and Marine Corps operations until June and August 2008. Up to $11.4 billion is available for transfers, which could potentially extend operations by another month without slowing down activities. This would reduce financial flexibility for other unexpected needs. Congress provided a $70 billion FY2008 bridge fund to resolve the debate. In FY2008, the Defense Department considered transferring $4.1 billion to the Army to extend operations by two to three weeks. Without supplemental appropriations, funds for day-to-day activities and war-related operations would be exhausted by February for the Army and early April for the Marine Corps. The Defense Department could have extended operations by transferring limited additional amounts to the Army and Marine Corps, slowing down spending, or using novel measures like invoking the Feed and Forage Act. However, these alternatives have limits and disadvantages, such as reducing financial flexibility and disrupting day-to-day operations. The use of Navy and Air Force funds to support Army operations might erode congressional controls. The FY2008 state department, foreign operations appropriations bill, part of the consolidated appropriations act, provides $1,473.8 million for international affairs, including $965 million for the State Department and $508.8 million for foreign operations. The FY2008 state department, foreign operations appropriations bill provides $1,473.8 million for international affairs, with $965 million for the State Department and $508.8 million for foreign operations. This leaves $5.4 billion of the request still to be considered. Supplemental funds for State Department accounts include $781.6 million for Diplomatic and Consular Programs, $468.0 million for Contributions to International Peacekeeping, and $12.0 million for International Broadcasting. Supplemental funds for Foreign Operations accounts include $115 million for Global Health & Child Survival, $110 million for International Disaster Assistance, $20.8 million for USAID Operating Expenses for Iraq, and $542.6 million for Economic Support Fund. The FY2008 state department, foreign operations appropriations bill provides $1,473.8 million for international affairs, with $965 million for the State Department and $508.8 million for foreign operations. Supplemental funds include $781.6 million for Diplomatic and Consular Programs, $468.0 million for Contributions to International Peacekeeping, $12.0 million for International Broadcasting, $115 million for Global Health & Child Survival, $110 million for International Disaster Assistance, $20.8 million for USAID Operating Expenses for Iraq, $542.6 million for Economic Support Fund, $200 million for Migration and Refugee Assistance, $100 million for Foreign Military Financing, and $35 million for Peacekeeping Operations. The FY2008 consolidated appropriations bill included a $70 billion bridge fund for Iraq, with no change in policy. The original House-passed bill required withdrawal of troops by December 2008. Other amendments were proposed during congressional debate. The $50 billion bridge fund approved by the House in November 2007 mandated troop withdrawal within 30 days of enactment. The President planned to withdraw troops from Iraq within 30 days and set a target date of December 15, 2008, for completion. A residual force would remain for protection, training, and targeted attacks on terrorists. H.R. 4156 aimed to end the war quickly and safely, extended prohibitions on torture, and required units to be fully ready before deployment. The President planned an immediate redeployment of U.S. forces from Iraq, with a goal of completing the transition by December 15, 2008. The remaining forces would focus on protecting U.S. facilities, training Iraqi security forces, and conducting targeted counter-terrorism operations. Quarterly reports were required on the transition progress before considering additional funding. The Senate proposed a comprehensive regional stability plan for the Middle East and required quarterly reports on military and political stability in Iraq with performance measures and a timetable for goals. Senators suggested shifting the U.S. mission in Iraq to training and supporting Iraqi security forces by the end of 2008. The Senate failed to approve a measure to transition the missions of the United States Armed Forces in Iraq to focus on counterterrorism operations, training Iraqi forces, and force protection by the end of 2008. The vote reflected no change in Senate support or opposition to the war in Iraq. Earlier, Senators proposed an amendment to begin withdrawing troops. The Senate rejected an amendment to withdraw troops from Iraq within 90 days and cut off funding after nine months. Instead, a $70 billion fund for FY2008 was approved without withdrawal requirements. The Secretary of Defense was mandated to provide reports on Iraq's stability every 60 days. The Administration requested $196.5 billion in additional appropriations for military operations and international affairs in FY2008. This included $141.7 billion for military operations abroad, $3.3 billion for international affairs programs, and $325 million for other agencies. Additionally, a budget amendment requested $5.3 billion for mine resistant ambush protected (MRAP) vehicle procurement and deployment. The White House requested an additional $45.9 billion in FY2008 for military operations and international affairs programs. The total requested amount for military operations was $189.3 billion, with $6.9 billion for international affairs programs and $325 million for other agencies. The funds were designated as \"emergency\" spending to bypass spending caps in the congressional budget resolution. The FY2008 budget resolution exempts emergency funds from spending caps but has a restrictive definition of emergency spending. It allows for adjustments of up to $124.2 billion for overseas deployments and related activities. The FY2008 budget resolution allows for adjustments of up to $124.2 billion for overseas deployments and related activities. Supplemental appropriations bills often exceed White House requests and can include significant legislative initiatives. The FY2007 supplemental bill included funds for disaster relief, farm programs, energy assistance, children's health insurance, and a minimum wage increase. It was expected that additional emergency funds would be included in the FY2008 supplemental appropriations bill for Hurricane Katrina recovery and other purposes related to the war. The FY2008 supplemental appropriations bill included funding for veterans health programs, community development in Louisiana, FEMA Disaster Relief Fund, and wildfire management. The bill was attached to the FY2008 defense appropriations bill and signed into law in November 2007. In FY2008, Congress allocated $16.8 billion for MRAPs in the defense appropriations bill. The bill included $5.2 billion for production and deployment of MRAP vehicles for the Army and Marine Corps. Additionally, $11.6 billion was designated as emergency appropriations for MRAPs in the defense appropriations bill. The FY2008 defense appropriations bill allocated funds for training Afghan and Iraqi security forces, joint IED defense, weapons procurement, and a bridge fund for flexibility in funding transfers. The $189.3 billion requested for military operations in FY2008 reflects a trend of increasing supplemental appropriations for the Defense Department. The funding for the war has increased significantly since FY2005, with a focus on repairing and upgrading military equipment. The largest increases in funding have been for weapons procurement, reaching $64 billion in the amended FY2008 request. The funding for the war has significantly increased since FY2005, with a focus on repairing and upgrading military equipment. There have also been increases in funding to train and equip Afghan and Iraqi military forces, as well as reorganizing the Army into a modular, brigade-centered force. The Defense Department has seen large increases in funding for force protection and reconstitution efforts. The Army requested funding for force reconstitution, but Congress insisted on adding funds for new equipment. Secretary Rumsfeld preferred the term \"reset\" to describe the process, aiming to return the force to a planned condition rather than its pre-war state. The goal was to refine and potentially reduce funding requirements. The Defense Department has resumed using the term \"reconstitution\" to encompass upgrades to the force, including fixing equipment shortfalls, adding transportation and communications gear, and equipping units with the same gear used in theater for training. Guard and reserve units are also being fully equipped with newer gear. The Defense Department has resumed using the term \"reconstitution\" to encompass upgrades to the force, including fixing equipment shortfalls and equipping units with newer gear for overseas operations. Congress generally supports upgrading ground forces and has questioned only a small share of requested equipment funding increases. Funding for MRAPs is the largest focus of the increase in spending. The amended defense request realigned funding to cover costs of the troop surge, with a focus on MRAPs. The budget included $6.3 billion for maintaining additional Army and Marine units in Iraq until December 2007. Other increases in funding were allocated for Iraqi security forces, factory reopening programs, and emergency response. The budget amendment includes additional funds for reconstitution, repair, and replenishment of equipment in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as $1 billion for Navy P-3 aircraft radar detection equipment. Additionally, $5.4 billion is allocated to restock equipment inventories of combat support units. The budget amendment includes $2.5 billion for various initiatives, such as fuel price increases, accelerating construction of facilities, improving Army medical facilities, and supporting soldier and family programs. Additionally, the Administration's FY2008 budget includes $35.1 billion for international affairs. The President's FY2008 emergency supplemental request for international affairs totaled $6.897 billion, with significant allocations for State Department operations, foreign assistance in Iraq and Afghanistan, programs in Mexico, the West Bank and Gaza, North Korea, Sudan, and Pakistan. The State Department estimated emergency supplemental funding needs for various programs in Iraq and Afghanistan. The State Department's FY2008 emergency supplemental request for international affairs totaled $6.897 billion, with significant allocations for Diplomatic and Consular Program funding for Iraq Operations, foreign assistance in Iraq and Afghanistan, and other international programs. The Bush Administration has faced criticism for relying too heavily on emergency supplemental funds for international affairs budgets. In February 2007, the State Department requested $3.220 billion in emergency funds for FY2008, including $1.3 billion added to the original request for operations in Iraq, Embassy Security, and Contributions for International Peacekeeping Activities. The State Department requested $7.317 billion for the Administration of Foreign Affairs, with $2.523 billion allocated for operations in Iraq, including $978.7 million for security needs such as guards, armored vehicles, and equipment. The Administration requested $1.1 billion for various security and reconstruction efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan, including counterterrorism training, overhead cover protection, Provincial Reconstruction Teams, security upgrades, and fully armored vehicles for embassies and PRTs. The FY2008 emergency supplemental request for the Department of State included funding for U.S. staff housing in Afghanistan, assessments for U.N. activities combatting terrorism, and contributions for international peacekeeping activities in Darfur. Congress provided $1.262 billion in supplemental funds for the Department of State, with $781.6 million for Diplomatic and Consular Programs and $468.0 million for International Peacekeeping, which was less than the Administration's request. The $781.6 million for Diplomatic and Consular Programs includes $575.0 million for Iraq operations and $206.6 million for worldwide security protection. $162.4 million is still pending for security protection in Afghanistan. $550.4 million is designated for a new peacekeeping mission in Darfur, with $390 million allocated for Darfur and $78 million for U.N. Peacekeeping funds. $333.6 million is still pending for Darfur. Emergency supplemental funds for the BBG total $12.0 million. Supplemental funds for the BBG total $12.0 million in the consolidated appropriation. No specific allocation requirements mentioned. Foreign Operations portion of the supplemental request sent to Congress in two tranches totaling $3.678 billion. Request includes Economic Support Funds for Iraq, Afghanistan, West Bank and Gaza, North Korea, Sudan, and Pakistan. Anti-narcotics emergency supplemental funding also included. The FY2008 foreign operations supplemental funding request includes $734 million for anti-narcotics efforts, $230 million for Migration and Refugee Assistance, $80 million for International Disaster and Famine Assistance, and $5 million for the Afghanistan Presidential Protection Service. Additionally, there is a $350 million request for P.L. 480 food aid and a $30 million contingency fund. Congress approved $1.123 billion in emergency supplemental funds for foreign operations in addition to regular FY2008 funding. The omnibus bill for FY2008 foreign operations supplemental funding includes approved emergency funds for various purposes, with some amounts lower than requested. The White House requested $2.2 billion in ESF funds for six recipients, but it is unclear where the funds should be directed. Congress approved funds for Global Health & Child Survival, International Disaster Assistance, USAID Operating Expenses, and Economic Support Fund, with varying amounts compared to the requests. The omnibus bill for FY2008 foreign operations supplemental funding included approved emergency funds for various purposes, with some amounts lower than requested. Funds were allocated for Iraq, Afghanistan, the West Bank and Gaza, Pakistan, North Korea, and Sudan, as well as for Migration and Refugee Assistance for Iraqi and Palestinian refugees. Additionally, funds were provided for Foreign Military Financing and Peacekeeping Operations. No supplemental funds were provided for counter-narcotics programs in Mexico and Central America. Over $42 billion in U.S. funds had been appropriated for Iraq reconstruction, mostly through annual supplemental legislation. The Administration did not request security assistance in its regular Defense budget proposal for FY2008, but asked for funds under State and Foreign Operations appropriations. In FY2008, Congress rejected the Administration's request for Iraq funding under State and Foreign Operations appropriations. The Administration then requested $4.9 billion in emergency supplemental funding for Iraq reconstruction, with $3.7 billion allocated for Department of Defense reconstruction appropriations. This funding would primarily support training and equipping Iraqi troops through the Iraq Security Forces Fund (ISFF). The Commander's Emergency Response Program (CERP) funds various economic activities at the local level in Iraq, including infrastructure projects and salaries for the Sons of Iraq. Additionally, a $100 million request was added to the DOD-funded Iraq Freedom Fund for business improvement efforts. The Task Force funded at $50 million aims to stimulate the Iraqi economy by rehabilitating state-owned enterprises. Challenges include lack of electricity, security issues, and low interest from U.S. companies. The FY2008 emergency supplemental request would allocate $1.2 billion to Iraq for various purposes. The ESF provides funding for assistance programs in Iraq, including support for Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) and embedded PRTs (ePRTs) focused on stabilizing areas secured by U.S. and Iraqi forces through economic projects and capacity-building for local government officials. The ESF supports Ministerial capacity development, agriculture, private sector reform, and democratization efforts. The October budget revision added $25 million to the ESF supplemental request for a new Iraq enterprise fund based on the model created for east Europe and the former Soviet Union. Enterprise funds provide loans or equity investments to small and medium businesses, encouraging growth of the private sector. The Polish Fund is a successful example, making profitable investments to help companies grow post-communism. Some funds have been less successful post-communism due to poor investment risks and competition. Observers question their usefulness as their development purpose conflicts with economic profit pressures. The INCLE account supports rule of law and corrections programs, including prison construction and judicial reform. The MRA request aims to address the refugee crisis in the region caused by millions fleeing Iraq. The IDA program aims to provide medical care, food, shelter, and relief to 2.0 million Iraqi refugees and 2.2 million displaced individuals due to violence and instability. Congress allocated $679 million for PRT and $45.8 million for USAID operations in FY2008 emergency funds for Iraq reconstruction. Congress approved funding for humanitarian programs in Iraq, including demining, refugee assistance, disaster relief, and war victims fund. However, regular or supplemental economic assistance was mostly rejected, with only $250 million allocated. This amounted to 24% of the total International Affairs budget supplemental request for Iraq reconstruction. The U.S. has allocated $44.8 billion for Iraq reconstruction since 2003, with additional funding needed for PRT operations and programs. The Administration is seeking $1 billion in Foreign Operations appropriations and $2 billion in Defense appropriations for Iraq reconstruction. In Afghanistan, insurgent threats escalated in 2006, raising concerns about U.S. stabilization efforts. In Afghanistan, political progress includes a new constitution, successful elections, and increased personal freedoms. Women are now participating in economic and political life. Insurgency led by the Taliban escalated in 2006 despite previous defeats. The Taliban remains a significant threat in Afghanistan despite recent successes in counter-insurgency operations. Slow reconstruction, corruption, and the failure to extend government authority into rural areas have contributed to the Taliban resurgence. Narcotics trafficking and independent militias also pose challenges. Taliban commanders operating from Pakistan are beyond the reach of U.S./NATO forces. The Administration's efforts in Afghanistan include the Reconstruction Opportunity Zones initiative to stimulate economic activity in underdeveloped regions. Stabilization measures focus on strengthening the central government and security forces, combating insurgent challenges, and running Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs). Weak provincial governance remains a key obstacle to reconstruction and stabilization. In FY2008, the Administration requested $339 million in ESF for Afghanistan reconstruction assistance. The Administration's request for Afghanistan in FY2008 included increases in embassy operations and security, with a total request of $839 million for reconstruction. The FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act funded most government operations, but the supplemental request for reconstruction was not appropriated. Key elements of the FY2008 emergency supplemental requests included funding for the ESF and democratic governance. The amended supplemental funding for Afghanistan includes $275 million for provincial governance, $50 million for basic social services, and $170 million for economic growth and infrastructure projects. This funding aims to support security, development, and reconstruction efforts in the country. The request includes funding for Reconstruction Opportunity Zones in economically isolated areas and support for the Afghan leadership through the Presidential Protection Service. The Federally Administered Tribal Areas are crucial in combating terrorism, with a sustainable development plan in place. The State Department and USAID have proposed a $750 million development assistance strategy for the region. The U.S. has proposed a $750 million development assistance strategy for the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) to improve economic and social conditions, combat terrorism, and support governance, health, education, and economic development. President Musharraf imposed emergency rule in 2007, leading to a review of U.S. assistance, but no action was taken. In 2008, a new civilian government was elected, and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice recognized the democratic process. In April 2008, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice lifted coup-related sanctions on Pakistan after a democratically elected government took office in March 2008. The FY2008 budget included a $60 million emergency supplemental request to fulfill the U.S. pledge of $150 million for Pakistan, with allocations for governance, health, education, and economic development. The FY2008 emergency supplemental budget included $868.6 million for Sudan, mainly for humanitarian and peacekeeping support in Darfur. This funding was in addition to the $334.8 million Sudan received in the regular FY2008 budget and $468 million for the UNAMID peacekeeping mission. The supplemental also included $70 million for Sudan to support upcoming national elections as per the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement. The United Nations estimates that the upcoming national elections in Sudan could cost nearly $400 million due to logistical challenges in a post-conflict environment. Funding includes $70 million from the FY2008 emergency supplemental budget and $723.6 million for the African Union/United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur. Additionally, $468 million was appropriated in the Consolidated Appropriations, with $333.6 million remaining in the pending FY2008 emergency supplemental. The initiative funded entirely by the International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement Account (INCLE) aims to address criminal gang and drug trafficking activities in Mexico and Central America. Mexico would receive $500 million for border security technology and law enforcement transport, while Central American countries would get $50 million to improve border security and justice systems. Regular funding for Mexico in FY2007 was $65.4 million, with a requested $45.1 million in FY2008. Central America received $134.8 million in FY2007 and is proposed to receive $146.5 million in FY2008. Additionally, the FY2008 emergency supplemental request included $375 million to support the Palestinian Authority government. The supplemental request of $375 million supports the Palestinian Authority government, focusing on rule of law, economic growth, and governance issues. Funds are allocated for governance, health care, job creation, infrastructure, trade, investment, agriculture, budget support, training for security forces, and aid for Palestinian refugees. Congress allocated $542.6 million in emergency funds, with $155 million designated for the West Bank and Gaza. The Administration allocated $155 million of emergency funds to the West Bank and Gaza, with a total of $200 million in emergency MRA provided. $106 million in ESF funds were proposed for North Korea as part of the Six Party Talks agreement. North Korea agreed to shut down the Yongbyon nuclear facility in exchange for assistance from the U.S. and other members. The U.S. committed $131 million for humanitarian assistance, with $106 million to be provided in FY2008 supplemental funding. The omnibus bill allocated $53 million in ESF funds for North Korea. Additionally, $350 million in P.L. 480 - Title II assistance was requested for emergency food needs in Darfur, eastern Chad, and other regions. The Administration also sought $230 million for Migration and Refugee Assistance. In FY2008, $195 million was requested for humanitarian assistance to Iraqi refugees, an increase of $160 million. An additional $35 million was requested for Palestinian refugees in Gaza, West Bank, and Lebanon. $200 million was appropriated for Migration and Refugee Assistance, with $195 million allocated for Iraqi refugees. $30 million remains pending for Iraqi refugee assistance in the FY2008 supplemental request."
