The \"Environmental Improvement Timber Contract Extension Act\" defines key terms such as board feet, contract, contracting officer, mid-market criteria, and proportionality. The \"Environmental Improvement Timber Contract Extension Act\" defines terms related to timber volume stands and the purchaser, Ketchikan Pulp Company. Congress finds that a contract was made in 1951 to harvest timber from Tongass National Forest in Alaska, with the intention to provide timber for the purchaser's facilities permanently. A pulp mill in southeast Alaska is essential for creating year-round, high-paying jobs, utilizing low-grade wood, and maintaining a stable economy. The purchaser plans to improve the mill environmentally and operationally, with $200 million in total capital expenditures, $25 million already invested. A 15-year contract extension is needed for amortization of these improvements. The purchaser of a pulp mill in southeast Alaska plans to make environmental and operational improvements with a $200 million investment. The city of Ketchikan heavily relies on the mill for employment, and the purchaser aims to maintain a long-term commitment to the area by utilizing local workforce and suppliers. The management planning process in southeast Alaska focuses on sustainable forest resource utilization, including multiple-use principles, protection of air, water, land, and wildlife habitat, and the exploration of new technologies for timber harvesting optimization. The management planning process in southeast Alaska aims to maximize timber use and increase product value. It serves the national interest by ensuring proper stewardship of publicly owned assets in the Tongass National Forest, fair returns for public timber, and a balance among multiple use interests to enhance forest health and economic growth.

The contract includes a plan for timber volume, location, and schedule coordinated with the Tongass Land Management Plan. Timber volume requirements are provided in 5-year increments of 962,500,000 board feet for the purchaser to harvest orderly.
