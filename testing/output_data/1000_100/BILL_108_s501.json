    "content": "The \"Gifted and Talented Students Education Act of 2003\" establishes a grant program for gifted and talented students under Chapter B. This program includes authorized activities for supporting these students. The \"Gifted and Talented Students Education Act of 2003\" recognizes the need to provide specialized services for gifted and talented students from diverse backgrounds, including those with disabilities or English as a second language. Elementary school gifted students have already mastered a significant portion of the school year's material in various subjects. Elementary and secondary school teachers receive training to meet the needs of students with various traits and backgrounds, but often lack training for gifted students. While some gifted students have access to private programs, many high-ability students rely on public educational offerings. Gifted education programs in public schools are essential for providing equal opportunities to gifted and talented students. Parents and families play a crucial role in developing appropriate educational services for these students. Currently, there is no federal requirement to identify or serve the approximately 3,000,000 gifted and talented students in the nation. To address the disparity in resources for gifted and talented students, it is crucial to ensure that highly capable students receive the education needed to excel in innovative and creative work. This is essential for the future economic and national security needs of the United States. The performance of twelfth-grade advanced students in the United States on the TIMSS study was among the lowest globally in physics and mathematics. In 1990, minimal funding was allocated for challenging programs for gifted students in the US. If the appropriation exceeds $7,500,000 but is less than $57,500,000, competitive grants to states are authorized. If the appropriation is over $7,500,000 but under $57,500,000, the Secretary can award competitive grants to State educational agencies for gifted and talented education programs. If the appropriation equals or exceeds $57,500,000, grants can be awarded to State educational agencies for the same purpose. Grant funds provided under this chapter can be used for activities such as providing direct educational services and materials to gifted and talented students, including curriculum compacting, modified curriculum, acceleration, independent study, and dual enrollment. Grant funds may also be used for the development of curriculum packages, compensation of distance-learning educators, and other relevant activities. Grant funds provided under this chapter can be used for educational services and materials for gifted students, but not for purchasing or upgrading technological hardware. State educational agencies receiving grants must allocate no more than 10% for dissemination of program information, technical assistance, monitoring, evaluation, parental education support, or state gifted education. The State educational agency can use up to 50% of the funds for administrative costs when creating a State gifted education advisory board. SEC. 5467A. ALLOTMENTS TO STATES. From the amount allocated for programs under this chapter, the Secretary reserves a small percentage for the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The remaining funds are allotted to states based on their population of individuals aged 5 through 17. No state can receive less than half of one percent. The Secretary reserves a small percentage of funds for the Bureau of Indian Affairs from the amount allocated for programs under this chapter.

To be eligible for a grant under this chapter, a State educational agency must submit an application to the Secretary with assurances on how the funds will be used to support gifted and talented students from diverse backgrounds, make grants to local educational agencies, and ensure proper utilization of the received funds. The State educational agency must use funds to supplement, not supplant, state and local funds for gifted and talented students. They must provide matching funds of at least 10% of the grant amount and develop program assessment models for accountability. The Secretary will approve state applications that meet the requirements of the chapter. SEC. 5467C. DISTRIBUTION TO LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES. A State educational agency must allocate 90% of funds to local educational agencies through a competitive process for equitable distribution. Grants awarded should meet the needs of the students served. SEC. 5467D. LOCAL APPLICATIONS. To be eligible for a grant under this chapter, a local educational agency must submit an application to the State educational agency. The application must include assurances on how funds will be used to support gifted and talented students from diverse backgrounds, a plan to meet their educational needs, and a commitment to use funds appropriately. The local educational agency must assure that funds received will supplement, not supplant, existing funds for gifted and talented students. The State educational agency must submit an annual report to the Secretary detailing the number of students served and activities supported with funds under the Gifted and Talented Students Education Act. Recipients of funds can serve gifted students alongside those with similar needs. Private school children and teachers can also participate in the program. The Secretary ensures equitable participation of private school students and teachers in grants under the chapter, including professional development programs. Definitions are provided in SEC. 5467H. The term 'gifted and talented' is defined under applicable State law or by the State educational agency or local educational agency if the State does not have a specific law defining it. The term 'State' is defined as each of the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. Authorization of Appropriations for the Jacob K. Javits Gifted and Talented Students Education Program is set at $170,000,000 annually from 2004 to 2010. $7,500,000 is allocated for Chapter A, with the remainder for Chapter 2. Technical and conforming amendments are made to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. In section 5461 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, the term \"This part\" is replaced with \"This chapter\". The term \"this part\" is also replaced with \"this chapter\" wherever it appears. Additionally, in section 5464, subsection (c) is removed and subsections (d) and (e) are redesignated as subsections (c) and (d) respectively."
