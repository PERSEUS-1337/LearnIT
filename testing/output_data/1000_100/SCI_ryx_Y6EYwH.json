A novel differentially private estimator is proposed, extending to confidence intervals and test statistics without extra privacy budget. The method is validated on clinical datasets, showing good utility and strong privacy guarantees. The survival function estimates from patient data can lead to sensitive information disclosure, posing privacy risks. This function is used in various fields like economics, engineering, and healthcare. Protecting personal healthcare information is crucial, as violations can result in severe penalties. In the healthcare domain, information leakage is a serious issue with severe penalties. The focus of this study is on estimating the survival function using the Kaplan-Meier's non-parametric method, which is widely used in clinical research. There is a lack of models providing formal privacy guarantees for this method, with only one related work by Nguy\u00ean & Hui (2017). The study focuses on estimating the survival function using the Kaplan-Meier method in healthcare. Existing related work by Nguy\u00ean & Hui (2017) is limited to multivariate regression models and cannot provide differential privacy. Generative models like GANs could be used for this purpose but may not generalize well for small sample sizes and constrained data dimensions. The proposed method is the first to offer differential privacy for survival function estimation. The proposed method offers differential privacy for estimating the survival function based on the Kaplan-Meier method. It extends to provide private confidence intervals and test statistics without extra privacy cost. The method is also applicable for estimating the competing risk cumulative incidence function in clinical research. Empirical evidence from nine clinical datasets shows good utility and strong privacy guarantees. The method is released as an R package for easy accessibility. The survival function is essential for modeling time to event data, such as HIV infection to AIDS timeline. It accounts for censored observations and estimates the probability of not having an event by a certain time. Various methods can be used to estimate the survival function. The Kaplan-Meier estimator is a non-parametric method used to estimate the survival function in time to event data analysis. It focuses on distinct failure times and the number of failures at each time, resulting in a step function for the survival estimate. The Kaplan-Meier estimator produces a step function for survival estimates based on distinct failure times. Differential privacy ensures privacy by randomizing algorithms on similar datasets, with smaller values providing stronger guarantees. The Kaplan-Meier estimator provides survival estimates based on distinct failure times. Theorem 1 states that differential privacy is immune to post-processing, ensuring that an adversary cannot increase privacy loss by acting on the output of a differentially private algorithm. This approach allows for differentially private estimation of the survival function and accompanying statistics. In a differentially private manner, survival estimates are obtained using the Kaplan-Meier estimator. By adding noise from a Laplace distribution to a dataset matrix M, a differentially private version of M is created for preserving privacy without extra budget spending. Algorithm 1 presents a method for creating a differentially private version of a matrix M by adding noise from a Laplace distribution. The procedure is simple and requires minimal changes to the original estimation process, making it easily implementable with existing software packages. This method incurs no additional computational overhead compared to the original estimation, providing formal privacy guarantees and the ability to extend it for differentially private estimation. The proposed method for creating a differentially private version of matrix M ensures privacy guarantees by adding Laplace noise. The L1 sensitivity of M is established, and the algorithm is proven to be -differentially private. The proposed method ensures differential privacy by adding Laplace noise to matrix M. The approach allows for easy extension to include confidence intervals and test statistics for comparing survival function distributions. The proposed method ensures differential privacy by adding Laplace noise to matrix M. Confidence intervals for survival function estimates are calculated in a \"point-wise\" fashion and are -differentially private. The most often used Greenwood's linear-point-wise confidence intervals are discussed. The proposed method ensures differential privacy by adding Laplace noise to matrix M. Confidence intervals for survival function estimates are calculated in a \"point-wise\" fashion and are made differentially private. Using differentially private survival function estimates allows for obtaining differentially private confidence intervals without additional privacy cost. Hypothesis tests, such as the Logrank test, can be used to compare distribution of survival function estimates between groups, like infection rates in clinical trials. The Logrank test is commonly used in clinical trials for hypothesis testing. The test statistic Z can be made differentially private by replacing sensitive information with their private counterparts. This ensures differential privacy without compromising the accuracy of the test results. The Logrank test in clinical trials can be made differentially private by using Algorithm 1, allowing output of confidence intervals and test statistics without using additional privacy budget. Competing events like death before progression to AIDS require specialized estimates to avoid biased results, such as competing risk cumulative incidence. Using Algorithm 1, differential privacy can be extended to competing risk scenarios, ensuring that competing risk cumulative incidence is -differentially private. This method replaces quantities with their differentially private counterparts, making statistics like confidence intervals and hazard ratios also differentially private. The differentially private extension of the Nelson-Aalen estimate of cumulative hazard can be obtained using Algorithm 1. The method is evaluated on nine real-life clinical datasets with time to event information. Further details are provided in Table 1 and in the Appendix for dataset properties, pre-processing, and group comparison details. Our approach provides a differentially private estimation of the survival function, compared to the original non-private version. The evaluation on nine real-life datasets shows that our privacy-preserving estimation faithfully estimates the survival function. The privacy-preserving estimation method accurately estimates the survival function with minimal utility loss. Estimation quality decreases as privacy budget increases. Small sample sizes result in poorer utility for differential private estimation. In small datasets, large noise is added for privacy protection. Differentially private estimation works well for moderate to medium-sized datasets, even in high privacy settings. Median survival time and confidence intervals are important estimates reported with survival functions. The method estimates median survival with high precision, even in high privacy scenarios. Some cases, like Myeloid and Ovarian datasets with high survival rates, may have \"NA\" for upper bounds on confidence intervals. Our differentially private estimation performs well even in high privacy settings, with precision increasing as dataset size grows. The test statistic follows a \u03c72 distribution with one degree of freedom, maintaining statistical significance thresholds. Results for cumulative incidence using competing risk information are similar, showing good utility of our proposed method. Our proposed method provides accurate estimation of competing risk cumulative incidence while ensuring individual privacy. Previous research has explored differentially private methods for regression modeling, with limited applications to survival analysis. The first method for differentially private estimation of survival function is presented, showing its extension to other statistics like confidence intervals and test statistics. Extensive evaluation on nine real-life datasets demonstrates a good privacy-utility trade-off. The datasets used for evaluation include data on survival in patients with advanced lung cancer from the North Central Cancer Treatment Group. The dataset includes survival data for patients with advanced lung cancer, leukemia, kidney infections, monoclonal gammopathy, and acute myeloid leukemia. Time is converted into months, and groups compared are males and females. The curr_chunk compares survival data from different datasets related to acute myeloid leukemia, ovarian cancer, Stanford heart transplant, and lung cancer treatment regimens. Time is converted into months, and groups compared are different treatment arms or age groups. The curr_chunk discusses a clinical trial for primary biliary cirrhosis of the liver and a dataset on liver transplant waiting list subjects from 1990-1999. It shows results of differentially private estimation of competing risk cumulative incidence function with strong privacy guarantees. Theorem 6 proves Algorithm 1 is -differentially private. The curr_chunk discusses the differentially private estimation of competing risk cumulative incidence function with strong privacy guarantees. It compares probability density functions at an arbitrary point and shows good estimation results. The survival function estimation is differentially private.
