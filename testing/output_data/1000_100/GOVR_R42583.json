    "content": "Federal job training and employment programs aim to connect vulnerable youth to work and school. These young people are typically low-income with barriers to employment, such as dropping out of school or being in foster care. The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 provides job training and related services for unemployed and underemployed individuals, including youth. Youth job training programs under WIA are carried out by the Department of Labor and include the WIA Youth Activities formula program. The Department of Labor administers federal job training programs for youth, including WIA Youth Activities, Job Corps, and YouthBuild. These programs aim to connect youth to education, employment, leadership development, and community service. WIA funding was authorized through September 30, 2003, with potential reauthorization in the 112th Congress. This report provides an overview of WIA youth programs, focusing on Youth Activities and Job Corps, and discusses relevant provisions of H.R. 803. The relevant provisions of two bills, H.R. 803 and S. 1356, focus on job training and employment services for youth under the Workforce Investment Act of 2013. Programs include WIA Youth Activities, Job Corps, YouthBuild, Reintegration of Ex-Offenders, and Youth Opportunity Grants. The Workforce Investment Act of 2013 includes programs like WIA Youth Activities, Job Corps, YouthBuild, Reintegration of Ex-Offenders, and Youth Opportunity Grants. These programs aim to connect youth to educational and employment opportunities. The programs under the Workforce Investment Act of 2013, such as WIA Youth Activities, Job Corps, YouthBuild, Reintegration of Ex-Offenders, and Youth Opportunity Grants, aim to connect low-income youth to educational and employment opportunities. Each program serves youth with specific employment barriers, with YouthBuild specifically for high school dropouts. The programs provide employment and educational services in different ways, with Job Corps offering residential services. Job Corps is the only program offering residential services for youth, providing employment and educational support. The Reintegration of Ex-Offenders program includes mentoring, education, and reentry services. Funding for Youth Activities is allocated by DOL to states, which then distribute it to local WIBs. Job Corps centers are operated by nonprofit and for-profit organizations through competitively awarded agreements. YouthBuild and the Reintegration of Ex-Offenders program award grants to nonprofit organizations and local communities. The program competitively awards grants to nonprofit organizations and local communities. Recent hearings and listening sessions have addressed issues regarding the WIA youth programs, with a focus on the Youth Activities grant program. Stakeholders have discussed ways to improve the program through potential law refinements. During the 112th Congress, hearings were held to update the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) to meet the needs of a changing economy. The House and Senate committees discussed modernizing job training programs and reauthorizing WIA. The Senate HELP Committee released discussion drafts for amending WIA in June 2011. In the 113th Congress, the House Committee on Education and the Workforce introduced the SKILLS Act (H.R. 803) to amend and reauthorize the Workforce Investment Act. The bill was passed by the House and introduced in the Senate as the Workforce Investment Act of 2013 (S. 1356) by Senators Murray, Alexander, Harkin, and Isakson. The Senate HELP Committee marked up S. 1356 on July 31, 2013, ordering the bill reported by a vote of 18 to 3. Issues in the WIA reauthorization process include proposals to consolidate workforce programs for adults, dislocated workers, and youth. Advocates argue consolidation could increase efficiency, while others fear at-risk youth may be overlooked. Congress may need to consider the role of one-stop centers and oversight bodies if youth programs are consolidated. Coordination between workforce programs is also a concern. The perceived lack of coordination between the workforce system and other systems serving youth is a key issue. Stakeholders suggest greater coordination to meet youth needs as intended by WIA. Congress is interested in the effectiveness of youth workforce programs, with ongoing impact evaluations for Job Corps and YouthBuild. Specific concerns include eligibility requirements for Youth Activities and Job Corps programs. State and local workforce officials have concerns about income eligibility requirements for youth programs, including challenges in obtaining proof of income. There is debate over whether the program should focus on serving older youth, with questions about targeting those ages 22-24. Stakeholders also raise issues about the school status of youth in the program. The Youth Activities program is under scrutiny for its focus on out-of-school youth and age eligibility. Congress is considering funding for Job Corps centers due to mixed performance outcomes. A 2011 report by the Government Accountability Office highlighted overlapping services in federal workforce programs, with varying models of program services. The Government Accountability Office recommended consolidating administration of selected workforce programs, including the Employment Service and training services under Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. Legislation in the 113th Congress aimed to consolidate various workforce programs, such as Youth Activities, YouthBuild, and Reintegration of Ex-Offenders. The 113th Congress aimed to consolidate various workforce programs, including YouthBuild and Reintegration of Ex-Offenders, into a single Workforce Investment Fund allocated to states for employment and training activities. Required activities would include providing \"work ready services\" in the one-stop delivery system, with funding based on factors like the number of disadvantaged youth in each state. The bill aims to distribute funding to local workforce investment areas based on factors like the number of disadvantaged youth in each state. States must set aside funding from the Workforce Investment Fund to establish a grant program for individuals with barriers to employment, including low-income youth aged 16 and older. State and local workforce plans must outline strategies to assist at-risk and out-of-school youth in acquiring education and skills. The bill aims to assist at-risk youth and out-of-school youth in acquiring education, skills, credentials, and employment experience for success in the labor market. It defines \"at-risk youth\" as those ages 16 through 24 who are low-income and high school dropouts, youth in foster care, youth offenders, youth with disabilities, children of incarcerated parents, or migrant youth. Chairman Kline emphasized the benefits of consolidating workforce programs to eliminate duplication and ensure accountability. Some policymakers are concerned that the proposed Workforce Innovation Fund (WIF) may serve fewer youth due to the lack of a set-aside funding for them. The bill, S. 1356, aims to maintain youth programs and introduce Youth Innovation and Replication Grants (YIRG) to improve education and employment outcomes for youth through competitive grants to states and localities. Congress may need to consider the implications of consolidating youth programs with other workforce initiatives. One-stop centers play a crucial role in connecting youth to job training and employment services. These centers attract youth through various methods like active recruitment and specialized staff training. However, some areas face challenges in attracting youth to these centers. Some local areas struggle to attract youth to one-stop centers, requiring referrals or school involvement. Recommendations include better training for staff on youth matters and increased targeting of youth by one-stop centers through funding and guidance from DOL. The bills H.R. 803 and S. 1356 require states to fund one-stop centers for youth services, but do not specify how youth will be served. Local Workforce Investment Boards have youth councils responsible for coordinating services for eligible youth. The National Youth Employment Coalition (NYEC) has documented challenges faced by youth councils in developing beyond advisory roles to Workforce Investment Boards (WIBs). Some councils struggle to engage youth and parents due to transportation issues and conflicting schedules. A 2002 report identified enabling conditions for innovative youth councils to enhance service delivery. Innovative youth councils have developed a comprehensive system for youth activities under the Youth program. Conditions for their success include an established intermediary organization, strong school-to-career partnerships, and a community-wide planning process. Stakeholders suggest giving youth councils a stronger role for greater flexibility in partnerships and priorities. Stakeholders recommend that youth councils develop a comprehensive plan to coordinate activities and funding streams. Reauthorization legislation may make youth councils optional, with a focus on addressing the needs of vulnerable youth. State boards would be required to have representatives with youth interests, while local workforce development boards would need to establish standing committees. The bill proposes that local workforce development boards establish standing committees for the one-stop system, youth services, and disability services. These committees would provide information and assistance for planning and operational issues related to youth services, including involvement of successful community-based organizations. Existing entities can fulfill these requirements if they meet the criteria. Congress may consider best practices from youth councils to improve coordination between the workforce system and other systems. The lack of coordination between the workforce system and other systems serving youth is a key issue in programs like WIA. WIA includes provisions for coordination with the education system, such as requiring local boards to have representatives from education entities. Stakeholders suggest that better coordination can meet the needs of youth as intended by WIA. This issue was discussed at a Senate HELP Committee listening session on WIA and youth in 2004. The Senate HELP Committee's listening session on WIA and youth in 2004 highlighted the collaboration between workforce and education systems, as documented in a 2004 report by the Government Accountability Office on the Youth Activities program. The report found that about half of all youth received services through various entities, but some educators were hesitant to partner due to perceived inconsistencies with schools' academic mission. In Wisconsin, some schools hesitated to allow WIA Youth Activities on school grounds due to stigma. The Department of Labor and Department of Education collaborate to ensure all youth receive necessary services and support. Past collaboration includes the School-to-Work program, which provided grants for work-based programs. The grants supported programs combining work-based learning in schools, school-based learning in the workplace, and job training. Lessons from the STW program can inform Congress on school-work partnerships. H.R. 803 includes provisions for workforce and education system coordination, but it is not explicit. Local areas may include education officials on workforce investment boards under the bill. Local plans must identify strategies for assisting youth in acquiring education and skills. The Senate bill S. 1356 aims to coordinate workforce and education systems by requiring states to submit a Unified State Plan every four years. This plan covers various programs under WIA and includes elements like analyzing state economic conditions and setting goals for preparing a skilled workforce, including youth. The current law allows states to submit a unified plan covering WIA Title I, WIA Title II, and activities under the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education programs. Concerns exist about the effectiveness of youth programs under WIA for at-risk youth. Evaluations of Youth Activities, Job Corps, and YouthBuild programs are limited. The programs have generally met or exceeded goals under common performance measures. Section 172 of WIA mandates continuous program evaluation by the Department of Labor. The Department of Labor is required to continuously evaluate programs authorized under Title I of WIA, including their effectiveness and cost. Legislation from the 113th Congress would mandate independent evaluations of WIA programs every five years. Limited information exists on the effectiveness of these programs, with only a few having undergone impact studies since 2004. The Department of Labor is required to evaluate programs authorized under WIA for effectiveness. Limited information exists on the impacts of these programs, making it difficult for policymakers to determine their effectiveness. Youth Activities program has not been formally evaluated for impacts, but some studies have focused on its implementation. DOL has contracted a research organization to evaluate the impact of YouthBuild program. The Department of Labor is working with a research organization to evaluate the impact of YouthBuild program on youth employment. They have also completed a process evaluation of the Job Corps program to identify practices associated with center performance. The Job Corps program was rigorously evaluated in the late 1990s to early 2000s, showing positive outcomes in education and employment for youth ages 16-24. A follow-up report analyzed longer-term impacts on earnings and employment rates 5-10 years later. After 5 to 10 years, positive employment effects of the Job Corps program diminished for sample members aged 26-34. However, older youth aged 20-24 at the time of program application saw increased earnings. The discussion also covers performance measures for Youth Activities, Job Corps, and YouthBuild programs, addressing concerns about disincentives for serving youth with the greatest needs. H.R. 803, the WIA reauthorization bill, aims to replace current youth performance measures with new indicators for Workforce Investment Fund activities. These new measures include entry and retention in unsubsidized employment, earnings change, credential attainment, and participation in education or training programs. S. 1356 establishes six performance indicators for eligible youth in WIA Youth Activities programs, including entry into education, training, or employment, retention in these activities, earnings, credential attainment, skills gains, and program effectiveness in serving employers. States may add more indicators, and the DOL Secretary must establish performance measures. S. 1356 requires the DOL Secretary to establish performance measures for Job Corps center operators based on six indicators of performance for youth eligible under Youth Activities. Section 136 of WIA outlines state and local performance measures to assess the effectiveness of workforce investment activities funded under this subtitle. State performance measures include core indicators for youth ages 14 through 18 and any additional indicators identified by individual states. The core indicators for youth ages 14-18 and 19-21 are different, with states negotiating performance levels with DOL. Stakeholders argue that current measures may not capture gains for at-risk youth, potentially leading programs to focus on higher-functioning individuals to meet targets. The Government Accountability Office found that some youth programs funded with Youth Activities dollars only accepted young people at specific grade levels to meet program goals. Department of Labor issued guidance in 2010 to help service providers assist lower-skilled youth while still achieving performance targets. The Government Accountability Office identified six strategies to improve youth programs funded with Youth Activities dollars, including multiyear contracting, basing enrollment goals on total participant count, using real-time indicators for provider performance assessment, factoring participant characteristics into goal negotiations, creating positive incentives for enrolling at-risk youth, and promoting interagency collaboration for youth services. These strategies aim to enhance program flexibility and effectiveness. The 2010 DOL guidance encourages local WIBs to adopt \"real-time\" indicators like changes in attitudes, behaviors, knowledge, and skills for youth programs. Some suggest adjusting performance levels for serving higher-risk youth populations. The Job Training Partnership Act allowed for adjustments to national performance standards based on economic and demographic factors in order to serve challenging youth populations. This process aimed to level the playing field across different local areas. The Job Training Partnership Act allowed for adjustments to national performance standards based on economic and demographic factors to serve challenging youth populations. Job Corps under WIA established over 20 core performance metrics, including measures for entered employment, average wage, and retention in postsecondary education or employment. DOL implemented an additional 33 performance metrics to assess program performance, developed from DOL policy and the Government Performance and Results Act. A 2011 report by the DOL Inspector General raised concerns about Job Corps' implementation of performance metrics. The Office of Job Corps reported inaccurate results for some metrics, did not establish targets for others, and miscalculated program participant costs. YouthBuild program applicants must include a description of results to be achieved, as required by WIA. The final regulation for YouthBuild, issued in February 2012, addresses performance indicators for grantees, including placement in employment or education, attainment of a degree, and literacy and numeracy gains. The Department of Labor (DOL) has issued guidance to YouthBuild program grantees regarding performance indicators, including placement in employment or education, attainment of a degree, and literacy and numeracy gains. DOL also includes retention and recidivism rates as additional goals for the program. Since the start of the Youth Activities program, stakeholders have debated the eligibility requirements for participants, including the focus on out-of-school and older youth. Under H.R. 803, states and local areas would need strategies to assist at-risk youth, but no specific quotas or funding requirements are mandated. The Youth Activities program eligibility requirements include being age 14-21, low-income, and facing barriers like literacy deficiencies or homelessness. There is debate over the need for proof of low-income status, with challenges in documenting income eligibility reported by state and local officials. State and local officials reported challenges in obtaining necessary documentation for WIA Youth program eligibility, diverting resources from service delivery. GAO examined states' implementation of WIA Youth program and other federal programs funded by ARRA. Officials noted difficulties for youth in proving eligibility, especially regarding income requirements and other criteria like foster care involvement. Under WIA, DOL can waive certain requirements for states or local areas, but not for participant eligibility. States and local governments have the authority to establish their own policies for verifying eligibility, including for youth involved in foster care, juvenile justice, or homelessness. Some states have requested waivers for certain criteria, such as criminal records, to help youth who may have difficulty providing documentation. Some stakeholders believe that WIA lacks flexibility in verifying income and eligibility criteria. States and localities have preferred using eligibility criteria from WIA's predecessor, JTPA. In-school youth were eligible if they qualified for free lunch or participated in Title I programs for low-income districts. Out-of-school youth were eligible if they were economically disadvantaged. Some stakeholders suggest expanding eligibility criteria for out-of-school youth, including residency in high-poverty areas or specific risk factors like dropouts or homeless youth. It is uncertain how changing eligibility requirements would impact the number of eligible youth or the services they receive. The Youth Activities program faces challenges in focusing on out-of-school youth as required by WIA. GAO reports show difficulties in recruiting and retaining these youth due to higher costs and maintaining contact. Some stakeholders suggest allocating more WIA Youth funding to dropouts and high-risk youth, including those in school with insufficient credits. Previous legislation aimed to prioritize out-of-school youth, while others advocate for maintaining current funding but enhancing technical assistance for their needs. The Department of Labor (DOL) has provided guidance and funding to support out-of-school youth and at-risk in-school youth. This includes recommending strong alternative education programs for dropouts and youth at risk of dropping out. DOL also funded the Multiple Education Pathways Blueprint Grants to reconnect youth who have dropped out to multiple education pathways. The Department of Labor (DOL) has supported out-of-school youth and at-risk in-school youth through various programs. Some successful strategies included providing technical assistance, resources, and contracting with service providers for GED and vocational training programs. Youth aged 14-21 are eligible for WIA services, with the age limit temporarily expanded to 24 in 2009. The upper age limit for accessing WIA Youth services was expanded to reach more unemployed young adults. Research suggests that many young people are taking longer to transition to adulthood due to various factors. Challenges for vulnerable youth include family conflict, obstacles to employment, and being disconnected from work or school. The WIA Youth program may need to consider targeting older disconnected youth, but expanding the age limit could strain resources. Around 7% of youth in the program were ages 22-24, indicating a potential increase in demand for services if the age limit is raised. DOL allows co-enrollment of older youth in both Youth and Adult programs to meet individual needs. The Youth program allows older youth to receive mentoring services and funding for occupational skills training. It is unclear if youth ages 18-21 self-select or are encouraged to participate in the Youth program, Adult program, or both. Exiters ages 19-21 in the Youth program have increased, compared to youth ages 18-21 in the Adult program. The Youth program offers academic services like tutoring and secondary school options, while the Adult program focuses on job search assistance and workplace training with related instruction. Both programs provide occupational skills training and links to employment, with the Youth program emphasizing leadership development and community service activities. The Adult program focuses on job counseling during the intensive phase, while the Youth program offers academic services and emphasizes leadership development. The Adult program provides referrals to supportive services like child care and transportation, while the Youth program offers adult mentoring and counseling for drug and alcohol abuse. The Department of Labor published a request for comment on selecting low-performing centers for closure based on performance criteria. The Department of Labor (DOL) is considering closing low-performing centers based on performance criteria including performance rating, on-board strength, and facility condition. DOL aims to keep at least one center in each state, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, while exempting certain centers and considering the impact on specific student subpopulations. This is part of DOL's reform efforts. The Department of Labor is considering closing low-performing centers as part of its reform agenda to improve performance outcomes. While cost is not cited as a driving factor, budget constraints emphasize the need to maximize resources for students and taxpayers. H.R. 803 includes provisions to improve and potentially close underperforming centers, with new performance measures and a requirement for a one-year program improvement plan for struggling centers. The bill H.R. 803 aims to develop a program improvement plan for centers reporting less than 50% on performance indicators and close low-performing centers after four consecutive years. The DOL Secretary will conduct an audit ranking centers based on performance and violence incidents, with a report to Congress identifying bottom-ranked centers. Within 12 months, the Secretary will close the bottom quintile centers. The Reagan Administration and legislation in the 104th Congress proposed closing underperforming Job Corps centers based on various criteria, but ultimately, the centers were not closed. The proposal also suggested transferring Job Corps operations from the federal government to the states. The Reagan Administration and legislation in the 104th Congress proposed transferring Job Corps operations from the federal government to the states, citing states' ability to manage centers integrated with their workforce development systems. Some Members raised concerns about potential decreases in student attendance and limited access to out-of-state programs. The Workforce Investment Act of 2013 also addressed changes to Job Corps. The Workforce Investment Act of 2013 (S. 1356) would direct the Secretary to determine center closures, establish performance levels for Youth Activities, develop a performance improvement plan, and implement actions within a one-year period. Common measures are performance metrics used in various workforce programs. The Workforce Investment Act of 2013 (S. 1356) would direct the Secretary to determine center closures, establish performance levels for Youth Activities, develop a performance improvement plan, and implement actions within a one-year period. Common measures include placement in employment or education, attainment of a degree or education, and literacy and numeracy gains. ETA first implemented a common measures policy in 2003 for workforce programs to collect, record, and report program performance. ETA introduced three measures for youth in programs like Youth Activities and Job Corps. ETA issued additional policy guidance on common measures to streamline data collection on performance. The common measures are used to assess program performance under the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA). Goals for the common measures are set at the higher end to be ambitious. Program goals may need to be adjusted for individual grantees. Data for YouthBuild is based on aggregated program data from the 2007 grant cycle. The Department of Labor (DOL) sets performance targets for programs like Youth Activities, YouthBuild, and Job Corps using regression analysis. Factors considered include program results, labor market conditions, and individual characteristics to adjust for economic influences. Targets for placement in employment or education are based on economic assumptions and program results. The Youth Activities program exceeded goals in PY2011 and PY2012. Placement in Employment or Education measures the share of youth enrolled in postsecondary education or employed in the first quarter after the program. Attainment of a Degree or Certificate tracks those enrolled in education or training during program participation. The measure tracks the attainment of a diploma, GED, or certificate by youth participants after program completion. It excludes postsecondary students and work readiness certificates. Another measure focuses on literacy or numeracy gains for youth not in school who improve their basic skills. The measure tracks the educational progress of out-of-school youth participants by assessing their reading, writing, and math skills before and after program completion. Individuals who are not basic skills-deficient are excluded from this measure to focus on those who need assistance. The measure excludes individuals who are not basic skills-deficient to focus on youth who need remediation and eliminate testing burden. DOL provides guidance on types of tests for literacy and numeracy gains, and accommodations for students with disabilities."
