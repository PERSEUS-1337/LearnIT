    "content": "The \"Spending Safeguard Act\" may be cited as the short title of this legislation. It includes a spending limitation on direct spending programs. The Spending Safeguard Act establishes a spending limitation for direct spending programs, set by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget within 90 days of enactment. The limitation is determined based on the program's cost, ranging from 120 percent for certain programs within specific budget functions. The Director determines the cost of direct spending programs based on a six-year estimate using scorecards or estimates under the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act. A spending safeguard limitation scorecard is maintained and publicly available for programs subject to this Act. The Secretary of the Treasury must report monthly spending for direct spending programs to the Director. The Director submits a biannual report to Congress on total spending and its relation to spending limitations. President's budget submissions are required annually. The Director must report on total spending for direct spending programs subject to spending safeguard limitations. If a breach is detected, a report must be submitted to Congress. If a direct spending program reaches the spending safeguard limitation, the Director must report to Congress within 15 days. After such a determination, no funds can be obligated for the program, and a report must be submitted to the Committees on the Budget of the House of Representatives and the Senate. The Director must report to Congress if a direct spending program reaches the spending safeguard limitation. No funds can be obligated for the program after this determination, and information must be provided to program participants about the impact on future fund availability. Definitions for \"Director\" and \"direct spending\" are provided in the Act. The Deficit Control Act of 1985 defines a direct spending program as a federal program funded by direct spending without a specific level of authorization of appropriations in statute. No additional funds are authorized to be appropriated for this Act."
