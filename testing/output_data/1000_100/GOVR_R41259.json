    "content": "North Korea's development of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons, along with illicit activities, has been a persistent challenge for U.S. foreign policy. The U.S. has never had formal diplomatic relations with North Korea and has used negotiations, aid, and sanctions to address the issue without success. U.S. interests in North Korea include security, political, and human rights concerns due to military alliances with South Korea and Japan. The U.S. faces challenges from North Korea's nuclear weapons program, with alliances with South Korea and Japan requiring defense against North Korean attacks. Tensions are heightened by North Korea's advancements in missile capabilities, posing a potential threat to the U.S. homeland. The situation also impacts regional and global economies, influencing diplomatic relations with major powers like China and South Korea. Dealing with North Korea's totalitarian regime presents complex geostrategic challenges. North Korea, with a totalitarian regime founded on self-reliance, has resisted outside influences and built a large military over the past 70 years. This militarization acts as a deterrent to foreign intervention and allows Pyongyang to extract concessions from neighbors. North Korea's militarization deters foreign intervention and allows the regime to extract concessions from neighbors. However, this militarization, combined with provocative behavior and opaque policymaking, hinders economic growth by limiting interactions with the outside world. Despite signs of economic strengthening, internal conditions in North Korea remain challenging, with widespread poverty and potential discontent if growth falters. Congress influences U.S. policy on North Korea through sanctions legislation, shaping trade restrictions and the President's ability to ease sanctions. Congress plays a significant role in shaping U.S. policy towards North Korea, including authorizing funds for aid and addressing human rights issues. They hold hearings to question North Korea's capabilities, intentions, and sanctions evasion. North Korea's rapid advances in missile and nuclear weapons capabilities have shifted U.S. policymakers' assessment of the regime's threat. Recent tests have shown that North Korea is capable of striking the continental United States with a nuclear-armed ballistic missile, making it a top-line U.S. foreign policy and national security concern. Pyongyang's threats have increased in various domains, including nuclear weapons, missile technology, artillery, and cyberattacks. North Korea has demonstrated its nuclear capabilities through multiple tests, including its most powerful sixth test in 2017. It has also shown the ability to reach the continental United States with missiles. Additionally, North Korea is developing a submarine-based ballistic missile program to evade U.S. defenses. The Trump Administration blamed North Korea for the \"WannaCry\" cyberattack, highlighting their disruptive cyber capabilities. The administration initially responded with a \"maximum pressure\" policy to coerce Pyongyang through economic and diplomatic measures. The Trump Administration employed economic and diplomatic measures to pressure North Korea, leading the UNSC to pass four new sanctions resolutions. This policy aimed to persuade China and other countries to cut ties with North Korea and strengthen alliances to counter new threats. The Trump Administration's approach to North Korea involved pressuring countries to cut ties with North Korea beyond UNSC requirements. There were contradictory statements on launching a preventive strike, causing confusion about U.S. policy. North Korea accepted an invitation to the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea, signaling a potential easing of tensions. Pyongyang's high-level delegation, including Kim Jong-un's sister, led to warmer North-South relations. President Trump accepted an invitation to meet with Kim before the Singapore Summit. Kim's diplomatic efforts followed harsh rhetoric and sanctions, driving him towards diplomacy. Kim Jong-un's diplomatic efforts were influenced by punishing sanctions, Moon Jae-in's outreach, and his confidence in his nuclear deterrent. Trump and Kim met in Singapore to discuss North Korea's nuclear program and future relations. The summit resulted in a brief joint statement committing to security guarantees and denuclearization. The document outlines key principles in four areas: normalization of relations, building a lasting peace regime, denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and recovering POW/MIA remains. It does not mention North Korea's ballistic missile program. Follow-on negotiations will be led by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Trump announced the suspension of annual U.S.-South Korea military exercises. Trump called the military exercises \"war games\" and \"provocative,\" surprising South Korea and U.S. military commanders. He mentioned saving money and possibly withdrawing U.S. troops from South Korea. The Defense Department canceled the annual U.S.-South Korea exercises. Analysts noted similarities to previous agreements with North Korea. Supporters highlight the suspension of missile and nuclear tests, while critics point out the lack of a timeframe for denuclearization verification. The lack of a timeframe or verification mechanisms for denuclearization, Kim's non-commitment to dismantle DPRK's ballistic missile program, and uncertainties regarding denuclearization definition, sequencing, peace regime, and diplomatic ties were highlighted. Analysts suspect North Korea's push for a peace treaty before denuclearization talks is a tactic to delay and gain recognition as a nuclear state. Maintaining sanctions momentum amid engagement efforts is challenging. The UNSC has imposed sanctions on North Korea since 2006, with a total of 10 resolutions adopted by December 2017. These sanctions target arms sales and materials that could aid North Korea's weapons programs. Since 2006, the UNSC has imposed sanctions on North Korea targeting arms sales, materials aiding WMD programs, luxury goods transfers, and entities involved in WMD activities. The fourth nuclear test in January 2016 led to expanded U.N. sanctions, with six resolutions adopted by December 2017. These sanctions ban financial interactions, trade in various sectors, and interactions with North Korea in broad activities, resulting in the prohibition of most major North Korean export items in international markets. The value of North Korean exports in 2017 declined by over 30% compared to 2016. The US, under Obama and Trump Administrations, pushed countries globally to cut ties with North Korea beyond UNSC requirements. It is uncertain if the Trump Administration continued this approach after diplomatic outreach in 2018. The US imposed unilateral sanctions on North Korea, with Presidents Bush, Obama, and Trump issuing executive orders targeting North Korean entities. In 2016, North Korea was designated as a primary money laundering concern, and in 2017, it was redesignated as a state sponsor of terrorism. Congress passed two North Korea-specific statutes since 2015, imposing sanctions that limit trade to humanitarian goods, prohibit financial transactions, new investments, and give the President authority to restrict certain sectors. U.S. foreign aid to North Korea is minimal and emergency-based. U.S. foreign aid to North Korea is minimal and emergency-based, administered through centrally funded programs to prevent the government from benefiting. U.S. persons are prohibited from trading with designated North Korean entities, vessels, and individuals. Foreign financial institutions could face sanctions for facilitating transactions for DPRK entities. U.S. travel to North Korea is restricted and requires a special validation passport. North Korea's demands in negotiations regarding its weapons programs have been inconsistent. North Korea's behavior towards its nuclear weapons programs has been inconsistent, with a mix of limited cooperation and overt provocations. Pyongyang's willingness to negotiate is often driven by internal conditions like food shortages or economic desperation. The regime has tested long-range ballistic missiles and conducted multiple nuclear tests over the past two decades. North Korea is adept at exploiting divisions among other parties involved in negotiations. North Korea has exploited divisions among parties and used political transitions to stall nuclear negotiations. Analysts argue negotiations are necessary to reduce conflict and feasible due to Kim Jong-un's focus on economic development. A basic bargain could involve a more secure relationship with the US, an end to the Korean War, economic benefits, and sanctions removal in exchange for denuclearization. Kim Jong-un's emphasis on economic development in 2018 is seen as a sign of potential denuclearization. Many analysts doubt North Korea's willingness to give up its nuclear weapons capability, viewing their demands as tactical moves essential for regime survival. Despite discussions of denuclearization in 2018, Pyongyang's frequent statements reaffirming its nuclear program raise doubts about its intentions. North Korea has consistently reaffirmed its nuclear weapons program, stating that its nuclear weapons are not negotiable and will not be relinquished even for large sums of money. The country declared itself a \"nuclear-armed nation\" in 2012 and emphasized the importance of completing its state nuclear force in 2017. North Korea has also indicated that it will only consider giving up its nuclear stockpile once all nuclear weapons are eliminated worldwide. The 2011 multinational military intervention in Libya may have inadvertently reinforced the value of nuclear arms for regime security. The 2018 Singapore summit with North Korea conferred legitimacy as a nuclear state, meeting past demands such as canceling military exercises and easing sanctions. Prior to the Trump Administration's efforts, the United States engaged in four major sets of formal nuclear and missile negotiations with North Korea, including the bilateral Agreed Framework, bilateral missile negotiations, multilateral Six-Party Talks, and bilateral Leap Day Deal. The proposed formula for these negotiations involved North Korea halting its nuclear or missile programs in exchange for economic and diplomatic concessions. In 1986, U.S. intelligence detected the startup of a plutonium production reactor and reprocessing plant at Yongbyon, not subject to international monitoring as required by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. North Korea announced its intention to withdraw from the NPT and faced discussions of sanctions at the UNSC. A preemptive military strike was considered, but diplomatic efforts led to the U.S.-North Korea 1994 Agreed Framework, where North Korea agreed to freeze its plutonium program in exchange for nuclear power plants and fuel oil. The 1994 Agreed Framework with North Korea faced delays in reactor construction and funding. Despite this, North Korea froze its plutonium program, received heavy fuel oil, and started building light-water reactors. However, North Korea failed to declare all nuclear facilities to the IAEA and was confronted by the US in 2002 for a suspected uranium enrichment program. This led to the US halting fuel oil shipments and reactor construction, prompting North Korea to expel IAEA inspectors, withdraw from the NPT, and restart its reactor and reprocessing facility. In response to congressional pressure, the Clinton Administration began negotiations with North Korea in 1996 to curb its missile program. North Korea agreed to a moratorium on long-range missile testing in 1999 in exchange for lifting some U.S. sanctions. Talks continued, but a final agreement was not reached. North Korea maintained the moratorium until 2006. Under the George W. Bush Administration, the Six-Party Talks involving China, South Korea, Japan, and Russia aimed to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue. Despite occasional progress, the talks ultimately failed to address North Korea's nuclear arms. A promising breakthrough in 2005 led to a Joint Statement where North Korea agreed to abandon its nuclear weapons programs in exchange for aid and security guarantees. However, the process broke down due to disagreements on verifying North Korea's compliance. The Obama Administration's \"strategic patience\" policy towards North Korea focused on pressuring Pyongyang to return to negotiations. The Obama Administration's policy towards North Korea focused on pressuring Pyongyang to return to the Six-Party Talks, coordinating with allies, convincing China to take a tougher stance, and applying pressure through sanctions and arms interdictions. The US sought a comprehensive deal for North Korea's denuclearization in exchange for normalization of relations and aid, but insisted on a freeze of nuclear activities and testing. Military exercises were conducted to showcase the US-South Korean alliance's strength. The Obama Administration implemented multilateral and unilateral sanctions on North Korea, targeting entities involved in weapons of mass destruction and illicit activities. This included seizing assets of designated DPRK officials after the Sony cyberattack. Despite efforts for engagement, provocations by Pyongyang stalled progress. After Obama took office, provocations by Pyongyang halted progress on negotiations. The US focused on building consensus at the UNSC and pressuring North Korea through multilateral sanctions. The \"Leap Day Agreement\" in February 2012 committed North Korea to a moratorium on nuclear tests and missile launches in exchange for assistance, but North Korea scuttled the deal two months later. China plays a crucial role in U.S. policy towards North Korea, being its largest trading partner and providing essential aid to the regime. Despite voting for sanctions, China prioritizes stability on the Korean Peninsula to prevent North Korea's collapse. Analysts believe Beijing fears the consequences of a humanitarian crisis and significant refugee flows. China's strategic value in having North Korea as a buffer between itself and South Korea often obstructs U.S. efforts to impose harsher punishments on North Korea. Chinese enforcement of sanctions against North Korea has been inconsistent, but there were indications of increased enforcement in 2017, possibly to dissuade the United States from taking further action. Chinese enforcement of UNSC sanctions against North Korea has been inconsistent, possibly to dissuade the United States from military action. Beijing's limited trade and aid to North Korea may be to avoid appearing as an enabler of a rogue regime. Relations between Beijing and Pyongyang soured after Kim Jong-un's rise to power in 2011, with China displeased by his actions, including the execution of his uncle Jang Song-taek in 2013. Chinese President Xi Jinping had summits with former South Korean President Park Geun-hye and current President Moon, but not with Kim. Chinese academics called for a reassessment of ties with North Korea due to costs. Chinese public opinion turned against North Korea, with many favoring a U.S. airstrike. China agreed to strict UNSC sanctions in 2017 and seemed to be implementing them. Trump and Kim's diplomatic efforts in 2018 improved North Korea-China relations. The opening in 2018 restored the North Korea-China relationship. Kim traveled to Beijing to reaffirm ties before meeting Trump. Kim's achievements in deescalation and diplomacy gave him leverage with China. Kim Jong-un is the third generation of the Kim family to rule North Korea. Kim Jong-un's bold emergence on the global stage in 2018 suggests he has consolidated power in North Korea. He has pursued a two-track policy of economic development and nuclear weapons, rejecting external pressure to choose between the two. Kim has achieved a \"limited nuclear deterrent\" and is now focusing on improving the country's economy. Kim Jong-un has pursued economic opportunities through a \"charm offensive\" with South Korea and China, while also achieving a temporary breakthrough with the United States to avoid harsher sanctions. Despite initial hopes of political reform, Kim's ruthless consolidation of power shows his commitment to maintaining the dynastic dictatorship. Since becoming supreme leader in 2011, Kim has executed purges of senior officials, including his uncle by marriage in 2013 and his half-brother in 2017. Kim Jong-un has displayed a different ruling style than his father, allowing Western influences and being informal in public appearances. His wife has been introduced to the North Korean public, but their children remain hidden. Analysts see these changes as Kim's attempt to appear young and modern. Kim Jong-un's stylistic changes aim to project a youthful and modern image, reminiscent of his grandfather Kim Il-Sung's \"man of the people\" persona. Despite North Korea's economic challenges, Kim's economic policies have led to growth and improved living standards for many citizens. Increased domestic production and sanctions-evasion efforts have helped North Korea withstand international sanctions since 2016. North Korea's exports declined in 2016-2017 due to stricter sanctions. Kim Jong-un has allowed market principles in some sectors, legalizing consumer and business markets. He emphasizes domestic manufacturing and trade with China, which accounts for over 90% of North Korea's trade. Agricultural liberalization and improved planting conditions have also contributed to economic changes. Agricultural liberalization and favorable planting conditions have led to larger harvests in North Korea since 2010. Despite stable food prices since 2012, over 10 million North Koreans still suffer from food insecurity and undernutrition. Analysts question the extent of Kim's economic reforms, as private enterprise is prohibited by the penal code. The North Korean regime prohibits private enterprise and tightly controls market activity. Access to healthcare is limited, with most hospitals in poor condition and only the elite having access to better facilities in Pyongyang. The regime determines where families can live based on loyalty, restricting access to quality medical care for many. The North Korean regime restricts access to quality medical care for many citizens. Pyongyang is losing control over information flows, with some turning to outside sources of news despite government efforts to prevent it. Defectors report that some citizens have illegal radios to listen to foreign broadcasts. North Korea restarted a mobile phone network in 2009 with over 3 million subscribers in 2017. The regime allows increased mobile-phone use for surveillance. Chinese cellphones are used near the border for international calls. Despite monitoring, cell phones enable faster dissemination of information. Spreading outside information in North Korea could lead to positive political changes. Increased access to information in North Korea, including through mobile phones, could weaken the regime's control by informing citizens about their living conditions and encouraging them to question their government. Thae Yong-ho, a defector, believes that outside sources of information could be the regime's \"Achilles Heel.\" The regime has long indoctrinated its citizens to portray the outside world as inferior, but exposure to reality could lead to positive political changes. The North Korean military, one of the largest in the world, has a significant presence near the demilitarized zone border with South Korea. They focus on developing WMD capabilities, including nuclear weapons and long-range ballistic missiles, to offset deficiencies in their conventional forces. Additionally, North Korea possesses a stockpile of chemical weapons and potentially biological weapons. North Korea has developed offensive cyber operations capabilities and is considered one of the top cyber threats to the United States in 2018. South Korea's Defense Ministry reports that North Korea has 6,000 cyber warfare troops. Despite a decline in conventional military capabilities, North Korea could still cause significant damage to Seoul with artillery and rocket attacks. Experts believe the US and South Korea would ultimately prevail in a war on the Korean Peninsula, but at a high cost. Analysts estimate that North Korean artillery forces, hidden in underground facilities, could unleash devastating attacks. North Korean artillery forces, based on outdated Soviet designs, could fire thousands of rounds at Seoul in the first hour of a war. To compensate for its obsolete traditional forces, North Korea has focused on improving asymmetric capabilities like UAVs, cyber operations, special forces, GPS jamming, and electromagnetic pulse. Recent advancements include long-range artillery, tanks, infantry weapons, UAVs, submarines, and special operations. North Korea has developed various military capabilities including vehicles, surface-to-air missiles, ballistic missile-capable submarines, and special operations forces. The military suffers from institutional weaknesses due to a highly centralized command and control structure, lack of training for mid-level officers, and general resource scarcity affecting readiness. The U.S. remains concerned about North Korea's nuclear weapons development and doubts Pyongyang's commitment to denuclearization. Logistical shortages could hinder troop travel, lack of spare parts may affect equipment availability, and food shortages could impact North Korean forces' endurance in combat. North Korea's nuclear arsenal is seen as crucial for its survival, with a focus on developing smaller, lighter, and more diverse warheads. The regime has conducted multiple nuclear tests, including a hydrogen bomb test in 2017 aimed at perfecting delivery on an intercontinental ballistic missile. The U.S. and international community have expressed concerns about North Korea's nuclear weapons program. North Korea's nuclear program began in the late 1950s with cooperation agreements with the Soviet Union on a nuclear research program near Yongbyon. Its first research reactor began operation in 1967. North Korea used indigenous expertise and foreign procurements to build a small (5MW(e)) nuclear reactor at Yongbyon capable of producing about 6 kilograms of plutonium per year. Despite announcing the closure of its test site in 2018, fissile material production and related facilities remain operational. North Korea's nuclear program includes a 5MW(e) reactor at Yongbyon producing plutonium. The country has also developed a reprocessing plant, uranium enrichment facility, and experimental light water reactor. Estimates suggest North Korea has produced 30-40 kilograms of plutonium for nuclear weapons. Additionally, there is evidence of a second route to a bomb using highly enriched uranium. North Korea openly acknowledged a uranium enrichment program in 2009, with a 100 MWT light-water reactor and gas centrifuge uranium enrichment plant shown in 2010 at Yongbyon. U.S. officials suspect other clandestine enrichment facilities, with one identified at Kangson in 2018. Lack of transparency makes it difficult to estimate warhead and material stockpiles. Recent scholarly analyses provide low, medium, and high scenarios for the amount. Recent scholarly analyses provide low, medium, and high scenarios for North Korea's potential production of fissile material by 2020, estimating a range of 20 to 100 warheads. Despite international condemnation, North Korea has prioritized the development of its ballistic missile technology, conducting numerous test launches since Kim Jong-un came to power in 2011. In 2016, they conducted 26 ballistic missile flight tests, followed by 18 tests in 2017, including multiple launches in July and November. North Korea conducted 18 ballistic missile launches in 2017, with two in July and one in November believed to be ICBM tests. They also possess around 700 short-range ballistic missiles, but their accuracy is questionable. The main goal of North Korea's nuclear program is to develop a miniaturized warhead for long-range missiles, with progress assessments varying. The Nodong missile poses a significant threat to the Korean Peninsula, mainland Japan, and some U.S. military bases. North Korea has demonstrated progress in developing ICBMs capable of carrying nuclear warheads, including the KN-08 and Taepodong-2. In 2017, they conducted two ICBM tests, showing limited but growing success in their missile capabilities. Additional testing may be required according to a December 2017 Department of Defense report. North Korea has shown progress in its medium-range ballistic missile (MRBM) and submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) programs, moving towards solid rocket motors for its missiles. Successful tests of the Pukguksong-2 (KN-15) solid fuel MRBM in 2017 led to plans for mass production. Recent focus is on developing capabilities to counter missile defenses like Patriot, Aegis BMD, and THAAD systems. Some tests in 2016 aimed at defeating or degrading missile defense effectiveness. North Korea's advancements in its medium-range ballistic missile (MRBM) and submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) programs include the ability to launch multiple missiles in quick succession, potentially overwhelming missile defense systems. They have also shown progress in solid rocket motor technology for their missiles, aiming to counter defenses like Patriot, Aegis BMD, and THAAD systems. Their SLBM development may be a strategy to launch attacks from sea positions outside the radar range of THAAD systems. The United States has tried to negotiate limits on North Korea's missile program in the past, but talks failed to reach a deal. North Korea violated UNSC resolutions by conducting missile tests, leading to increased restrictions on the country. Resolution 1874 increased restrictions on North Korea's ballistic missile program. The 2012 Leap Day Agreement included a moratorium on ballistic missile tests, excluding satellite launches. North Korea has active biological and chemical weapons programs, possessing a large arsenal of chemical weapons, including mustard, phosgene, and sarin gas. North Korea is estimated to have approximately 12 facilities and six major storage depots for chemical weapons. North Korea has a significant chemical weapon production capability, with an estimated inventory of 2,500 to 5,000 tons. They are not a signatory to the Chemical Weapons Convention and are suspected of maintaining biological weapons production. If they were to use chemical weapons, South Korea and Japan would be the most likely targets. North Korea is suspected of maintaining an ongoing biological weapons production capability, with a longstanding capability and infrastructure to support it. The U.S. intelligence community also notes their munitions production capacity for weaponizing biological agents. South Korea estimates that North Korea possesses anthrax and smallpox. North Korea's proliferation of WMD and missile-related technology is a serious concern, as they have sold missile parts and technology to various countries, generating hard currency for the regime. They have also assisted Syria in building a nuclear reactor. North Korea has assisted Syria in building a nuclear reactor, which was destroyed by Israel in 2007. There have been reports of North Korea transferring chemical weapons-related materials to Syria. North Korea and Iran have collaborated on missile development since the 1980s, with Chinese assistance in the North Korean missile program. The North Korean regime engages in illicit activities to earn hard currency, including drug production, counterfeit currency, and smuggling. Office 39 oversees these activities, generating $500 million to $1 billion annually. North Korea engages in illicit activities such as drug production and smuggling to earn hard currency. The regime's involvement in illegal narcotics trade was highlighted in 2013 when individuals were arrested for attempting to smuggle methamphetamines into the United States. The country also sells Cold War-era weapons to various states, particularly in the Middle East and North Africa. In 2016, a vessel carrying over 30,000 rocket-propelled grenades was seized outside the Suez Canal based on a U.S. tip. The true orchestrators of North Korea's illicit activities, whether state authorities or local criminal gangs, remain unclear. North Korea uses front companies based in China to mask its illicit dealings and access the international financial system. These companies keep the regime's earnings in overseas bank accounts, making it harder to track the money. In one case, a Chinese company used over 20 front companies, some of which were established in the British Virgin Islands. The U.S. government has been sanctioning companies working on behalf of North Korea, including banning a Chinese bank, Bank of Dandong, for facilitating illicit financial activities. In the past, Banco Delta Asia in Macau was identified for distributing North Korean counterfeit currency and laundering money, leading to frozen accounts and a North Korean boycott of talks until funds were returned. The U.S. government has sanctioned companies aiding North Korea, such as banning Bank of Dandong for illicit financial activities. Past administrations highlighted North Korea's human rights abuses, including denial of liberties and severe physical abuse for violating laws. Reports emphasize the lack of freedoms and extensive ideological indoctrination in North Korea. North Korea operates prison camps (kwanliso) where around 100,000 political prisoners, including family members, are held. Conditions in these camps are extremely harsh, leading to high mortality rates due to starvation, disease, executions, and torture. Reports indicate that close to 400,000 prisoners died in captivity over a 31-year period, according to a United Nations Commission of Inquiry. Reports highlight starvation, disease, executions, and torture in North Korean prison camps, with a decline in political prisoners possibly due to high mortality rates. The United Nations plays a key role in addressing human rights violations in North Korea, establishing positions like the Special Rapporteur and the Commission of Inquiry to investigate and ensure accountability for grave violations. The Commission of Inquiry (COI) conducted public hearings to shed light on inhumane conditions in North Korea, concluding that the regime had committed \"crimes against humanity.\" Despite recommendations to refer North Korea to the International Criminal Court (ICC), no action has been taken due to resistance from China and Russia. In 2017, the UN Human Rights Council established a repository to archive evidence of human rights violations in the country for potential prosecution. For two decades, food shortages, persecution, and human rights abuses have driven tens of thousands of North Koreans to flee to China, where they face further abuse and lack of protection. Many women and children are victims of human trafficking, with women forced into marriage or prostitution. Some refugees make their way to Southeast Asia to seek passage to a third country, usually South Korea. The UNHCR has not been allowed to conduct a systematic survey in North Korea. In recent years, the number of North Korean defectors seeking passage to South Korea has declined, with 1,127 defectors arriving in 2017, a 21% decrease from the previous year. Elite defections in 2016 highlighted a changing demographic profile, with defectors of higher social status increasing. This shift may be due to tightened border security, making it harder for less fortunate individuals to escape. Since the late 2000s, diplomats have been tasked with earning foreign currency and procuring illicit goods for North Korea. Elite defectors face imprisonment or execution if caught, leading many to flee to China. The U.N. Commission of Inquiry accused China of repatriating defectors, with China denying the allegations. China has been actively cooperating with North Korea to repatriate political refugees, contravening the U.N. Refugee Convention. China labels defectors as \"illegal economic migrants\" and deports them based on a repatriation treaty signed in 1986. China cooperates with North Korea to repatriate political refugees, defectors face imprisonment, torture, and executions upon return. Beijing fears destabilization from allowing refugees in and maintains repatriation to preserve ties with North Korea. The North Korean Human Rights Act (NKHRA) was passed in 2004, authorizing funds for human rights efforts in North Korea. It called for U.S. nonhumanitarian assistance to be tied to human rights improvements and required the appointment of a Special Envoy on Human Rights in North Korea. The act also allows North Koreans to apply for asylum in the United States. The NKHRA was reauthorized by Congress in 2008, 2012, and 2018, with a focus on resettling North Korean refugees in the United States and processing them in third countries. The 2018 reauthorization bill emphasized increasing freedom of information into North Korea. President Trump signed the bill into law in July 2018. Analysts have raised concerns about North Korea's overseas workers and their working conditions. The State Department's annual Trafficking in Persons Report has consistently cited North Korea's overseas-labor program, highlighting the exploitative working conditions of laborers living under \"state-sponsored slavery.\" Workers toil long hours, with the regime taking a significant portion of their earnings, contributing millions to billions to the regime's coffers annually. North Korea's overseas-labor program contributes between $200 million and $2 billion annually to the regime's economy. The program has a long history, with North Korean laborers working in various countries. The Trump Administration has pressured foreign governments to send these workers home by 2019, and the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act prohibits North Korean goods from entering the US. The United States provided over $1.2 billion in assistance to North Korea between 1995 and 2008, with aid for food and energy. However, aid was halted in early 2009, and technical assistance for nuclear disablement ended in 2009 after North Korea's provocative actions. In 2009, North Korea test-fired a missile, tested a nuclear device, halted denuclearization activities, and expelled nuclear inspectors. U.S. food aid ended due to disagreements with Pyongyang. The abrogated Leap Day Agreement would have provided food aid. Nearly 7,700 U.S. personnel from the Korean War are \"unaccounted-for.\" In 1996, North Korea and the United States agreed to conduct joint investigations to recover the remains of U.S. servicemen unaccounted for during the Korean War. Despite difficulties, 229 sets of remains were recovered and 107 have been identified. Operations in North Korea and negotiations over the program terms faced challenges. The joint recovery program between the United States and North Korea faced difficulties, leading to a suspension in 2005 due to North Korea's nuclear intentions and safety concerns. Despite providing over $20 million for recovery assistance, talks resumed in 2011, but Pyongyang's actions cast doubt on the credibility of North Korea. The United States suspended joint recovery missions with North Korea in 2012, citing doubts about North Korean commitments. North Korean state media warned in 2014 about the potential damage to U.S. POW-MIAs remains, signaling a desire for broader negotiations. The Department of Defense prioritizes the recovery of missing U.S. soldiers from the Korean War. Trump and Kim committed to recovering POW/MIA remains at the 2018 Singapore summit. According to Trump, the repatriation of remains was a last-minute addition to the summit's agenda. North Korea delayed transferring the remains due to a request for payment, which the US does not provide. Aid to North Korea has mainly come from government contributions to relief programs, with some NGOs involved in capacity building and exchanges in various fields. Some U.S.-based NGOs maintain good working relationships with North Korean counterparts in various fields like agriculture, health, informal diplomacy, information science, and education. These NGOs aim to provide aid to vulnerable sectors of the North Korean population and promote peaceful relations through people-to-people ties. Operations have been hindered since 2016 by tighter restrictions. Many NGOs have faced challenges in their operations in North Korea since 2016 due to U.S. and international sanctions, as well as restrictions imposed by the Trump Administration in 2017 on U.S. citizens traveling to North Korea.
