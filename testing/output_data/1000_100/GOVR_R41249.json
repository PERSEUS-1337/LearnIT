    "content": "Prior to 1996, health insurance coverage for mental illness was historically less generous than for physical illnesses, with lower limits, fewer covered services, and higher cost sharing. Mental health parity laws were enacted to address this disparity in insurance coverage. Mental health parity laws aim to provide equal insurance coverage for mental health services compared to medical and surgical benefits. There are three general approaches to achieving parity, based on coverage mandates and parity requirements. Full parity approach mandates coverage for mental illnesses and requires parity, while minimum mandated benefit approach mandates coverage but does not require parity. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements by mandating coverage for certain mental health and substance abuse disorder services. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements by mandating coverage for certain mental health and substance abuse disorder services through specific financing arrangements. It does not include an explicit coverage mandate for mental health services at the federal level but contains provisions that mandate coverage for certain plans. The ACA also does not modify federal mental health parity requirements but expands their applicability to various financing arrangements. Prior to the ACA, two major federal laws established the federal mental health parity requirements: MHPA and MHPAEA. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements by mandating coverage for certain mental health and substance abuse disorder services through specific financing arrangements. Recent data shows that approximately one-third of employers with more than 50 employees have modified their benefits in response to MHPAEA, with some choosing to drop coverage for mental health and substance use disorder services while others have eliminated limits on coverage or increased utilization management of benefits. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements by mandating coverage for certain mental health and substance abuse disorder services through specific financing arrangements. MHPA (P.L. 104-204) was the first federal mental health parity law, employing a mandated offering parity approach with no coverage mandates but requiring partial parity. It amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) and the Public Health Service Act. The Mental Health Parity Act (MHPA) and its amendments, including the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA), apply parity coverage requirements to all group health coverage arrangements governed by ERISA, PHSA, and IRC. MHPA includes exemptions for small employers and cost increases, with MHPAEA expanding the scope to include substance use disorders. The sunset provision in MHPA was repealed by MHPAEA, which extends federal mental health parity requirements. The Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA) expands on the MHPA requirement of parity in aggregate lifetime and annual limits to include parity in treatment limitations, financial requirements, and in- and out-of-network benefits. It also amends the small employer exemption and clarifies the cost exemption parameters. The federal mental health parity requirements established by MHPA and MHPAEA do not apply to the individual market. The ACA extends federal mental health parity requirements to various types of health plans, mandating coverage of specified mental health services. Medicare plans are not required to comply with these parity requirements. The federal mental health parity law extends to qualified health plans (QHPs), Medicaid benchmark plans, and individual market plans under the ACA. Small employer exemption remains, but QHPs purchased through an Exchange must cover mental health services in compliance with parity requirements starting in 2014. Considerations may need to be reconciled through rulemaking. The ACA mandates coverage of mental health services for QHPs, Medicaid benchmark plans, and small group market plans. Federal mental health parity requirements apply to non-managed care plans offering mental health services. CHIP plans must also comply with parity requirements. The ACA mandates coverage of mental health services for QHPs, Medicaid benchmark plans, and small group market plans, ensuring full parity with medical or surgical services. This coverage mandate extends to essential health benefits required for various plan types under the ACA. QHPs in Section 1301 must provide essential health benefits, including mental health and substance abuse services. Coverage for these services is required for all QHPs, but the specific services covered are determined through the rulemaking process. The ACA ensures parity between mental health services and medical/surgical services in QHPs, Medicaid benchmark plans, and small group market plans. The ACA mandates that all Qualified Health Plans (QHPs) must cover essential health benefits, including mental health and substance abuse services. This requirement applies to all QHPs, Medicaid benchmark plans, and small group market plans, ensuring parity between mental health services and medical/surgical services. Additionally, Medicaid benchmark and benchmark-equivalent plans are required to offer essential health benefits by January 1, 2014, as outlined in ACA Section 2001(c). The ACA mandates coverage of mental health benefits by insurers, with some states requiring coverage of specific conditions. States can require additional benefits beyond Essential Health Benefits (EHB) for Qualified Health Plans (QHPs), but must bear the cost. Requiring QHPs to cover mental health services is separate from ensuring parity. The ACA mandates mental health coverage by insurers, with states able to require additional benefits for QHPs. ACA Section 1311(j) extends federal mental health parity requirements to all QHPs in Exchanges, impacting small group and individual plans. Large group plans may be less incentivized to participate. Federal mental health parity requirements under ACA Section 1311(j) extend to all QHPs in Exchanges, including small group and individual plans. The small employer exemption in federal mental health parity law applies to employers with 2-50 employees and now includes self-employed individuals. ACA Section 1563(c)(4) extends these requirements to the individual market by replacing references to group health plans with \"a health insurance issuer offering group or individual health insurance coverage.\" The ACA conforming amendment extends federal mental health parity requirements to plans in the individual market, but the small employer exemption may still apply based on the amended statutory language. The small employer exemption under federal mental health parity law may still apply, with an expanded definition of \"small employer\" to include those with an average of at least 1, but not more than 100, employees. This wider range of employers may now be eligible for the exemption. States have the option until 2016 to use the previous definition of small employer for plans offered through an Exchange, which could raise questions regarding coverage for self-employed individuals. The federal mental health parity law may exempt small employers with 1-100 employees. Questions arise regarding whether small employer QHPs are exempt from federal mental health parity requirements under ACA Section 1311(j). The ACA does not specify the application of mental health parity provisions to QHPs. The ACA does not specify if small employer QHPs are exempt from federal mental health parity requirements. Medicaid managed care plans must comply with federal mental health parity laws, including benchmark or benchmark-equivalent coverage. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements to Medicaid benchmark plans. The ACA extends federal mental health parity requirements to Medicaid benchmark and benchmark-equivalent plans, which provide medical, surgical, mental health, or substance use disorder benefits. These plans must comply with parity requirements for treatment limitations and financial requirements. EPSDT plans are considered to meet these requirements. Medicaid benchmark and benchmark-equivalent plans must comply with federal mental health parity requirements for treatment limitations and financial requirements. However, Medicaid managed care plans are required to comply with the totality of federal mental health parity requirements, including annual and lifetime limits and in- and out-of-network covered benefits. It is unclear if the parity requirements extend to plans offered under traditional Medicaid. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements to all \"newly eligible\" Medicaid populations, including those enrolled through benchmark or benchmark-equivalent non-managed care plans. The CHIP statute also extends federal mental health parity requirements to CHIP plans. The ACA extends federal mental health parity requirements to all \"newly eligible\" Medicaid populations, including benchmark or benchmark-equivalent non-managed care plans. The CHIP statute also applies federal mental health parity requirements to CHIP plans, which may need to be conformed to reflect ACA redesignations. Specifically, SSA Section 2103(c)(6) requires state child health plans to comply with PHSA Section 2705 for both mental health/substance abuse and medical/surgical benefits. This aligns with ACA Section 2001 for Medicaid non-managed care plans, with similar limitations. SSA Section 2103(c)(6)(B) deems CHIP plans offering EPSDT services as satisfying the parity requirement. However, it is unclear if this fulfills the requirement for compliance with the full set of parity requirements outlined in SSA Section 2103(f)(2). Compliance with all requirements of subpart 2 of part A of Title XXVII of the PHSA is also mandated for CHIP plans under SSA Section 2103(f)(2). The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements to include CHIP plans, individual market plans, QHPs, and certain Medicaid plan types. It also mandates coverage of specific mental health services for certain plan types, representing a significant change from prior federal law. The mental health parity law extends requirements to the individual market and qualified health plans under the ACA. Questions arise about the impact on small employer plans in the Exchange and Medicaid non-managed care benchmark plans. The CHIP statute includes provisions with varying reach for parity requirements in CHIP plans."
