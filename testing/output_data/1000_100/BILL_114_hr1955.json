    "content": "The \"Great Lakes Nutrient Removal Assistance Act\" aims to address water pollution in the Great Lakes System by focusing on nutrient pollution, particularly phosphorus loading. The Act emphasizes the importance of limiting phosphorus loads to control algal growth and highlights nutrient removal technology as an effective method for reducing harmful nutrients from point sources. Section 118 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to establish a Nutrient Removal Technology Grant Program for Great Lakes States and municipalities to install technologies reducing nutrients in wastewater discharge. The Nutrient Removal Technology Grant Program prioritizes eligible facilities for nutrient reduction in Great Lakes States based on environmental benefits and meeting nutrient objectives outlined in the Great Lakes Water Quality Protocol of 2012. States or municipalities can submit applications to the Administrator. The Administrator may approve grant applications for nutrient removal technologies at eligible facilities in Great Lakes States, with grants not exceeding 55 percent of installation costs. The term 'Great Lakes Water Quality Protocol of 2012' refers to the protocol for water quality in the Great Lakes. The term 'eligible facility' refers to a municipal wastewater treatment facility within the Great Lakes System in any of the Great Lakes States, with a design capacity to treat at least 500,000 gallons of wastewater per day. Authorization of appropriations is provided for these facilities. Authorized to appropriate $100,000,000 annually for fiscal years 2016-2020 for eligible municipal wastewater treatment facilities in the Great Lakes System. Up to 4% can be used for administrative costs."
