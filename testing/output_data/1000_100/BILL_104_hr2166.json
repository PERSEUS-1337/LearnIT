The \"Fairness and Equity Tax Act of 1995\" introduces a minimum tax on specific foreign and foreign-owned corporations under the Internal Revenue Code. This tax applies to corporations with substantial foreign-related person transactions, ensuring their taxable income meets a certain threshold based on profit percentages and gross receipts from different business activities. The \"Fairness and Equity Tax Act of 1995\" imposes a minimum tax on certain foreign and foreign-owned corporations under the Internal Revenue Code. This tax applies to corporations with significant foreign-related transactions to ensure their taxable income meets specific thresholds based on profit percentages and gross receipts from various business activities. Additionally, a qualified section 482 agreement with the Secretary can exempt a corporation from this tax for specific business activities during the taxable year. The Secretary may enter into a qualified section 482 agreement if it will reflect the taxable income of the corporation accurately. The agreement can have retroactive effects for prior taxable years if deemed necessary by the Secretary. In cases where a corporation's activities cannot be categorized by the Secretary based on the Standard Industrial Classification Code, a minimum tax of 35 percent is imposed on gross receipts from property sales. The section does not apply in cases of casualty or disaster deemed inequitable by the Secretary. Foreign taxes are treated accordingly. For tax purposes, foreign income taxes are not considered when determining taxable income. The Secretary prescribes applicable profit percentages for different business activities based on domestic corporations' average earnings rates. The earnings rate of a domestic corporation is based on the ratio of adjusted book income to gross receipts from business activities, excluding certain taxes. Definitions and special rules apply for foreign-owned entities and related parties. The IRS defines terms like 'foreign-owned', 'foreign person', and 'related party' according to section 6038A(c). A corporation has substantial foreign-related person transactions if the total amount with foreign related parties exceeds $2,000,000 or 10% of gross income. Business activities are categorized based on the Standard Industrial Classification Code. The IRS categorizes business activities based on the Standard Industrial Classification Code, allowing for aggregation of classifications and alternative classification systems when appropriate. A clerical amendment was made to the table of parts for subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Code. Effective Date: The amendments for minimum tax on certain foreign and foreign-owned corporations will apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 1995."
