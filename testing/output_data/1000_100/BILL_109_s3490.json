    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Cherry Valley National Wildlife Refuge Study Act\" and includes findings. The Cherry Valley area in northeastern Pennsylvania is home to over 80 special-concern animal and plant species, including 6 endangered or threatened species such as the bog turtle, dwarf wedge mussel, and bald eagle. Efforts are being made to reestablish favorable conditions for the Indiana bat. Cherry Valley in northeastern Pennsylvania provides habitat for 79 species of national or regional concern, including neotropical migratory birds, waterfowl, rare plants, and anadromous fish. The Cherry Valley watershed on the Kittatinny Ridge is an important migration route for birds of prey in the northeastern United States. The Kittatinny Ridge in Cherry Valley, northeastern Pennsylvania, is a crucial migration route for various raptor species, including bald eagles and golden eagles. The area also features the Appalachian Trail and rare calcareous wetlands, with ongoing studies showing high water quality in Cherry Creek. Additionally, there are federally-owned parcels of land adjacent to the potential Cherry Valley National Wildlife Refuge. Public meetings have shown strong local support for a potential Cherry Valley National Wildlife Refuge, with landowners, leaders, and officials expressing enthusiasm for the project. Various communities and conservation entities share goals for protecting Cherry Valley. Local entities, including landowners and conservation agencies, are actively working to protect Cherry Valley by conserving wildlife habitat and farmland. They see the potential for a Cherry Valley National Wildlife Refuge to complement existing conservation efforts. Additionally, some landowners have already placed their land under conservation easements. In Monroe County, Pennsylvania, there is voter-approved funding for open space preservation. The open space fund and voter-approved municipal land conservation fund in Stroud Township, Pennsylvania have supported various conservation projects in the area. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The term \"map\" refers to the Proposed Cherry Valley National Wildlife Refuge-Authorization Boundary map dated February 24, 2005. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior. The term \"Study Area\" includes the fish and wildlife habitat in Cherry Valley, located in northeastern Pennsylvania, as identified on the map. The Secretary will conduct a study to evaluate the Study Area for potential acquisition by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and inclusion in a Cherry Valley National Wildlife Refuge. Consultation with State and local officials, conservation organizations, and landowners will be done to identify eligible land and determine boundaries for acquisition. The Secretary will conduct a study to evaluate the suitability of the Study Area for inclusion in the National Wildlife Refuge System. This includes assessing conservation benefits such as preserving diverse populations of fish, wildlife, and plants, including threatened or endangered species. The Study Area will be evaluated for inclusion in the National Wildlife Refuge System, focusing on conservation benefits like protecting diverse fish, wildlife, and plants, including threatened or endangered species. The evaluation will also consider habitat protection, wildlife-dependent recreation, public participation, and local input on future land acquisition for refuge purposes. The Secretary will acquire up to 30,000 acres of land, water, and interests in the Study Area for refuge purposes. A report with study results, including a prioritized map of specific areas, will be submitted to the Senate and House committees within a year of the Act's enactment. The Secretary is authorized to acquire land, water, and interests in the Study Area for a potential Cherry Valley National Wildlife Refuge. A cost estimate and funds from non-Federal sources will be provided for the acquisition and management. $200,000 is authorized for this purpose."
