    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Servicemember Mental Health Review Act\". Since September 11, 2001, around 30,000 veterans have been discharged from the Armed Forces due to personality or adjustment disorders. These veterans are then restricted from receiving disability compensation, severance pay, and retirement pay. Many of them struggle to find employment due to the stigma attached to their discharge label. The Department of Defense's compliance in separating members based on these disorders has been questioned by the Government Accountability Office. The establishment of a Mental Health Discharge Board of Review is necessary to review the separation of veterans based on personality or adjustment disorders. This will ensure that wrongly separated veterans can access disability benefits and employment opportunities. The Department of Defense will review military separations based on mental conditions that do not amount to disability. The Department of Defense will establish Mental Health Discharge Boards of Review to review separations based on mental conditions not amounting to disability for covered individuals in the armed forces. Each board will consist of at least five members, including a licensed psychologist and psychiatrist. The Department of Defense will appoint individuals with fiduciary responsibility to the Mental Health Discharge Boards of Review for covered members of the armed forces separated due to mental conditions since September 11, 2001. The boards will be equipped with necessary staff and covered individuals will be notified of their right to review. The Secretary of the military department is responsible for notifying covered individuals of their right to request a review by the Mental Health Discharge Board of Review if they do not receive notification. The Secretary of Defense will oversee compliance and report any failures to Congress. Legal counsel is required for the notification process. The notification required by subsection (c) informs covered individuals of the right to obtain private counsel for representation before the Mental Health Discharge Board of Review and provides a list of organizations offering free counsel. The Board reviews the findings of the diagnosing psychologist or psychiatrist, the separation authority's decisions, and ensures compliance with separation processes outlined in law and regulations. The Mental Health Discharge Board of Review conducts reviews based on records from the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs, as well as private mental health records. They notify individuals of proposed reviews and require consent for the process to proceed. The Mental Health Discharge Board of Review requires consent from the covered individual or their representative before conducting a review. After completing the review, the board must provide a statement of reasons for their decision, and the individual can request reconsideration with new evidence. The board may recommend to the military department concerned not to negatively recharacterize the individual's separation. The Mental Health Discharge Board of Review can recommend various actions for a covered individual, including recharacterizing their separation to retirement for disability, issuing a new disability rating, or recharacterizing the separation for other reasons. Compliance with the Administrative Procedure Act Transparency Requirement is necessary if certain recommendations are not made. The Mental Health Discharge Board of Review can recommend actions for a covered individual, including recharacterizing separation to retirement for disability. The Secretary of the military department must correct the individual's military records based on the Board's recommendation, effective from the separation date. The Secretary of the military department can reduce back pay and allowances upon separation based on the individual's corrected military record. Regulations for this section will be set by the Secretary of Defense with specified deadlines for reviews. The Secretary of Defense must establish Mental Health Discharge Boards of Review within 90 days of the enactment of the Act, as required by section 1554b of title 10, United States Code. Regulations for this section will also be prescribed within the same timeframe."
