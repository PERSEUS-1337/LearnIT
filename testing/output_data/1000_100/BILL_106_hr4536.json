    "content": "Title X of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include a new section called \"Physical Education for Progress Act.\" This section aims to provide grants and contracts to local educational agencies to enhance physical education programs for students from kindergarten to 12th grade. Congress finds that physical education is crucial for children's development, improving their health, self-esteem, relationships, behavior, and independence. Participation in quality physical education programs leads to better health and fitness, especially important as the rate of overweight youth has more than doubled in the past 30 years. The prevalence of obesity among children in the United States is high due to low levels of activity. Obesity-related diseases cost the economy over $100 billion annually, with at least 300,000 deaths attributed to inactivity and poor diet each year. Physically fit adults have lower risk factors for heart attacks and stroke. Children are not active enough, with less than 1 in 4 getting 20 minutes of vigorous activity daily. The Surgeon General and CDC recommend daily physical education for all students from kindergarten to grade 12. \"Congress passed Resolution 97, 100th Congress, in 1987 to promote daily physical education programs for students in kindergarten through grade 12. However, little progress has been made in implementing quality physical education nationwide.\" Every student in our Nation's schools should have the opportunity to achieve the goals established by Healthy People 2000 and Healthy People 2010. The Secretary is authorized to award grants to local educational agencies for physical education programs for K-12 students, including equipment, curriculum development, and staff training. Applications and program requirements are outlined. The local educational agency must submit an application to the Secretary outlining a plan to enhance physical education programs in schools to meet national goals and state standards. The goals include fitness education, motor skills instruction, and overall physical well-being. The physical education program aims to enhance children's physical, mental, and social development through motor skills, cognitive concepts, social skills, and healthy habits. Teachers are required to undergo professional development to stay updated on the latest research and trends in the field. Special Rule: Extracurricular activities like team sports and ROTC program activities are not considered part of the physical education program assisted under this part. The Secretary ensures equitable distribution of grants and contracts between urban and rural local educational agencies, and between those serving large and small student populations. Funds can include participation of home-schooled and private school students. Reporting is required for continued funding. The administrator of a local educational agency must submit an annual report to the Secretary to continue receiving grant or contract funding. The Secretary is required to submit a report to Congress detailing the programs assisted under this part and making recommendations for their continuation and improvement. Administrative costs are also addressed in the legislation. \"Administrative costs for local educational agencies receiving grant funds are limited to 5 percent. The Federal share of project costs cannot exceed 90 percent in the first year and 75 percent in subsequent years. Funds should supplement, not replace, other available Federal, State, and local funds for physical education activities. Authorization of appropriations is also addressed.\" Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2000 to 2004 is set at $30,000,000 for 2000, $70,000,000 for 2001, and $100,000,000 annually from 2002 to 2004 to support the outlined activities."
