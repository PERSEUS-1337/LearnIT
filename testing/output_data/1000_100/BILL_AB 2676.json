The credit is limited to expenses for household services and care provided in the state. Earned income for active services in the Armed Forces is considered taxable income in California. The definition of a qualifying individual for the household and dependent care credit is expanded to include children as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. For tax purposes, a child shall be treated as receiving over one-half of their support from the parent with custody for a greater portion of the year, who is then considered the \"custodial parent.\" This classification allows the child to be considered a qualifying individual for tax benefits. The child must receive over half of their support from parents who never married and lived apart during the last six months of the year. The child must also be in the custody of one or both parents for more than half of the year. The amendments to this section apply to taxable years starting in 2002 and 2011. This act provides for a tax levy and takes immediate effect."
