    "content": "The Act titled \"Quincy Library Group Forest Recovery and Economic Stability Act of 1997\" establishes a pilot project for Plumas, Lassen, and Tahoe National Forests to implement the Quincy Library Group proposal. The Quincy Library Group-Community Stability Proposal defines an agreement by a coalition in northern California to manage Federal lands in the Sierra Nevada area for ecological and economic health. It includes a map dated June 1993. The Secretary of Agriculture is required to implement a pilot project for the Forest Service after completing an environmental impact statement. The Secretary of Agriculture must conduct a pilot project on Federal lands in California to demonstrate resource management activities as per the Quincy Library Group-Community Stability Proposal. The project will take place in designated areas within Plumas National Forest, Lassen National Forest, and the Sierraville Ranger District of Tahoe National Forest. The pilot project area, designated in June 1993, excludes spotted owl habitat areas and protected activity centers from resource management activities and timber harvesting. The Regional Forester for region 5 directs that road building and timber harvesting activities on Federal lands within the Plumas National Forest are deferred during the pilot project. The pilot project area, designated in June 1993, excludes spotted owl habitat areas and protected activity centers from resource management activities and timber harvesting. The Scientific Analysis Team guidelines for riparian system protection apply to all resource management activities and timber harvesting in the designated Federal lands within the Plumas National Forest, Lassen National Forest, and Sierraville Ranger District of the Tahoe National Forest in California. The Forest Service research document from March 1993, co-authored by the Scientific Analysis Team including Dr. Jack Ward Thomas, outlines compliance requirements for resource management activities related to the conservation of the California spotted owl. During the pilot project, the Secretary is mandated to implement specific resource management activities in designated Federal lands within California. The Secretary is required to implement resource management activities on Federal lands in California, including fuelbreak construction and forest management using group and individual tree selection methods to achieve a fire-resilient condition. The pilot project aims to achieve a desired future condition of fire-resilient forests through group and individual tree selection methods on a limited acreage not exceeding 70,000 acres annually. Riparian management, including protection zones and restoration projects, is also included. The Secretary will ensure cost-effectiveness in conducting the pilot project. The Secretary will use cost-effective means to implement resource management activities for the pilot project. Funding will come from specific Forest Service funds and excess funds allocated for administration and management of certain national forests. The Secretary will implement resource management activities for the pilot project using specific Forest Service funds and excess funds allocated for administration and management of certain national forests, including the Sierraville Ranger District of Tahoe National Forest. The Secretary will implement resource management activities for the pilot project using specific Forest Service funds. Up to 12 percent of the funds may be used for general administration, with at least 88 percent allocated for required activities. Additional funds may be appropriated as necessary for the project. The management activities for the pilot project will include baseline funding levels. The project will be conducted until the completion of land and resource management plan revisions for specific forests or five years after the project starts. Consultation with the Quincy Library Group is required for project statements. The Forest Service may carry out project requirements based on available appropriations. Within 180 days of enactment, the Regional Forester for Region 5 will start amending land management plans for specific forests. This includes incorporating pilot project designations and resource activities from the Quincy Library Group proposal. Other changes will be made based on environmental analyses. Private contracts can be used for project requirements. The Secretary, in consultation with the Quincy Library Group, must submit an annual report to Congress on the pilot project's status, including a detailed account of fund usage. The annual report to Congress on the pilot project's status must include a detailed account of fund usage, total acres treated for resource management activities, economic benefits to local communities, and a comparison of revenues generated and costs incurred. The annual report on the pilot project's status must include a detailed account of fund usage, total acres treated for resource management activities, economic benefits to local communities, a comparison of revenues generated and costs incurred, a schedule for activities in the pilot project area, descriptions of adverse environmental impacts, and a limitation on Federal funds expenditure for each report not exceeding $50,000. Additionally, a final report is required after 6 months of completion. The final report for the pilot project, to be compiled after 6 months of the second year, will assess the effectiveness of the project in meeting its goals. It will include watershed monitoring, analysis of environmental impacts, and consultation with the Quincy Library Group. The Quincy Library Group pilot project final report must be submitted to Congress by July 1, 2002. Federal funds for the assessment and report cannot exceed $150,000, with an additional $75,000 allocated for watershed monitoring each fiscal year from 2000 to 2002. The pilot project is not exempt from any Federal environmental laws."
