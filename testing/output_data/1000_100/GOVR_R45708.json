    "content": "The Energy and Water Development appropriations bill includes funding for various agencies, such as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Department of Energy, and Nuclear Regulatory Commission. President Trump's FY2020 budget proposal requests $38.02 billion, which is 15% lower than the FY2019 appropriation. A 12% increase is proposed for DOE nuclear weapons activities. The FY2019 Energy and Water Development appropriations bill provided $44.66 billion, 3% above FY2018 and 23% above the FY2019 request. The bill was signed into law on September 21, 2018. The FY2020 budget proposes substantial reductions for DOE energy research and development programs. The FY2020 budget proposes significant cuts to DOE energy research and development programs, including reductions in fossil fuels, nuclear energy, energy efficiency, and renewable energy R&D. Programs like energy efficiency grants, ARPA-E, and loan guarantee programs are targeted for elimination. Funding cuts are also proposed for USACE, Reclamation, and CUP. Congressional consideration of the Energy and Water Development appropriations bill is influenced by budget enforcement measures. The Budget Control Act of 2011 established limits on defense and nondefense discretionary spending, enforced through sequestration. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 increased limits for FY2018 and FY2019, but limits for FY2020 remain unchanged, leading to lower spending caps. The FY2020 limits for discretionary defense and nondefense spending are lower than FY2019 limits. The House Budget Committee reported a bill to raise the limits for FY2020 and FY2021. Controversial issues may arise during congressional consideration of Energy and Water Development appropriations for FY2020. The Trump Administration's FY2020 budget request for the Energy and Water Development bill includes significant reductions in funding for USACE and Reclamation projects. The request aims to limit funding for ongoing projects to those with high benefits relative to costs and proposes transferring the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program from USACE to DOE. The FY2020 budget request includes a $461.6 million (29%) reduction in funding for USACE and Reclamation projects. The budget also proposes divesting the assets of the PMAs that own transmission infrastructure. The FY2020 budget request proposes divesting the assets of PMAs, including BPA, SWPA, and WAPA, to generate approximately $5.8 billion in mandatory savings over 10 years. The budget also suggests repealing borrowing authority for WAPA's Transmission Infrastructure Program and transitioning PMAs to a market-based rate-setting approach, estimated to yield $1.9 billion in new revenues over a decade. Additionally, the budget calls for repealing $3.25 billion in borrowing authority for WAPA's transmission projects. The FY2020 budget proposes divesting assets of PMAs, including BPA, SWPA, and WAPA, to save $5.8 billion over 10 years. It also suggests repealing borrowing authority for WAPA's Transmission Infrastructure Program, saving $1.9 billion in new revenues. The budget calls for repealing $3.25 billion in borrowing authority for WAPA's transmission projects. The proposals have faced opposition from various groups and have not yet been enacted into legislation. The FY2020 budget proposes terminating the DOE Weatherization Assistance Program and the State Energy Program (SEP) to shift focus towards early-stage R&D. The Weatherization Assistance Program provides grants for energy efficiency improvements in low-income housing, while the SEP offers grants and technical assistance for state energy programs. The proposed elimination is due to a departmental shift away from deployment activities. The Administration's FY2020 budget request proposes significant reductions in DOE R&D funding for energy efficiency and renewable energy, with cuts of up to 82% in bioenergy technologies and 79% in vehicle technologies. The focus is on early-stage R&D, shifting towards private sector funding for later-stage research and commercialization. Similar reductions were proposed for FY2019 but not enacted. The Administration's FY2020 budget request includes new funding for a proposed nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, NV. DOE would receive $116 million to seek an NRC license for the repository and develop interim nuclear waste storage capacity. NRC would receive $38.5 million to consider DOE's application. The funding would come from two appropriations accounts: $90 million from Nuclear Waste Disposal and $26 million from Defense Nuclear Waste Disposal. DOE submitted a license application for the Yucca Mountain repository in 2008. The Yucca Mountain repository license application was suspended in 2011 due to lack of funding. The Obama Administration deemed the site \"unworkable\" because of Nevada's opposition. Funding for Yucca Mountain was not included in the FY2018 and FY2019 Senate bills. A pilot program for an interim nuclear waste storage facility was authorized in the FY2019 Senate bill but was not enacted. The FY2020 budget request includes funding for a nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain. The FY2020 budget request by Mark Holt would halt further loans and loan guarantees under DOE's Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program and the Title 17 Innovative Technology Loan Guarantee Program. It would also stop further loan guarantees under DOE's Tribal Energy Loan Guarantee Program. DOE would continue to administer its existing portfolio of loans and loan guarantees, rescinding unused prior-year authority and unspent appropriations. Additionally, $3.7 billion in additional Title 17 loan guarantees were provided for two new reactors at the Vogtle nuclear plant. The Administration's FY2020 DOE appropriation request includes $107 million for the U.S. contribution to the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) in France. ITER aims to be the first fusion device for long-term fusion and commercial fusion-based electricity production. The request, 19% below the FY2020 level, would fund components from U.S. companies for the project. The United States is to pay 9% of the project's construction costs. The United States is to pay 9% of the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) project's construction costs, with a total estimated cost between $4.0 billion and $6.5 billion. DOE funding for the project was $122 million in FY2018 and $132 million in FY2019. The Trump Administration's FY2020 budget proposed eliminating ARPA-E and rescinding $287 million of the agency's unobligated balances. The Trump Administration's FY2020 budget proposed terminating ARPA-E and increasing funding for DOE Weapons Activities, including a 10% increase for nuclear warhead life-extension programs. ARPA-E would phase out by FY 2022 using unobligated balances. The FY2020 budget proposes a 10% increase in funding for nuclear warhead life-extension programs, with notable increases for the W80-4 and W87-1 warheads. The W80-4 warhead funding increases by 37% due to a new budget estimate, while the W87-1 warhead receives $112 million for FY2020. Additionally, funding for the W76-2 warhead decreases to $10 million as work on it nears completion. In FY2020, NNSA is seeking $51.5 million for surveillance efforts for the B83 gravity bomb, representing a 47% increase from FY2019. The Trump Administration reversed the plan to retire the bomb, which may spark controversy. Funding for Plutonium Sustainment in the NNSA budget would increase by 97%, from $361 million in FY2019 to $712 million in FY2020. The Administration is seeking a $712 million budget for FY2020 to produce plutonium pits for nuclear warheads at Los Alamos National Laboratory and the Savannah River Site. Additionally, the Department of Energy's Office of Environmental Management is requesting $6.469 billion for environmental cleanup and waste management activities, a decrease of $706 million from FY2019. The FY2020 budget request includes a proposal to transfer management of the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program (FUSRAP) from USACE to the Office of Legacy Management (LM). The budget for FUSRAP is $141 million, down from $150 million in FY2019. USACE will continue cleanup of FUSRAP sites on a reimbursable basis. No markups had been held as of the publication date of this report. Table 2 shows budget totals for energy and water development appropriations from FY2011 to FY2019, along with the FY2020 request. The Energy and Water Development appropriations bill consists of four titles: Corps of Engineers\u2014Civil, Department of the Interior, Department of Energy, and Independent Agencies. Major programs are described in the bill, with previous appropriations and budget recommendations detailed in accompanying tables. For more information on funding issues, contact CRS. The FY2020 budget justifications for the largest agencies funded by the annual Energy and Water Development appropriations bill can be found through the provided links for U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Bureau of Reclamation, Central Utah Project, Department of Energy, Appalachian Regional Commission, and Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Congressional clients can contact CRS analysts for more detailed information. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board, and Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board are key agencies. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is responsible for water resource facilities and projects funded by the Energy and Water appropriations bill. Congress authorizes Corps activities through Water Resources Development Acts before funding them. Recent Congresses passed omnibus water resources authorization acts in June 2014, December 2016, and October 2018. These acts authorized new projects for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and made changes to USACE policies. Unlike other infrastructure programs, USACE projects are not funded through formulas or competitive grants but are cost-shared with nonfederal sponsors. Since FY2010, Congress has not added funding at the project level for USACE projects, due to earmark moratorium policies. Instead, Congress has provided \"additional funding\" for select categories of projects and imposed restrictions on the use of these funds. The Bureau of Reclamation, originally focused on irrigation for arid lands, now assists in meeting water demands in the West while managing hundreds of dams and diversion projects in 17 states. Municipal and industrial water deliveries have doubled since 1970. The Bureau of Reclamation manages over 300 storage reservoirs in 17 western states, providing water to 10 million acres of farmland and 31 million people. It is the largest wholesale water supplier in the region and the second-largest hydroelectric power producer in the nation. Reclamation projects also offer flood control, recreation, and other benefits, but face controversy over their impact on fish and wildlife, as well as conflicts among water users during droughts. The agency's budget consists mainly of individual project funding lines, subject to earmark disclosure rules due to the current moratorium on earmarks. The Bureau of Reclamation manages numerous projects providing water to farmland and people in western states. The agency's budget includes various funding accounts, with oversight of the Central Utah Project conducted separately. The Energy and Water Development bill has funded DOE programs since FY2005, focusing on research and development activities. DOE programs since FY2005 include research on renewable energy, energy efficiency, nuclear power, fossil energy, and electricity.

Research includes advanced small modular reactors and sustainability of commercial light water reactors. The Reactor Concepts program focuses on enhancing the sustainability of existing commercial light water reactors and developing Generation IV advanced reactors. Research includes advanced coolants, fuels, materials, and a Versatile Test Reactor for testing in a fast neutron environment. The program also conducts research on extending the life of existing reactors beyond 60 years and includes industry cost-sharing. The Fuel Cycle Research and Development program focuses on generic research. The Fuel Cycle Research and Development program focuses on developing technologies for nuclear waste management, accident-tolerant fuels, fuel cycle options, and prevention of nuclear material diversion. It also works on creating high-assay low enriched uranium for advanced reactors. For more information, refer to CRS Report R45706. The DOE's Fossil Energy R&D Program focuses on carbon capture and storage for coal and natural gas power plants. Activities include Advanced Coal Energy Systems, Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS), Natural Gas Technologies, and Unconventional Fossil Energy Technologies. CCUS program includes Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage subprograms for separating CO2, converting carbon to marketable products, and storing CO2 in geologic formations. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was authorized in 1975 to store crude oil in caverns within salt domes in Louisiana and Texas, providing security against oil supply disruptions. This program fulfills U.S. obligations under the International Energy Program and serves as a deterrent against energy supply disruptions. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was established in 1975 to store crude oil in salt dome caverns in Louisiana and Texas, ensuring energy security and serving as a deterrent against supply disruptions. The SPR's capacity reached 727 million barrels by early 2010, but currently holds about 649 million barrels due to sales and purchases mandated by laws enacted since 2015. The legislation enacted since 2015 mandates the sale of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve over the period FY2017 through FY2027, totaling 266 million barrels. The DOE Office of Science conducts basic research in six program areas. The DOE's Office of Science is the largest Federal sponsor of basic research in the physical sciences and supports fundamental scientific research for the nation's energy future. The ASCR program focuses on developing computing and networking capabilities for science and research, including exascale computing. The BES program area in the Office of Science focuses on understanding and controlling matter and energy at the atomic and molecular levels.

U.S. analysts have concerns about ITER's cost and impact on domestic fusion research. The High Energy Physics (HEP) program focuses on researching the fundamental constituents of matter. The High Energy Physics (HEP) program researches fundamental constituents of matter and energy, including dark energy and dark matter. The Nuclear Physics program studies matter's basic constituents and interactions, with a major project being the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams at Michigan State University. The Advanced Research Projects Agency\u2014Energy (ARPA-E) supports transformative energy technology research projects to overcome long-term technological barriers. The DOE's Loan Programs Office provides loan guarantees for specified projects. Sargent Jr. DOE's Loan Programs Office offers loan guarantees for projects deploying specified energy technologies under Title 17 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The program covers up to 80% of construction costs for eligible energy projects, with successful applicants required to pay an upfront fee. The federal government would repay all covered loans in case of borrower default, reducing risk for lenders. Loan guarantees reduce lender risk, enabling financing at below-market rates. Authorized guarantee amounts include: $8.3 billion for nonnuclear technologies, $2.0 billion for unspecified projects, $18.5 billion for nuclear power plants, $4 billion for uranium enrichment plants, $1.18 billion for renewable energy projects. An additional $161 million was allocated for subsidy costs. The loan guarantees under Section 1703 leveraged about $1.6 billion for the Vogtle nuclear project in Georgia. The Stockpile Stewardship Program was established to maintain confidence in the U.S. nuclear stockpile. NuScale Power is seeking a loan guarantee to build a small modular reactor in Idaho. The Stockpile Stewardship Program, established by the Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010, ensures the safety and reliability of the nuclear weapons stockpile without underground testing. It is operated by the NNSA, funded through the Weapons Activities account, and involves activities at various nuclear weapons facilities across the country. The NNSA manages and sets policy for the weapons complex, with contractors operating eight sites including the Nevada National Security Site. Radiological activities are overseen by the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board. The Weapons Activities account includes Directed Stockpile Work for life extension programs, stockpile services, research, development, and dismantlement of warheads. Funding for dismantlement increased as the U.S. stockpile decreased after the Cold War. The Directed Stockpile Work program provides funding for critical components of nuclear warheads and materials like plutonium pits. Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E) focuses on developing capabilities for stockpile stewardship without nuclear testing. Infrastructure and Operations funding includes material recycle, facility recapitalization, and construction. The Nuclear Weapons Activities program includes projects such as the Uranium Processing Facility and the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Replacement Project. It also covers programs for secure transportation, defense nuclear security, and information technology and cybersecurity. DOE's nonproliferation and national security programs, administered by NNSA's Office of Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation, support U.S. efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons. The Materials Management and Minimization program works to eliminate stockpiles of weapons-useable material worldwide through activities like converting reactors to low-enriched uranium and disposing of excess nuclear materials. Global Materials Security has three major program elements: International Nuclear Security focuses on securing vulnerable stockpiles of nuclear material in other countries, Radiological Security promotes reducing and securing radioactive sources worldwide, and Nuclear Smuggling Detection and Deterrence works to prevent illicit trafficking of nuclear materials. Nonproliferation and Arms Control supports U.S. objectives to prevent proliferation, ensure peaceful nuclear uses, and enable verifiable nuclear reductions through reviews of nuclear export applications and treaty obligations implementation. The Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation program includes research, development, and construction to advance nuclear detection and forensics technologies. Nuclear Counterterrorism and Incident Response provides policy, planning, training, and capacity building to counter nuclear terrorism. The DOE manages legacy waste and contamination from nuclear weapons production and environmental contamination at nondefense nuclear research sites. The DOE established the Office of Environmental Management in 1989 to consolidate cleanup responsibilities for former nuclear weapons production sites. Cleanup efforts include disposal of radioactive and hazardous wastes, management of surplus nuclear materials, remediation of contamination in soil and groundwater, decontamination of buildings, and safeguarding facilities. Over 100 sites in 30 states are involved in nuclear weapons production and research cleanup. The DOE established the Office of Environmental Management in 1989 to consolidate cleanup responsibilities for former nuclear weapons production sites across 100 sites in 30 states. Cleanup remedies are in place at most sites, with long-term stewardship managed by the Office of Legacy Management and other DOE offices. Some smaller sites were transferred to the Army Corps of Engineers under the FUSRAP program in 1997 for cleanup before being returned to DOE for long-term stewardship. The Office of Environmental Management is funded by three appropriations accounts, with the Defense Environmental Cleanup account being the largest. It finances the cleanup of former nuclear weapons production sites. The Non-Defense Environmental Cleanup account funds the cleanup of federal nuclear energy research sites. The Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund was established to pay for the cleanup of three federal facilities that enriched uranium. Title X of P.L. 102-486 authorized reimbursement for uranium and thorium producers for cleanup costs. Funding for the Office of Environmental Management to achieve cleanup milestones has been a recurring issue. These milestones are enforceable measures in compliance agreements among DOE, EPA, and states, setting time frames for specific actions at individual sites. DOE's Power Marketing Administrations sell power from dams, prioritizing publicly and cooperatively owned utilities. PMAs operate in 34 states with transmission infrastructure spanning over 33,000 miles of high voltage lines and 587 substations. PMA customers repay power program expenses and capital project interest. The Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs) are responsible for repaying power program expenses and capital project interest. Power revenues associated with PMAs are classified as discretionary offsetting receipts, giving them a \"net-zero\" spending authority. Only the capital expenses of WAPA and SWPA require appropriations from Congress. Other independent agencies funded in Title IV of the Energy and Water Development bill include the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC), and the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board. NRC has a budget of over $900 million, with about 90% offset by other means. The Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) was established in 1965 as a regional economic development agency. It awards grants and contracts to foster economic opportunities, improve workforce skills, build critical infrastructure, and strengthen natural and cultural assets in the defined Appalachian Region. The region includes parts of several states and has a population of over 25 million people. The Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) provides funding for projects in economically distressed counties, focusing on infrastructure like broadband, transportation, and water systems. They have supported the development of the Appalachian Development Highway System (ADHS), with 90.5% completion. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) enforces safety standards for nuclear power plants and materials, with Nuclear Reactor Safety being its largest program. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) oversees the U.S. fleet of power reactors and nuclear waste facilities, including the proposed Yucca Mountain repository. NRC's budget is mostly funded through fees from nuclear reactor owners and license holders, with only 10% coming from appropriations. Congressional hearings have discussed the FY2020 budget request, with testimony and statements available online. Testimony and opening statements for various Department of Energy hearings are available online, along with webcasts in some cases. Dates and links for specific hearings are provided for easy access. The National Nuclear Security Administration budget request was reviewed on April 3, 2019. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation budget requests were reviewed on April 10, 2019. Links to the hearings can be found online."
