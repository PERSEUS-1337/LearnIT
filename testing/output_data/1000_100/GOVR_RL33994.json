    "content": "Many observers criticized the United Nations for leaving Timor-Leste prematurely in 2005, leading to political violence in 2006. President Jose Ramos-Horta requested the UN to stay for five more years in 2008 due to ongoing security concerns. In 2008-2009, civilians displaced in 2006 returned home. A failed assassination attempt on President Ramos-Horta and Prime Minister Gusmao in 2008 was led by former Major Alfredo Reinado, who was killed. Reinado's group of ex-soldiers surrendered in April 2008. The security situation in Timor-Leste has improved, but concerns remain about implementing security reforms after the 2006 mutiny. Indonesia was blamed for atrocities in 1999, with President Yudhoyono expressing regret. President Ramos-Horta urged moving on after the report. There is also concern over government plans to withdraw funds from Timor's Petroleum Fund in 2009. In 2009, Timor-Leste planned to withdraw funds from the Petroleum Fund. China's involvement in Timor-Leste increased, offering assistance with construction and selling power plants and patrol boats. The government created the National Recovery Strategy Program in 2007, focusing on housing, trust-building, security, social protection, and socio-economic development. By June 2009, the last IDP camps were being closed. The government of East Timor needed support to close the last IDP camps by 2009. The country's history includes Portuguese colonial control, independence declaration in 1975, Indonesian invasion, and a referendum for autonomy or independence in 1999. In East Timor, a referendum for independence from Indonesia was held in 1999 under U.N. supervision. The majority voted for independence, leading to violent retaliation by pro-integrationist militias. More than 1,300 people were killed, and infrastructure was severely damaged. A U.N.-authorized peacekeeping mission, INTERFET, was deployed to restore order. Australia played a leading role in the mission. Jose Ramos-Horta, the president of Timor-Leste, has been actively involved in promoting the country's cause on the international stage. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1996 for his efforts. Ramos-Horta was appointed president in 2006 after the resignation of Mari Alkatiri. He survived an assassination attempt in 2008. Former President Xanana Gusmao is the current prime minister of Timor-Leste. Xanana Gusmao, a former civil servant under Portuguese rule, became the leader of the resistance in Timor-Leste after the death of Fretilin commander Nicolau Lobato in 1978. Captured by Indonesian forces in 1992, he was released in 1999 and became Timor-Leste's first president in 2002. Gusmao later served as prime minister after forming a coalition with smaller parties. In 2008, he survived an assassination attempt by Reinado forces, a group of disgruntled security forces that caused insecurity in 2006. The Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste has a unicameral national parliament of 65 members, elected in June 2007. The parliament originated from an 88-member Constituent Assembly in 2001 that drafted the constitution for East Timor. East Timor gained independence in 2002 after being under UN administration since 1999. Fretilin's Secretary General, Alkatiri, has support within the country but has a hostile relationship with Gusmao, who opposes using petroleum reserves to fund a budget deficit. East Timor gained independence on May 20, 2002, with a new constitution establishing a parliamentary government. Xanana Gusmao led a coalition government in 2007, consisting of four parties. The main opposition party is Fretilin. The main opposition party in East Timor is Fretilin, facing challenges in parliament with members lacking legislative experience and education. The use of multiple legal languages hampers parliamentary business. Committees attempt oversight with limited staff and resources. In 2007, Ramos-Horta was elected president with 69% of the vote, while Xanana Gusmao became prime minister leading the largest coalition of parties. In 2007, Xanana Gusmao became prime minister leading the largest coalition of parties in East Timor. Violent protests followed his appointment. Prior to the 2007 elections, East Timor held elections in 2001 and 2002, with high voter turnout. Events in 2006 led to the reintroduction of foreign peacekeepers from Australia, New Zealand, Portugal, and Malaysia. The Australian military contingent, the largest with 1,100 troops, was deployed in East Timor at the invitation of the government. UN Security Council Resolution 1704 established the UN Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT) with civilian, police, and military personnel to support stability, democratic governance, and national reconciliation. Strife in 2006 stemmed from divisions within the Fretilin party, with some members going into exile and others, like Xanana Gusmao, staying to fight. Divisions within East Timor's military and police forces, stemming from loyalty to Xanana Gusmao, have led to the creation of paramilitary units. Recruitment processes have resulted in tensions between those loyal to Gusmao and those with ties to the Indonesian police force. The situation is exacerbated by political and institutional conflicts between the president and the ruling party, Fretilin. The dismissal of 591 military members in March 2006 by former Prime Minister Alkatiri triggered political turmoil in East Timor. The military divisions between eastern and western districts, along with police factions joining rebels, led to rioting, looting, and deaths. The dismissal of 591 military members in March 2006 by former Prime Minister Alkatiri triggered political turmoil in East Timor, leading to rioting, looting, deaths, and the fleeing of tens of thousands of mostly eastern East Timorese from the capital, Dili. Alkatiri stepped down in June amid accusations of forming \"hit squads,\" which he denied. Former Interior Minister Rogerio Lobato was sentenced to seven years imprisonment for authorizing the transfer of weapons to pro-Fretilin supporters and a Fretilin-linked hit squad. Major Alfredo Reinado, a leader of violent protests in March 2006, had a support base drawn from the west. Major Alfredo Reinado, a key figure from the western districts, escaped from prison with 50 supporters in August 2006. Despite Australian forces failing to capture him on March 11, 2007, the East Timor government ordered an operation to apprehend him. Reinado's influence stemmed from his ability to attract support among young men resentful of foreign military presence and the government's handling of protesting troops. Unemployment and underemployment also contributed to the escalating violence in East Timor. Unemployment and underemployment, estimated at 70% in East Timor, led to gang violence and instability after the 2006 clashes. Gangs in Dili viewed Reinado positively, causing further displacement and property destruction. The UN reported that by February 2007, 100,000 people remained displaced, with many unable to return home due to damage. The living conditions of internally displaced persons (IDPs) in East Timor were dire, with damaged or destroyed homes, lack of access to clean water, and high risk of disease due to poor sanitation. More than 40% of the population lived below the poverty line, leading to high child mortality rates from lack of sanitation, infectious diseases, and malnutrition. Rice shortages, food price increases, and deteriorating social structures further exacerbated the situation, affecting healthcare, education, and disaster response capabilities. The transition from humanitarian programs to development activities in East Timor remains a challenge due to extreme poverty levels. Funding increased during times of insecurity and displacement, with the U.N. providing emergency assistance. Security incidents in 2007 led to restrictions on humanitarian personnel movement, raising concerns about the protection and security of displaced individuals. In 2007, security incidents in East Timor raised concerns about the protection and security of displaced individuals. The international community, including the U.N. and various organizations, provided assistance and worked closely with local groups. By April 2008, IDPs willing to return received recovery packages, and the government started decommissioning some IDP camps. The government began decommissioning some of the 65 IDP camps in East Timor in 2008, with assistance from international organizations like the International Organization for Migration. By November 2008, 10,400 families had received recovery packages and returned, with 21 camps closed. Limited access to food, water, and basic services remained a problem for returning IDPs, along with increasing food prices and shortages. Land disputes also impacted the sustainability of returns. The sustainability of returns for IDPs in East Timor has been affected by land disputes, home conditions, and fear of violence in their villages. Despite no major incidents during recent returns, challenges persist. The U.N. Representative emphasized the need for sustainable returns and durable solutions. UNOCHA ended its formal mission in December 2008, with a national staff member continuing humanitarian work within UNMIT. A new U.N. mission was established in East Timor in August 2006 under Resolution 1704. The U.N. established a new mission in East Timor under Resolution 1704, called UNMIT, to assist with security, political, and humanitarian issues. The mission includes civilian, police, and military personnel, as well as support for electoral processes. The mandate was extended until February 2008, with temporary police reinforcement approved for national elections. Cooperation with the International Security Force (ISF) was emphasized. The U.N. Security Council extended the mandate for the UNMIT mission in East Timor until February 26, 2010, highlighting the need for long-term commitment to achieve stability, development, and democratic governance. Challenges such as reintegration of IDPs, poverty, underdevelopment, and high unemployment persist in a fragile political and judicial environment marked by volatility and insecurity. The Secretary General's report highlighted three main areas of focus: political developments, restoration of public security, and support for the 'Compact'. Specific activities included support for dialogue and reconciliation, electoral process, human rights promotion, and maintenance of public security. The report emphasized the need for increasing dialogue, reconciliation, improving democratic governance, and strengthening security institutions. The U.N. peace operations in East Timor focus on public security, human rights promotion, socio-economic development, and preparation of a medium-term strategy. The U.N. peace operations in East Timor have evolved in phases since 1999. Resolution 1246 authorized UNAMET to organize a national referendum in August on East Timor's status. After violence erupted, Resolution 1264 authorized INTERFET. UNTAET was established on October 25, 1999, to administer East Timor. The U.N. conducted a multi-dimensional peacekeeping operation in East Timor to assist in its transition to independence. UNTAET's mandate included providing humanitarian aid, reconstruction assistance, establishing a government, and aiding East Timorese refugees. UNMISET was established in 2002 as a successor mission to UNTAET. The United Nations Office in Timor-Leste (UNOTIL) was established in 2005 as a special political mission to support state institutions, strengthen democratic governance, and develop a national police force. Its mandate lasted until May 2006, focusing on peace-building activities and human rights observance. Special Representative Sukehiro Hasegawa highlighted UNOTIL's achievements in implementing programs and preparing for capacity transfer in his address to the U.N. Security Council in January 2006. In Timor-Leste, progress was made in implementing mandated programs and preparing for capacity building support functions. The Timorese were developing skills in public administration, training national judges, and enhancing expertise in the finance sector. Efforts were also made in democratic governance and human rights, including drafting a strategic plan and training the Border Patrol Unit. However, concerns were raised about weaknesses in justice and finance sectors, emphasizing the need for international advisory support. In Timor-Leste, progress was made in implementing programs and capacity building support functions. Concerns were raised about pending civil and criminal cases, human rights activities needing outside supervision, and additional training for the Border Patrol Unit. Mr. Hasegawa described the situation as \"fragile\" and emphasized the need to maintain stability for the 2007 elections. UNOTIL's mandate was extended multiple times due to increased violence. The U.N. Security Council extended the mandate for U.S. aid programs in East Timor to support economic and political development, including building a free market economy, basic public services, and good governance. The assistance aims to develop independent media, civil society organizations, and political parties. The U.S. aid programs in East Timor support independent media, civil society organizations, and political parties, while also strengthening the electoral process and governmental capacity. According to experts, sustained bilateral, multilateral, and regional support is still needed. The Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) provides non-food humanitarian assistance during crises and disasters, facilitating U.S. government emergency assistance. In East Timor, the U.S. aid programs provide humanitarian assistance through the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) and the Food for Peace Program (FFP). OFDA funds implementing partners for tasks like humanitarian coordination, shelter, water, sanitation, and peacebuilding. In FY2008, OFDA provided $1.2 million, FFP contributed over $1.1 million, and the Office of Conflict Management and Mitigation (CMM) provided $0.8 million. In FY2008, OFDA provided $1.2 million, FFP contributed over $1.1 million, and CMM provided $0.8 million for a total of just over $3.1 million in USAID humanitarian assistance to East Timor. In previous years, OFDA and FFP also provided significant aid amounts to East Timor. The events of 2006 highlighted the need for continued support to improve security services, judiciary, institutional transparency, and the rule of law in East Timor to prevent destabilization upon the U.N.'s departure. The United States' relations with East Timor have been closely tied to its relations with Indonesia. Congress has expressed concern about past human rights abuses in East Timor by the Indonesian military. The East Timorese government is looking to move forward and establish a productive relationship with Indonesia. The population difference between Indonesia and East Timor is a factor in human rights considerations for the U.S. The Tariff Relief Assistance for Developing Economies Act of 2009 would include Timor-Leste as an eligible state. The proposed legislation, S. 1141, aims to include Timor-Leste as an eligible state for preferential tariff treatment. Timor-Leste's main external relations are with Australia, New Zealand, Portugal, Indonesia, and China. Australia and New Zealand have been key providers of peacekeeping troops in Timor-Leste since 1999. Australia and New Zealand have been key providers of peacekeeping troops in Timor-Leste since 1999. Australia has 650 soldiers operating alongside 150 troops from New Zealand as part of the International Stabilization Force (ISF). Australian police also work alongside police from 20 other countries in Dili as part of the United Nations Police Force. Australia has strategic and economic interests in Timor, including historical involvement in World War II and the Timor Gap Treaty with Indonesia. The Timor Gap Treaty between Indonesia and Australia in 1989 led to joint development of hydrocarbon resources in the maritime area. Despite disagreements on sovereignty, Australia and Timor-Leste work together on resource development. Timor-Leste hopes for a processing facility in Timor, while Australia supports one in Darwin. Commercial concerns and political instability in Timor influence decisions on resource development. The political security situation in Timor influences commercial decisions favoring facilities in Darwin. Key participants in the greater Sunrise project include Woodside, ConocoPhillips, Shell, and Osaka Gas. Timor-Leste has a historical relationship with Portugal, with Portuguese colonial influence until 1975. Portugal provides foreign assistance and cultural support to Timor-Leste. Indonesia invaded Timor-Leste after Portuguese departure in 1975. After gaining independence from Portugal in 1975, Timor-Leste faced Indonesian military aggression resulting in significant casualties and destruction. The 1999 referendum for independence led to further violence by Indonesian-backed militias. Despite efforts for reconciliation, the past atrocities remain unaddressed as the country strives for positive relations with Indonesia. President Ramos-Horta has urged the people to move forward without seeking justice for the 1999 crimes. Former Indonesian General Wiranto, responsible for human rights abuses in East Timor in 1999, ran for vice president in the 2009 Indonesian elections. China has increased investment in Timor-Leste since 2005 for various reasons, including balancing U.S. influence in Southeast Asia and accessing Timor's resources. China has increased its influence in Timor by providing assistance for government buildings and selling patrol vessels. Timor supports a One-China policy and aims to strengthen bilateral relations with China. Plans to purchase power stations from China for $381 million are also in place. Plans to purchase second-hand oil burning power stations from China for $381 million in June 2009 faced criticism for being unnecessary and potential heavy polluters. The heavy oil would need to be imported to gas-rich Timor, with Fretilin opposing the proposal and preparing a legal challenge. East Timor, with extensive off-shore energy resources, aims to become a full member of the ASEAN group for financial development. Disputes with Australia over maritime boundaries have been somewhat resolved through revenue sharing agreements. In January 2006, Australia and East Timor signed a treaty increasing East Timor's share of hydrocarbon revenues to 50% for the Greater Sunrise field. East Timor earned $360 million in hydrocarbon revenues in 2005-2006. They also have a 90%-10% revenue sharing agreement for the Bayu-Udan field. East Timor favors a pipeline but faces challenges due to seabed configuration and lack of infrastructure. The configuration of the seabed and lack of infrastructure led industry to favor Darwin over Timor-Leste for a new liquefied natural gas plant. Timor-Leste prefers a plant on its southern coast. The Bayu-Udan field is expected to be depleted by 2023. East Timor has earned billions in energy revenues since 2005, mostly placed in a Petroleum Fund. The government has been criticized for spending from the fund, intended to save for future generations. East Timor's top export destinations are Australia, Germany, Portugal, and Brazil. It is the poorest country in Asia. East Timor is the poorest country in Asia and one of the poorest in the world. Its economy is dual, with one part serving the international donor community and the other 90% based on agriculture. The violence in 1999 devastated the country's infrastructure, leading to widespread poverty and lack of basic amenities. The mountainous terrain is difficult and infertile, requiring sustained efforts for job creation, infrastructure reconstruction, and improved health and literacy rates. Language barriers exist, with Indonesian being more widely used than the official Tetun or Portuguese. Economic development is crucial for the East Timorese people to improve their living conditions. Significant economic development is needed to improve the basic standard of living in East Timor. External assistance remains crucial post-independence, especially for governance capacity building. Revenue from oil and gas in the Timor Gap has increased, along with economic activities like coffee production and potential for tourism and fisheries. Challenges include strengthening democratic institutions, education and training the workforce, implementing the rule of law, and rebuilding infrastructure. East Timor is a member of the World Bank and IMF, and has shown interest in ASEAN membership. In January 2000, an international commission recommended establishing a tribunal for crimes after the 1999 independence referendum in East Timor. The Indonesian government conducted its own investigation, leading to dissatisfaction from the US and allies. The UN's Serious Crimes Unit indicted over 380 individuals, convicting 55, and acquitting three for crimes related to the referendum. Only one person was imprisoned in Indonesia for crimes in East Timor. President Gusmao has supported a joint East Timor-Indonesia Commission of Truth and Friendship to address past atrocities, with the first public hearing held in Bali in February 2007. Critics argue that Indonesia has not been held accountable for documented atrocities in 1999, despite a 2005 report detailing executions, torture, mutilations, and rape. If Gusmao becomes prime minister, it is unlikely that there will be a change in policy regarding past human rights abuses by Indonesians during East Timor's independence. The 2009 State Department Country Report on Human Rights practices in Timor-Leste highlighted serious human rights issues including police abuse, arbitrary arrest, and inadequate judiciary. Concerns were raised about the control, discipline, and accountability of the National Police and Defense Forces. Questions arose about extending the UN presence in East Timor beyond 2006. Supporters argue for continued U.N. presence in East Timor due to fragile state institutions and vulnerabilities. Improvements needed in security services, judiciary, transparency, and rule of law. East Timor requests U.N. maintenance. U.S. suggests reducing reliance on direct U.N. assistance with international community support in key sectors for democratic institutions, infrastructure, and economic development. The debate surrounds the timing of the United Nations' departure from fragile states like East Timor. Questions arise about the duration of UN presence, necessary international support, and criteria for measuring aid effectiveness and national capacity building progress. Donor fatigue and limited budgets add pressure to the situation. The debate on the timing of the United Nations' departure from fragile states like East Timor involves questions about aid effectiveness, national capacity building progress, donor fatigue, and limited budgets. Humanitarian crises and development assistance face pressures and complicating factors in determining the right course of action."
