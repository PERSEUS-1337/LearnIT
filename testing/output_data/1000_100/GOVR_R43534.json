    "content": "In 1978, Congress enacted the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) to address electronic surveillance abuses. FISA established the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) to review government applications for electronic surveillance. Recent concerns about FISC's orders have led to proposals to amend FISA and the FISC's practices, focusing on altering the process for selecting judges for the FISA courts. The judicial power in the United States includes rendering final judgments in cases and controversies. Federal judges in Article III courts have life tenure and their salaries cannot be reduced during their terms. The purpose is to ensure independence from political interference for an impartial administration of the laws. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) was established by Congress under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) to issue orders related to foreign intelligence investigations. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) established the FISA Court of Review to review denials by the FISC. The Chief Justice designates federal judges for the FISC and Court of Review, serving seven-year terms. Some argue against the sole authority of the Chief Justice in selecting judges. Several bills in the 113th Congress aim to change the process of selecting FISA judges, with proposals including giving selection authority to chief judges of circuit courts or allowing the President or congressional leadership to choose judges. The main concern is whether designating judges by a specific branch of government would be constitutionally permissible. The judicial branch expressed concern with proposals to shift selection of FISA judges away from the Chief Justice in January 2014. The report reviews the constitutional method for appointing Article III judges and explores the constitutionality of proposals that shift designation authority to other officials within the branches of government. The Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution dictates how certain government officials, like Judges of the supreme Court, must be appointed. The Supreme Court has ruled that all Article III judges are principal officers appointed by the President with Senate consent. If Congress expands an office's duties, a second appointment may not be necessary if the new duties are related to the original post. For example, military officers can serve on a military court without a second appointment. The Supreme Court has ruled that all Article III judges are principal officers appointed by the President with Senate consent. Congress may increase the power and duties of an existing office without requiring a second appointment if the new duties are related to the original post. This principle, known as \"germaneness,\" allows for the designation of federal judges to serve in separate positions within a related Article III capacity without violating the Appointments Clause. The Chief Justice has the authority to temporarily assign federal judges to serve on other federal courts. The Chief Justice has authority to designate federal judges to special tribunals, like the now-defunct Commerce Court. This process has been upheld by the Supreme Court and has served as a model for future specialized courts. Congress has also given lower federal court judges designation authority. The Supreme Court has upheld the Chief Justice's authority to designate federal judges to special tribunals, like the Commerce Court. This process has been deemed a matter of statutory construction, not a constitutional issue. The Court has also dismissed challenges to the Chief Justice's designation authority with respect to district court judges. The court rejected the defendant's argument that the FISA judges' designation violated the Appointments Clause, citing precedent of Chief Justice's authority to assign judges to specialized courts. The FISA Judge Selection Reform Act proposes dispersing the selection process for the FISC between the 13 chief judges of the circuit courts and the Chief Justice, increasing the number of FISC judges from 11 to 13. The FISA Judge Selection Reform Act proposes involving chief judges of circuit courts and the Chief Justice in designating FISA court judges, with the Chief Justice having the final say. At least five Supreme Court associate justices must concur in the Chief Justice's designation for the FISA Court of Review. This proposal aims to expand the selection process and increase the number of FISA judges. The McDowell Court suggested that Congress has the authority to designate judges to serve in different districts, based on their power to establish courts. This implies that Congress could potentially empower chief judges to appoint judges from within their circuits to serve on FISA courts. The McDowell Court suggested that Congress has the authority to designate judges to serve in different districts, implying that chief judges could potentially appoint judges from within their circuits to serve on FISA courts. Other proposals include shifting designation authority to the President through the Presidential Appointment of FISA Court Judges Act (H.R. 2761), which would allow the President to \"designate\" judges for both the FISC and FISA Court of Review. This proposal could be seen as a second constitutional appointment, following the Appointments Clause. A reviewing court could reasonably construe that life tenure protects a judge's overall position on the federal judiciary and not the particular court to which he is appointed, allowing judges appointed to FISA courts for fixed terms to retain their Article III status and protections. The proposal to allow the President to select federal judges for the FISA courts may raise separation-of-powers concerns, as it could be seen as executive encroachment on the judiciary. However, the Mistretta v. United States case established that the President can appoint judges to the U.S. Sentencing Commission without violating the separation-of-powers doctrine. The President cannot affect the tenure or compensation of Article III judges or coerce them in their judicial duties.

However, the President cannot affect the tenure or compensation of Article III judges or coerce them in their judicial duties. There are proposals to vest designation authority with congressional leadership for FISA judges. The FISA Court Accountability Act proposes allowing congressional leadership to make designations to the FISC and FISA Court of Review, which may raise concerns under the Appointments Clause and separation-of-powers principles. Congressional designations could conflict with the principles outlined in I.N.S. v. Chadha regarding legislative acts altering legal rights. The FISA Court Accountability Act proposes allowing congressional leadership to designate judges to the FISC and FISA Court of Review, which may raise concerns under the Constitution's bicameralism and presentment requirements. Congressional designations made without approval from both houses or the President could implicate principles established in Chadha."
