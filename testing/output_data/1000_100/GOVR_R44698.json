    "content": "Poverty rates have been rising since 2000, with only three significant declines between 2000 and 2015. Policymakers are reexamining the drivers of poverty and the effectiveness of policy responses. A report provides a snapshot of who was poor in 2015 by various characteristics, showing that those in poverty are a diverse group of families and individuals. The report highlights the diverse nature of poverty, focusing on the role of work and living arrangements in economic well-being. Factors like family dynamics and attachment to the labor market are crucial considerations for understanding poverty. This snapshot examines the composition of people in poverty, looking at what groups make up the poverty population. It provides a different perspective on poverty, showing how different population groups contribute to the overall poverty population. The report does not delve into factors like family dynamics and attachment to the labor market, which are important for understanding poverty but are beyond its scope. The CRS Report R44644, Poverty in the United States in 2015: In Brief, examines poverty rates for different demographic groups using the official measure of poverty by the U.S. Census Bureau. Poverty is defined as a lack of resources to meet basic needs, with poverty status determined by income compared to a dollar threshold. The Census poverty measure is family-based, considering the income of family members related by birth, marriage, or adoption. If an individual lives alone or with non-relatives, only their income is counted for poverty status. The poverty status is determined by comparing money income to a dollar threshold based on family composition. The official poverty measure has limitations as it only looks at pre-tax income and does not consider government taxes, non-cash benefits, or assets. The official poverty measure does not consider living cost differences or modern family arrangements. The Census Bureau has a supplemental poverty measure that adjusts for taxes, transfers, and housing costs. In 2015, an estimated 43.1 million people had income below the poverty threshold. In 2015, an estimated 19.4 million people were living in deep poverty, defined as having income below 50% of the poverty threshold. This accounted for close to half of all individuals in poverty. The population in poverty included individuals of all ages, genders, and racial/ethnic groups. Figure 3 illustrates the distribution of the population in poverty by age group, showing children, working-age adults, and the aged. In 2015, the population in poverty included individuals of all ages, genders, and racial/ethnic groups. Children made up one-third of those in poverty, with working-age adults comprising the largest share. People aged 65 and older were underrepresented. Figure 4 shows the racial and ethnic composition of the poverty population compared to the total population. Non-Hispanic whites were the largest group in both populations. The poverty population in 2015 was diverse in terms of age, gender, and racial/ethnic groups. Non-Hispanic whites were the largest group in both the total and poverty populations. Hispanics were the second largest group overall and the largest within the poverty population. Most minority groups were over-represented in poverty, including Hispanics, non-Hispanic African-Americans, and others. Non-Hispanic whites and Asians were under-represented in poverty. The racial and ethnic composition of people in poverty varied by age group. The demographic trends of poverty in 2015 show that minorities were over-represented in all age groups. Hispanic children made up the largest share of poor children, while non-Hispanic white children were the largest group overall. Women slightly outnumbered men in the total population, but represented a larger share in the poverty population, possibly due to heading single-parent households. The report explores poverty among children, working-age adults, and aged adults, with different policy considerations for each group. Men earn more than women on average, even with full-time year-round employment. Children are dependents, working-age adults are expected to work and support themselves and their children, while aged adults may retire and draw income from past work. Children in America are disproportionately poor, with a poverty rate of 19.7% in 2015. They rely on their parents or other adult caretakers for support. In 2015, 19.7% of children in America were poor, relying on adult caretakers for support. Among poor children, two-thirds lived in families with earners, with 57.5% having one earner and 10.5% having two or more earners. 32.1% lived in families with no income from earnings. In 2015, children in America were poor, with two-thirds living in families with earners. Children in female-headed families made up the majority of poor children, while children in married couple families still accounted for one-third of all poor children. Despite a low poverty rate for children in married couple families, their large population size meant a substantial number were still poor. In 2015, a substantial number of poor children lived in married-couple families, which were underrepresented among children in poverty. Larger families are more likely to be poor due to higher income requirements, even though earnings are not determined by family size. 27% of poor children in 2015 were in families with four or more children. In 2015, a significant number of poor children were in families with four or more children, which is higher than the overall population. Working-age adults make up the majority of people in poverty, with 61.3% not earning from work. In 2015, a significant number of poor children were in families with four or more children. 38.8% of working-age adults who were poor were working in some capacity, with 10.4% working full-time all year. Reasons for not working included illness, caregiving, schooling, retirement, and job availability. Educational attainment is linked to success in the workforce. In 2015, a significant number of poor working-age adults had varying levels of educational attainment. The largest group were high school graduates without a post-secondary credential, followed by those without a high school diploma. Educational credentials are linked to higher earnings and job stability. In 2015, working-age adults with only a high school diploma were the largest group among the poor. Family living arrangements were more common in the overall population than among the poor, with 41% of all working-age adults in poverty living outside of a family. This group included individuals living alone, with cohabiting partners, or other unrelated adults/roommates. The poverty status of individuals living outside of families with others is determined by each person's income, without pooling resources. Aged adults have the lowest likelihood of living below the poverty line, accounting for 14.9% of the total population but only 9.7% in poverty in 2015. Despite many aged adults not working, income from past work and other family members is crucial for their financial well-being. In 2015, Social Security income was received by 62.4% of aged persons in poverty, compared to 86.0% in the total population. Aged adults also receive income from pensions and other benefits earned during their working careers, but fewer in poverty receive these benefits compared to the overall aged population. In 2015, retirement, disability, or survivor pensions were received by 48.5% of all aged persons, but only 7.7% of families of aged persons in poverty. Earnings from current work were received by 40.7% of aged persons, with only 11.0% of families in poverty receiving earnings. Most aged adults (97.2%) lived in families with income derived from work, including Social Security or pension income, or current work. Among aged persons in poverty, almost three in four (71.7%) lived in families with work-derived income. Figure 14 illustrates aged adults living in poverty. In 2015, half of aged adults in poverty lived alone, significantly higher than the overall aged population. Aged adults in poverty were less likely to be living in families compared to the overall aged population. The report provides basic information about the 43 million Americans below the poverty line in 2015, showing they are a diverse group including children, working-age adults, and aged adults living alone or in families. The report highlights certain groups over-represented in poverty, such as women, minorities, children, and individuals living alone. Income from work plays a central role in determining poverty status, with children relying on parents' income, working-age adults on their own work, and aged adults on past work or that of those they live with. Despite earning income, two-thirds of children in poverty in 2015 were in families with at least one working adult. In 2015, over 70% of elderly individuals in poverty had some form of work-based income. The complexity of circumstances leading to poverty, both individual and systemic, require further exploration for effective federal policy interventions."
