The \"MANIFEST for Human Spaceflight Act of 2016\" reaffirms Congress's goal for NASA to expand human presence beyond low-Earth orbit with international partners, as outlined in the 2010 Authorization Act. Congress also acknowledges the findings of the National Academy of Sciences regarding human space flight goals and capabilities. The Committee on Human Spaceflight, comprised of leaders from various sectors, concluded that multiple rationales support human space exploration, including economic benefits, national security, and scientific discovery. They affirmed Mars as the long-term goal and recommended it for the human space flight program. The Committee on Human Spaceflight recommended sustainable steps and mission planning for NASA to achieve the goal of placing humans on Mars. The Committee on Human Spaceflight recommended sustainable steps and mission planning for NASA to achieve the goal of placing humans on Mars. SEC. 3. HUMAN EXPLORATION STRATEGY. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2010 is amended to include human exploration of Mars, with a focus on extending human presence to the surface. The Administrator of NASA is required to submit reports outlining a strategy to achieve this objective. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2010 is amended to include human exploration of Mars and other destinations. The Administrator of NASA is required to develop a strategy for expanded human presence in cis-lunar space to enable missions to various destinations for future exploration and development. The curr_chunk discusses the importance of an expanded human presence in cis-lunar space for economic, scientific, and technological advances, collaboration opportunities with international partners, private industry, and other Federal agencies, utilization of the International Space Station for research and technological developments, and exploration mission architectures. The curr_chunk discusses a range of exploration mission architectures for missions including the Orion crew capsule and the Space Launch System, comparing them based on factors like cost effectiveness, schedule resiliency, safety, sustainability, and opportunities for international collaboration. It also evaluates how these architectures may enable new markets for US private industry and provide opportunities for scientific discovery. The curr_chunk discusses measures for setting standards to ensure crew health and safety during space exploration missions, including radiation exposure limits and medical countermeasures. It also addresses safety, health, and medical issues that may arise. The curr_chunk outlines crew training needs, prioritizing missions, and assessing recommendations from a previous report for space exploration missions. The Administrator ensures recommendations are incorporated into the strategy and provides technical information for stakeholder interest. The National Academy of Sciences reviews interim reports on the strategy for space exploration missions. The National Academy of Sciences reviews interim reports on space exploration missions, focusing on agreed matters, concerns, and recommendations. The Administrator ensures timely review and comment to comply with requirements. The Administrator must submit interim and final reports to the National Academy of Sciences for review and comment on the space exploration strategy within specified deadlines. The Administrator must submit a final report to Congress every five years on the space exploration strategy, incorporating feedback from the National Academy of Sciences."
