    "content": "The 1999 Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act (SHVIA) builds on the 1988 Satellite Home Viewer Act (SHVA) to enhance consumer access to television signals via satellite dishes. Major companies like EchoStar and DirecTV offer satellite TV services through their DBS systems. Rainbow DBS, a subsidiary of Cablevision, also provides satellite channels through Voom. SHVIA allows consumers greater access to broadcast network television programming via satellite dishes. The 1999 Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act (SHVIA) allows satellite companies to rebroadcast local network signals in the same market area, in addition to distant network signals. Local signals are received within a network affiliate's local area, while distant signals come from elsewhere in the country. The original law permitted the rebroadcast of distant network signals to consumers outside the \"Grade B contour\" of broadcast network affiliate stations. The SHVIA established the Grade B contour as the factor for receiving distant network signals via satellite. Consumers inside the contour were not eligible, while those outside could receive them. Court challenges arose when some satellite companies transmitted signals to ineligible consumers. In 1998, a Miami judge ruled to terminate signals for over 2 million consumers. EchoStar appealed to the Supreme Court in 2002, but the case was declined. Congress grandfathered consumers receiving distant signals in the 1999 law. In the 1999 law, Congress \"grandfathered\" consumers who had been receiving distant network signals illegally. New subscribers must meet Grade B signal intensity requirements to receive distant network signals. The FCC confirmed the use of Grade B standard for SHVIA purposes. Consumers can seek a waiver if they believe they are not receiving the required signal strength. Waiver requests are made through satellite companies. The satellite company forwards waiver requests to the local network affiliate, who has 30 days to decide. If the waiver is granted or no action is taken, consumers can receive distant network signals. If denied, consumers can request a signal intensity test, with costs covered by the \"loser\" of the test. Exceptions are made for recreational vehicles. Consumers using RVs, commercial trucks, or \"C-band\" satellite dishes may receive distant network signals until December 31, 2004, if they do not receive a Grade B signal locally or had illegal signals terminated. \"C-band\" dish users are not limited to five years. \"C-band\" dish users can receive distant network signals indefinitely if they were receiving them before October 31, 1999. SHVIA allows DBS companies to offer \"local-into-local\" service within designated market areas, but it is not mandatory. There is confusion regarding the \"must carry\" provision, which requires DBS companies to carry all local broadcast stations in a market if they provide any local station in that market. The \"must carry\" provision for DBS companies went into effect on January 1, 2002, requiring them to carry local TV stations in markets that wish to be carried. Despite opposition from DBS companies, EchoStar offered local-into-local in 152 markets and DirecTV in 106 markets as of October 2004, with plans to add more markets. Many smaller communities in the US do not receive local signals via satellite due to the 210 designated market areas (DMAs) identified by Nielsen Media Research. EchoStar and DirecTV are expanding their local-into-local services to reach more TV households. The LOCAL Act was passed in 2000 to help small and rural areas access local television through satellite or terrestrial technologies. Satellite carriers have compulsory copyright licenses for retransmitting distant network programming. The 1999 law extended the compulsory copyright license for satellite carriers retransmitting distant network signals until December 31, 2004. Congress is considering further extension and changes to pricing. Satellite companies have a royalty-free permanent compulsory copyright license for retransmitting local signals. Cable also has a permanent compulsory copyright license. Table 1: Summary of SHVIA Provisions allows satellite companies to offer local-into-local television service, implements must-carry requirements for satellites starting January 1, 2002, applies syndicated exclusivity, sports blackout, and network nonduplication to satellite retransmission of nationally distributed superstations, allows restoration of distant network signals for subscribers affected by 1998 court rulings until December 31, 2004, retains Grade B signal intensity standard for receiving distant network signals. The SHVIA provisions allow satellite companies to offer local-into-local television service and implement must-carry requirements for satellites. It also establishes a process for consumers to seek waivers from local affiliates to receive distant network signals. C-band satellite customers can continue receiving distant network signals indefinitely. Copyright royalty payments for satellite companies are reduced by 45% for distant network signals and 30% for superstation signals. No copyright fees may be charged for local signals. The SHVIA provisions allow satellite companies to offer local-into-local television service, reduce copyright royalty payments for distant network and superstation signals, and eliminate the 90-day waiting period for cable subscribers. It also allows satellite companies to offer a national PBS feed until January 1, 2002, after which local PBS stations must be carried in markets with local-into-local service. In 1999, a loan guarantee program was proposed to ensure small and rural markets benefit from local-into-local provisions, but it was deleted due to objections by Senator Gramm. Congress later passed the LOCAL Act as Title X of the FY2001 Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations Act. The FY2001 Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations Act created a board to select recipients of loan guarantees for up to $1.25 billion in loans to build systems for local television signal access. The Board considers serving \"nonserved\" or \"underserved\" areas and providing high-speed Internet access. The act is technology neutral and limits eligibility for cable companies. The Board's website is http://www.usda.gov/rus/localtvboard/. The Board issued regulations for the LOCAL Television Loan Guarantee Program in December 2003. An application period ended in April 2004, with one incomplete application received. The program is administered by the Rural Utilities Service and received funding from the FY2002 Agriculture appropriations act. The GAO criticized the slow progress of the program in its annual review reports. The \"Northpoint Provision\" required the FCC to conduct tests for potential interference from terrestrial systems operating in the same frequency band as DBS satellites. This provision was named after Northpoint Technology, seeking a license for a terrestrial service called MVDDS. The FCC is seeking a license for a terrestrial service called MVDDS in the 12.2-12.7 GHz band, previously assigned to satellites. Interference tests conducted by the MITRE Corporation concluded that MVDDS and DBS could co-exist with mitigating techniques. The FCC decided to auction the frequencies instead of granting licenses to Northpoint and other companies for MVDDS. The auction for the 12.2-12.7 GHz band raised $118.7 million in January 2004. Legislation proposed to eliminate the auction requirement for fixed terrestrial services like MVDDS. The FCC decided to auction the frequencies instead of granting licenses to Northpoint and other companies for MVDDS."
