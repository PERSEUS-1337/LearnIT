    "content": "Residential energy efficiency can benefit consumers through reduced utility bills and support national environmental policy objectives by reducing the demand for electricity generated using fossil fuels. Various policies have been adopted since the 1970s to increase conservation and energy efficiency, including tax incentives. The federal government is still deciding on the best policy tools to meet energy-efficiency objectives. In 2016, one-fifth of total energy consumed in the US was by the residential sector, which has gradually increased over time. In recent years, residential energy consumption has slightly decreased on a per capita and aggregate basis. Per capita energy use remained constant until the mid-2000s when it started to decline. Despite efficiency gains, there is still potential for increased energy efficiency in the residential sector. Concerns exist that consumers may not invest in optimal energy efficiency levels. Increasing energy efficiency could change residential energy use trends, leading to reduced energy use per capita over time. This report explores promoting residential energy efficiency through tax credits, addressing market failures and barriers to optimal investment in energy-efficient technologies. Tax incentives correct market failures and barriers in residential energy efficiency. Taxpayers can claim credits for energy-efficient improvements and high-efficiency appliances for their primary residence. The Section 25C credit for residential energy efficiency allows taxpayers to claim a tax credit of up to $500 for building envelope improvements and energy-efficient property. The credit expired at the end of 2017. Another credit, the residential energy efficient property tax credit (IRC \u00a725D), also provides tax incentives for high-efficiency appliances. The energy efficient property tax credit (IRC \u00a725D) allows taxpayers to claim a tax credit for renewable energy technologies installed on their residence. The credit rate is 30% for 2017, decreasing to 26% in 2020 and 22% in 2021, with the credit expiring after 2021. The maximum value of the credit is not capped. For more information, refer to Appendices A and B. A rational consumer would invest in energy-efficient technology if the savings outweigh the cost. However, some consumers do not make these investments, known as the \"energy-efficiency paradox.\" Various economic theories and market failures may explain why consumers do not invest in optimal residential energy efficiency. Market failures and barriers, such as externalities and informational issues, can hinder optimal investments in residential energy efficiency. These factors may limit the impact of tax credits like Section 25C and Section 25D in promoting energy efficiency. Energy consumption externalities contribute to underallocation of resources for energy-efficient investments. Residential electricity consumption may have negative environmental externalities, such as pollution costs, due to market failures. Lower electricity prices lead to overconsumption and underinvestment in energy efficiency. Adoption of energy-efficient technologies can have positive externalities through knowledge spillover effects. The adoption of emerging technologies has knowledge spillover effects, benefiting society as a whole. Market failures, such as the principal-agent problem, can lead to underinvestment in energy efficiency. Investments in energy efficiency may be hindered by various factors such as lack of belief in cost recovery upon property sale, decision-making by landlords and builders without considering end user energy use patterns, capital market imperfections leading to underinvestment, high initial costs deterring purchasers without upfront funds, credit constraints for low-income households, and lack of consumer information on energy-saving technologies. Various government policies, including tax incentives, can be used to enhance markets in the face of barriers to energy-saving technology investments. Other options like grants, rebates, or credit enhancements may also be considered. The government may address energy market failures through regulations. The government can address energy market failures through regulations or mandates and support energy efficiency investments through programs like Energy Star. Tax credits such as Section 25C and Section 25D can lower the cost of energy-efficient investments, while incentives like the energy-efficient appliance manufacturer credit reduce production costs. These measures encourage additional investment in energy-saving technologies. Tax credits can address positive externalities from energy-efficiency technologies by encouraging investment and increasing awareness. However, if markets underinvest due to low electricity prices, tax credits may not be the most efficient policy option. Allowing electricity prices to reflect costs by removing federal financial support or taxing electricity production could be more effective. Increasing electricity prices to reflect full costs can encourage investment in energy-efficiency technologies. Current tax incentives for residential energy efficiency do not address the principal-agent problem, as they are not available to renters or landlords investing in rental properties. Other tax incentives, such as the tax credit for energy-efficient new homes, more directly promote residential energy efficiency. Tax credits like the tax credit for energy-efficient new homes address principal-agent problems in the market for new homes by reducing the cost of investment in energy-efficient technologies. However, tax credits may not be the most effective policy option for providing immediate savings to credit-constrained consumers. Policies that subsidize efficiency, like tax credits, can increase the adoption of energy-efficient technologies and improve societal welfare. Recent research suggests that tax credits for energy-efficient investments may not be beneficial for well-informed consumers, as they may not need the incentive and instead receive a windfall gain. Tax credits are most effective when targeting consumers with the largest energy inefficiencies. However, these credits may not address all market failures and may not increase the usage of energy-efficient technologies to optimal levels. The analysis focuses on Section 25C and Section for residential energy-efficient property investments in existing homes. The economic analysis of Section 25C and Section 25D tax credits for residential energy efficiency focuses on their effectiveness in increasing investment, fairness, and administrative issues. Tax incentives aim to influence taxpayer behavior, but it is unclear how effective these credits are in stimulating additional investment. They tend to benefit higher-income taxpayers and face administrative challenges according to the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA). The goal of residential energy-efficiency tax credits is to encourage individuals to increase investments. Tax credits should lead to additional energy-efficiency investment, not just reward consumers for investments they would have made anyway. Concerns about the effectiveness of these credits were raised in the 1970s. In 1979, concerns were raised about the effectiveness of residential energy tax credits, with Representative Bill Frenzel expressing doubts about their ability to incentivize investment. He noted that the tax credits did not seem to provide a significant incentive in the marketplace and were not motivating economic action as intended. The effectiveness of residential energy tax credits in incentivizing investment is questioned. Empirical evidence on their impact is mixed, with some researchers suggesting they may lead to additional investment while others believe they result in windfall gains. Policymakers need to consider whether tax credits truly encourage enhanced residential energy-efficiency investment. The effectiveness of residential energy tax credits in incentivizing investment is questioned. Tax credits may not provide a current financial incentive for some taxpayers due to lack of federal income tax liability. Additionally, savings from tax credits are delayed until tax returns are filed, reducing their incentive power. Tax incentives for residential energy efficiency mainly benefit higher-income taxpayers with tax liability, motivating them to invest in energy-efficient equipment. Tax credits can encourage the purchase of high-efficiency units, especially for those already in the market for energy property. Tax credits for residential energy efficiency target homeowners, who are typically higher-income taxpayers. In 2015, over three-quarters of residential energy tax credits were claimed by individuals with an adjusted gross income above $50,000. In 2015, tax credits for residential energy efficiency were mainly claimed by individuals with adjusted gross incomes above $50,000, who also claimed the majority of the total value of these credits. Tax units with incomes below $50,000 made up a significant portion of all tax units but claimed a smaller percentage of residential energy tax credits. As income levels increase, the average amount of residential credit claimed also rises, with the highest income tax units receiving credits approximately seven times higher than the lowest income tax units. The nonrefundability feature of certain tax credits may limit who can claim these benefits. Taxpayers with low tax liability in the current year may not fully benefit from the Section 25C tax credit, which cannot be carried forward. Those who eliminate their tax liability through other incentives may miss out on residential energy-efficiency tax credits, mainly claimed by higher-income individuals. This limitation may hinder the goal of motivating energy-efficiency investments through tax credits. Tax credits can encourage investment if households are credit constrained, but if only available to higher-income households, they may not be effective. An ideal tax code should be simple for taxpayers to comply with and for the government to administer. Taxpayers are more likely to claim benefits with low compliance costs. However, there may be a trade-off between easy reporting requirements and overall taxpayer compliance. The Treasury Department's Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) report highlighted opportunities for fraud in residential energy tax credits. The IRS was unable to verify if claimants made qualifying energy modifications to their homes or if the expenses were for their residence due to lack of required information and third-party verification. IRS Form 5695 did not request necessary details prior to the 2011 tax form. The IRS Form 5695 did not initially request information to confirm eligibility for residential energy tax credits, leading to potential fraud opportunities. TIGTA found that 30% of sampled taxpayers claiming the credits may not have been homeowners. Subsequent updates to the form required additional details about the taxpayer's home. In a recent report, TIGTA discovered cases where eligible taxpayers were wrongly denied credits, resulting in a loss of $1.5 million. The 25C credit is capped at $500, while the 25D credit has no limit but cannot exceed the taxpayer's tax liability. The $500 limit for the 25C credit was mistakenly applied to the 25D credit, causing some taxpayers to be improperly denied the full credit amount. Congress has the option to let these temporary tax credits expire as scheduled, with potential alternatives being modifying the credits or implementing a grant program for residential energy efficiency incentives. The residential energy-efficiency tax incentives, including the $500-per-taxpayer cap, may not provide significant incentives for homeowners who have already claimed credits. Policymakers have the option to extend, expand, or modify these incentives to encourage further investment. The residential energy-efficiency tax credits under Section 25C can be expanded in various ways to provide additional incentives for taxpayers. This includes using a more generous formula, expanding eligible technologies, and removing caps. The value of these credits grew significantly after expansions in 2009. Policymakers have the option to scale back these provisions by reinstating caps or reducing them. The residential energy-efficiency tax credits under Section 25C can be expanded by removing caps or reducing them, which may increase confusion among taxpayers. Policymakers could phase out these credits for upper-income taxpayers and consider replacing them with a rebate program or direct cash payments for eligible purchases. A rebate program called Home Star was proposed in 2010 to help consumers purchase energy-efficient or renewable-energy-generating technologies. The program aimed to provide financial benefits to those with limited funds or little tax liability. The legislation passed the House but was not considered by the Senate. The appendix provides technical standards for property to qualify for energy-efficiency tax credits in IRC Section 25C and Section 25D. Residential energy tax incentives were first introduced in the late 1970s and expired in the mid-1980s. Present-day incentives, introduced in 2005, are similar to those from the late 1970s and early 1980s. The Energy Tax Act of 1978 introduced the first tax credit for conservation and renewable-energy generation, with two components: 15% of the first $2,000 of energy-conservation expenditures and 30% of the first $2,000 in qualified expenditures for solar, wind, and geothermal energy. In 1980, the Crude Oil Windfall Profit Tax Act increased the federal tax credit for renewable energy generation to 40% of the first $10,000 in expenditures, with a maximum value of $4,000. This credit expired in 1985 and was not reinstated until 2005 with the Energy Policy Act, which introduced new temporary tax credits for residential energy efficiency and renewable-energy property. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT05; P.L. 109-58) introduced two temporary tax credits for homeowners who made energy-efficiency improvements to their homes in 2006 and 2007. The nonbusiness energy property credit (IRC \u00a725C) allowed taxpayers to receive a nonrefundable tax credit of 10% of qualified expenditures, with specific limits for different types of property. For example, the credit limits were $50 per year for advanced main air circulating fans, $250 per year for qualified furnaces or hot water boilers, and $300 for heat pumps, air conditioners, and water heaters meeting efficiency standards. The maximum credit for windows was $200, with a lifetime cap of $500 for 2006 and 2007. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT05) introduced two temporary tax credits for homeowners in 2006 and 2007. The nonbusiness energy property credit (IRC \u00a725C) allowed a nonrefundable tax credit of 10% of qualified expenditures with specific limits for different types of property. The maximum credit for windows was $200, with a lifetime cap of $500. Another credit, the residential energy-efficient property credit (IRC \u00a725D), was 30% of expenditures on qualified photovoltaic properties, solar water-heating properties, and fuel-cell generators, with annual limits. The credit for photovoltaic and solar water-heating properties could not exceed $2,000 per year, while the credit for fuel cells could not exceed $500 per year. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 introduced tax credits for homeowners in 2006 and 2007. Section 25C provided a 10% credit for qualified expenditures, while Section 25D offered a 30% credit for photovoltaic, solar water-heating, and fuel-cell properties. In 2008, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act reinstated and modified the credits, expanding the list of qualified energy property. Geothermal heat pumps were added to Section 25D, while biomass fuel stoves were eligible for a $300 credit under Section 25C. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act extended the Section 25D tax credit for eight years, through 2016, and expanded it to include small wind-energy and geothermal heat pump properties. The credit for small wind energy was 30% of expenditures up to $4,000 annually, while the geothermal heat pump credit was 30% of expenditures up to $2,000 annually. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 extended and modified tax credits for energy-efficient improvements and energy property. The credit was equal to 30% of qualified expenditures, with an increased cap of $1,500 for 2009 and 2010. The technology-specific credit amounts were eliminated, and the aggregate credit cap was lifted. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 extended and modified tax credits for energy-efficient improvements and energy property. The removal of the aggregate cap for windows allowed taxpayers to claim up to $1,500 in tax credits for qualified windows in 2009 and 2010. ARRA also expanded the availability of the credit to additional products by reducing efficiency standards. Changes to the Section 25D tax credit removed maximum credit caps for every type of technology except fuel cells, effective from 2009 through 2016. The number and total dollar amount of credits being claimed increased under ARRA, with higher average credit amounts compared to 2006 and 2007. The 2010 Tax Act extended the Section 25C credit for one year, but with reinstated lifetime limits. Taxpayers who had already claimed the maximum credits in previous years were ineligible for the credit in 2011. The American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA) extended the Section 25C credit for 2012 and 2013, while the Tax Increase Prevention Act (TIPA) extended it for 2014. The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act (PATH) further extended and modified the credit for 2015 and 2016. The PATH Act modified Energy Star requirements for windows and doors to meet more stringent standards starting in 2016. The 25D credit for solar technologies was extended through 2021, with a 30% credit for qualifying solar technologies from 2017 to 2019. In 2020 and 2021, the 25D credit for solar technologies will be reduced to 26% and 22% of qualifying expenditures, respectively. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 extended the 25D credit for nonsolar technologies through 2021, with credit rates for fuel cell plants, small wind energy property, and geothermal heat pump property matching those for solar technologies. The 25D credit for solar technologies will be reduced to 22% in 2021, matching the credit rates for other technologies."
