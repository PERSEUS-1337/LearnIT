    "content": "Regulation is a fundamental government function, with federal agencies issuing thousands of rules annually on various topics. The costs of complying with these regulations are not included in the federal budget process. Some policymakers are interested in measuring total regulatory costs and benefits, as seen in the Congressional Office of Regulatory Analysis Creation and Sunset and Review Act of 2011. This act would require an annual report estimating the total costs and benefits of all existing federal regulations. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) prepares a report each year on the costs and benefits of federal rules, but measuring total regulatory costs and benefits is challenging. Researchers must establish a baseline for measurement and aggregating results from studies with different methodologies is problematic. Some doubt the accuracy of measuring total regulatory costs and benefits. In 2010, the Small Business Administration released a report stating that the annual cost of federal regulations in 2008 was about $1.75 trillion. The Small Business Administration released a report in 2010 estimating the annual cost of federal regulations in 2008 to be around $1.75 trillion. This estimate has been widely cited as evidence for the need for regulatory reform legislation and oversight actions, although some critics argue that it overstates the total cost of federal regulations. Crain and Crain developed the $1.75 trillion estimate of federal regulatory costs in 2008 by combining cost estimates for economic regulations, environmental regulations, tax compliance, and regulations for occupational safety and health, and homeland security. Economic regulations accounted for over 70% of the total regulatory costs. The impact of economic regulations on businesses includes restrictions on imports, production, employment, and pricing. Crain and Crain used a regulatory quality index to estimate the cost of regulations, measuring governments' ability to promote private sector development. In 2008, the WGI regulatory quality index score for the United States was +1.579, representing minimal regulation. Crain and Crain used regression analysis to determine the impact of changes in the regulatory quality index on real GDP per capita, finding a 9.4% change for a one-unit increase in the index. In 2008, the regulatory quality index for the United States was +1.579, indicating minimal regulation. Crain and Crain found that a 0.921 difference from the maximum of +2.5 led to an 8.7% reduction in GDP due to economic regulations. This amounted to a decrease of about $1.236 trillion in real GDP per capita. The WGI index for regulatory quality in 2008 was determined by aggregating expert-based measures and surveys scored on a 0 to 1 scale. The Economist Intelligence Unit scored at 0.70, based on experts' judgment of 16 factors including protectionism, access to capital markets, and labor regulations. Global Insight Business Conditions and Risk Indicators scored at 0.94, based on tax effectiveness and legislation assessment. Global Insight Global Risk Service also provided a score. Global Risk Service, a commercial business information provider based in Boston, Massachusetts, scored 0.95 based on factors like export and import regulations. The Heritage Foundation Index of Economic Freedom, scored at 0.73, focuses on foreign investment and banking/finance. The Institutional Profiles Database, provided by the French government's Ministry of the Economy, scored 0.89. The regulatory quality index is determined by various factors such as ease of starting a business, competition, and investment profile. Different surveys like the Political Risk Services International Country Risk Guide and the Institute for Management and Development World Competitiveness Yearbook contribute to this index. The Institute for Management Development, based in Switzerland, conducts surveys on business factors. The World Economic Forum also conducts surveys on factors like administrative regulations and tax systems. Some observers question the accuracy of WGI indices measuring regulatory quality. Crain and Crain referenced a World Bank report on the development of WGI indices and their correlation with OECD's economic regulations index. They chose WGI regulatory quality index for their study due to its broader coverage over a longer period. The World Bank's WGI authors caution that indices like the regulatory quality index are useful for broad comparisons but may not be precise enough for specific governance reforms. Crain and Crain's estimate of economic regulation costs depends on the validity of the WGI index. The WGI index of \"regulatory quality\" is used to measure the cost of economic regulations. Aart Kraay from the World Bank raised concerns about how Crain and Crain interpreted the index, stating that higher values do not necessarily mean less stringent regulations. The Regulatory Quality (RQ) index measures perceptions of the regulatory environment's overall quality, not just stringency. The United States ranks high globally, with countries like Finland and Sweden ahead. The WGI indicators have margins of error, so rankings are imprecise. Kraay noted a misinterpretation of the WGI units by comparing scores incorrectly. The United States' Regulatory Quality (RQ) score of +1.579 was compared to +2.5, referred to as \"the minimal amount of regulation.\" Kraay suggested comparing the US score with countries like Singapore and Denmark for a more relevant comparison. The United States' Regulatory Quality (RQ) score of +1.579 was compared to Denmark. Kraay suggested comparing the US score with countries like Singapore and Denmark for a more relevant comparison. Kraay explained the difference between the regulatory quality index values cited by Crain and Crain and the actual values. Ireland had the highest regulatory quality index in 2008 with a value of +1.915, resulting in a difference of 0.336 when compared to the US. Crain and Crain used regression analysis to determine that a 0.336 difference in regulatory quality index between Ireland and the United States suggests a 3.16% reduction in GDP. This would amount to about $448 billion, less than their original calculation of $1.236 trillion. Kraay raised concerns about the quality of their analysis and noted that higher scores on the index do not necessarily mean less stringent regulations. Crain and Crain's regression analysis shows that high scores on regulatory quality are correlated with other good policies and institutions affecting GDP per capita. They acknowledge the challenge of isolating the impact of regulation from other factors. Despite concerns raised by Kraay about the index's ability to reflect changes in regulation stringency, Crain and Crain argue that empirical evidence supports its effectiveness in practice. The index captures regulation extent from stakeholders' perceptions. Crain and Crain did not compare the US to another country due to the need to estimate total regulation costs. They selected +2.5 as the best approximation of the regulatory environment. Before publishing the Crain and Crain report, the SBA Office of Advocacy had the study peer reviewed by two economists\u2014Bob Litan of the Kauffman Foundation, and Richard Williams of the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. Litan found the study \"terrific\" with nothing to add, while Williams had more extensive comments, expressing concerns about the index of regulatory quality potentially overstating the costs of regulation. In February 2011, the Center for Progressive Reform criticized the Crain and Crain study, requesting SBA's Office of Advocacy to withdraw its sponsorship. Williams expressed concerns about the Regulatory Quality Index potentially overestimating costs and suggested better explanation or controlling for other regulations' effects on GDP to avoid overestimation. The Center for Progressive Reform criticized the SBA's Office of Advocacy for sponsoring a report that overestimated economic regulatory costs. CPR raised concerns about the lack of clarity in defining \"economic regulations,\" the simplistic relationship assumed between regulatory stringency and GDP, and the misleading impression of low regulatory quality in the United States. The Crain and Crain report analyzed data for 25 OECD countries to assess the impact of economic regulation on GDP per capita. Economists believe that a country's standard of living is influenced by various factors such as natural resources, labor, technology, and trade opportunities. Government interventions like taxes and regulations can also impact the standard of living. Crain and Crain used linear regression analysis to study the relationship between GDP per capita and regulatory quality index, considering factors like population, foreign trade, education, and broadband. The Crain and Crain report analyzed the relationship between GDP per capita and control variables like regulatory quality index, population, foreign trade, education, and broadband. The selection and impact of these control variables were not fully discussed, and their estimation strategy was considered non-standard. The Crain and Crain report used country-specific and year-specific control variables in their analysis. Year-specific control variables that were statistically insignificant were omitted from the reported results. The two-stage estimation strategy used by the authors has not been explored in peer-reviewed journals. CRS requested the data used in the study from Crain and Crain, but it was not provided. CRS conducted a similar regression analysis, which showed that the regulatory quality index had no discernable impact. The regulatory quality index had no independent effect on GDP per capita, suggesting sensitivity to control variables. Economic regulation's impact on standard of living may be subtle and evolve slowly, interacting with other public policy instruments. More focused empirical tools may be needed to understand the relationship between regulatory quality and economic well-being. Crain and Crain estimated the cost of environmental regulations by following OMB's approach, using estimates from OMB reports converted to 2009 dollars. They concluded that environmental regulations cost between $175 billion and $280 billion. The authors used a $280 billion estimate to calculate the cumulative cost of environmental regulations in 2009. They justified this by stating that cost estimates were lacking for important regulations and government agencies tend to underestimate regulatory costs. Crain and Crain utilized a mix of academic and agency estimates to determine the costs of environmental rules issued before 1988 and major rules issued from 1999 to 2008. The unit of analysis varied across different time periods. The analysis of regulatory costs varies by year and methodology, with OMB stating that combining individual studies to summarize total costs is flawed due to varying quality and assumptions. There is a concern about double counting in cost estimates, as some estimates overlap in time periods. The authors of the analysis incorrectly recorded OMB's estimates for environmental regulatory costs in certain periods. They also failed to report OMB's estimates of the benefits of environmental regulations. The authors of the analysis incorrectly recorded OMB's estimates for environmental regulatory costs in certain periods. They also failed to report OMB's estimates of the benefits of environmental regulations. The estimated benefits of environmental rules from OMB's reports were higher than the estimated costs in most time periods. Williams's only comment on the estimate of environmental regulatory costs was that it should be noted as an assumption. Crain and Crain used OMB's upper estimate of environmental costs, believing that cost estimates were missing for some important regulations. They mentioned that government agencies tend to be conservative in estimating regulatory costs. The Center for Progressive Reform analyzed the Crain and Crain report, noting that agencies' estimates are subject to considerable debate. The Center for Progressive Reform criticized agencies' environmental cost estimates as being too high and influenced by industry, which has an incentive to overstate costs. They also questioned the use of outdated studies by Crain and Crain to estimate regulatory costs. OMB noted that agency estimates may understate costs and overstate benefits due to agency self-interest in regulation. However, there is little documentation to support this theory, as regulated entities may overstate costs to avoid regulations, and competitive firms often find cost-effective ways to comply with regulations using new technologies. Some commenters believe that agencies tend to overestimate the benefits of their programs, as technological progress has reduced the long-term expected benefits of regulations. Crain and Crain estimated that businesses, individuals, and nonprofits spent about 4.3 billion burden hours on tax paperwork in 2008. In 2008, businesses, individuals, and nonprofits spent about 4.3 billion burden hours on tax paperwork, costing approximately $159.6 billion. The government-wide paperwork burden in FY2008 was about 9.71 billion burden hours. In FY2008, the government-wide paperwork burden was about 9.71 billion hours, with the Department of the Treasury accounting for 7.78 billion hours. The IRS represented about 77.8% of the government-wide estimate and 99.5% of the Treasury estimate. If the same ratios applied in 2008, IRS paperwork would have been about 7.5 billion hours, 3.2 billion hours higher than previously reported. Certain aspects of how IRS burden hours were monetized in a report by Crain and Crain are unclear. According to Bureau of Labor Statistics data, tax preparers earn an average of $17.34 per hour. Even with additional compensation factored in, their average hourly cost would be around $23. Multiplying this by 7.5 billion burden hours results in a total cost of approximately $172.5 billion, higher than previous estimates. The inclusion of tax paperwork in regulatory cost estimates is a debated issue. The debate revolves around whether tax paperwork should be considered in regulatory cost estimates. OMB excludes tax paperwork from its reports to Congress, stating that filling out tax forms is a result of the tax code itself. John D. Graham from OIRA highlighted that IRS paperwork burden is driven by the complexities of the Tax Code, making taxpayer compliance challenging. The Tax Code is complex and subject to continuous revision, with Congress passing numerous tax laws that increase taxpayer burden. IRS had to make changes to 1040 schedules due to statutory revisions, adding 47 million hours to taxpayer burden. Factors like economic and population growth also contribute to increased IRS burden hours. The final category of regulatory costs focused on workplace regulations related to safety and health, primarily from OSHA and homeland security. Costs were estimated using data from various studies, including a 2005 study by Joseph M. Johnson and OMB's 2009 report on regulatory costs and benefits. Total costs included occupational safety and health regulations prior to 2001, 2001-2008 occupational safety and health regulatory costs, and homeland security costs through 2008. The authors estimated the total cost for occupational safety and health and homeland security regulations in 2008 to be about $75.2 billion, with occupational safety and health regulatory costs between 2001 and 2008 estimated at $10.4 billion in 2009 dollars. The estimate was obtained from OMB's 2009 report to Congress, which included costs associated with four rules from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. There may be a potential issue of double counting with estimates provided in previous studies. The authors estimated the total cost for homeland security regulations in 2008 to be about $75.2 billion. They obtained their estimate from OMB's 2009 report, which stated that agencies had finalized 17 major homeland security regulations with a total annual cost between $4.2 billion to $8.6 billion. Converting these costs to 2009 dollars yields a range of $5.1 billion to $10.4 billion. Crain and Crain used the upper-end of OMB's estimated cost range for these regulations. The authors used OMB's upper-end cost estimates for environmental rules, believing agencies tend to be conservative in estimating costs. However, OMB stated little evidence of agencies being too conservative. The Center for Progressive Reform criticized the authors for overestimating occupational safety and health costs, stating that the estimates likely inflate true compliance costs. In 2005, W. Mark Crain estimated total federal regulatory costs in 2004 at about $1.11 trillion. In 2010, Crain and Crain estimated those costs in 2008 at about $1.75 trillion\u2014an increase of about $639 billion (57.4%) in four years. The main reason for the increase was a change in the methodology used in developing their estimate of the cost of economic regulations. The cost estimate for economic regulations increased, leading to a total estimated cost increase of $6 billion between 2004 and 2008. Congress has required OMB to submit annual reports on the costs and benefits of federal regulations for nearly 15 years. In 2001, the Regulatory Right-to-Know Act mandated OMB to report on regulatory costs and benefits in the President's budget, including total costs and benefits of federal rules and paperwork. The report must analyze impacts on state, local, and tribal governments, small businesses, wages, and economic growth. In its 1997 report, OMB estimated total federal regulatory costs in 1997 at $279 billion, and estimated the benefits of federal regulations at $298 billion. In its 1998 report, OMB estimated federal regulatory costs at between $170 billion and $230 billion, and estimated regulatory benefits at between $260 billion and $3.5 trillion, largely due to the inclusion of an EPA estimate of the benefits associated with the Clean Air Act. The cost of social regulations in 1996 was estimated between $146 billion and $229 billion, with benefits estimated between $254 billion and nearly $1.8 trillion. The drop in upper-bound benefits was mainly due to a decrease in the EPA's estimate for the Clean Air Act benefits. OMB highlighted the challenges in accurately estimating total costs and benefits of federal regulations, citing methodological issues. The OMB pointed out methodological problems in estimating costs and benefits of federal regulations. Issues included unclear baselines for measurement, difficulty in attributing costs or benefits, and challenges in aggregating results from different studies. Technological change can also make previous estimates inaccurate. The OMB highlighted challenges in estimating costs and benefits of federal regulations, including issues with unclear baselines, attributing costs or benefits, and aggregating results from different studies. OMB excluded certain rules from total regulatory costs, such as \"transfer\" regulations and costs associated with filling out tax paperwork. OMB's \"Regulatory Right-to-Know Act\" reports since 2001 have not included cost or benefit estimates for all rules, focusing instead on regulations with costs or benefits of at least $100 million annually. The 2002 report estimated total costs of $50-53 billion and benefits of $48-101 billion for rules reviewed from 1995 to 2001. The 2003 report provided estimates for 107 regulations reviewed over a 10-year period. OMB estimated the total costs of 107 regulations reviewed from 1992 to 2002 to be between $37 billion and $43 billion, with benefits ranging from $146 billion to $230 billion. EPA rules accounted for a significant portion of the benefits. OMB decided to focus on rules from a limited time frame due to outdated studies affecting cost and benefit estimates. OMB decided not to reproduce aggregate estimates in a draft report, citing outdated estimates for rules adopted prior to a 10-year period. Former OIRA administrator John D. Graham emphasized the inaccuracy of past attempts to estimate aggregate costs of regulations. The Crain and Hopkins estimate from 2001, based on earlier estimates dating back to the 1970s, is considered a rough indicator of regulatory activity's impact on the macro economy. However, due to changes over the years, these estimates may no longer be accurate or suitable for official accounting statements. The cost estimates for regulations combine various types, some with real costs and others with income transfers. Information by agency and program is limited, and benefit information is lacking. Many studies used for these estimates lack transparency for reproducibility. Recent reports to Congress focus on costs and benefits of major regulations from the past decade. Graham criticized the Paperwork and Regulatory Improvements Act of 2004, stating that requiring agencies to estimate the costs and benefits of rules was not feasible. OMB's 2009 report estimated the annual costs and benefits of 98 regulations, ranging from $51 billion to $60 billion in costs and with quantified benefits. The OMB estimated the costs and benefits of 98 regulations, ranging from nearly $51 billion to nearly $60 billion in costs, with benefits estimated between about $126 billion and about $663 billion in 2001 dollars. The estimates were not a complete accounting of all regulations issued during that period. The OMB estimated costs and benefits of regulations, but comparing with Crain and Crain's estimates is challenging due to different methodologies and presentation categories. Crain and Crain's estimates of annual regulatory costs in 2008 were much larger than OMB's, including costs of all rules and major rules. OMB's estimates only included major rules meeting specific criteria issued over a 10-year period. Crain and Crain's estimates of total federal regulatory costs in 2008 were $1.75 trillion, with over 70% based on the WGI index of regulatory quality for the United States. Decision makers should be aware of the conceptual and methodological underpinnings of studies on aggregate regulatory costs and benefits. The authors of the regulatory quality index disputed Crain and Crain's interpretation, stating that higher values on the index do not necessarily mean less stringent regulations. They suggested comparing the US index to a country with a preferable index, like Ireland, which would significantly reduce the estimated cost of economic regulations. Other commenters also raised concerns about using the regulatory quality index to measure economic costs. Crain and Crain defended their use of the regulatory quality index to measure economic regulations, despite criticisms. They argued that the index reflects a country's regulatory stringency and compared the US index to a theoretical environment. The World Bank cautions that such measures may not be precise for specific governance reforms. Crain and Crain's cost estimates for various regulations were based on a mix of old academic studies. OMB criticized the approach of mixing old academic studies and outdated regulatory cost estimates to calculate regulatory costs. Crain and Crain used only the highest cost estimates from OMB reports, arguing that government agencies tend to underestimate costs. However, OMB disputed this claim, stating there is little evidence to support it. OMB has concluded that estimates of the costs and benefits of regulations issued more than 10 years earlier are of \"questionable relevance.\" Since 2003, OMB's annual reports to Congress have only included information on major rules issued during the previous 10 years, as older estimates are deemed unreliable for informing policy decisions. Incremental costs of regulations tend to decrease over time as business practices and consumer expectations evolve. Consumers now demand safer cars and companies prioritize product liability. Environmentally responsible behavior is becoming more profitable. Over time, the true costs and benefits of regulations decrease due to changing practices and consumer expectations. Older estimates of regulation costs may overestimate current impacts. OMB stated that only half of compliance costs for regulations over ten years old would likely be saved if they disappeared overnight. Crain and Crain's estimate for tax paperwork costs may be higher than OMB's data suggests, with assumptions on hourly costs potentially inflated. The categorization of tax paperwork as regulatory costs is questioned by OMB. Crain and Crain did not include regulatory benefits in their study as they were focused on updating a previous study that only looked at costs, not benefits. This decision was in line with the requirements set by the SBA Office of Advocacy. The task for this iteration was to update a previous study on costs and disproportionality between small and large businesses. Executive Order 12866 requires agencies to assess costs and benefits of regulations, aiming to maximize net benefits. OMB reports to Congress show that estimated benefits generally exceed costs. For example, the 2010 report estimated aggregate costs between $43 billion and $55 billion for major rules reviewed from 1999 to 2009. In FY2009, costs for major rules ranged from $3.7 billion to $9.5 billion, with benefits between $8.6 billion and $28.9 billion. In FY2010, costs ranged from $6.5 billion to $12.5 billion, with benefits between $23.3 billion and $82.3 billion. The aggregate costs for rules reviewed from 2000 to 2010 were estimated between $44 billion and $62 billion, with benefits between $136 billion and $651 billion. The benefits of federal regulations were estimated at $23.3 billion to $82.3 billion annually. However, agencies often only quantified or monetized costs, not both. Crain and Crain's report on regulatory costs in 2008, totaling $1.75 trillion, has been used to advocate for regulatory reform. They caution against using their report as a decision-making tool for lawmakers or regulatory agencies. The curr_chunk discusses how information on both costs and benefits is essential for policymakers to make valid policy decisions regarding federal regulations. It mentions that a valid policy decision can only be made after considering both costs and benefits, and highlights the importance of assessing the sensitivity of results. To assess the sensitivity of Crain and Crain's results, CRS conducted a linear regression using similar data and methods for 30 OECD countries from 2002-2008. They used GDP per capita, regulatory quality index, broadband penetration rates, country population, and foreign trade as variables. The unexpected negative coefficient for primary school enrollment in Crain and Crain's analysis was noted. The negative coefficient for primary school enrollment in the analysis by Crain and Crain was attributed to \"aging pyramid\" demographic effects. To address this, CRS added variables for the proportion of the population under 14 and over 65. These demographic measures were calculated from U.S. Census Bureau data and may capture aging effects more directly. CRS used a cross-country fixed effects panel estimator with year indicator variables and ran estimation results using Stata 11 xtreg procedure with robust standard errors. The estimation results in Table A-1 show that the coefficient on the World Governance Indicators regulatory quality index is very small and not significantly different from zero. The estimated economic effect of shifting the US regulatory quality index to Ireland's level in 2008 is an increase of $2.14 in per capita GDP. The effect of a hypothetical shift of U.S. regulatory quality to the Irish level is imprecise due to the uncertainty in the point estimate. The variance in the model results mainly from differences among countries rather than time-series variation within countries, making it challenging to estimate the effects of variables that change slowly over time. Other econometric approaches focusing on specific changes in the regulatory environment may provide a better understanding of the impact of regulation on economic activity."
