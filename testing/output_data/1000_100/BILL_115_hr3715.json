An environmental assessment for the response activity must be completed within 60 days, with a categorical exclusion option available. Categorical exclusion is available for National Scenic Area response activities under 10,000 acres, visible from key viewing areas, providing screening for development, part of a municipal watershed, or containing utility right-of-ways. No consultation under the Endangered Species Act if the response activity is not likely to harm listed species.

Expedited consultation must be concluded within 90 days if the activity is not covered by the exemption. The response activity for consultation not concluded within 90 days under the Endangered Species Act is deemed not in violation and can proceed.

The special fund established under the Knutson-Vandenberg Act will provide funding for response activities. The Secretary must reforest at least 75% of National Scenic Area lands impacted by a catastrophic event within two years."
