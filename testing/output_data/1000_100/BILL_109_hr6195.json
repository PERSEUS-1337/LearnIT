The National Science Foundation is recognized for its role in strengthening the nation's information infrastructure. Automation and digitization in various industries will rely on NSF-funded researchers for information processing. NSF's research and assistance are crucial for industry to leverage advanced technology. Information management is projected to grow significantly in key sectors by 2010. The National Science Foundation plays a vital role in enhancing the country's information infrastructure, supporting research in automation and digitization. There is a need for a systematic plan to design and implement information tools for the workforce to transition to the information age. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\nDirector - Refers to the Director of the National Science Foundation.\nInformation - Refers to data in sectors where the government is heavily involved and transitioning to digital data.\nInstitution of higher education - Defined as per section 101 of the Higher Education Act of 1965.\n\nSEC. 4. NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION RESEARCH. The Director, in consultation with other agencies, awards grants for research on improving information systems in areas like information studies, data security, and confidentiality. Grants are merit-reviewed and competitive, with authorized appropriations for fiscal years 2008-2010. The Director awards multiyear grants to institutions of higher education to establish Centers for Informatics Research. Grants are merit-reviewed and competitive, with specific funding allocated for fiscal years 2010 and 2011. The Centers for Informatics Research aim to conduct cutting-edge, multidisciplinary research in various areas. Institutions seeking funding must submit applications detailing research projects and promoting collaboration among professionals from different disciplines. The Center for Informatics Research aims to increase the number of information researchers and professionals by evaluating applications based on innovative approaches, research experience, and multidisciplinary capacity. The Center for Informatics Research evaluates applications based on innovative approaches, research experience, multidisciplinary collaborations, support for students, and partnerships with government or other entities. The Director convenes an annual meeting to foster collaboration among Centers. Authorization of appropriations is provided for the National Science Foundation to carry out these activities. The Center for Informatics Research receives funding as follows:\n(A) $4,500,000 for fiscal year 2008;\n(B) $4,600,000 for fiscal year 2009;\n(C) $4,700,000 for fiscal year 2010; and\n(D) $4,800,000 for fiscal year 2011. SEC. 5. NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION INFORMATION PROGRAMS. The Director, in consultation with other Federal agencies, will establish a program to award grants to institutions of higher education to improve undergraduate and master's degree information programs. Grants will be awarded on a competitive basis and used to enhance students' ability in information fields. Grants awarded to institutions of higher education will enhance information education programs by developing curriculum, establishing degree programs, creating research opportunities, and acquiring necessary equipment for student instruction. The curr_chunk discusses the implementation of various initiatives to enhance information education programs, such as installing testbed networks, providing faculty opportunities to collaborate with government agencies and industry, establishing student internships, and creating bridge programs between community colleges. The curr_chunk discusses the selection process for institutions of higher education seeking funding under a specific subsection. The application must include a description of the applicant's research and instructional capacity. The application must include a description of the role of each consortium member, a plan to build instructional capacity, collaborations with government or industry, and student enrollment and placement data. The Director will ensure grants are awarded in diverse geographic areas and institutions. Assessment of program success includes postgraduate outcomes and relevance to the workplace. The Director will evaluate the program established under this subsection within 3 years, assessing if grants have increased students pursuing degrees in information fields. Authorization of appropriations is specified for fiscal years 2008 to 2011. The Director will provide grants under the Scientific and Advanced Technology Act of 1992 to improve education in information fields. Authorization of appropriations is set for fiscal years 2008 to 2011, with increasing amounts allocated each year. SEC. 6. REPORT ON STANDARDIZATION OF MEASURES RELATED TO DIGITAL INFORMATION. The Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology must report to the House and Senate committees on its informatics efforts within 120 days of this Act. This includes standards harmonization, research, and technical support for standards development organizations. The report should outline timetables for information standards promulgation, challenges faced, and efforts to ensure digital information usability for scientists and researchers. The National Institute of Standards and Technology must report to Congress on actions to ensure robust and timely standards for scientists and researchers, as required by Public Law 104-113."
