    "content": "The 112th Congress used TPA authority to pass implementing bills for U.S. FTAs with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea in 2011. Other trade negotiations that may require TPA include the Doha Development Round, TPP, TTIP, and TISA. Congress has granted the President TPA/fast track authority for over 40 years. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) clarifies Congress's authority over trade policy and gives the President negotiating leverage. Earlier versions were bipartisan, but as trade negotiations became more complex, renewing TPA has become more controversial. The expiration of TPA raises questions about its renewal. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) is the result of decades of debate and cooperation between Congress and the executive branch. It reflects the constitutional powers of both branches and the need for flexibility in negotiating trade agreements. The partnership between Congress and the President on trade policy can be strengthened or strained based on political and economic conditions. Congress has the authority to regulate foreign trade, while TPA gives the President negotiating leverage. The Constitution assigns no specific responsibility for trade to the President, but grants exclusive authority to negotiate treaties and international agreements. Congress historically set tariff rates on imported products for the first 150 years of the United States, with tariffs being the main trade policy instrument and revenue source. Trade debates in Congress often pitted northern manufacturing regions against southern commodity exporting regions. In the 1930s, the President's role in trade policy was to negotiate treaties for MFN treatment. The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 drastically changed US trade policy by imposing high tariffs, leading to retaliatory tariffs and worsening the Great Depression. The Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934 (RTAA) authorized the President to enter into reciprocal trade agreements reducing tariffs within pre-approved levels, aiming to lessen political pressure from special interests faced by Congress. This act followed the damaging effects of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act in the 1930s, which worsened the Great Depression. The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act was the last general tariff legislation passed by Congress, now only applied to imports from Cuba and North Korea. Congress delegated tariff-cutting authority but retained broader trade authority, subjecting trade agreements to periodic review and renewal. Tariff levels declined, reducing their significance as trade barriers. The establishment of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1947 shifted trade negotiations from bilateral to multilateral, expanding beyond tariffs. The Trade Expansion Act of 1962 granted the President authority to negotiate tariff reductions and required congressional review of agreements. This allowed the conclusion of the GATT Kennedy Round (1963-1967) focusing on tariff reduction. During the GATT Kennedy Round, agreements were reached on nontariff barriers, including customs valuation and antidumping practices. Congress opposed these agreements as they required changes beyond tariff modifications, leading to a debate on presidential authority. During the Kennedy Round, Congress debated granting the President authority to negotiate trade agreements, leading to the creation of fast track authority in the Trade Act of 1974. The Trade Act of 1974 granted the President authority to enter trade agreements reducing tariffs. Implementing legislation for nontariff barrier agreements had to be passed by Congress. Concerns were raised about the impact of congressional debate and amendment procedures on trade negotiations. The Trade Act of 1974 allowed the President to negotiate trade agreements with limited congressional debate and amendment. Congress agreed to give trade agreements expedited treatment, with implementing bills subject to time-limited debate and no amendments. The Trade Act of 1974 allowed for expedited trade agreement negotiations with limited congressional debate and no amendments. Congress required the executive branch to consult with relevant committees and notify Congress before signing agreements. The Trade Act of 1974 also accredited 10 Members of Congress as advisers to the U.S. delegation of negotiators, expanding on the previous provision of five advisers in the Trade Act of 1962. This established the \"fast track trade negotiating authority\" which led to the conclusion of the Tokyo Round of the GATT (1973-1979) resulting in agreements on non-tariff barriers. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 established expedited legislative procedures for trade agreements authority, which have remained unchanged since 1974. These provisions, found in Sections 151-154 of the Trade Act of 1974, have no sunset provisions but are subject to time limits. Congress extended the presidential authority to proclaim tariff modifications until January 2, 1982, along with implementing the Tokyo Round agreements. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 extended presidential authority for trade agreements until January 2, 1988, focusing on reducing tariffs and addressing nontariff barriers. It added provisions for negotiating bilateral free trade agreements, including the U.S.-Israel and U.S.-Canada FTAs. The act waived the 90-day notification requirement for the U.S.-Israel FTA but mandated notification to Congress for negotiations with other countries. The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act (OTCA) extended the President's authority to enter into trade agreements before June 1, 1993, but only allowed expedited procedures for agreements entered into before June 1, 1991. Agreements leading to significant tariff changes required congressional approval through implementing legislation. The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act (OTCA) extended the President's authority to enter into trade agreements before June 1, 1993. Congress could withhold a trade agreement from fast track consideration by passing a resolution of disapproval. Implementing legislation for NAFTA was passed in 1993. Congress extended the authority and implementing procedures with H.R. 1876 in July 1993. In July 1993, the authority for trade agreements was extended until April 16, 1994, solely for the Uruguay Round. The law did not change any other aspects of the fast track authority. Congress did not approve new authority until the Trade Act of 2002. In 1997 and 1998, there were unsuccessful attempts to renew fast track authority. The bill for new trade agreements authority failed to pass (180-243) due to disagreements on negotiating objectives for labor and environmental issues. The WTO did not launch new negotiations in 1999, making renewal of trade agreements authority less of a priority. In 2001, President George W. Bush requested a renewal of fast track authority, renamed as \"trade promotion authority (TPA).\" The legislation renamed fast track authority to \"trade promotion authority (TPA)\" in the Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002. TPA included new language for labor and environmental provisions but did not mandate minimal enforceable labor standards in trade agreements, leading to opposition from labor groups and some Members of Congress. The act also established the Congressional Oversight Group for congressional consultation. The original House version of the BPTA (H.R. 3005) passed by one vote (215-214) along party lines. It was combined in the Senate with other trade-related acts and passed as the Trade Act of 2002. Under this act, Congress approved implementing legislation for various Free Trade Agreement countries. The proposed BCTPA was introduced in 2015 by Senators Hatch and Wyden (S. 995). The BCTPA legislation, introduced in 2015 by Senators Hatch and Wyden, was modeled on previous trade acts. It was reported by the Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee in April 2015. The legislation passed in May 2015 with updated negotiating objectives on trade in goods, services, agriculture, and intellectual property. The TPA-2015 legislation covers various trade aspects such as agriculture, intellectual property rights, regulatory practices, and digital trade. It includes provisions on labor, environment, currency manipulation, localization, state-owned enterprises, and human rights. TPA-2015 may be used for ongoing negotiations like TPP, T-TIP, and TISA. If not extended, TPA-2015 will expire on July 1, 2021. The European Union is involved in plurilateral trade negotiations for agreements like TISA and EGA to promote services and environmental goods trade. Through TPA/fast track, Congress aims to define trade policy priorities and ensure the executive branch adheres to them in trade agreements. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) aims to define trade policy priorities, ensure executive branch adherence in trade agreements, and reaffirm Congress's constitutional authority over trade. Initially, trade agreements were implemented through presidential proclamation for tariff reductions, but expanded negotiations led to tighter congressional control over agreements involving nontariff barriers. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) establishes fast track negotiating authority for trade agreements. TPA includes expedited procedures for passing trade implementing legislation through Congress, with specific conditions that must be met for a bill to qualify. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) establishes fast track negotiating authority for trade agreements, with specific conditions for passing implementing legislation through Congress. The bill must approve the agreement, contain necessary provisions, and give Congress control over approval and implementation. Congress grants the President authority to enforce the agreement after partner countries comply. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) grants the President authority to enforce trade agreements after partner countries comply with specific conditions outlined in the Trade Act of 2002. This includes notifying Congress prior to signing the agreement, providing a list of required changes to U.S. law, and transmitting the final legal text of the trade agreement to Congress for approval. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) grants the President authority to enforce trade agreements after partner countries comply with specific conditions outlined in the Trade Act of 2002. This includes notifying Congress prior to signing the agreement, providing a list of required changes to U.S. law, and transmitting the final legal text of the trade agreement, a draft implementing bill, a statement of administrative action proposed to implement the agreement, and supporting statements on how the agreement meets various congressional priorities and objectives, changes existing agreements, and serves the purpose of U.S. commercial interests. If Congress is satisfied with the requirements, certain expedited legislative procedures defined in Sections 151-154 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, must be followed. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) grants the President authority to enforce trade agreements after partner countries comply with specific conditions outlined in the Trade Act of 2002. This includes notifying Congress prior to signing the agreement, providing a list of required changes to U.S. law, and transmitting the final legal text of the trade agreement. Congress exercises its trade policy role by defining trade negotiation objectives in TPA legislation, emphasizing the importance of trade for U.S. foreign economic and security policy. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) grants the President authority to enforce trade agreements after partner countries comply with specific conditions outlined in the Trade Act of 2002. Congress defines trade negotiation objectives in TPA legislation, which are definitive statements of U.S. trade policy that the Administration is expected to honor for expedited consideration of trade agreement implementing legislation. These objectives are categorized into overall objectives, principal objectives, and other priorities, guiding trade negotiations towards goals like enhancing economies and reducing barriers. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) grants the President authority to enforce trade agreements after partner countries comply with specific conditions outlined in the Trade Act of 2002. Congress defines trade negotiation objectives in TPA legislation, which include reducing barriers to trade, protecting foreign investment, ensuring fair regulatory practices, combating corruption, and enforcing environmental and labor laws. The language of TPA objectives can be contentious and serve as a template for future trade agreements negotiated under these guidelines. The language of TPA objectives can be contentious and serve as a template for future trade agreements negotiated under these guidelines. The labor provisions, emphasized in all negotiating objectives, led to contentious debates over both TPA and FTAs that later adopted similar language. This issue was evident in the 2005 debate on the implementing bill for CAFTA-DR. Disputes over FTAs based on TPA objectives have survived challenges from opponents, ensuring the renewal of TPA/fast track authority. The vote on renewing TPA/fast track authority is crucial for trade agreements. The President must consult with Congress and notify them before negotiations begin. Congressional Advisory Groups play a role in advising trade negotiation delegations. Timing of notifications is outlined in the timeline. The President must conduct consultations and notifications with Congress before and after entering into trade agreements, including notifying Congress 90 days prior to entering an agreement and consulting with relevant committees. Special consultations are required on agriculture, import sensitive agricultural products, fishing, and textile industries tariffs. Additionally, notifications to the revenue committees must be made at least 180 days prior to any potential changes to U.S. trade remedy laws. The congressional consultation process is a key part of Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), requiring the President to notify and consult with Congress before and after entering into trade agreements. This includes providing details to the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC) at least 90 days before an agreement, presenting an impact report to Congress within 105 days, and releasing the agreement text 60 days prior to entering into it. This process reflects Congress's interest in influencing trade negotiations and ensuring oversight of trade policy. The effectiveness of the congressional consultation process for trade negotiations under Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) has been questioned. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that despite extensive consultations with Congress on Free Trade Agreements (FTAs), many congressional staff felt they were not given enough time to provide input, meetings were more like briefings than consultations, and last-minute changes to draft FTA texts were not always included. Staff expressed concerns about the consultation process. Staff concerns were raised about the consultation process for trade negotiations under Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), with worries that it did not allow for sufficient congressional input and last-minute changes to draft FTA texts. Congress adopted TPA procedures to prevent delays or obstruction of trade implementing bills and to protect fragile consensus between trade partners. However, Congress did not agree to surrender its constitutional authority over trade. Congress did not agree to surrender its constitutional authority over trade matters when crafting TPA. Each renewal of the trade agreements authority has provisions limiting expedited procedures, ensuring congressional oversight. TPA-2015 allows expedited procedures for agreements entered before July 1, 2021, with no deadline for submitting implementing legislation for agreements entered before the authority expires. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) legislation requires the President to request an extension of the TPA authority after a certain period of time. The extension is granted unless either House of Congress adopts a disapproval resolution, which must be reported out of the House Ways and Means or Senate Finance Committees. This process serves as a reminder to the executive branch that expedited legislative procedures are a congressional prerogative that can be denied if Congress is dissatisfied with the President's conduct of trade agreements. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) legislation allows Congress to deny expedited legislative procedures if dissatisfied with the President's conduct of trade agreement negotiations. Congress can influence agreements by requiring consultation and reporting obligations, and can withdraw TPA procedures through a joint \"procedural disapproval\" resolution if the President fails to meet these requirements. The new CCR procedure in TPA-2015 allows either chamber to withdraw TPA procedures for an implementing bill if there is a failure to notify or consult with Congress on a trade agreement. The Trade Act of 1974 allows Congress to enact expedited procedures for trade implementing bills, but also reserves the right to withdraw or override these procedures with a vote. Cooperation between the legislative and executive branches, as well as between political parties, is crucial for the success of TPA. Some have noted a lack of cooperation under previous TPA agreements, causing strain on the process. The lack of bipartisan cooperation under previous Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) agreements has strained the trade legislative process. Congress has integrated certain procedures, such as reviewing trade agreements before introducing implementing bills, into the approval process. The Ways and Means and Senate Finance Committees, along with other committees, conduct informal markup sessions to review draft trade agreement implementing bills. This process allows committee members to raise concerns, offer amendments, and signal changes they would like to see in the final legislation. The revenue committees may use a \"mock conference\" to reconcile differences in their markups for trade agreements. The Administration has discretion in accepting changes from Congress, as seen with the U.S.-Oman FTA implementing bill. The Oman FTA implementing bill passed, prompting a bipartisan call for better consultation before entering into trade agreements. Congress has at times requested additions or clarifications to trade agreements, resulting in side agreements or side letters. Side agreements involve additional obligations accepted by all parties after the original agreement, such as the environment and labor side agreements of NAFTA. Side letters clarify specific issues and are common in bilateral FTAs to address congressional concerns. Side letters are used to address congressional concerns in trade agreements, typically involving top trade representatives. They accompany the agreement but do not change its text, requiring official signatures from all parties. Enforceability is untested. Informal commitments from the executive branch have been relied upon by Congress to address issues. The Bush Administration made accommodations in the CAFTA-DR implementing bill to secure support. TPA expired in 2007. Good will between Congress and the executive branch is crucial for fulfilling special interests and concerns. TPA expired on July 1, 2007, and there have been criticisms of President Obama for delaying the request for its renewal. The President eventually requested TPA renewal in 2013 and reiterated the request in his 2015 State of the Union address. Congress may also consider revamping parts of the 2002 law related to TPA. Some argue that TPA may not be necessary if consensus can be built on passing a Free Trade Agreement (FTA). TPA, or Trade Promotion Authority, involves more than just expedited legislative procedures. It helps build consensus on trade policy, signals congressional support for FTAs, and ensures Congress's role in the trade policy agenda. The timing of TPA renewal is debated, with some suggesting waiting until FTA negotiations are near completion for a compelling rationale. The scope of U.S. trade negotiating objectives has evolved with the changing structure of trade, leading to the inclusion of new topics in TPA-2015 such as issues in \"21st century trade agreements\" like the treatment of state-owned enterprises. Congressional action on TPA renewal is debated, with some suggesting early consideration to allow input on critical negotiation matters before the end of negotiations. The treatment of negotiating objectives in trade agreements, including issues like state-owned enterprises, regulatory cooperation, and trade effects on SMEs, is a key concern for Congress. The controversial nature of TPA renewal was highlighted by dissatisfaction with the Trade Act of 2002, leading to a partisan vote. Approval of FTAs was withheld until a bipartisan agreement was reached in the \"May 10th Agreement\" in 2007, which included significant changes in labor policies. The \"May 10th Agreement\" in 2007 brought significant changes in labor, environment, and intellectual property rights commitments for trade agreements with Peru, Colombia, Panama, and South Korea. Some Democrats want to include these commitments in formal trade negotiating objectives, while some Republicans have reservations. TPA-2015 incorporates key provisions of the May 10th Understanding. TPA-2015 includes key provisions from the May 10th Understanding on labor and environmental provisions. Some Members of Congress are dissatisfied with the consultation process for trade negotiations, especially with the TPP. They want more influence in the negotiation process and access to draft texts of agreements. Congress may seek to clarify negotiation and consultation procedures in the future. Some Members of Congress argue they have limited access to draft text compared to business and NGOs. Members on trade committees stress the need to stay informed to influence trade agreements. Bipartisan interest exists in enforcing trade commitments. Efforts have been made to address trade enforcement, including the creation of the Interagency Trade Enforcement Center by President Obama. Congress may consider including language on trade agreement enforcement in TPA. Technical issues arose in the 112th Congress regarding TPA expedited procedures. In the 112th Congress, expedited procedures raised technical issues for Congress to reevaluate. Key issues include the interpretation of using TPA only for necessary or appropriate provisions in implementing bills and the time limitation on introducing FTA implementing bills. Members may debate defining the language more precisely or allowing flexibility in applying the standard. In the 112th Congress, expedited procedures raised technical issues for Congress to reevaluate, including the time delay in introducing FTA implementing bills and potential text changes in FTAs after negotiations. Congress may need to consider setting a time limit for bill introduction and addressing text change issues in TPA renewal. In the 112th Congress, expedited procedures raised technical issues for Congress to reevaluate, including time delays in introducing FTA implementing bills and potential text changes in FTAs after negotiations. Congress may need to consider setting a time limit for bill introduction and addressing text change issues in TPA renewal. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) is a political compact between Congress and the President, crucial for passing trade legislation with bipartisan understanding. Congress has options for renewing TPA, such as renewing and revising TPA authority or extending targeted TPA. The TPA-2015 legislation offers options for renewing Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), including extending targeted TPA for specific agreements like the TPP, granting permanent TPA authority in a two-tier procedure, or proceeding without TPA renewal which could delay future trade agreements but allow for consideration of other trade frameworks. The Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities Act of 2015 renewed Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) for four years with a possible three-year extension. Some Members oppose TPA due to concerns about expedited procedures limiting congressional authority. The legislation includes changes like increased consultation requirements with Congress and private sector advisers. The Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities Act of 2015 renewed Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) for four years with a possible three-year extension. The legislation includes new trade negotiating objectives such as digital trade, cross-border data flows, state-owned enterprises, localization barriers, currency, and human rights. The Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities Act of 2015 renewed Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) for four years with new trade negotiating objectives including digital trade, cross-border data flows, state-owned enterprises, localization barriers, currency, and human rights. The legislation also included a category of trade negotiating objectives called \"capacity building and other priorities.\" Congressional Trade Agreements Authority Requested by and Granted to Presidents Since 1934 Congressional Timeline under TPA A Short Guide to the Expedited Legislative Procedures for Passage of Trade Implementing Bills Under TPA. Before the formal TPA expedited procedures come into play, the House Ways and Means and Senate Finance Committees typically hold \"mock markups\" on informal drafts of the implementing legislation, voting to approve or disapprove. The President sends a final legal draft text of the trade agreement and a draft implementing bill to Congress. Identical bills are introduced in each house and referred to relevant committees. Committees have 45 days to report the bill or it is automatically discharged. The Senate Finance Committee has a deadline to act on a revenue bill, with limited debate and no amendments allowed. A bill passes by a simple majority, and the second house typically debates its own bill before taking a final vote. The Senate Finance Committee has a deadline to act on a revenue bill, with limited debate and no amendments allowed. The second house typically debates its own bill before taking a final vote, ensuring both houses act on the same measure. The implementing bill is signed by the President, and the agreement enters into force after necessary legislative and regulatory changes are made by the partner country(ies)."
