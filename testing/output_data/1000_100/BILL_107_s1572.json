    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Freedom Consolidation Act of 2001\". Congress finds that full and active participants in the Partnership for Peace should be invited to become full NATO members, as stated in previous Acts. The European Security Act of 1998 emphasized the importance of including emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe, such as Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Romania, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Bulgaria, in NATO to enhance stability and peace in Europe. At the Madrid Summit of the NATO Alliance in July 1997, Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic were invited to join the Alliance in the first round of NATO enlargement, with the expectation of extending further invitations to other nations in the coming years. At the Washington Summit of the NATO Alliance in April 1999, NATO pledged to continue welcoming new members who fulfill the Treaty's objectives and contribute to peace and security in the Euro-Atlantic area. In late 2002, NATO will decide on additional emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe to invite to join the Alliance in the next round of NATO enlargement at a summit in Prague, Czech Republic. In May 2000, several countries declared their intention to seek NATO membership in the next round of enlargement, emphasizing the importance of security and freedom for all European nations. President George W. Bush also expressed support for extending security and freedom to all new democracies in Europe. Former President William J. Clinton advocated for NATO membership for all of Europe's democracies willing to share responsibilities, emphasizing the importance of not using nations as pawns and advancing the cause of freedom. Former President William J. Clinton supports NATO membership for all European democracies willing to shoulder responsibilities, ensuring no automatic exclusions or vetoes from non-NATO countries to prevent a gray zone of insecurity in Europe. Congress reaffirms support for NATO enlargement as expressed in previous acts and declarations, endorsing further expansion of the alliance as outlined by past presidents and urging NATO allies to work towards this vision at the Prague Summit in 2002. Designation of Slovakia to receive assistance under the NATO Participation Act of 1994. Slovakia is designated as eligible to receive assistance under the NATO Participation Act of 1994, in addition to other countries already designated for assistance under related acts. Latvia, Lithuania, and Bulgaria are designated as eligible to receive assistance under the NATO Participation Act of 1994, with the possibility for other emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe to also receive assistance under the same program. SEC. 5. Authorization of security assistance for countries designated under the NATO Participation Act of 1994. Authorization of Foreign Military Financing for several countries including Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Bulgaria, and Romania for fiscal year 2002. The Security Assistance Act of 2000 (Public Law 106-280) is amended by redesignating certain paragraphs."
