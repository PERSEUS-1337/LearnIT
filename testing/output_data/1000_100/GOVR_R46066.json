Key deliverables from the London Leaders' Meeting included a new Readiness Initiative with 30 mechanized battalions, air squadrons, and naval combat vessels ready within 30 days. Space declared as a new operational domain for NATO, progress in combatting cyber threats, increased defense spending by European allies, commitment to missions in Afghanistan and counterterrorism efforts, assessment of China's impact on security, and initiation of a reflection process to strengthen NATO's political dimension. The London meeting highlighted NATO's achievements and the importance of strong U.S.-European relations. The United States has been a driving proponent and leader of the alliance since its creation in 1949. However, some European allies have questioned the Trump Administration's commitment to NATO. The Trump Administration's commitment to NATO has been questioned, with criticism over its unilateral approach to foreign policy and the drawdown of U.S. forces from Syria. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg acknowledges tensions within the alliance but emphasizes the importance of transatlantic cooperation. Despite concerns, U.S. officials maintain their commitment to NATO and highlight increased funding for U.S. force presence in Europe. President Trump has expressed support for NATO's purpose. At the London meeting, NATO leaders emphasized their commitment to advancing readiness and deterrence initiatives, declaring space as an operational domain. They also discussed NATO's ongoing mission in Afghanistan, counterterrorism efforts, and the implications of China's engagement in Europe. The United States has supported NATO's focus on territorial defense and deterring Russian aggression since Russia's actions in Crimea and Eastern Ukraine. NATO's focus on territorial defense and deterring Russian aggression was highlighted at the London meeting. Initiatives include deploying troops to Baltic States and Poland, increasing military exercises in Central and Eastern Europe, and implementing the Four-Thirties Readiness Initiative by the end of 2019. This aims to have 30 mechanized battalions, 30 air squadrons, and 30 naval combat vessels ready for use within 30 days. Some NATO allies question the effectiveness of deterrence initiatives, urging for more forces in the region. Western European countries emphasize a dual-track approach to Russia, balancing deterrence with dialogue. They believe efforts to rebuild relations with Moscow are as important as deterring Russia. NATO allies are hesitant to permanently deploy troops in countries that joined after the Soviet Union's collapse, citing concerns about violating the 1997 NATO-Russia Founding Act. In London, allies focused on cyber defense and declared space as a new operational domain. NATO has enhanced cyber defense capabilities since 2014, including Cyber Rapid Reaction Teams and plans for a new NATO Cyberspace Operations Center in Brussels. The new NATO Cyberspace Operations Center in Brussels will integrate allies' national cyber capabilities into NATO missions and operations. NATO aims to incorporate cyber defense into all levels of planning and operations to counter hybrid warfare threats. NATO leaders have agreed to establish counter-hybrid support teams to assist allies in preparing against and responding to hybrid activities. NATO deployed counter-hybrid support teams to Montenegro in November 2019 to assist allies in preparing against and responding to hybrid activities. In London, NATO leaders endorsed new baseline requirements for allies regarding the resilience of telecommunications infrastructure, including 5G systems. NATO formally declared space as an operational domain, emphasizing a defensive approach without intentions of deploying weapons. The Trump Administration has urged NATO allies to increase defense budgets in line with past agreements. President Trump welcomed European allies' substantial defense spending increases over the past five years. Critics worry his criticism of insufficient defense spending could harm NATO cohesion. NATO declared space as an operational domain with a defensive approach. NATO allies agreed in 2006 to allocate 2% of GDP to defense annually and increase procurement spending. At the 2014 Wales Summit, they pledged to meet the 2% guideline within a decade. European allies and Canada have increased defense spending by $130 billion since 2014, expected to reach $400 billion by 2024. In 2019, 9 allies are projected to meet the 2% guideline, with 16 expected to follow suit. In 2019, 9 allies are expected to have met the 2% guideline for defense spending, and 16 allies are expected to have met the 20% benchmark for spending on major equipment. President Trump and others criticize NATO members perceived as reluctant to meet defense-spending targets. Germany, Europe's largest economy, currently spends about 1.38% of GDP on defense, with plans to reach 1.5% by 2024. Many allies, including Germany, emphasize contributions to ongoing NATO missions and military capabilities as important as total defense spending levels. Analysts argue that focusing on defense budgets should also consider military capabilities and contributions to NATO missions. NATO aims for 20% of defense expenditure to be spent on new equipment and research. Secretary General Stoltenberg emphasizes measuring contributions through \"cash, capabilities, and contributions\" to align with NATO's strategic objectives. In London, allied leaders approved a U.S. proposal to adjust contributions to NATO's common funds, with the U.S. and Germany each contributing about 16%. The allies also reaffirmed their commitment to NATO's training mission in Afghanistan. NATO allies and partners have been steadily increasing troop levels in Afghanistan since the launch of the Resolute Support Mission in 2015. As of February 2020, there were about 8,500 troops from NATO members and partner countries, with the top contributors being the United States, Germany, the UK, Italy, Georgia, and Romania. NATO leaders welcomed agreements between the United States, Afghanistan, and the Taliban for a peaceful settlement in Afghanistan. NATO is making adjustments to its mission in Afghanistan, including troop reductions, based on agreements. European allies want close coordination on drawdown plans. President Trump urges NATO to expand counterterrorism efforts beyond Afghanistan. NATO has launched initiatives to counter terrorism in the MENA region. NATO has launched initiatives to counter terrorism and address instability in the MENA region, including the noncombat NATO Training Mission in Iraq, partnership activities with countries like Tunisia and Jordan, and the establishment of a NATO Regional Hub for the South in Naples, Italy. Aerial surveillance aircraft have been deployed to assist the global coalition fighting the Islamic State. Some allies believe the EU should lead Europe's response to terrorism and migration, limiting NATO's engagement in the region. France has advocated strong European responses to terrorism and conflict in the Middle East but has generally opposed a larger role for NATO. Some allies disagree on involving NATO in security challenges in the MENA region, with concerns about endorsing military action. The Trump Administration and some Members of Congress have urged NATO to assess security implications of Chinese investment in Europe to counter potential negative impacts on transatlantic security. U.S. officials are increasingly concerned about China gaining a strategic foothold in Europe through unfair trade practices and investments in key industries and infrastructure. U.S. officials are concerned about Chinese investment in critical infrastructure and 5G networks, with potential implications for military cooperation and intelligence sharing with allies. NATO has adopted a plan to address emerging concerns about 5G technology and assess risks associated with cyber threats and foreign ownership. The EU is working on common guidelines for 5G networks, but decisions will ultimately be made by individual national governments. The UK government announced that \"high-risk vendors\" like Huawei would be excluded from sensitive parts of 5G networks and critical national infrastructure, limiting their access to 35%. Other countries, such as Poland, are considering excluding Huawei from their telecommunications sector. Poland and Czech Republic are considering excluding Huawei from their telecommunications sector due to national security risks. Despite concerns about China's influence in Europe, US officials are optimistic about collaborating with Europe on security and economic issues. Analysts suggest joint US-European pressure on China would be more effective. North Macedonia became NATO's 30th member on March 27, 2020, after delays in the ratification process. The U.S. Senate ratified NATO accession on October 22, 2019, amid tensions within the alliance over various issues. Disagreements on NATO's strategic direction and President Trump's criticism have raised concerns about the alliance's future. In an effort to address disagreements within NATO, allies agreed to start a reflection process to strengthen the alliance's political dimension. Secretary General Stoltenberg appointed a group of experts to recommend ways to reinforce unity and increase political consultation. Some analysts and leaders question the Trump Administration's commitment to NATO and express concerns about potential lasting damage to the alliance. President Trump's criticisms of NATO could harm alliance cohesion and credibility. He has questioned NATO's value to the US and urged European allies to increase defense spending. Despite reaffirming commitment to NATO in London, concerns persist about growing divergence between the US and European allies on key foreign policy issues. The US's divergences with European allies on key foreign policy issues, such as the drawdown of forces in Syria and subsequent Turkish military operations, have raised concerns about NATO's cohesion and credibility. French President Macron has warned of the \"brain death of NATO\" due to these rifts. French President Macron criticized the lack of coordination between the United States and its NATO allies, particularly regarding Turkey's actions in northern Syria and its planned deployment of a Russian air defense system. President Trump dismissed Macron's comments as \"nasty\" and reaffirmed the importance of NATO. Some NATO members have questioned Turkey's membership due to its military operations and defense system choices. Since 1952, Turkey has been a NATO member and has participated in various missions. NATO has invested in military facilities in Turkey, including naval bases and radar sites. NATO members have provided air defense support to Turkey since 2013. Turkey has invoked Article 4 of NATO's treaty three times due to perceived threats from Syria. Secretary General Stoltenberg urged Turkey to act with restraint during a 2019 visit. NATO allies expressed solidarity with Turkey in response to air strikes by the Syrian regime and Russia in Idlib province. Secretary General Stoltenberg highlighted NATO's air defense support and aerial surveillance for Turkey along its border with Syria. Some allies questioned the deployment of air defense systems after Turkey's military incursion into northern Syria in October 2019. Italy withdrew its air defense system from Turkey in December 2019, while Spain continues to deploy a Patriot missile battery along Turkey's border. The deployment of a Patriot missile battery along Turkey's border continues. Secretary General Stoltenberg expressed concerns about Turkey's acquisition of the S-400 air defense system, stating it is \"not good\" for NATO. Some allied leaders suggest excluding Turkey from NATO's defense systems if it deploys the S-400. The North Atlantic Treaty does not explicitly authorize action against a NATO member without consent, but the US and other allies could adjust their cooperation with Turkey. Defense Secretary Mark Esper plans to urge NATO allies to take collective action. Defense Secretary Mark Esper plans to urge NATO allies to take collective action in response to Turkish actions. European leaders, including French President Macron, emphasize the need for coordinated European defense capabilities independent of NATO. The EU has been working on its Common Security and Defense Policy to enhance European military capabilities, despite challenges with flat or declining defense budgets. The EU has introduced initiatives like the European Defense Fund to support joint defense research. The EU has introduced new defense initiatives, including the European Defense Fund (EDF) and the EU defense pact (PESCO) to enhance joint defense research and spending efficiency. NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg supports EU defense integration but emphasizes strengthening the European pillar within NATO. Concerns have been raised by the Trump Administration that the EDF and PESCO could limit U.S. defense company participation in pan-European military projects. Supporters highlight that PESCO's projects were identified in consultation with NATO. Congress has consistently shown strong support for NATO, with some members criticizing specific aspects but overall backing U.S. leadership in the alliance. During the Trump Administration, congressional support for NATO was seen as a reassurance to allies following President Trump's criticisms. During the Trump Administration, Congress reaffirmed U.S. support for NATO despite some allies questioning the President's commitment. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell invited Secretary General Stoltenberg to address a joint session of Congress in commemoration of NATO's 70th anniversary, highlighting NATO's importance to Congress. Congressional hearings reflected disagreement on President Trump's impact on the alliance, with some arguing his criticism of defense spending levels spurred increases by NATO members. President Trump's criticism of NATO allies has led to increased defense spending by members, despite concerns about his impact on the alliance. Some Members of Congress worry that his actions have damaged relationships and credibility within NATO, potentially emboldening adversaries like Russia. There are also concerns about the lack of coordination with allies on important security issues. Despite disagreements, most Members of Congress support strong U.S. leadership in NATO to address threats from Russia. Some Members of Congress are questioning NATO's response to Russian aggression and considering formal action against allies like Turkey. They are also discussing the strategic value of NATO to the United States and the need for a new strategic concept to address emerging threats in cyber and hybrid warfare domains. NATO's current strategic concept, adopted in 2010, is being examined for its capacity to address security threats in the Euro-Atlantic region, including terrorism and migration. The assessment includes member states' defense spending targets, U.S. force posture in Europe, allies' contributions to NATO deterrence efforts, and a strategy towards China. Options to sanction allies jeopardizing security and the commitment to NATO's \"open door\" policy on enlargement are also being revisited. Increased Chinese investment in Europe raises security concerns for the U.S. and its allies."
