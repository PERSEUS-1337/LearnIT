    "content": "The alternate engine program for the F-35 Lightning II fighter was a significant issue for Congress in FY2012, with implications for the defense budget and military capability. The program developed the General Electric/Rolls-Royce F136 engine as an alternative to the Pratt & Whitney F135 engine. Despite successive Administration proposals to terminate the program, Congress continued to fund it until FY2011 when funding was eliminated. General Electric and Rolls-Royce announced the end of F136 development on December 2, 2011. On December 2, 2011, General Electric and Rolls-Royce ended development of the F136 engine, terminating the F-35 engine competition. The Department of Defense selected the Lockheed Martin F-35 with the Pratt & Whitney F135 engine as the winner of the Joint Strike Fighter competition. The F135 and F136 engines were designed to be used interchangeably on the F-35 airframe. The alternate engine program for the F-35 was terminated in 2011 after Congress rejected funding for it. Supporters of the termination argued that developing a second engine would significantly increase costs and reduce the number of F-35s that could be procured. The F-35 program office anticipates a reduction in procurement of 50 to 80 aircraft over the next five years due to funding constraints. Procuring a second engine would raise operation and support costs, with challenges in maintaining two engine pipelines on aircraft carriers. International interest in the F-35 is already strong, and having a second engine is deemed unnecessary. Congress has accepted the risk of using single designs across fleets. Congress and the Department of Defense accept the risk of using single designs across fleets for aircraft like the F-35. Procuring a second engine is deemed unnecessary and would increase operation and support costs. The development and testing of the F135 engine have reached a point where having an alternate engine program is no longer necessary. The Administration's proposal to terminate the alternate engine program is being opposed by some, citing concerns about compliance. The Administration's proposal to terminate the alternate engine program for the F-35 does not comply with the FY2008 defense authorization act, which requires the development and procurement of 2 options for the propulsion system. Having all F-35s powered by a single engine type could be imprudent given their importance as the country's strike fighters. Having a second engine for the F-35 would allow for competition in procurement and support, reducing costs and promoting better performance and reliability. It would also enable production to be quickly increased if needed, maintaining effective competition. The F-35 alternate engine program was terminated by DOD on April 25, 2011, with all tooling and engines ordered to be returned. This decision raised questions about maintaining competition in aircraft engine development and procurement, especially if F-22 and F/A-18E/F production ends. Having a second engine option could sustain international interest in the F-35 program and potentially increase exports. The F-35 alternate engine program was terminated by DOD in 2011. General Electric and Rolls-Royce ended development of the F136 engine. Pratt & Whitney, the incumbent engine maker, received $7.3 billion in funding for the F-35 program. The estimated cost of the F135 SDD contract increased to $6.7 billion by 2009. The F-35 alternate engine program, developed by General Electric and Rolls-Royce, received $2.4 billion in funding from FY1995-FY2009. The F136 engine did not include certain components provided under the F135 Pratt & Whitney SDD contract. The F136 program was terminated in 2011. Prior to the final FY2011 DOD and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act on April 15, 2011, the government operated under continuing resolutions (CRs). Some members of Congress questioned the status of the alternate engine program during this period. CRs prohibited spending on new starts or procurement rates above FY2010 levels. P.L. 111-242 set DOD spending at a \"rate of operations\" consistent with FY2010 levels for base budget and military construction, with reductions for BRAC funding not requested in FY2011. Office of Management and Budget Director Jacob Lew stated that DoD would be expected to continue funding activities. The government operated under continuing resolutions (CRs) before the final FY2011 DOD and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act on April 15, 2011. Office of Management and Budget Director Jacob Lew assured that DoD would fund activities on a pro-rata basis during the CR period. The alternate engine program was funded at the FY2010 level until March 24, 2011, when DOD issued a stop-work order. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates testified that there was little advantage to taxpayers in having a second engine. The F135 engine program is progressing well with 13,000 hours of testing completed out of 14,700. The F136 engine has only completed 50 hours of testing, and there are concerns about encountering similar development problems as the first engine. Secretary of the Air Force Michael Donley highlighted the close call in deciding whether to invest further in the second engine during a hearing on February 23, 2010. The F135 engine program is progressing well with 13,000 hours of testing completed out of 14,700. Secretary of the Air Force Michael Donley highlighted concerns about investing in a second engine due to the considerable remaining investment needed, logistics tail, pre-production work, and development costs. Air Force Chief of Staff General Norton Schwartz testified that the F-35 should not have an alternate engine due to technological progress and the potential impact on the number of F-35s available. The defense community is comfortable with the reliability of airplane engines, with General Schwartz questioning the need for funding for an alternate engine. Adm. Roughead prefers one engine for carriers, while Gen. Cartwright suggests investing in more Predators instead of the alternate engine for the Joint Strike Fighter. The defense community questions the need for an alternate engine for aircraft. Developing a second engine would require significant upfront costs for infrastructure and tooling. The Administration believed the alternative engine program may not result in lower prices induced by competition. The Administration stated that the alternative engine program for the Joint Strike Fighter was no longer necessary due to high costs and minimal financial benefits. The cancellation would result in estimated near-term savings of over a billion dollars. GAO testified that competitive pressures could potentially offset costs over the program's life, but continuing the alternate engine program would require an additional investment of $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion. The GAO stated that a competitive strategy could save $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion in costs for the engine program. The \"Great Engine War\" in the 1980s resulted in significant savings across the life cycle of the engine. Nonfinancial benefits of competition include better performance and increased reliability. Cost has been a major issue in the debate over the alternate engine. The F135 engine cost has increased by 24%, prompting calls for a competitor to control costs. The Administration argues that the benefits of a second engine do not justify the expense. Secretary Gates mentioned cost growth is expected for developmental aircraft and allocated over $4 billion in the budget to address program risks. A Joint Assessment Team was created to investigate Pratt & Whitney's cost structure. The Joint Assessment Team (JAT) was formed to analyze Pratt & Whitney's cost structure for the F135 engine of the F-35 Lightning II program. The JAT's charter included understanding production costs, drivers, projections, and long-term affordability. A Pentagon study indicated that adding a second engine would cost the same as sticking to a single-source plan, supporting the decision to reject proposals for a competitive engine acquisition strategy. The Pentagon memo explains that developing a second engine for the F-35 is not cost-effective, despite reduced development costs. Pratt & Whitney received $1 billion for F135 engine support and production improvements. The Pentagon memo states that developing a second engine for the F-35 is not cost-effective, despite reduced development costs. Approximately $400 million would be allocated for engine improvements, with a third needed to meet the original specification and two-thirds to exceed it for increased robustness. Three independent cost analyses of the F-35 engine program were directed by Section 211 of the 2007 defense authorization act, with differing conclusions on financial break-even points for an alternate engine program. The studies analyzed financial break-even points for an alternate engine program and highlighted non-financial benefits like fleet readiness and international relations. The CAIG study looked at engine competitions for the Air Force F-16 and Navy/Marine Corps F/A-18 programs, as well as the sole-source procurement of the Pratt & Whitney F-119 engine for the F-22. The study assumed favorable outcomes for dual sourcing. The study assumed that the second F-35 engine provider would match the pricing of the initial provider in 2014. It projected a 5% immediate price decrease in engine procurement costs with competition, along with a steeper reduction in costs for subsequent engines. A 21.1% reduction in engine procurement costs over the program's lifetime was needed to break even, with a 25.6% reduction on a net-present-value basis. The study suggested that the Department of Defense would not recover its initial investment in the alternate engine development program. The CAIG study suggested that DOD would need to compete engine operations and support contracts to achieve a 25.6% savings by 2040. It also discussed the growth potential in the F-35 engine due to aircraft weight increases. The CAIG and IDA studies analyzed engine competition for the F-16 and F/A-18 programs, estimating potential savings of 11% to 18%. An alternate engine program for the F-35 would incur $8.8 billion in investment costs, which would not be recouped through procurement-cost savings alone. The study found that for the alternate engine program for the F-35 to break even on an NPV basis, a 40% procurement-cost savings would be needed, which was deemed unrealistic. However, if engine O&S contracts were also competed, the required savings would decrease to 18%. The study highlighted the lack of historical data linking procurement and O&S costs in a single competition. It emphasized the importance of contractor responsiveness in the Great Engine War and the potential risk mitigation of having an alternate engine for the F-35 fleet. Industry responsiveness to engine upgrades and fixes due to competitive forces could significantly impact fleet readiness. A GAO study indicated that a 10.3% to 12.3% procurement-cost savings would be necessary for the alternate engine program to break even on its investment costs. Past engine competitions have shown potential financial savings of up to 20%. The study suggested that savings from competing the engine could recoup investment costs. GAO's director mentioned that the alternate engine program might reach its break-even point by the late 2020s. Despite marginal financial benefits, DOD's program management advisory group recommended continuing the alternate engine program for its non-financial advantages. The size of the F-35 production run can impact the potential for reaching a break-even point for an alternate engine program. U.S. and foreign governments' decisions on procurement numbers and engine choices will influence the production run size. Changes in international security and defense budgets make it challenging to predict the ultimate size of the production run or engine selection. The GE/Rolls-Royce and Pratt & Whitney teams made offers to build F136 and F135 engines for the F-35. Pratt & Whitney agreed on a fixed-price contract for F135s for Low Rate Initial Production Lot IV, resulting in a 16% cost reduction compared to LRIP III. The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed by the United States and eight other countries on the production, sustainment, and development of the JSF Air System includes the production of the JSF Air Vehicle with propulsion systems F135 and F136. The scope of work is subject to the availability of funds from the U.S. and partner nations. The PSFD MOU provision regarding cooperative production and procurement of F135 and F136 remains valid, subject to availability of funds. Consultations have been held with partners regarding the decision not to include F136 in RDT&E funding requests. The JSF SDD and PSFD MOU obligations will be continued regardless of the U.S. FY10 authorization process. European countries with firms involved in F135 and F136 programs may evolve their position on the second engine based on economic interests. On September 3, 2010, British Secretary of State for Defence supported the F136 engine, expressing concerns about canceling it. Both JSF engines faced development challenges, with failures during ground testing due to \"high-cycle fatigue.\" The second engine failure was linked to ongoing testing after the first failure. The engine malfunctions delayed the first flight of the F-35B aircraft by a month or two, leading to cost overruns in the F135 program. Damage to an F135 engine was attributed to a worn bushing, prompting minor modifications for future engines. The F136 engine also encountered test incidents, including ingestion of a test sensor and impact damage to blades. On October 2, 2009, impact damage was found on blades in the turbines due to a loose nut ingestion. In September 2010, an F136 engine sustained damage, leading to a design change. In April 2011, F135 engines were replaced due to a misassembly issue identified during testing. Pratt & Whitney confirmed engine replacements since March due to misassembly after overhaul. Pratt & Whitney faced quality control issues with mis-assembled engines, leading to increased costs and scrap rates. Marine Corps Brigadier General David Heinz criticized the company for deficiencies in their manufacturing process. Pratt & Whitney defended their yield rates, stating that only a few parts had high scrap rates. William Begert, VP of business development, refuted claims of a 50% scrap rate, citing a 97% success rate for the total engine. A General Electric F136 engine exceeded thrust requirements in testing. Pratt & Whitney plans to test a higher-thrust F135. The FY2012 budget proposes terminating the alternate engine program, prompting Congress to decide on its continuation. Funding for the program has been drawn from various sources, including the F-35 program. The funding for the alternate engine program for the F-35 came from existing program funds and additional funds from the DOD topline. The allocation of funds could impact other DOD programs, potentially leading to cuts in F-35 activities if funds are taken from within the existing budget lines. This could result in a reduction of 50-80 tails from the program over the next five years. The DOD may need to transfer funds from other defense programs to support the F-35 due to an increase in the topline. Congress faces a decision on whether to continue the alternate engine program, which could impact the number of F-35s procured or other defense capabilities. The cost of fielding and supporting two F-35 engines is similar to one engine, with an additional $2.9 billion needed over six years for competition. The GAO report highlighted that the $2.9 billion estimate for developing the F136 engine lacks precision and could vary based on different assumptions. The upfront cost of the engine could be offset by competition savings over the program's lifetime, although studies differ on this point. Congress must consider which assumptions to trust regarding competition's impact on costs. The GAO report and advocates of alternate engine procurement argue that competition helps control cost growth. Without competition, DOD negotiates contracts based on past experience, with incentives for cost targets and penalties for missing them. Congress must weigh the risk of relying on a single engine type for the F-35 fleet, as a problem could ground all aircraft. Marine Corps grounded 106 AV-8B Harriers in 2000. The Marine Corps grounded 106 AV-8B Harriers in July 2000 due to a faulty engine bearing causing a crash. Engine issues accounted for 18% of Navy groundings from 1997 to 2006, and the Air Force had to stand down two fleets between 1990 and 2006 for the same reason. DOD argues that terminating the F136 alternate engine program poses little operational risk, citing advancements in computational fluid design and software for health monitoring to reduce risks associated with relying on a single engine type. The advanced software in aircraft engines can diagnose their own condition and provide early warnings of impending failures, allowing pilots to land safely. However, supporting multiple engines may pose operational and logistical challenges, as noted by Navy and Air Force officials. The Air Force has experience with multiple engine types for single-airframe fleets, but there is concern about focusing the alternate engine solely on the Air Force. Congress may need to decide on using multiple engines for one service or the entire F-35 buy. The potential impact on General Electric's ability to compete for future fighter aircraft engines if the F136 engine is terminated is a key issue for policy makers. General Electric has a significant share of the market for commercial aircraft engines and also supports military engines. A study noted that General Electric produced more commercial engines than Pratt & Whitney in 2007. The debate is whether the Pentagon should pay GE to compete with Pratt for military engine contracts. Pratt & Whitney relies heavily on military engines for its business. The termination of the F136 program could impact General Electric's ability to design and produce fighter engines, potentially reducing their competitiveness for future military engine contracts. Ending the F136 program may also lead to a decrease in suppliers for F-35 engine spare parts, increasing vulnerability to disruptions. Maintaining competition between the F135 and F136 for F-35 engine production could mitigate these risks. Maintaining competition between the F135 and F136 for F-35 engine production could reduce workload for suppliers and create uncertainty. Studies suggest that having multiple vendors could create parts for each engine, with the possibility of suppliers not exiting the domestic industrial base if the F136 program is terminated. However, concerns remain about placing all fighter engine production with a firm that has a weak position in the commercial marketplace. The IDA study of 2007 found that having multiple engine vendors for the F-35 could strengthen the U.S. industrial base. Competition between General Electric and Pratt & Whitney in the Great Engine War improved engine development. Congress may need to consider non-monetary benefits of competition when choosing between one or two engines. The House passed H.R. 1540, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, which includes language requiring competitive development and procurement of the F-35's engine. Funds cannot be used for performance improvements unless done competitively. The Secretary of Defense must ensure competitive procurement for the propulsion system of the F-35 Lightning II aircraft program. The Secretary of Defense must ensure competitive development and production of the propulsion system for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft program. Performance improvement is defined as increasing fan or core engine airflow volume or maximum thrust for better takeoff performance or vertical load bring back. The preservation and storage plan for the F136 propulsion system must be developed and carried out. The Secretary of Defense is required to develop a plan for preserving and storing property acquired under the F136 propulsion system development contract. The plan must ensure the ability to restart development, sustain and repair the property, and allow for storage at government or contractor facilities. Additionally, the plan must identify costs for restarting development and provide support for the contractor to conduct research and testing of the F136 engine. The Secretary of Defense is required to develop a plan for preserving and storing property acquired under the F136 propulsion system development contract, ensuring the ability to restart development, sustain and repair the property, and allowing for storage at government or contractor facilities. The plan must also identify costs for restarting development and provide support for the contractor to conduct research and testing of the F136 engine. Additionally, the Secretary must submit a report to the congressional defense committees within 45 days of the enactment of the Act. The report accompanying H.R. 1540 emphasizes incentivizing competition for the F136 propulsion system, ensuring preservation of related property, and supporting the contractor for development and testing at no cost to the government. The committee believes a competitive alternative is crucial for the success of the Joint Strike Fighter program, leading to better engine performance, improved contractor responsiveness, a stronger industrial base, increased engine reliability, and enhanced operational readiness. The Administration strongly objects to limiting funds for F-35 propulsion system improvements without competitive development. This could lead to unnecessary costs and destabilize the program. It may also delay main engine development and impact the viability of the short takeoff and vertical landing variant. The Administration opposes funding for the F136 engine program and objects to the requirement to store and preserve property developed under the program. The Senate passed a bill prohibiting funds for the F136 engine. The F136 engine program is prohibited from receiving funds for research, development, test, and evaluation. Any expenses related to the F136 engine cannot be charged to future government contracts. The Secretary of Defense is required to develop a plan for the disposition of property acquired under the F136 propulsion system. The Secretary of Defense must develop a plan for the disposition of property acquired under the F136 propulsion system contract, ensuring long-term sustainment, repair, and potential reuse within government programs or contractor-funded activities. Additional facilities or funding may be required for the plan's implementation. The Secretary of Defense must develop a plan for the disposition of property acquired under the F136 propulsion system contract, ensuring long-term sustainment, repair, and potential reuse within government programs or contractor-funded activities. None of the funds for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft program can be used for destroying or disposing of the property until a report is submitted to the congressional defense committees. The report must describe how to maximize the benefit from the investment in developing the F136. The Federal Government did not allocate funds for the F-35 alternate engine in the 2012 Department of Defense Appropriations Act. The legislative history of the F-35 alternate engine program from FY1996-FY2010 is detailed in Appendix A. The legislative history of the F-35 alternate engine program from FY1996-FY2010 is presented in the appendix, focusing on final bill language and committee and conference report language. The program was initially known as the Joint Advanced Strike Technology (JAST) program in FY1996 and FY1997. The FY1996 Defense Authorization Act authorized funds for the JAST program and required a report to be submitted before funds could be obligated. The FY1996 Defense Authorization Act allocated $7 million for competitive engine concepts for the JAST program. The Senate report raised concerns about the program's ability to meet service needs and directed the inclusion of two approaches to reduce program risk, including evaluating propulsion concepts from competing engine companies. The Senate report (S.Rept. 104-112) raised concerns about engine competition and prototype size in the JAST program. The conferees directed the Under Secretary of Defense to ensure adequate engine competition and scale of demonstrator aircraft. They recommended authorization of funds for competitive engine concepts. The Senate Armed Services Committee report on the JAST program emphasized the importance of supporting competitive propulsion programs to reduce risk and achieve more affordable life cycle costs. The committee directed the Secretary to evaluate at least two propulsion concepts from competing engine companies for the full scale, full thrust aircraft demonstrators. The history of recent fighter engine development shows challenges faced in creating new engines. The Navy upgraded F-14s with an Air Force engine due to dissatisfaction with early models. The Air Force spent over a billion dollars to introduce competition between engine manufacturers for F-15 and F-16. The F-22's new engine is undergoing redesign. The JAST program aims to build a common aircraft for Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps, but has chosen a single power plant design. The JAST program aims to build a common aircraft for Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps, but has chosen a single power plant design. The Senate Armed Services Committee believes it is imperative to actively pursue an engine design from a second manufacturer to ensure cost-effectiveness and competition. Additional funding has been provided for this purpose. The committee directs that remaining competition funds be rebaselined to guarantee integration into the preferred weapons system concept at the earliest practical point. The DOD Appropriation Act (H.R. 3610 / P.L. 104-208 of September 30, 1996) included funding to accelerate development of an alternate engine for the JAST program. The FY1998 Defense Authorization Act (H.R. 1119 / P.L. 105-85) requires a report on the Joint Strike Fighter Program, including funding for an alternate engine development program. The House Armed Services Committee report (H.Rept. 105-132) discussed the JSF program in detail. The FY1998 Defense Authorization Act requires a report on the Joint Strike Fighter Program, specifically regarding funding for the alternative fighter engine development. The Senate Armed Services Committee directed the Secretary of Defense to provide a report detailing the funding needed for full development and flight testing of the AFE within the JSF program. The FY1998 Defense Authorization Act requires a report on the Joint Strike Fighter Program, specifically regarding funding for the alternative fighter engine development. The Senate Armed Services Committee recommended an increase in the budget request of $28.0 million to accelerate the alternative engine program for the JSF. The committee expects the Department to program sufficient funds for a robust, accelerated profile in future years. The Senate Armed Services Committee recommended an increase in the budget request of $28.0 million to accelerate the alternative engine program for the JSF. The committee notes the timely submission and clear presentation of the Department of Defense priorities and plans, but expresses concern about the continuous delays in demonstrating the alternate engine in a JSF airframe. The Senate Armed Services Committee recommended an increase of $28.0 million to accelerate the alternative engine program for the JSF due to concerns about delays in demonstrating the engine in a JSF airframe. The House Armed Services Committee also supports the development of an alternate engine to ensure critical industrial base capabilities, control engine cost growth, and reduce risk to the planned fleet of 3,000 JSF aircraft. The committee is concerned about the funding levels for the development of an alternative engine for the JSF aircraft, noting an increase in funding for other jet engine development efforts. They prioritize the development of a new state-of-the-art alternative engine for JSF over proposed increases in other engine programs. The committee prioritizes the development of a new alternative engine for the JSF over other engine programs. They recommend reallocating funds for acceleration of the alternate engine development. The committee recommends an additional $15.0 million for the alternate engine program of the JSF to reduce risk and accelerate development, bringing the total Air Force authorization to $250.4 million. The FY2001 Defense Authorization Act discussed concerns about additional contractor funding needed for the JSF program. The JSF program, a major acquisition program in the Department of Defense, is a winner-take-all competition where contractors are vying for selection. Conferees are against requiring industry to make additional investments beyond existing agreements. They believe DEMVAL funding is necessary for project execution as per the budget request. Risk mitigation projects, including the alternate engine, are expected to be funded at requested levels. The House Armed Services Committee report discussed concerns about the \"winner take all\" strategy for the JSF program. The committee supports the JSF alternate engine program to ensure the health of the fighter aircraft engine industrial base. Acceleration of AEP development is recommended to reduce risk to JSF production and aircraft fielding. The Committee supports acceleration of AEP development for the JSF airframe, recommending increased funding for the program. The Senate Appropriations Committee report also backs the Alternate Engine Program for JSF, ensuring no impact on the current AEP schedule. The FY2002 Defense Authorization Act discusses the JSF program and the need for the Department to develop and integrate the alternate engine. The House Armed Services Committee report on the companion bill also addresses the JSF alternate engine program. The FY2002 Defense Authorization Act addresses the JSF program's development phase and the need for an alternate engine. The JSF joint program office encourages collaboration between engine manufacturers for common propulsion components. The committee supports production of the F-120 alternate engine in fiscal year 2009. The committee recommends increased funding in fiscal year 2002 to reduce development schedule risk of common hardware components for the JSF alternate engine. Additional funding was included in the FY2003 DOD Appropriations Act and FY2004 Defense Authorization Act to support the development of two competing engine programs for the Joint Strike Fighter. The report on S. 1050 recommends $56 million in additional funding for the JSF program, specifically for the interchangeable engine development. The committee urges the Department of Defense to make financial adjustments to maintain the original engine schedule. The Senate Appropriations Committee report on the Joint Strike Fighter program expressed dismay over a $56 million reduction in funding for the F136 Interchangeable Engine in fiscal year 2004. The Committee recommended a total cut of $56 million to the program, to be equally divided between the Navy and Air Force Joint Strike Fighter programs, excluding the F136 engine program. The Committee recommends restoring the fiscal year 2004 cut to the F136 Interchangeable Engine program and adding $20,000,000 for risk reduction. The House Armed Services Committee report discusses the JSF program and the importance of maintaining competition for the engine. The committee directs the JSF JPO to compete engine common hardware and turbomachinery at the earliest possible date while maintaining engine interchangeability. Despite efforts to eliminate funding for the competitive engine development program, the Secretary of Defense ensured nominal funding, believing a two-engine source for the single-engine JSF would be beneficial. The committee believes that a two-engine source for the single-engine JSF would be the most cost-effective and operationally effective engine solution. The Secretary, along with the Department of the Navy and the Department of the Air Force, is expected to remain committed to the development of competitive engines for the JSF as per the FY2007 Defense Authorization Act. The Secretary is prohibited from making modifications to the acquisition program for the Joint Strike Fighter aircraft that would change the propulsion system, except under certain conditions. Independent cost analyses of the JSF engine program are required. The Joint Strike Fighter engine program requires independent cost analyses by the Comptroller General, a federally funded research and development center, and the Cost Analysis Improvement Group of the Office of the Secretary of Defense. The analyses will cover different alternatives for the propulsion system of the aircraft. The Joint Strike Fighter engine program requires cost analyses by various entities to evaluate different propulsion system alternatives for the aircraft. The Secretary of Defense, Comptroller General, and CEO of the research center must submit reports to Congress by March 15, 2007, detailing key assumptions, methodologies, and cost comparisons for each alternative. The report to Congress by March 15, 2007, must include cost analyses for different propulsion system alternatives for the Joint Strike Fighter program, as well as evaluations of manpower requirements, flight hours, engine procurement, and benefits of competition. Additionally, past acquisition strategies and experiences with engines for tactical fighter aircraft must be described. The report to Congress by March 15, 2007, must include cost analyses for different propulsion system alternatives for the Joint Strike Fighter program, evaluations of manpower requirements, flight hours, engine procurement, and benefits of competition. It should also cover past acquisition programs for tactical fighter aircraft engines, comparisons of sole-source vs competitive programs, and the impact of canceling the F136 competitive engine on the military engine industrial base. The House Armed Services Committee report discussed the JSF program and the budget request for the Department of the Air Force's development of the joint strike fighter. It includes cost analyses for different propulsion system alternatives, evaluations of manpower requirements, flight hours, engine procurement, and benefits of competition. The term ''lifecycle costs'' in this section includes elements of cost for a life-cycle cost analysis for a major defense acquisition program. The committee report discussed the budget request for the Department of the Air Force's development of the joint strike fighter (JSF), including funds for the F-35 but not for a second aircraft tire source or an alternate JSF engine. The JSF alternate engine program is developing the F136 engine as an alternative to the F135 engine. The committee believes a two-engine source for the single-engine JSF would be the most cost-effective and operationally effective solution. The committee discussed the budget request for the Department of the Air Force's development of the joint strike fighter (JSF) and expressed disappointment that funds for an alternate JSF engine beyond fiscal year 2006 were not included. The Under Secretary of Defense testified that the benefits of a second supplier are not worth the financial cost. The committee requested the Government Accountability Office to review the Department of Defense's analysis on terminating the JSF alternate engine program. The GAO reported that the analysis only focused on potential savings for engine acquisition and did not fully examine other possible savings. The committee concurs with GAO's observation that the JSF alternate engine program should continue until potential costs and savings resulting from competition over the engine's lifecycle are fully analyzed. An increase of $408.0 million is recommended to continue the program for fiscal year 2007. Additionally, a provision is recommended to obligate not less than $408.0 million for the development of an alternate engine for the Joint Strike Fighter. The committee recommends continued development of an alternate engine for the Joint Strike Fighter, with a provision for independent analyses and reporting by March 15, 2007. The Senate Armed Services Committee supports modernization and transformation of the armed forces, including authorizing funds for ship construction totaling $12.1 billion. The Senate Armed Services Committee recommends funding for the construction of eight ships totaling $12.1 billion, promoting joint development of unmanned systems, supporting the Joint Strike Fighter engine development, and increasing funds for science and technology programs. The committee emphasizes the importance of coalition operations and previously addressed concerns about engine competition in the Joint Strike Fighter program. The Senate Armed Services Committee recommends funding for the construction of eight ships totaling $12.1 billion, promoting joint development of unmanned systems, supporting the Joint Strike Fighter engine development, and increasing funds for science and technology programs. The committee remains concerned about the Department's proposal to eliminate the F136 alternate engine from the Joint Strike Fighter program, and authorizes additional funding for the development of the interchangeable engine to maintain competition and reduce operational and financial risks. The report recommends continuing the development of the Joint Strike Fighter program with two competitive propulsion systems or opting for a single propulsion system through a firm-fixed-price contract. Pratt & Whitney was the sole provider of engines for certain aircraft in the past. The Department of Defense was directed by Congress to develop an engine to compete with Pratt & Whitney for the F-14, F-15, and F-16 aircraft due to persistent engine problems. This competition resulted in improved performance, reduced risk, increased readiness, and over $4.0 billion in cost savings. Congress has consistently supported competitive engine programs for the Joint Strike Fighter for the past 10 years, as it is the largest acquisition program in Department of Defense history. The committee is concerned about the reliance on a sole engine supplier for the Joint Strike Fighter program, which is the largest acquisition program in Department of Defense history. They believe that the termination of the F136 interchangeable engine did not consider the total life cycle cost, posing operational and financial risks to the nation. The committee recommends conducting a full life cycle cost analysis to show significant cost savings through a competitive engine strategy for the Joint Strike Fighter program. They propose independent cost analyses to ensure Congress has a complete picture of the costs involved. The Secretary of Defense, a federally-funded research and development center (FFRDC), and the Comptroller General are tasked with conducting independent life cycle cost analyses of the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program with two competitive propulsion systems. The goal is to compare the costs of developing and sustaining the program with two engines versus proceeding with only one engine. The committee is concerned that the Department of Defense's analysis did not consider all costs over the aircraft's life cycle. The report discusses the JSF program and the need for competitive propulsion systems to reduce operational risk and achieve more affordable life cycle costs. The committee recommends an increase in funding for the development of the F136 interchangeable engine. The conference report on H.R. 5631 recommends additional funding for the development of the F136 engine for the Joint Strike Fighter program. The Under Secretary of Defense is directed to sponsor an independent cost analysis of the engine program, with a focus on comparing costs between the F-135 and F-136 engines. The conference report on H.R. 5631 recommends additional funding for the development of the F136 engine for the Joint Strike Fighter program. An independent cost analysis is required to compare costs between the F-135 and F-136 engines, evaluating potential savings and effects on the industrial base. The Department of Defense is directed to fully fund the development of both engines in fiscal year 2008. The House Appropriations Committee report recommends additional funding for the development of the F136 engine for the Joint Strike Fighter program. An independent cost analysis is required to compare costs between the F-135 and F-136 engines, with the Department of Defense directed to fund both engines in the fiscal year 2008 budget submission. An independent cost analysis is required to compare costs between the F-135 and F-136 engines for the Joint Strike Fighter program. The analysis will evaluate potential savings and effects on the industrial base, to be submitted to congressional defense committees by March 15, 2007. This analysis complements required studies in the National Defense Authorization Act, 2007. The Senate Appropriations Committee report on H.R. 5631 discusses the JSF program and supports the cost analysis. The Committee is disappointed that the Department of Defense did not include funding for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter 2nd Engine Source in the fiscal year 2007 budget request. They recommend an additional $170,000,000 to each of the Navy and Air Force Research, Development, Test and Evaluation accounts for competition in procuring the best value engine. The Committee directs the Department of Defense to fund the development of two propulsion system options for the Joint Strike Fighter in future budget submissions. This is in accordance with FY2008 Section 213 of H.R. 4986 / P.L. 110-181, which requires the obligation and expenditure of funds for the competitive propulsion system. H.R. 4986, a revised version of H.R. 1585, focuses on the development of a competitive propulsion system for the Joint Strike Fighter. The House Armed Services Committee report highlighted the need for funding the F136 engine as an alternative to the currently-planned F135 engine. Congressional defense committees recommended increases for the competitive propulsion system program. The House Armed Services Committee report emphasized the need for funding a competitive propulsion system for the Joint Strike Fighter, with other congressional defense committees also recommending increases for this purpose. A study was conducted on the JSF propulsion system, but the results were inconclusive. The House Armed Services Committee report highlighted the importance of funding a competitive propulsion system for the Joint Strike Fighter. Studies showed inconclusive results on the financial benefits, but identified significant non-financial factors favoring the program. The committee recommends an increase of $480.0 million for the JSF competitive propulsion system program. The committee recommends funding a competitive propulsion system for the Joint Strike Fighter program with an increase of $115.0 million in PE 64800F. A provision requires the Secretary of Defense to allocate funds for the development and procurement of the competitive propulsion system. Plans aim to complete development by fiscal year 2012 for a competition in the sixth lot of low-rate initial production aircraft. The Senate Armed Services Committee recommends funding a competitive propulsion system for the Joint Strike Fighter program, with plans to complete development by fiscal year 2012 for a competition in the sixth lot of low-rate initial production aircraft. The Senate Armed Services Committee recommends funding a competitive propulsion system for the Joint Strike Fighter program by fiscal year 2012. The budget request includes funds for the development of the JSF but not for a competitive propulsion system. The F136 engine is being developed as an alternative to the current F135 engine. A life cycle cost analysis of the JSF propulsion system, including a competitive engine program, was required by the John Warner National Defense Authorization Act. The committee has been briefed on the results of these reviews. The Senate Armed Services Committee recommends funding a competitive propulsion system for the Joint Strike Fighter program by fiscal year 2012. The committee believes that the potential benefits from non-financial factors favor continuing the JSF competitive propulsion system program and recommends an increase of $480.0 million for this purpose. The House Appropriations Committee recommended an increase of $200 million for F-35 production enhancements and $480 million for the development of an alternative engine for the aircraft in the DOD Appropriations Act. These funds are intended to improve production facilities and ensure competitive engine production. The House Appropriations Committee recommended additional funding for F-35 production enhancements and an alternative engine development. The Committee allocated $480 million for the alternative engine, despite the Department of Defense's failure to follow previous directives. The Senate Appropriations Committee report on H.R. 3222 discusses the JSF program and directs the Department of Defense to fully fund the F-136 engine development program in the fiscal year 2009 budget submission. The Committee is disappointed with the lack of funding for the alternative engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter in the fiscal year 2008 budget request, emphasizing the importance of engine competition for better performance. The F-16 Fighter program showed that engine competition resulted in a more reliable, better performing, and cost-effective engine. The Committee recommends an additional $240,000,000 for the Navy and Air Force Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation accounts to support competition for the F-35 engine. Funding for the development of both engines is directed by the Department of Defense. The House Armed Services report on the JSF program emphasized the importance of engine competition for better performance. The budget request included $1.5 billion for the development of the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program, with no funds allocated for a competitive propulsion system. Additionally, $136.9 million was designated for F-35 advance procurement in the Air Force. The committee recommended increases for the JSF competitive propulsion program in previous reports. The committee recommended increases for the JSF competitive propulsion system, but the Department of Defense did not include funds for this purpose in the budget request, despite the requirement in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008. The GAO Director of Acquisition and Sourcing Management testified about the update on the JSF propulsion system cost analysis, stating that the Department of Defense would recoup its investment costs with program savings of 9-11%. The USD (AT&L) did not update the Cost Analysis and Improvement Group's analysis for the JSF propulsion system, leading to potential long-term savings. Engine failures with the F135 engine caused delays in the first flight of the F-35 STOVL variant. The committee recommends a 30 to 60-day delay for the first flight of the F-35 STOVL variant due to F135 engine development issues. They advocate for a competitive JSF propulsion program to improve engine performance and operational readiness, proposing a $1.8 billion increase in funding for the program. The committee recommends a $1.8 billion increase in funding for the competitive JSF propulsion program, including $167.9 million for advance procurement of long-lead components. They urge the Department of Defense to continue development and procurement of a competitive JSF propulsion system in the fiscal year 2010 budget request. The committee recommends a $35.0 million increase in funding for long lead items for the F-136 engine in the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, following Congress's directive for competitive propulsion system development. The budget request includes $1,532.7 million for PE 64800N and $1,524.0 million for PE 64800F for the JSF program. The committee recommends increasing funding for the competitive propulsion system for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, in line with Congress's directive. This includes adding $215.0 million each to PE 64800N and PE 64800F for the development of the F-35 JSF competitive propulsion system. The budget request for the JSF program includes $1,524.0 million in PE 64800F. Congress has allocated $820.0 million to fund the F136 engine for the JSF program, ensuring fair competition for propulsion systems. The Department of Defense froze the technology baseline of the F135 engine, prompting the need for investment in both engines to incorporate the latest technology. The committee recommends exploring new composite materials for the F135 engine to potentially reduce life cycle costs. The committee recommends an increase of $35.0 million for F135 engine technology development to maintain a level playing field with the $430.0 million increase for the F-136 engine. The FY2009 DOD Appropriations Act includes funding for the continued development of the F-136 engine within the Joint Strike Fighter program. The committee recommends an increase of $35.0 million for F135 engine technology development to maintain a level playing field with the $430.0 million increase for the F-136 engine. The FY2009 DOD Appropriations Act includes funding for the continued development of the F-136 engine within the Joint Strike Fighter program.

It authorizes an increase of $430 million in RDT&E for the Navy and Air Force for continued F136 engine development, along with $130 million in Aircraft Procurement, Air Force, for F136 engine procurement. H.R. 2647 contains two sections relating directly to the F-35 alternate program: Section 218, which limits the obligation of FY2010 F-35 research and development funds until certain conditions (including one related to the alternate engine program) are met, and Section 242, which concerns the alternate engine program. Section 218 of the House bill limits the obligation of FY2010 F-35 research and development funds until certain conditions, including the certification of funds for a competitive propulsion system. The report required by the Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009 is to be submitted to the congressional defense committees. The Secretary of Defense must also submit the annual plan and certification for fiscal year 2010. Section 242 emphasizes the need for sufficient funding for the development and procurement of a competitive propulsion system for the F-35 Lightning II in the annual budget request and future-years defense program. The Secretary of Defense is required to request funding for the development and procurement of a competitive propulsion system for the F-35 Lightning II in the annual budget submissions. This includes ensuring sufficient funding in future-years defense programs for the continued development and procurement of the propulsion system. The Secretary of Defense must ensure funding for the competitive propulsion system for the F-35 Lightning II in annual budget submissions, with continued development and procurement of two options for the propulsion system to ensure competitive production. The House report recommends funding for the competitive F-35 propulsion system, specifically the F136 engine as an alternative to the F135 engine. The committee has consistently recommended increases for the competitive propulsion system in annual defense authorization acts. The committee is disappointed with the Department of Defense for not including funds for the competitive propulsion system for the F-35 in the budget request, despite the requirement in Public Law 110-181. The F135 engine development program has experienced cost growth, increasing from $4.828 billion to $6.7 billion in then-year dollars by the end of 2008. The F-35 program manager reported a 38-43% increase in F135 engine procurement costs between 2005 and 2008. The F135 engine for the F-35B saw a 47% cost increase due to the lift fan. In contrast, the F136 engine program did not experience any cost growth. The F136 contracts remained stable at $411 million for pre-EMD and $2.486 billion for EMD. The committee is concerned about the Department's decision not to include an F-35 competitive propulsion system program in its budget requests despite F135 cost increases and test failures. They believe that a two-engine competitive program would offer better engine performance, improved contractor responsiveness, a more robust industrial base, increased engine reliability, and improved operational readiness. The committee recommends a total increase of $463.0 million for the continued development of the competitive F-35 propulsion system program. The committee recommends a total increase of $463.0 million for the F-35 propulsion system program, including procurement of four F136 engines and spare parts. The Administration objects to the addition of $603 million for the alternative engine program, which may delay the fielding of the Joint Strike Fighter. The Administration objects to provisions in the bill that mandate an alternative engine program for the JSF, stating that the current engine is performing well and expenditures on a second engine are unnecessary. They also disagree with the limit on overall JSF development funding until all funds for the alternative engine program are obligated, warning that any disruption to the F-35 program would be serious. The FY2010 defense authorization bill (S. 1390) recommends a net increase in funding for the F-35 program, including an increase for the F136 alternate engine and a reduction in excess management reserves. The President's senior advisors would recommend a veto if the final bill disrupts the F-35 program. Section 211 of S. 1390 requires the Department of Defense to obligate funds for the continued development of a competitive propulsion system for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft program. The committee's report recommends ensuring sufficient funds for the F136 engine. The committee recommends ensuring sufficient funds for the continued development of the F136 competitive propulsion system for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft program, with plans to complete development by fiscal year 2012. The committee recommends increasing funding by $438.9 million for the development of the F136 competitive propulsion system for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft program, citing non-financial benefits such as better engine performance, improved contractor responsiveness, and increased operational readiness. The committee recommended increasing funding by $438.9 million for the development of the F136 competitive propulsion system for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft program. The recommendation was approved in full-committee markup with a vote of 12-10. The Administration strongly objected to the additional funding for the alternative engine program. The Administration objects to provisions mandating an alternative engine program for the JSF, citing the current engine's successful performance and manageable risks of a single engine provider. They argue that expenditures on a second engine are unnecessary and impede JSF progress. Additionally, they object to a limit on overall JSF development funding until a certification is submitted. If the final bill disrupts the F-35 program, the President's senior advisors will intervene. The Senate rejected an amendment to preserve additional funding for an alternate engine program in the F-35 program. Another amendment was adopted to remove the added funding and prohibit spending on the alternate program until certification is submitted. The Senate rejected an amendment to preserve additional funding for an alternate engine program in the F-35 program. S.Amdt. 1767 would have prohibited spending on the alternate program until certification is submitted by the Secretary of Defense. The Senate rejected an amendment to preserve funding for the alternate engine program in the F-35 program. The amendment aimed to limit spending on the alternate program until certification is submitted by the Secretary of Defense. The Senate rejected an amendment to preserve funding for the alternate engine program in the F-35 program until the Secretary of Defense certifies sufficient funds for the competitive propulsion system. Additionally, $282.9 million is allocated for UH-1Y/AH-1Z rotary wing aircraft procurement, and $78 million is added for F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program management reserves. The Navy and Air Force's funding for the Joint Strike Fighter program is increased by $78 million each for management reserves. Additionally, the Air Force's aircraft procurement budget is decreased by $438.9 million for the HC/MC-130 recapitalization program. S.Amdt. 1627 aims to eliminate language prohibiting DOD from obligating funds. The Senate Armed Services Committee's Sec. 211 prohibits DOD from using more than 90% of FY2010 F-35 research funds until a certification is provided for competitive propulsion system development. It also prohibits funding for an alternate engine program until cost-effectiveness certifications are made. Additional funding for the alternate engine program is eliminated, and reductions to the UH-1Y/AH-1Z helicopter program and F-35 program management reserves are restored. The Senate Armed Services Committee's Sec. 211 limits funds for an alternate propulsion system for the F-35 program until certification is provided. Additional funding for the alternate engine program is eliminated, with reductions to the UH-1Y/AH-1Z helicopter program and F-35 program management reserves restored. The Senate Armed Services Committee limits funds for an alternate propulsion system for the F-35 program until certification is provided. Additional funding for the alternate engine program is eliminated, with reductions to the UH-1Y/AH-1Z helicopter program and F-35 program management reserves restored. The amount authorized for the Navy and Air Force Joint Strike Fighter programs is increased by $78 million each for management reserves. Offsets include a decrease of $219.45 million for the Navy Joint Strike Fighter F136 development. The Navy and Air Force Joint Strike Fighter programs are increased by $78 million each for management reserves, while there is a decrease of $219.45 million for the Navy Joint Strike Fighter F136 development. The explanatory statement for Division A of H.R. 3326 explains the appropriations for the Department of Defense for fiscal year 2010. It allocated $2,083.8 million for Air Force F-35 procurement, including $35 million for the F-35 alternate engine program. Additionally, Air Force research and development funding for the Joint Strike Fighter program received $2.073.1 million, with $215 million designated for the F-35 alternate engine program. The explanatory statement allocated $1,956.3 million for Navy research and development funding for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, including an additional $215 million for the alternate engine program. Concerns persist about cost growth and schedule issues in the program. The JSF procurement program is on track to achieve cost and schedule goals, receiving $6,840,478,000 as a congressional special interest item. The Secretary of Defense must ensure all 30 aircraft are procured as requested. The Under Secretary of Defense is directed to provide findings on test program and cost growth to congressional defense committees by January 15, 2010. The House Appropriations Committee recommends a net increase of $18.6 million for Air Force procurement funding for the F-35 program. The report highlights increases in funding for the F-35 alternate engine in Navy and Air Force research and development. The Committee aims to reverse the trend of terminating programs prematurely and supports realistic budgeting matching available funding to programs. The Committee opposes terminating programs prematurely and sees potential payback in continuing efforts like the presidential helicopter, Joint Strike Fighter alternate engine, and missile defense activities. The F-35 Lightning II program is crucial for tactical aviation, with plans to procure over 2,500 stealthy aircraft. The Committee is concerned about the F-35 aircraft all being powered by the same propulsion engine, which could pose logistical and operational challenges. They worry that any technical problems with the engine could ground the entire fleet, limiting flexibility in times of crisis. Additionally, the lack of competition in the Joint Strike Fighter engine program is seen as a missed opportunity for cost savings with over 2,500 aircraft planned for the program. The Committee recommends funding for the development of an alternate engine for the Joint Strike Fighter to introduce competition and potentially save costs. Despite initial costs, a dual source strategy is deemed more cost-effective in the long run. The Committee recommends funding for the development of an alternate engine for the Joint Strike Fighter to introduce competition and potentially save costs. An additional $560 million is allocated for the alternate engine program, despite objections from the Administration. Expenditures on an alternate engine for the JSF are deemed unnecessary and divert resources from the overall program. The risks of a single engine provider are manageable, and the Senate Appropriations Committee recommends no funding for F-35 alternate engine development. The FY2011 Defense Authorization Act included $485 million for an alternate F-35 engine, with a provision limiting DOD spending until all funds are obligated. The FY2011 Defense Authorization Act included a provision limiting DOD spending on the F-35 Lightning II aircraft program until all funds for a competitive propulsion system have been obligated. Additionally, the bill requires certification from the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics before more than 30 F-35 aircraft can be acquired. The FY2011 Defense Authorization Act limits DOD spending on the F-35 Lightning II aircraft program until all funds for a competitive propulsion system are obligated. Certification from the Under Secretary of Defense is required before acquiring more than 30 F-35 aircraft. H.R. 5136 requires funds for F136 engine procurement to be obligated or reprogrammed, mandates testing of six F136 engines, and completion of 1,000 test hours. The Secretary of Defense must include alternate engine funding in DOD's annual budget submission for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft. The Secretary of Defense is required to include funding for a competitive propulsion system for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft in the annual budget submission, as well as in future-years defense programs. The Secretary of Defense must ensure funding for two propulsion system options for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft in each fiscal year to support competitive production. The Secretary of Defense must ensure funding for two propulsion system options for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft in each fiscal year to support competitive production. H.R. 5136 designates the competitive F-35 engine programs as major subprograms, imposing more stringent oversight and reporting requirements. The F135 and F136 engine development and procurement programs are designated as major subprograms. The engine development and procurement programs for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft are designated as major subprograms, with the F135 and F136 engines specified. The Secretary will use the Milestone B decision as the original baseline for reporting requirements. If necessary, the program may be restructured following critical cost growth. The Secretary restructures the F-35 Lightning II aircraft program and the F135 and F136 engine development programs in compliance with section 2433a of title 10, United States Code. This action fulfills the requirements for designated major subprograms. The Secretary of Defense must reassess and take action for the F-35 alternate engine program as a major subprogram. Any increase in program acquisition unit cost beyond the critical cost growth threshold will require further actions. The budget request includes funding for the development of the F-35 aircraft. The budget request includes $7.7 billion for procurement of F-35 aircraft but no funds for a competitive F-35 propulsion system. The committee has recommended increases for the F-35 competitive propulsion system for the past four years, despite Congress appropriating funds for this purpose. The committee is disappointed that the Department of Defense has not included funds for a competitive propulsion system for the F-35 in the budget request for the fifth consecutive year. Cost increases in the F135 development program and procurement of F135 engines have been noted. The Government Accountability Office reported a 50 percent increase in F135 engine development costs, with the negotiated price for the F-35B engine and lift fan being 21 percent higher than the budget. The negotiated price for the F-35B engine and lift fan was 21 percent higher than the budget estimate, and the negotiated unit cost for the F-35A engine was 42 percent higher than budgeted. The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics directed a review of the F135 cost structure due to cost increases in fiscal year 2009. The Joint Assessment Team concluded that engine contractor improvement plans were credible but challenging, requiring additional investment for cost reduction initiatives. An update on the competitive engine program noted that an investment of $2.9 billion over six years would be needed to finish F136 engine development. The committee is puzzled by the Department's decisions to not include an F-35 competitive propulsion system program in its budget requests despite the long-term cost benefits. They believe that a two-engine competitive program would offer better engine performance, improved contractor responsiveness, a more robust industrial base, increased engine reliability, and improved operational readiness for the F-35. The committee recommends a $485.0 million increase for the F-35 competitive engine program due to concerns over cost and schedule performance. Independent reviews highlighted delays and increased costs in the F-35 development program. JET 2 and IMRT reviews highlighted delays and increased costs in the F-35 development program. To mitigate risks, the Department of Defense plans to procure additional test aircraft, adjust production rates, and increase budget allocations. These actions are expected to delay completion by 13 months and cost $2.8 billion more. The Secretary of the Air Force reported to the committee that the F-35 program will exceed cost thresholds by over 50% compared to the original estimate. The Under Secretary of Defense described the program as having unprecedented concurrency of development, test, and production activities. The Director of Operational Test and Evaluation highlighted issues with late delivery of test aircraft and failure to adjust system development and test plans. The Department of Defense plans to procure 307 aircraft at a cost of $58.2 billion before completing developmental flight testing by mid-fiscal year 2015. Despite findings and continued concurrency in research and development, the request for 43 F-35 aircraft for fiscal year 2011 remains the same as projected in fiscal year 2009. The committee remains concerned about the F-35 production ramp rate being too high and recommends authorization of the budget request for 42 aircraft for fiscal year 2011, subject to completion of certain milestones. The committee recommends a provision requiring certification of certain milestones before procurement of more than 30 F-35 aircraft. The Administration objects to adding $485 million for the extra engine program and legislative provisions limiting JSF development funding. The Future Years Defense Plan includes funding for the F135 and F136 engine development programs. Despite additional funding from Congress, the extra engine would still need $2.4 billion more to be viable for the JSF program. The Department does not believe this cost will be recovered through competition and should not be diverted from other defense needs. The current engine has performed well with over 13,000 ground test and 200 flight test hours. If the final bill includes funding for the extra engine program, the President's advisors would recommend a veto. The committee recommends a provision that would require the Secretary of Defense to certify that development of the alternate propulsion system for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program will reduce costs, improve operational readiness, and not disrupt the program before spending additional funds on the F136 engine. The Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act For Fiscal Year 2011 did not specify funding for the F-35 alternate engine. The House and Senate Armed Services Committees designated an F-35 engine development and production subprogram as a major subprogram of the F-35 Lightning II aircraft. The Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act For Fiscal Year 2011 did not specify funding for the F-35 alternate engine. The House and Senate Armed Services Committees designated an F-35 engine development and production subprogram as a major subprogram of the F-35 Lightning II aircraft. The Secretary shall use the Milestone B decision as the original baseline for reporting requirements. Actions may be taken following critical cost growth in the F-35 engine development and procurement program. The F-35 engine development and procurement program is designated as a major subprogram under the Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act For Fiscal Year 2011. Actions taken in accordance with this designation will meet the requirements of section 2433a of title 10, United States Code. The FY2011 Defense Appropriations Act included $450 million for the F-35 alternate engine, added by a vote of 11-5. The Senate version had no funds for the program, but commented favorably on it. The House and Senate passed a continuing resolution maintaining spending at FY2010 levels, including funding for the alternate engine program. However, on February 16, 2011, the House approved an amendment to eliminate $450 million for the program. The FY2011 DOD and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act signed into law on April 15, 2011, provided DOD funding for the remainder of FY2011 with no funds allocated for the F-35 alternate engine program. The F-35 alternate engine program may have been influenced by the \"Great Engine War\" between Pratt & Whitney and General Electric from 1984 to 1994. The competition was for engines for Air Force F-16 fighters, with Pratt & Whitney's F100 and General Electric's F110. Congress funded the Engine Model Derivative Program (EMDP) after Air Force concerns about using a single engine type for their fighter fleet. In 1979, Congress funded the Engine Model Derivative Program (EMDP) for General Electric to develop the F101 engine (later F110) as an alternate engine for the F-16. Over $376 million was spent on the F110 to compete with the F100, while $600 million was used to enhance the F100's durability. The use of annual engine competitions for aircraft procurement was controversial, with some believing it improved contractor responsiveness. The Great Engine War competition between General Electric and Pratt & Whitney for annual production and support work resulted in benefits for the DOD, including better contract terms, warranties, and engine improvements. The competition was managed with requirements for cost projections and dual sourcing data. The contractors in the Great Engine War competition were required to provide cost projections and dual sourcing data for operations and support.
