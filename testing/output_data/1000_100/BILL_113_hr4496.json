    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Covering People With Pre-Existing Conditions Act of 2014\" and establishes universal access programs to improve high-risk pools and reinsurance markets for individuals with pre-existing conditions. Each State must operate a qualified State reinsurance program or a qualifying State high-risk pool by January 1, 2015, funded by State premium assessments not used on State health care programs. States not operating a qualified high-risk pool must establish a qualified State reinsurance program to meet requirements, treated as a high-risk pool for Public Health Service Act purposes. States operating a current high-risk pool must transition to a qualified State reinsurance program using premium assessment funds. A qualified State reinsurance program operated by a State provides reinsurance for health insurance coverage in the small group market. If the program is in strong fiscal health, the requirements are deemed met. A qualified State reinsurance program can provide reinsurance on a prospective or retrospective basis, protecting health insurance issuers against annual aggregate spending and catastrophic costs. It is deemed a qualified high-risk pool for HIPAA requirements. A qualifying State high-risk pool must provide at least two coverage options. The high-risk pool must offer two coverage options, including a high deductible health plan with a health savings account. It must have stable funding, eliminate waiting lists, cover individuals waiting for Medicare, and limit premiums to 150% of the average. The high-risk pool must offer coverage for preventive services, disease management, and education outreach initiatives. Only citizens and nationals of the United States are eligible to participate in the pool. As a condition for receiving funds, States must certify that applicants for coverage in the high-risk pool provide documentation of citizenship or nationality. The Secretary will maintain records to verify citizenship only once per individual. Starting January 1, 2015, a pool must meet specific criteria to qualify as a high-risk pool under the Public Health Service Act. The Public Health Service Act allows for waivers to accommodate new programs. Funding of $15 billion for 2015-2024 and an additional $10 billion for 2020-2024 is appropriated. Definitions for health insurance coverage and issuer are provided in this section. The terms \"health insurance coverage\" and \"health insurance issuer\" are defined in section 2791 of the Public Health Service Act. The term \"current section 2745 qualified high risk pool\" refers to the qualified high risk pool under section 2745(g) of the Public Health Service Act. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The term \"standard risk rate\" is a rate determined under the State high risk pool by considering premium rates charged by other health insurers. The term \"State\" refers to any of the 50 States or the District of Columbia. It is established using reasonable actuarial techniques and reflects anticipated claims experience and expenses for the coverage involved."
