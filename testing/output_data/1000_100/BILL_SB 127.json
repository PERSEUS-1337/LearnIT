    "title": "SB 127",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature acknowledges the disproportionate impact of drought on areas heavily reliant on groundwater. While state programs assist communities with water needs, individual homeowners with groundwater wells lack financial aid for essential water improvements. The program created by this act aims to provide low-interest loans and grants to individual homeowners for improving drinking water and wastewater treatment, including digging deeper wells, addressing contaminants, and connecting to local systems. Chapter 6.6 of the Water Code establishes a program for local agencies to receive funding for these purposes. The program created by this act provides low-interest loans and grants to homeowners for improving drinking water and wastewater treatment. This includes connecting to local systems, addressing contaminants, and deepening wells. The Water Code allows local agencies to receive funding for these purposes. The board may adopt regulations to carry out the chapter's purposes. The Water and Wastewater Loan and Grant Fund is established in the State Treasury for expenditure by the board. Moneys deposited include repayments from grants or loans and interest earned. Eligible loan applicants must have a household income below the statewide median and own the residence. Loan applicants must have an ownership interest in the residence, be unable to obtain financial assistance from private lenders, demonstrate an ability to repay the loan, and secure the loan with a mortgage on the residence. The loan must be repaid within 20 years with an interest rate not exceeding 1 percent. Homeowner's insurance on the residence is required while the loan balance is outstanding. The board may contract with a private financial institution to provide loans for eligible applicants with low household income. Grant recipients must repay the grant amount if they sell the residence within five years or return any unused funds. Ten million dollars ($10,000,000) is transferred from the General Fund to the Water and Wastewater Loan and Grant Fund. This act is an urgency statute for providing eligible households with access to safer drinking water and wastewater treatment during California's drought. Section 21168.6.7 of the Public Resources Code defines a \"water project\" as one funded by bonds from the Water Quality, Supply and Infrastructure Improvement Act of 2014. The procedures outlined in this section apply to legal actions challenging the certification of environmental impact reports or approvals for water projects. The Judicial Council must establish procedures for resolving legal actions challenging the certification of environmental impact reports for water projects within 270 days. Environmental impact reports for water projects must include a notice in at least 12-point type. The EIR is subject to Section 21168.6.7 of the Public Resources Code, which states that the lead agency is not required to consider comments filed after the public comment period. Any legal challenge to the EIR or project approval must follow procedures outlined in the Public Resources Code. The draft and final EIR must include the full text of this section as an appendix. Within 10 days of releasing the draft EIR, the lead agency must conduct an informational workshop for the public. Within 10 days before the close of the public comment period, a public hearing must be held by the lead agency to receive testimony on the draft environmental impact report. A transcript of the hearing will be included in the final environmental impact report. Within five days after the public comment period ends, a commenter may request nonbinding mediation. The mediation involving the lead agency, applicant, and commenters must be completed within 35 days after the comment period closes. The lead agency must select retired judges or experts with experience in land use or environmental law for mediation. The applicant covers the costs, and any agreed-upon measures must be adopted as a condition of approval. Written comments after the public comment period are not considered unless they address specific issues. The lead agency must select retired judges or experts with experience in land use or environmental law for mediation, with costs covered by the applicant. Written comments after the public comment period are not considered unless they address specific issues. New issues raised in response to comments, new information released by the public agency, changes made to the project post-public comment period, proposed conditions for approval, mitigation measures, or new information not reasonably known during the public comment period are all factors to be considered. The lead agency must file the required notice within five days of the last project approval. The agency must prepare and certify the record of proceedings, with costs covered by the applicant. The lead agency must make the draft environmental impact report and related documents available to the public in an electronic format within three business days of its release. Any additional documents submitted after the draft report must also be accessible within five business days. The lead agency is required to make the draft environmental impact report and related documents available in an electronic format within three business days of release. Copyright protected documents not prepared specifically for the project do not need to be electronically accessible, but an index of these documents must be available electronically. Written comments on the project should be submitted in an electronic format and made accessible to the public within five days. Within seven business days, the lead agency must convert any non-electronic comments into an electronic format and make them available to the public. Comments not considered by the lead agency do not need to be included in the record of proceedings. Within five days of filing the required notice, the lead agency must certify and provide an electronic copy of the proceedings record to a party upon request. A reasonable fee may be charged for the copy. Within 10 days of receiving a complaint or petition, the lead agency must lodge a copy of the certified record with the superior court. Any disputes over the record content will be resolved by the superior court, with parties required to file a motion to augment the record if necessary. In granting relief in an action brought under this division, the court shall not stay construction of a water project unless there is an imminent threat to public health or safety, or important Native American artifacts or historical values would be adversely affected. The court will only enjoin specific activities of a water project if they pose a threat to public health, Native American artifacts, or historical values. Any challenge to a project approval must follow certain requirements. No reimbursement is needed for this act as local agencies can cover the mandated costs."
