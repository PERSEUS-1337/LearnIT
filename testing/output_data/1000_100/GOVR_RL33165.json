    "content": "The electric utility industry is a major source of air pollution, including sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, mercury, and carbon dioxide. The EPA released an analysis comparing different approaches to controlling this pollution, focusing on market-oriented mechanisms for cost-effective solutions. The Administration's \"Clear Skies\" proposal is compared to more stringent bills introduced by Senators Jeffords and Carper. The Administration initially resisted conducting the study due to cost and difficulty but eventually relented. The Clear Skies bill (S. 131) failed to advance in March 2005 after a tie vote in the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. Concerns were raised about the lack of analysis comparing its provisions to other Senate bills. EPA Administrator Stephen Johnson promised to conduct a cost-benefit analysis, which has now been released. Electric utility generating facilities are a major source of air pollution due to the combustion of fossil fuels. Electric utility generating facilities emit gases that pose risks to human health and welfare, including PM, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and mercury. While PM, SO2, and NOx are regulated under the Clean Air Act, CO2 emissions, which contribute to global warming, are unregulated and have been rising. In 2003, fossil-fuel-fired electric generating plants accounted for significant emissions of SO2, NOx, and CO2. Mercury emissions from utility facilities are uncertain. Emissions from U.S. fossil-fuel electric generating plants, including PM, SO2, NOx, and Hg, are a significant concern. Controls have evolved over time to address these pollutants, with additional measures underway. The United States has agreed to voluntary limits on CO2 emissions under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. The United States agreed to voluntary limits on CO2 emissions, rejecting the mandatory limits of the Kyoto Protocol. The Senate passed a resolution in 2005 calling for mandatory controls on greenhouse gases. Efforts are being made to simplify the air quality control regime with a \"multi-pollutant\" approach targeting SO2, NOx, Hg, and CO2 emissions from utility plants. The goal is to balance effective environmental controls with industry stability. The industry aims for a stable regulatory regime with recent rules like CAIR, CAMR, and CAVR focusing on reducing emissions of SO2, NOx, and Hg. Further reductions in NOx and SO2 emissions are needed due to new ambient air quality standards. Mercury emissions are also a concern with 44 states issuing fish advisories. Mercury emissions from power plants are a major concern, with 44 states issuing fish consumption advisories. Legislation addressing power plant pollution in a comprehensive manner could achieve health and environmental goals more effectively. Six bills in the 109th Congress propose multi-pollutant controls on utilities, including SO2, NOx, and Hg emissions. Legislation in the 109th Congress aims to control power plant emissions through a system of tradeable allowances, including caps on CO2 emissions. The bills propose 70%-90% reductions in NOx, SO2, and mercury emissions by 2018, with the Clear Skies bill being the least stringent. The debate focuses on the stringency of the caps, the timeline for reductions, and whether carbon dioxide should be included in the emissions subject to a cap. The 109th Congress aims to control power plant emissions through tradeable allowances, proposing 70%-90% reductions in NOx, SO2, and mercury emissions by 2018. However, due to banking provisions, actual reductions may be delayed until 2026 or later. The use of overcompliance in early years could lead to large holdings of banked emission allowances, delaying the achievement of emissions caps. The Jeffords and Carper bills propose earlier and more stringent emissions caps, allowing banking and trading of allowances. Clear Skies does not regulate CO2 emissions, leading to different compliance strategies. EPA's cost-benefit analysis compared options including Clear Skies and Senator Carper's Clean Air Planning Act. The analysis compared the Clear Skies, Carper, and Jeffords options for emissions regulation, with little difference between them. The EPA's baseline assumes no additional action on emissions beyond rules finalized by mid-2004. The EPA's baseline for emissions regulation assumes no additional action beyond rules finalized by mid-2004, despite three recently finalized rules by EPA on SO2, NOx, and Hg. The inclusion of these rules as a \"sixth proposal\" is questioned, as they are already finalized. The uncertainty surrounding these rules and others is compared to the uncertainty of specific provisions in multi-pollutant legislation. The 109th Congress or later versions may change deadlines in the 2003 proposal. The Managers' Mark is evolving and subject to change. Regulations supporting passed legislation face uncertainties and delays. EPA's cost analysis focuses on Electric Demand Price Elasticity and Short-term Construction Constraints. EPA analyzes scenarios related to electricity demand growth, natural gas supply, and construction constraints in response to increasing electricity prices. EPA developed four scenarios based on these parameters. EPA developed four scenarios based on parameters related to electricity demand growth, natural gas supply, and construction constraints in response to increasing electricity prices. The scenarios include different assumptions such as price elasticity, construction constraints, and demand growth. The report uses EPA's Demand Response Scenario as the benchmark analysis. The EPA's Demand Response Scenario is chosen as the benchmark analysis, incorporating short-term demand response function and electricity price elasticities within the literature's suggested range. The decision to include this refinement in only one scenario is unclear, but CRS followed EPA's choice. Other assumptions in the Demand Response Scenario, such as boilermaker labor, are debatable. The EPA assumes limited boilermaker labor for constructing SO2 and NOx control equipment until 2010, with unlimited labor available thereafter. This assumption has been questioned by the Institute of Clean Air Companies (ICAC), who found no constraint on construction even if the deadline was moved to 2010. The air pollution control industry has shown the ability to install significant amounts of equipment in short periods of time. The air pollution control industry has demonstrated the ability to install significant amounts of equipment quickly, including SCRs for NOx SIP call and installations in Germany and Japan. Resources for projected installations under IAQR will not be limiting, with factors like modular construction methods reducing demand for union boilermakers. Additional boilermaker labor can be sourced from Canadian union and other labor pools if needed. The air pollution control industry has the capacity to carry out projected IAQR and control installations for 2010 and 2015. Limited boilermaker availability only affects certain scenarios, but it is more important to include a demand elasticity function in the analysis. The analysis prioritizes including a demand elasticity function over removing a questionable feasibility constraint. EPA's demand response scenario is chosen as the base case, with a focus on future natural gas supply and the importance of sensitivity analysis for cost estimates. EPA's natural gas supply curves project more availability at lower prices compared to EIA's curves, with the EIA scenario potentially being more representative of future supplies. The analysis uses the Demand Response Scenario as the basis for discussion, highlighting the lower costs of the Clear Skies bill compared to other options. Clear Skies has minimal costs and benefits, with less stringent requirements and later deadlines, resulting in significant cost differences in the early years. The Clear Skies bill has weaker provisions for Hg and no provisions for CO2 compared to other bills. It aims to revamp the Clean Air Act with cost-effective measures but offers lower benefits than the Carper and Jeffords bills. In 2010, Clear Skies would provide $6 billion in annual benefits, while Carper and Jeffords bills offer $51 billion and $83 billion respectively. By 2020, Clear Skies benefits almost merge with baseline increases, lagging behind the other bills which have higher benefits. The Clear Skies bill has less stringent pollution caps and a more relaxed implementation schedule compared to the Carper and Jeffords bills. When adjusting for current Clean Air Act requirements, Clear Skies has minimal additional costs and benefits. This suggests that EPA has successfully integrated Clear Skies' market-based regulatory scheme into new regulations, but opponents argue that current law requirements are just as effective. Senator Jeffords' bill, S. 150, shows the greatest benefits compared to other proposals. In 2010, its benefits would be $83 billion annually, $32 billion more than the Carper bill, and 14 times more than Clear Skies. In 2020, its benefits continue to exceed others, estimated at $66 billion annually, three-and-a-half times more than the Carper bill and 22 times more than Clear Skies. EPA's cost and benefit estimates for S. 150 are the highest among the proposals. The Jeffords bill, S. 150, is the most costly and suffers from short-term construction constraints imposed by EPA. It would reduce coal production and coal-fired electric generation by about 40%, leading to a shift towards renewable sources and additional oil- and gas-fired capacity. The bill would require vast numbers of natural-gas-fired and renewable fuel generators at great cost. The net benefits of S. 150 exceed those of Clear Skies and S. 843 (Carper), with lower costs and higher benefits compared to Clear Skies. S. 843 aims for substantial emission reductions beyond the Clean Air Act, with a phased-in schedule to mitigate short-term price increases. It also includes a flexible CO2 requirement to reduce carbon dioxide emissions at a nominal cost. The EPA conducted sensitivity analyses on various bills to reduce carbon dioxide emissions at a nominal cost. Three key variables examined were price elasticity, short-term construction constraints, and electricity growth with constrained natural gas supply. Different scenarios were analyzed, including a No Construction Constraint Scenario and EPA Base Case Scenario. The EPA conducted sensitivity analyses on bills to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, considering price elasticity, construction constraints, and electricity growth with constrained natural gas supply. Different scenarios were analyzed, including No Construction Constraint Scenario and Higher Electricity Growth and Natural Gas Scenario. The No Construction Constraint Scenario removes short-term construction constraints but includes zero demand price elasticity assumption, impacting costs significantly for S. 150. The removal of any price elasticity in S. 150 leads to significant cost increases in both short and long-term scenarios. The EPA Base Case Scenario shows a 63% increase in 2010 and a 147% increase in 2020 compared to the benchmark analysis. This highlights the impact of zero price elasticity on the costs of S. 150. The removal of price elasticity in S. 843 leads to an 86% higher cost estimate in 2010 compared to the benchmark analysis. This suggests that demand response and short-term construction constraints heavily influence EPA's cost estimates for S. 843. The Higher Electricity Growth and Natural Gas Scenario maintains the short-term construction constraint assumption and removes demand price elasticity, resulting in significant cost implications. The combination of zero demand response, higher electricity growth, and tighter natural gas supply leads to increased costs, especially for S. 150. The impact is most significant for S. 150 in 2020 due to the lack of demand price elasticity. The sensitivity analysis is limited, and a more comprehensive assessment of future natural gas availability is needed for multi-pollutant legislation. EPA's assumption of zero demand price elasticity greatly affects the short and long-term costs of S. 150. The impact of zero demand price elasticity on cost estimates for S. 150 is significant, especially when combined with higher electricity growth and natural gas assumptions. EPA's assumptions have a notable effect on S. 843 in the short term but decrease over time due to S. 843's less aggressive timeframe. However, EPA's assumptions have little impact on the Managers' Mark cost estimates. The Managers' Mark has minimal economic impact compared to existing laws and regulations. Two bills analyzed by EPA, S. 150 and S. 843, aim to reduce carbon dioxide emissions with different caps and schedules. S. 843 has lower costs for CO2 allowances compared to S. 150 due to its more modest reduction requirements and slower schedule. The reduction requirements and schedule of S. 150 are more in line with the Kyoto Protocol than S. 843. EPA estimates the cost of carbon dioxide reduction for S. 150 to be $19 per metric ton in 2010 and $33 per metric ton in 2020, similar to current EU prices. EPA did not develop new data on control technologies due to time constraints. The analysis of CAIR and CAMR rules in 2005 used outdated cost data from 2003, leading to potential overestimation of mercury emission control costs. The air pollution control industry states that the cost of activated carbon injection controls is now significantly lower than in 2003. EPA's analysis of S. 150 suggests that 40% of coal-fired plants may shut down by 2010, with benefits outweighing costs. The reanalysis of data shows significant benefits outweighing costs for S. 150 and S. 843, particularly in reducing emissions of SO2 and fine particles. The benefits mainly involve human health effects, such as reduced mortality. Environmental benefits from reducing SO2 emissions, which cause acid deposition and harm aquatic life, were not monetized but are significant. Reductions in SO2 emissions could have significant environmental benefits, including the formation of regional haze and mercury deposition leading to fish consumption advisories. The analysis did not monetize these environmental benefits, especially for S. 150 and S. 843 with aggressive control schemes. Additionally, the analysis did not model mercury health effects, which could have significant economic impacts. The analysis did not estimate the benefits of controlling CO2 emissions, which may be a significant omission in evaluating the Jeffords and Carper bills. EPA's analysis found little cost and a small benefit associated with the Clear Skies legislation after adjusting for its caps. The Jeffords and Carper bills set more stringent standards. The Jeffords and Carper bills set more stringent standards than the promulgated rules, with benefits outweighing additional costs. Carbon dioxide reduction costs vary based on proposed reductions, while mercury control costs depend on data timeliness. EPA's analysis is limited and incomplete, favoring Clear Skies over alternatives with stricter standards. The analysis of ClearSkies alternatives favors them by overstating Hg control costs and penalizing short-term pollution reduction schedules due to constraints on labor availability. It fails to consider the impact of natural gas price volatility on implementation strategies and costs, based on outdated 2003 assumptions. This outdated analysis may no longer contribute substantially to congressional debate."
