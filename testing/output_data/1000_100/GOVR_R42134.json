    "content": "Risk adjustment is the process of adjusting payments to health insurance plans based on the risk characteristics of enrollees. For example, payments can be adjusted to reflect higher costs for women compared to men, ensuring insurers are not financially incentivized to enroll one gender over the other. Insurers should be indifferent between enrolling men or women into their plan as health care costs vary by more than just gender. Risk adjustment models consider factors like age, geography, health status, and tobacco use. However, these models do not fully explain differences in health care spending. The report discusses how CMS pays private health plans under Medicare Advantage, how payments are risk-adjusted, and how risk scores for MA enrollees are generated and change over time. It also addresses CMS audits of risk-adjusted MA payments and potential issues with risk adjustment. Medicare Advantage provides private plan options for Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in Parts A and B. Health plans receive capitated monthly payments adjusted for demographics and health status of enrollees. Plans are at-risk if costs exceed payments, but can retain savings if costs are lower. Payments are based on each plan's estimated cost relative to the maximum government payment. The Medicare Advantage program provides private plan options for beneficiaries enrolled in Parts A and B. Health plans receive monthly payments based on their bids compared to a benchmark set by the federal government. The bids include administrative costs and profit, and plans may receive a base rate equal to the benchmark or their bid. Payments are adjusted based on the characteristics of enrollees, such as age and health status. The current MA risk adjustment methodology adjusts payments to plans based on demographic, health history, and other factors identified in a base year. CMS estimates next year's health care expenditures using beneficiary demographic and health factors. Health care expenditures vary by age, gender, Medicaid eligibility, and disability, which are incorporated into payments. CMS also considers how a beneficiary became eligible for Medicare. The CMS uses administrative data to determine Medicare eligibility and incorporates health status into payments using ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes. The codes are mapped into diagnostic groups and condition categories, which have a hierarchy imposed on them. The CMS uses ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes to determine Medicare eligibility and incorporate health status into payments. The codes are organized hierarchically into condition categories, with the most significant manifestation of a disease coded for payment purposes. This hierarchical coding ensures that the most costly form of the disease dictates the basis for reimbursement. Coding ensures that the most costly form of the disease dictates reimbursement. There are 70 chronic HCC codes currently used in the CMS model, but this will increase to 87 in 2012. Figure 2 shows how ICD-9-CM codes are converted into HCC codes for predicting Medicare expenditures. Not all diagnoses result in an HCC. The coding system prioritizes costly diseases for reimbursement. There are 70 chronic HCC codes in the CMS model, increasing to 87 in 2012. Not all diagnoses lead to an HCC. Some conditions are excluded from the model if they are not chronic or short-term illnesses, as they are not good predictors of future expenditures. The model uses the highest code in a related disease category and codes across unrelated categories additively. The risk factors estimated for each condition are used additively in a model to determine a beneficiary's total risk score. This score is multiplied by the MA plan's base rate to calculate the risk-adjusted base payment. Interaction effects, where the presence of multiple conditions can result in greater costs than just their additive effects, are also considered. For example, an individual with both diabetes and congestive heart failure may have higher healthcare costs. The health care costs for an individual with diabetes and congestive heart failure are higher than expected due to interaction effects between certain diseases and disability. CMS has incorporated these interactions into the CMS-HCC model. Payments to MA plans are adjusted based on demographic characteristics and diagnoses using a mathematical model in the CMS-HCC model, which is a linear regression model. The CMS-HCC model is a linear regression model that predicts expenditures based on diagnoses and demographic variables, including interactions between certain diseases and disability. The model uses actual claims data for Medicare Parts A and B, with risk factors periodically recalculated. Results can be standardized so that a risk score of 1 represents average costs for a Medicare beneficiary. The CMS-HCC model predicts Medicare expenditures based on diagnoses and demographic variables. Risk scores reflect costs relative to average beneficiaries, allowing CMS to adjust payments to plans based on health status and demographics. The goal is to predict average expenditure variations, not individual costs. The CMS-HCC model predicts Medicare expenditures based on diagnoses and demographic variables to adjust payments to Medicare Advantage plans. For new enrollees without 12 months of Part B eligibility, rates are based on age, sex, Medicaid status, and original reason for Medicare entitlement. Non-new enrollees include those switching plans or with at least 12 months of Part B eligibility. CMS collects data from MA plans using the Encounter Data Processing System (EDPS). The Encounter Data Processing System (EDPS) allows CMS to update risk scores of MA beneficiaries using encounter level data with ICD-9-CM codes. Risk scores can be adjusted twice a year on January 1 and July 1 based on data from the prior 12-month period. Data from physician claims, inpatient/outpatient hospital facilities are acceptable for payment updates. The demographic data, disability status, and Medicaid eligibility for adjusting Medicare Advantage payments come from administrative files. Plans submit health status information to CMS for risk-adjusted payments, which are audited to ensure accuracy. Plans are responsible for providing accurate health status information to justify payments. CMS audits plans to verify that risk-adjusted payments are supported by medical records. In February 2011, CMS proposed to extrapolate RADV error rate to entire plan contract for estimated savings of $2.27 billion over five years. CMS released final notice of payment error calculation methodology in February 2012, stating audits will be extrapolated for entire contract payment error estimate. Plans are likely to face larger recovery amounts from CMS in the future. CMS plans to recover larger amounts from Part C plans, leading to potential pushback. Audits are conducted at the contract level using a three-step process: sampling, medical record review, and error rate calculation/payment adjustment. CMS uses samples to reduce data burden, with 201 enrollees considered a sufficient sample size. Enrollees must be continuously enrolled in an MA contract in January of the payment year. Enrollees in MA contracts must meet specific criteria for eligibility, including continuous enrollment for 12 months, non-ESRD status, non-hospice status, full Medicare Part B coverage, and diagnosis of at least one risk adjustment condition. Eligible enrollees are divided into three equal groups based on total numbers. The eligible enrollees in MA contracts are divided into three equal groups based on risk scores to sample 201 enrollees. Sampling weights ensure each sample represents its respective risk score group. For example, in a contract with 3,000 eligible enrollees, 1,000 each are divided into high, medium, and low-risk groups, with 67 enrollees randomly selected from each group. The weight for each sampled enrollee is 14.925. The enrollee sampling weights of 14.925 are used to scale-up sample payment error findings to the population. MA plans are required to provide evidence from medical records to substantiate HCC codes they were paid for. Plans have 12 weeks to deliver records for sampled enrollees, which are reviewed to confirm diagnosis for risk-adjusted payments. The CMS reviews payment errors based on diagnosis and allows plans to appeal findings. Payment errors are either positive (overpayment) or negative (underpayment). Underpayments must be supported by the initial medical record review. Risk scores are corrected based on supported HCCs from the RADV review. The CMS reviews payment errors based on diagnosis and allows plans to appeal findings, which can be positive (overpayment) or negative (underpayment). Enrollee-level payment errors are calculated using corrected risk scores supported by the RADV medical record review. The payment error is determined for each sampled enrollee based on enrollment duration in the MA selected contract. Weighted enrollee payment errors are summed to estimate payment errors for the MA contract. The payment recovery amount for each audited MA contract is determined by the lower bound of the 99% confidence interval around the payment error estimate, adjusted by a fee-for-service (FFS) adjuster. This adjuster addresses methodological concerns raised by the American Academy of Actuaries. The calculation involves selecting 201 eligible enrollees per contract for review, establishing total payment errors for each based on audit findings, and extrapolating the impact to the contract by weighting. The audit determines payment recovery amounts for MA contracts by extrapolating payment errors from a sample of 201 enrollees. The estimated plan level error is $1,187.50 with a 99% confidence interval from $1,037.50 to $1,337.50. If the interval includes $0, the recovery amount is limited to $0. The recovery amount for MA contracts is determined through an audit that extrapolates payment errors from a sample of enrollees. If the 99% confidence interval includes $0, the recovery amount is constrained to $0. The results of the RADV audit do not lead to additional payments to MA plans. Concerns have been raised about risk adjustment under Medicare Advantage based on recent academic studies and research by MedPAC. Medicare reimburses plans based on the average cost of treating beneficiaries with the same HCC code. The average cost of treating beneficiaries in Medicare Advantage plans is a concern due to potential discrepancies in reimbursement rates. Plans may enroll beneficiaries with below average costs to experience lower expenses while being reimbursed at average rates. There are worries that some plans may enroll high-cost individuals but be reimbursed for average cost enrollees. MedPAC and researchers suggest exploring improvements to the CMS risk adjustment model to address these issues. The American Academy of Actuaries (AAA) expressed concerns about the audit process for CMS's risk adjustment model. They worry that the Medicare fee-for-service data used for risk adjustments may contain errors and that the methodology may not accurately reflect the risk profiles of enrollees. The AAA is concerned that the proposed audit process creates inconsistencies in how risk adjustment factors are developed and applied. The CMS-HCC risk adjustment factors were developed with FFS data that were not validated for accuracy. The proposed audit process would apply these factors only to MA data that are validated, creating potential inconsistencies in risk adjustment models. If lower-cost enrollees are no longer considered diabetic in the RADV audit but were in the FFS data, it could lead to inadequate payments for diabetic members. The risk score factor associated with diabetes may be understated in non-validated data, leading to potential underpayment and payment inequities in the risk adjustment system. This inconsistency could make it difficult for actuaries to estimate risk scores and certify plan bids. The Health Practice Council is concerned about the significant change in the risk adjustment methodology for MA plans, particularly in how it may not accurately reflect the relative risk profile of enrollees. The final calculation methodology includes a fee-for-service adjustment to address these concerns, with more information on this adjuster to come. Risk adjustment aims to compensate MA plans for enrolling sicker or healthier Medicare beneficiaries, but there are concerns about under or overcompensation for plans with disproportionate enrollment of certain beneficiary types. The Health Practice Council is concerned about the risk adjustment methodology for Medicare Advantage plans, specifically the use of unaudited Medicare fee-for-service data. Plans fear financial risk from RADV audit recoveries. The Secretary's handling of methodological concerns during risk adjustment implementation is uncertain. Various models have been used for risk adjustment in Medicare private plan payments, each increasing in complexity and explanatory power. The R2 is a measure used to adjust Medicare private plan payments based on beneficiary expenditures. Models predict spending based on beneficiary characteristics, with sicker beneficiaries likely to have higher expenditures. The R2 ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating perfect prediction of expenditures. The AAPCC models used by CMS explain varying percentages of variation in beneficiary expenditures, with the most recent proposed model able to explain approximately 12.5% of the variation. Prior to 2000, private plan payments were risk-adjusted for demographic characteristics such as age, sex, Medicaid enrollment, institutionalized status, and working aged status. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 required CMS to implement a risk adjustment methodology that took into account beneficiary health status by no later than January 1, 2000. From payment year 2000 through 2003, CMS used the Principal Inpatient Diagnostic Cost Group (PIP-DCG) model to adjust private plan payments based on demographic variables and beneficiary health status. The PIP-DCG model, used from 2000 to 2003, adjusted private plan payments based on beneficiary health status. It considered the worst principal inpatient diagnosis but had limitations like not counting illnesses with high expenditures that didn't result in hospital admission. The model was phased-in with a 90% demographic-only method and 10% PIP-DCG method to soften the financial impact on M+C organizations. The CMS-HCC model, implemented in 2004, adjusts Medicare plan payments based on beneficiary illness severity and interactive effects of multiple diseases. It explains 10% of expenditure variation and is detailed in the \"Risk Adjustment Under Medicare Advantage\" section. Updates retain the model's basic structure. Updates to the CMS-HCC model, including Version 12 and Version 21, involve recalibration with recent diagnosis and expenditure data to increase predictive power. Version 21 underwent a major clinical revision in 2009 to adjust for changes in disease patterns, treatment methods, and coding practices. These updates have improved the model's ability to explain Medicare expenditures. Version 21 of the CMS-HCC Risk Adjustment Model is set to be implemented in 2012 for PACE plans."
