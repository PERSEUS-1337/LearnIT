    "content": "The Moving to Work (MTW) program was established in 1996 by Congress to allow HUD and local PHAs to test new policies for housing assistance programs. Over 30 PHAs are currently participating in MTW, managing billions in funding to support low-income families. The future of MTW is uncertain despite its goals of increasing cost-effectiveness, promoting self-sufficiency, and expanding housing choices. The future of the Moving to Work (MTW) program is uncertain as the current HUD-PHA agreements are set to expire in 2018. Critics argue that MTW agencies have been given unprecedented flexibilities with unknown impacts on low-income families. Supporters claim that the program allows PHAs to serve more families in unique and cost-effective ways. Conflicting calls have emerged to end, change, or expand the program due to differing perceptions of its effectiveness and efficiency. The Moving to Work (MTW) program's effectiveness and efficiency are difficult to evaluate against its statutory goals, leading to conflicting views on its success. Some argue for restructuring to focus on innovation, while others believe MTW agencies have shown success operating outside traditional regulations. Despite controversy, MTW policies have influenced discussions on housing reforms. The MTW program's policies have influenced discussions on housing reforms, with some reforms being considered for mainstream assisted housing programs. Congress may look to the MTW demonstration program for insights as they consider future reforms of federal housing assistance programs. The program was authorized in the FY1996 omnibus appropriations law, providing PHAs with flexibility. The MTW program allows PHAs to test new approaches for providing housing assistance to low-income families, aiming to reduce costs, promote self-sufficiency, and increase housing choices. Up to 30 PHAs can participate in the program through a competitive process, with evaluations conducted for up to 15 agencies to identify successful models. The legislative guidelines for the program are broad, allowing agencies to develop their own approaches to assisted housing. The MTW program allows PHAs to develop and test new approaches for providing housing assistance, with flexibility to combine funding streams and waive certain statutory requirements. PHAs can design rent policies to promote employment and self-sufficiency, while being held harmless in terms of funding. However, there are limits on the flexibility allowed to MTW agencies. MTW agencies must serve the same number and size-mix of families, with 75% being low-income, and meet HUD housing quality standards. HUD cannot waive certain U.S. Housing Act provisions, including public housing requirements. PHAs must seek public input and hold a hearing before applying to become an MTW agency, with the plan needing HUD approval. The MTW program requires approval by HUD for PHAs to participate. HUD monitors compliance with agency plans and requires annual reports on fund use and activities. The program allows agencies to implement various policies shaped by the public housing administration context in the 1980s and 1990s. During the 1980s and 1990s, federal policymakers considered public housing reforms to address social ills. The concept of \"block granting\" was debated to give local officials more autonomy in designing programs. Some believed federal regulation was necessary for assisted housing programs. Federal regulation of assisted housing programs was deemed necessary to achieve federal housing goals, including desegregation. The welfare reform debates in the 1990s focused on increasing family self-sufficiency in social welfare programs, including housing assistance. Policymakers and housing practitioners believed that market-based approaches could reduce housing costs. The MTW demonstration program, announced by HUD in December 1996, allowed for the pursuit of these policy goals while maintaining existing models of assisted housing. 30 PHAs were selected from 43 applicants to participate in the program. The MTW program was established in 1996 with 30 PHAs selected to participate in individual negotiations with HUD. The process was complex and lengthy, resulting in agreements signed in 1998 or 1999. Six agencies opted out due to delays or increased flexibility in housing programs. Additional PHAs joined through congressional acts, expanding the program beyond the original 30 agencies. The MTW program has expanded beyond the original 30 PHAs through congressional acts, with a current total of 35 participating agencies. Several agencies have completed their participation and chosen not to renew their agreements. HUD recently selected four more agencies to join the program. HUD recently selected four more agencies to participate in the MTW demonstration program, expanding the total number of participating agencies to 35. Criticisms of HUD's implementation of the program include selecting PHAs with prior poor performance, lack of uniformity in program structure leading to varied policies, and data system limitations hindering information collection on tenant characteristics for evaluation. HUD has faced challenges in evaluating the effects of MTW policies on tenant outcomes and program costs due to data collection issues and program design. Reports on MTW have been process-oriented, lacking in comparison of policy results. Criticisms from the Inspector General and GAO led to HUD implementing a standard MTW agreement in 2008 to improve monitoring and oversight. The standard MTW agreements introduced uniform language and reporting requirements while allowing agencies flexibility in developing local policies. The agreements extended agencies' participation in the program until 2018, aiming for more systematic evaluation in the future. However, the lack of standardized performance data limits HUD's ability to evaluate specific policies. Efforts to collect tenant data may provide some insight into policy outcomes and housing costs. HUD has increased monitoring of agencies' compliance with program purposes. HUD has increased monitoring of MTW agencies' compliance with program purposes, including defining terms like \"self-sufficiency\" and \"housing choice.\" In 2011, HUD assessed if agencies met program requirements, finding that 91% served low-income individuals and most served a comparable number of families. The GAO and HUD IG reports highlighted challenges in ensuring compliance with statutory requirements for MTW agencies. Without standard definitions and a systematic process, HUD cannot effectively evaluate compliance. The IG report recommended no additional MTW agencies be added until program administration improves. MTW agencies have implemented a variety of program activities. MTW agencies have adopted a wide range of program activities, with some fully transforming their assisted housing programs while others making more modest policy changes. Policies developed by MTW agencies include merging funding streams, determining assistance levels, and other administrative flexibilities. MTW agencies may alter policies over time, including merging funding streams into a block grant format. This departure from traditional operations allows for more flexibility in funding usage. Under the non-merged funding structure, Section 8 voucher funding is only for landlord payments; it cannot be used for PHA administration or public housing programs. MTW block grant assistance is negotiated, not formula-based. Initially, only six MTW agencies opted for merged funding, but now most do. A 2004 report found limited use of merged funding flexibility by MTW agencies to address financial shortfalls. MTW agencies used funding flexibility to address financial shortfalls and create autonomy from regulatory processes, enabling alternative uses of funds such as additional tenant support services and development projects not feasible under traditional funding structures. MTW agencies leveraged block grant assistance for low-income housing development, with some agencies like Chicago and Atlanta Housing Authorities using flexibility to redevelop public housing stocks. Chicago Housing Authority attracted private investment for its \"Plan for Transformation,\" replacing deteriorating housing with new developments in mixed-income communities. The Chicago Housing Authority and other MTW agencies used their merged funding stream to finance the transformation of public housing into mixed-income communities. Atlanta also utilized its funding stream to replace distressed public housing. Other agencies like Keene Housing Authority and the Housing Authorities of the County of Santa Clara and the City of San Jose converted public housing to project-based voucher developments, which is typically not allowed under standard program rules. The interest in converting public housing developments into new forms of assistance is driven by leveraging additional outside financing, limited in traditional public housing. Project-basing of vouchers is more widely used by MTW PHAs than non-MTW PHAs, allowing PHAs to reserve units for low-income tenants with attached vouchers. PHAs are limited to project-base only up to 20% of their vouchers and cannot exceed 25% of units in a private building or project-base units in federally assisted housing buildings. MTW agencies have the flexibility to convert public housing stock to project-based vouchers, project-base former public housing properties sold to nonprofits, and project-base entire buildings for special populations. The majority of MTW agencies either currently have project-based voucher assistance or plan to start project-basing vouchers. MTW agencies have the flexibility to convert public housing stock to project-based vouchers, project-base former public housing properties sold to nonprofits, and project-base entire buildings for special populations. A 2010 HUD report shows that a higher rate of project-basing is done by MTW PHAs compared to non-MTW PHAs. MTW activities can impact the level of assistance provided to tenants, with MTW agencies having discretion to experiment with alternative income calculations and rent structures until 2011 when HUD issued guidance on income eligibility determination. MTW agencies have the discretion to implement alternative rent structures and set additional conditions for tenants. Some agencies have experimented with alternative income calculations to simplify the process and encourage tenants to increase their income. Some MTW agencies have experimented with alternative income calculations and rent structures, simplifying income calculations by limiting exclusions and deductions. Over half of participating MTW agencies in 2011 used modified income or asset disregard, and a quarter used modified deductions. MTW agencies have experimented with reducing the frequency of verifying tenants' income, opting to reexamine income every two or three years or eliminating interim reexaminations. 88% of MTW agencies use an alternate schedule for recertifying tenant income, potentially forgoing additional revenue for administrative savings. MTW agencies under the housing assistance programs have experimented with alternative rent structures, including maximum and minimum rents, flat rents, delayed rent increases, and stepped rents. Data on the cost-effectiveness of these approaches are lacking. MTW agencies have implemented various alternative rent structures, such as minimum rents, tiered rents, and flat rents. Some agencies have simplified utility calculations for determining tenant subsidies. Officials believe these alternative structures encourage work and mimic the private market. MTW agencies have implemented alternative rent structures to simplify utility calculations and encourage work. Some agencies have also introduced time limit and work requirement policies for tenants receiving assistance. Data on the impact of these changes on tenant earnings and out-of-pocket payments are lacking. MTW agencies have implemented time limit policies to encourage self-sufficiency and serve more families. These policies vary in duration, ranging from three to seven years. Implementing work requirements and time limits may also come with supportive services for families. Additionally, some agencies have adopted policies to streamline operations without changing the assistance provided to families. Some MTW agencies have altered assistance policies, including housing quality inspection schedules and reporting requirements in the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program. PHA industry groups argue that current inspection requirements are resource-intensive and not always necessary annually. As a result, some agencies have implemented alternative inspection schedules, such as risk-based inspections. The risk-based model of inspection for MTW agencies includes less frequent inspections, self-certification of units, and sampling of rental units. Only a few agencies cluster inspections, with 38% inspecting less than annually and 19% allowing self-certification under certain conditions. HUD's 2010 Report to Congress suggests that alternative HQS inspection procedures have maintained housing quality effectively. The effectiveness of alternative HQS inspection procedures compared to traditional procedures for ensuring the quality of Section 8 voucher-assisted rental units has not been fully evaluated. MTW agencies differ in how they report program information to HUD, with MTW agencies submitting Annual MTW Plans and Reports outlining their activities and outcomes, while non-MTW agencies have more prescriptive plans focused on meeting federal rules and regulations. MTW agencies have flexibility in implementing activities under their Annual MTW Plans, with reporting requirements seen as encouraging program creativity and strategic planning. Since 2008, new MTW activities must be approved by HUD before implementation. HUD has more knowledge of MTW agencies' activities and how they plan to measure outcomes. However, GAO notes that the current reporting process allows MTW agencies to self-report on target program outcomes without verification. Some agencies have struggled with new reporting requirements after not reporting for up to 11 years. HUD's reporting systems lack capacity for MTW-specific data. There has been no systematic evaluation of MTW agencies' outcomes in achieving program goals. Despite the lack of verified evidence, observations from tenant advocates, PHAs, and HUD have highlighted the impact of the MTW demonstration program on tenants and PHAs' operations. These observations inform policy debates on the future of the program and overall reform of assisted housing programs. Low-income housing advocates have expressed concerns about the potential negative effects of MTW agency policies on assisted housing tenants. The MTW demonstration program's impact on assisted housing tenants and PHAs is unclear. While HUD suggests it has allowed PHAs to provide more housing units, concerns exist about potential negative effects on tenants. Some PHAs may be assisting more families by reducing assistance to current recipients. Some PHAs have implemented policies that reduce rental assistance for tenants, potentially impacting low-income individuals. MTW agencies' self-sufficiency programs may benefit families in the long term, but concerns exist about time limits and work requirements leading to needy families losing assistance. Reports suggest MTW agencies have limited tenants' housing choices by reducing portability. Further research is needed to determine the overall impact of MTW discretion on low-income individuals. The MTW demonstration program allows for large-scale demolition of public housing, impacting tenants' lives. MTW agencies like Atlanta and Chicago have replaced demolished housing with vouchers and mixed-income developments, claiming better quality and more opportunities for residents. Tenant advocates object to this displacement. The HOPE VI program has positive outcomes for tenants displaced from distressed public housing, leading to improved living conditions in lower-poverty neighborhoods. However, vulnerable tenants, such as large families or those with disabilities, may not see the same benefits. The Moving to Work (MTW) program has been generally successful according to supporters, including PHA industry groups and some Members of Congress. Most participating PHAs choose to renew their participation, and there is high demand for more agencies to join. Congress has shown support by expanding the number of participating agencies. HUD officials believe MTW agencies are more cost-effective in administering assisted housing programs. Some low-income housing advocates argue that MTW agencies may not be as cost-effective as believed. They suggest that MTW agencies' negotiated funding negatively impacts other PHAs in a limited funding environment. It is unclear how MTW agencies' funding levels would compare if subject to standard funding formulas. Supporters claim that MTW agencies' increased discretion reduces administrative burdens. Increased discretion for MTW agencies reduces administrative burdens without increasing oversight risk. Unlike traditional PHAs, MTW agencies define their own outcome goals and self-report their effectiveness to HUD. Supporters argue this allows for innovative strategies and focus on program outcomes. PHA industry groups support deregulation and moving away from traditional oversight, citing MTW agencies' experiences. Monitoring of program funds by MTW agencies is uncertain. MTW agreements are set to expire in 2018, with the future of the program remaining uncertain. Proposals include expanding MTW into a permanent program or continuing with limited expansion and addressing concerns raised by tenant-advocates. Critics of the MTW program have called for it to be phased out and replaced with targeted demonstrations for more meaningful evaluations. The debate centers around whether the MTW program should be a testing ground for reforming rental assistance programs or if it should become a permanent fixture in assisted housing. Policymakers are considering options to make the MTW program more effective, expand it permanently, or maintain the status quo. The program's purpose is to design and test new approaches for providing assistance. The MTW program aims to design and test various approaches for housing assistance, focusing on reducing costs, promoting self-sufficiency, and increasing family choice. However, the program's effectiveness as a true demonstration is limited due to the lack of thorough assessment of the models used by PHAs. HUD has proposed expanding the MTW demonstration program to 60 agencies for a systematic evaluation. The proposal includes targeted selection of agencies to study specific policies and emphasizes choosing high-performing agencies for rigorous evaluation with the goal of national adoption. The MTW demonstration program aims to evaluate policies for national adoption, with proposals included in housing reform legislative acts. The program was a compromise between transforming rental assistance programs into a block grant and maintaining existing programs. More PHAs have joined MTW than initially planned, with many others seeking MTW status due to its desirability. The desirability of MTW for PHAs has led to calls to expand and make MTW a permanent program. The Moving to Work Charter Program Act aims to increase the number of PHAs eligible for MTW and make it permanent. There have been proposals to block grant and deregulate federal housing assistance for all PHAs, similar to MTW, but these have faced concerns about potential funding reductions. Tenant advocates have concerns about deregulation of HUD block grant programs, fearing rent increases and unreasonable conditions. HUD is worried about the capacity of some agencies entering the MTW demonstration program, preferring high performers for success. HUD has recommended selecting PHAs for the MTW program based on evaluation capacity, innovation, and local support. It is uncertain if the current MTW program or a fully deregulated block grant program would suit small PHAs. Policymakers could choose to maintain the MTW program as is, with existing agencies having agreements through 2018. Congress may add a few more agencies, and HUD has addressed some concerns by increasing reporting requirements. Critics of the existing MTW program have raised concerns about increasing reporting requirements, standardizing agreements, and including evaluation requirements for new agencies. Despite a lack of full evaluation, HUD and policymakers are considering incorporating some reforms from MTW agencies into mainstream programs. Proposed changes include inspection rules and income calculation rules. Proposed changes to the MTW program include modifications to income calculation rules, rent policies, expanded authority for PHAs, and blending of funding. While some reforms are gaining bipartisan support, controversial policies involve altering assistance amounts and imposing conditions on recipients. Tenant advocates and researchers have concerns about the impact of these policies on tenant outcomes."
