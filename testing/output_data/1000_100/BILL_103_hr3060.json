The Secretary may require funds transfer for employee pay if deemed practical and safeguards are in place.

The Secretary may require employee pay to be transferred through a designated financial organization, with no transfer fees allowed. Employees can request exemptions from this process. Employees earning less than $20,000 annually can be exempt from certain requirements. National security provisions exempt certain agencies and employees. The CIA Director can authorize exemptions for the agency and its employees. The Director or designee can exempt employees from regulations if it risks intelligence disclosure.
