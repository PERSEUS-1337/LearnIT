    "content": "The federal government has supported educational statistics for over 150 years, with the creation of the National Institute of Education (NIE) and the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) in the mid-1970s. The Institute of Education Sciences (IES) now oversees federal educational research and statistics efforts since replacing the Office of Educational Research and Improvement (OERI) in 2002. The Education Sciences Reform Act (ESRA) established the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) as an independent research institute within the Department of Education, headed by a Director appointed by the President. ESRA also created the National Board of Educational Sciences (NBES) to advise the Director and assess the progress of IES. Three National Education Centers were established to conduct the work of IES in three areas: National Center for Education Research (NCER), National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), and National Center for Education. P.L. 108-446 reauthorized the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and added the National Center for Special Education Research (NCSER) to the Institute of Education Sciences (IES). Additionally, P.L. 107-279 enacted the Educational Technical Assistance Act (ETAA) and the National Assessment of Educational Progress Authorization Act (NAEPAA) to support technical assistance activities and assessments in reading and mathematics. The Education Sciences Reform Act (ESRA) led to the creation of an independent research institute with scientifically-based standards for research. ESRA allows the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) more freedom from the Department of Education (ED) and greater oversight by a technical panel (NBES). It also specifies standards for educational research supported under the act. The Education Sciences Reform Act (ESRA) defines scientifically based research standards and requires methodological rigor for IES-supported research. Funding for ESRA, ETAA, and NAEPAA programs has continued through annual appropriations legislation. In the 113th and 114th Congress, bills were passed for reauthorization of ESRA, ETAA, and NAEPAA. The Education Sciences Reform Act (ESRA) and related bills aimed to reauthorize and amend provisions for IES independence, research standards, technical assistance, evaluation, privacy protection, student assessment oversight, and IES accountability. ESRA established IES as a research institute within ED and outlined the National Education Centers. Recent legislative action has been discussed in relation to these programs. The Institute of Education Sciences (IES) aims to lead in expanding knowledge of education from early childhood to postsecondary study. It provides information on education progress, practices for academic improvement, and evaluates federal education programs. The IES Director is appointed by the President and conducts research, evaluations, and disseminates information. The Education Sciences Reform Act (ESRA) established procedures for technical and peer review, advised the Secretary on research matters, and ensured activities were objective and free of bias. ESRA also authorized the National Board for Education Sciences (NBES) to advise the Director on IES policies, approve research priorities, and assess progress for improvement. The Education Sciences Reform Act (ESRA) outlines requirements for the Board of the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) and the composition of its four research centers. Each center, including NCER, NCES, NCEE, and NCSER, has specific duties as outlined in ESRA. NCER, as outlined in ESRA, is tasked with sponsoring research to improve education quality, student achievement, and access to postsecondary education. It also supports research synthesis, promotes scientific inquiry practices, and maintains peer-review processes. The Commissioner of NCER is responsible for proposing and implementing research plans, ensuring relevance to education practice and policy, and disseminating research findings. They can support up to eight national research centers focusing on various topics such as adult literacy, teacher quality, and reading. Grants are awarded for a maximum of five years to address national needs. Continuation grants for research and development centers are provided by the Director for up to 10 years, with a competitive process required. NCES, under ESRA Part C, collects and analyzes education information with high methodological standards. Its primary duty is to compile and disseminate statistics on education from preschool to adulthood in a timely manner. NCES is responsible for reporting education information and statistics objectively and without bias. They also publish reports on collected statistics, set standards for state educational agencies, and compare student achievement in the US with other nations. The Commissioner of NCES can award grants, contracts, and provide technical assistance to carry out these duties. Certain data must be collected on various topics as specified in ESRA. ESRA specifies data collection on state and local education reform, early childhood school readiness, student achievement in reading, math, and science, school completions, dropouts, adult literacy, teaching practices, violence in schools, education financing, children's social and economic status, educational technology, access to early childhood programs, before and after-school programs, vocational education participation. ESRA Part D authorizes NCEE to support evaluation, technical assistance, development, and dissemination activities focused on student academic achievement in reading, mathematics, and science. The data collected must be disaggregated by various demographic factors to facilitate educational and policy decision making. The National Center for Education Evaluation and Regional Assistance (NCEE) is authorized to support evaluation, research, and dissemination activities in reading, mathematics, and science. NCEE must adhere to high standards for scientifically valid education evaluation, evaluate Title I programs, and provide technical assistance. The National Center for Education Evaluation and Regional Assistance (NCEE) supports program evaluations, particularly those conducted by ED through the Regional Educational Laboratories (REL) program. The Director of IES contracts with 10 RELs to provide training and technical assistance to SEAs, LEAs, school boards, and state boards of education on ESEA implementation and conducts scientifically valid research on teaching methods and curriculum frameworks. The Regional Educational Laboratories (RELs) support program evaluations and provide training on teaching methods and curriculum frameworks. They facilitate communication between educational experts and school officials to help schools meet state education goals. The Commissioner of NCEE ensures independent evaluations of RELs and shares results with relevant committees. NCSER sponsors research on the needs of children with disabilities. The National Center for Special Education Research (NCSER) aims to improve services for children with disabilities under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) through research, evaluation, and identifying effective practices and interventions. Their duties include improving academic achievement, promoting participation in general education, aligning state standards for students with cognitive disabilities, and addressing overidentification and underidentification of children with disabilities. The National Center for Special Education Research (NCSER) is tasked with improving services for children with disabilities under IDEA by conducting research, evaluating effective practices, and addressing issues such as overidentification and underidentification of children with disabilities. NCSER is authorized to award grants for research activities and is responsible for synthesizing and disseminating research findings. ESRA Part F includes provisions on confidentiality, data availability, performance management, staffing considerations, and authorizations. Title II of P.L. 107-279, known as the Educational Technical Assistance Act (ETAA), authorizes grants for technical assistance and evaluation to local entities and grants for statewide data systems. Funding for ESRA activities and RELs was authorized for FY2003 and subsequent years, with continued funding through annual appropriations legislation after the authorities expired in FY2008. Less than 20 grants are available for comprehensive centers to provide technical assistance to local entities in 10 geographic regions. Each center must collaborate with SEAs, LEAs, and schools in its region. Authorized activities include training, disseminating information to improve academic achievement, and developing teacher training models. Coordination with local RELs, NCEE, and other agencies is required, along with establishing an advisory board. The comprehensive centers must collaborate with SEAs, LEAs, and schools in their regions to provide technical assistance. They are required to establish an advisory board and report annually to the Secretary. The Secretary conducts independent evaluations and may award grants to SEAs for statewide data systems. Funding for these activities was authorized until FY2008. The National Assessment of Educational Progress Authorization Act (NAEPAA) established the National Assessment Governing Board (NAGB) and the Commissioner of Education Statistics to conduct the NAEP. NAEP includes national and state assessment programs, a long-term trend study, and a trial urban district assessment program. The national assessment program evaluates student achievement in reading and math every two years for grades 4 and 8. Other subjects like writing, civics, and the arts are assessed less frequently. The National Assessment Governing Board oversees the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), which evaluates student achievement in various subjects. Participation in the assessment is voluntary for students, schools, and local educational agencies. The Assessment Board, consisting of various stakeholders, selects subject areas to be assessed beyond reading and mathematics and develops appropriate student achievement guidelines. The National Assessment Governing Board oversees the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), evaluating student achievement in various subjects beyond reading and mathematics. They develop assessment objectives, test specifications, and guidelines for reporting results, ensuring validity and reliability. The assessment methodology involves input from teachers, administrators, parents, and experts to measure academic achievement in grades 4, 8, and 12. Standards and procedures for regional and national comparisons are also established. The National Assessment Governing Board oversees the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) to evaluate student achievement. Funding for these activities continued through annual appropriations legislation after authorities expired in FY2008. The House of Representatives and the Senate passed bills for reauthorization of ESRA during the 113th and 114th Congress. Both H.R. 4366 and S. 227 aimed to reauthorize ESRA, ETAA, and NAEPAA, with proposed changes to IES independence, research standards, technical assistance, evaluation, privacy protection, student assessment oversight, and IES accountability. The bills would have given the Director of IES authority to accept additional responsibilities from the Secretary and appoint the Commissioner of NCES, while also amending provisions related to NBES independence. Both H.R. 4366 and S. 227 aimed to reauthorize ESRA, ETAA, and NAEPAA, with proposed changes to IES independence and operational processes. The bills would require at least two board members of NBES to be practitioners knowledgeable about US education needs. They also included provisions for the IES Director's term limits and involvement in contracting processes. Both H.R. 4366 and S. 227 proposed new requirements for IES to establish a peer review system for grants exceeding $100,000. The bills also mandated that IES grants, contracts, and agreements be awarded through a peer review process, with changes to the definition of \"scientifically based research standards.\" The bills proposed new requirements for IES to establish a peer review system for grants exceeding $100,000 and mandated that grants be awarded through a peer review process. They emphasized the importance of research designs that eliminate competing explanations for results and adjusted research priorities to focus on educational problems relevant to federal laws and improving education quality. Some specific priorities under current law would no longer be specified under the bills. Both bills proposed changes to the National Center for Education Research (NCER) and Regional Educational Laboratories (RELs). They aimed to streamline the functions of RELs to focus on applied research, evaluation, and capacity building for SEAs and LEAs. The bills also sought to limit the number of RELs to no more than 10 and give authority to the Evaluation and Regional Assistance Commissioner to determine the appropriate number of RELs. The bills aimed to reorganize laboratories, potentially not based on regions, to improve their effectiveness in meeting performance indicators. They proposed assigning technical assistance responsibilities to ED-administered Comprehensive Centers, limiting the number of awards to 17, and giving the Secretary authority to determine the appropriate number of centers. The bills proposed reorganizing Comprehensive Centers to improve effectiveness, limiting awards to 17, and giving the Secretary authority to adjust the number of centers based on performance indicators. They designated IES for research on federal education programs and allowed funds for program evaluations. Both bills proposed changes to evaluations of programs authorized under ESEA, including consolidating funds, submitting biennial evaluation plans, protecting privacy of individuals, and amending the role of the National Assessment Governing Board. H.R. 4366 would have required an evaluation of all National Education Centers by an independent entity tied to a performance management system. Both H.R. 4366 and S. 227 proposed an expanded performance management system for evaluations of programs under ESEA. H.R. 4366 suggested a triennial evaluation, while S. 227 suggested a five-year evaluation. The system aimed to improve activities and fund utilization through measurable performance indicators. Renewal of grants and agreements would be based on progress in the performance management system. The Director could renew support for NCER centers for up to two years without competition. Both H.R. 4366 and S. 227 propose renewing grants, contracts, and cooperative agreements for up to two years, with recipients required to show progress in meeting ESRA's performance management system. The Evaluation and Regional Assistance Commissioner and the Special Education Research Commissioner would also have the authority to renew support without competition for up to two years. The Director would report public information on all grants, contracts, or agreements. The bills would have required the Director to report public information on grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements within 120 days of the award. They would have also authorized specific appropriations for ESRA, ETAA, and NAEPAA for FY2015 through FY2020, and reserved 16.13% of funds for RELs."
