Congress finds that over 1 billion people in the developing world live in severe poverty, with high child mortality rates and preventable deaths from malnutrition and disease. Women in poverty face greater workloads and fewer opportunities than men, but aiding the poorest, especially women, has positive effects on family incomes, child nutrition, health, and education. Many poor women in the developing world lack stable employment and turn to self-employment to support their families. However, they struggle to access credit at reasonable rates, often resorting to high-interest money lenders. An international Microcredit Summit in 1997 aimed to expand access to credit for self-employment and other financial services for the world's poorest. The goal of providing business services to 100 million of the world's poorest families, especially women, by 2005 aims to expand access to microcredit for the absolute poor. NGOs like Grameen Bank and Accion International have been successful in lending directly to the very poor, enabling them to grow their incomes and businesses. Microcredit institutions have high repayment rates and reduce poverty, lessening dependency on foreign aid. Interest income from loans can cover institutional costs for long-term sustainability. These institutions leverage foreign assistance by recycling loans for new benefits. Sustainable microcredit institutions are crucial for global poverty reduction and economic development. AID initiated a Microenterprise Initiative in 1994 in consultation with Congress. The Microenterprise Initiative, launched in 1994, aimed to expand funding for AID's microenterprise programs. Funding of $137 million was provided for fiscal year 1994, with a goal that half of resources by fiscal year 1996 would support programs providing credit to the poorest with loans under $300. However, in fiscal year 1996, total funding fell to $111 million, with only 39 percent benefiting the poorest with loans under $300. Increased investment in microcredit institutions serving the poorest is crucial for achieving the Microcredit Summit's goal. AID's funding for microenterprise activities should be expanded to $160 million for fiscal year 1999 to match the growing capacity of microcredit. To achieve the Microcredit Summit's goal, it is essential to increase funding for international microcredit programs in the United States, focusing on institutions serving the poorest. Expanding successful microcredit institutions and assisting them in developing their capacity is crucial to reach millions of the poorest with microcredit. PVOs and other NGOs have shown competence in building networks of local support. AID should prioritize investing in PVOs and other NGOs to expand successful microcredit institutions and create a global infrastructure for providing financial services to the world's poorest families. AID can also provide leadership in supporting microenterprise for the poorest among bilateral and multilateral development aid agencies. The Act aims to expand AID's commitment to developing microcredit institutions, making microenterprise the focus of economic growth strategies, supporting US PVOs and NGOs in providing financial services to microentrepreneurs, and increasing assistance for the poorest sector in developing countries. The Act aims to expand AID's commitment to developing microcredit institutions, supporting US PVOs and NGOs in providing financial services to microentrepreneurs, and increasing assistance for the poorest sector in developing countries, particularly women. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"AID\" refers to the United States Agency for International Development. The terms \"microcredit\", \"microenterprise\", \"poverty lending portion of mixed programs\", and \"mixed programs\" are defined under the 1994 Microenterprise Initiative of AID. \"PVOs and other nongovernmental organizations\" include private voluntary organizations and international, regional, or national nongovernmental organizations active in the region or country of the project.

SEC. 4. MICROENTERPRISE ASSISTANCE. The President, through the Administrator of AID, is authorized to establish programs for microenterprise assistance in developing countries. Programs will be carried out by US PVOs and other organizations. Eligibility criteria will be set by the Administrator of AID to determine eligible entities for carrying out the purposes described. The entity's credit recipients lack access to formal financial sector, are among the poorest, focus on working with poor women, and aim for financial self-reliance. Funding levels for fiscal year 1999 require at least $160,000,000 for assistance under the Act. The Act authorizes funds for microenterprise activities in the former Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, Europe, Asia, and the Near East. $80,000,000 is allocated for poverty lending, and $35,000,000 is designated for support of NGOs through AID's central funding mechanisms.

A minimum of $10,000,000 is specified for the private voluntary organizations matching grant program to support United States PVOs. The Act authorizes funds for microenterprise activities, with a focus on poverty lending to the poorest 50% living below the poverty line in foreign countries. Funds can be used for making loans of $300 or less in 1997 USD to the poverty target population. SEC. 5. PROGRAM PERFORMANCE CRITERIA. The Administrator of AID is required to strengthen mechanisms for microenterprise programs and develop mechanisms for targeting microcredit to the poorest population. A monitoring system must be established to measure the performance of assistance programs under section 4.
