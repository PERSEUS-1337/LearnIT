The \"Crime Victim Restitution and Court Fee Intercept Act\" amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow for the collection of past-due state judicial debts by reducing overpayments payable to individuals by the amount of the debt. The Act allows for the collection of past-due state judicial debts by reducing overpayments payable to individuals. The reduction is notified to the State judicial branch or agency, along with the person's details. The Act allows for the reduction of overpayments to individuals to collect past-due state judicial debts, federal agency debts, state income tax obligations, and covered unemployment compensation debts. The Act permits the offset of overpayments to individuals for various debts, including past-due state judicial debts, federal agency debts, state income tax obligations, and covered unemployment compensation debts. If multiple debts are owed to a state agency or judicial branch, overpayments will be applied in the order of debt accrual. Rules similar to subsection (e)(4) apply for debt consideration. The term 'past-due, legally enforceable State judicial debt' refers to a debt resulting from a court judgment in criminal or traffic cases, with an assessed but uncollected amount. The term 'State judicial debt' includes court costs, fees, fines, assessments, and restitution to crime victims resulting from court judgments. The Secretary will issue regulations for submitting notices of past-due State judicial debts and specify the types of debts eligible for reduction. Regulations may also require certain information to be included in the notices. The regulations may require State judicial branches and agencies to pay a fee to reimburse the Secretary for applying procedures. Any erroneous payments made to State judicial branches or agencies must be promptly repaid to the Secretary. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include disclosure of return information to agencies requesting a reduction under specific sections. Conforming amendments are made to various sections of the Code to reflect these changes.
