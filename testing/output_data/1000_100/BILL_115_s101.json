    "content": "The Act titled \"King Cove Road Land Exchange Act\" finds that the land exchange and road construction is in the public interest. The Act defines \"Federal land\" as 206 acres within the Refuge and includes 131 acres in the Wilderness for road construction. \"Non-Federal land\" refers to 43,093 acres owned by the State. \"Refuge\" means the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge in the State. The Act defines key terms such as \"road corridor,\" \"Secretary,\" \"State,\" and \"Wilderness\" in relation to the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. SEC. 4. LAND EXCHANGE REQUIRED. The State can convey non-Federal land to the Secretary in exchange for Federal land for the purpose of designating a road corridor and constructing a single-lane gravel road. The value of the exchanged lands must be equal or equalized through appraisals. The Secretary and State will select an appraiser to conduct appraisals of Federal and non-Federal land in accordance with recognized standards. If the final appraised value of Federal land exceeds the final appraised value of non-Federal land, equalization measures will be taken. If the appraised value of Federal land exceeds the appraised value of non-Federal land in a land exchange, equalization can be achieved by conveying additional non-Federal land, making a cash payment, or using a combination of both methods. If the final appraised value of non-Federal land is higher, it will be considered surplus. In a land exchange, if the appraised value of Federal land exceeds that of non-Federal land, the State can adjust the acreage of non-Federal land to equalize the values. The Secretary may accept a payment exceeding 25% of the Federal land value. Upon completion of the exchange, the Wilderness boundary will be modified to exclude Federal land and non-Federal land will be added to the Wilderness. The land exchange must be completed within 180 days of the enactment of the Act. The exchanged land will be added to the Wilderness and managed in accordance with the Wilderness Act and other applicable laws. The road corridor will follow the southern road alignment described in the final environmental impact statement. The road constructed in the corridor must meet specific requirements outlined in the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009. The exchange of Federal land and non-Federal land, as well as the construction of a road under this Act, will not be considered a major Federal action under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969."
