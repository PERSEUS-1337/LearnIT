    "content": "The \"Farmers Tax Deferral Act\" allows for the nontaxable exchange of qualified agricultural property for real property under Section 1046 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"Farmers Tax Deferral Act\" under Section 1046 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 allows qualified individuals aged 55 and above to exchange United States real property for qualified agricultural property without recognizing gain or loss. Qualified persons include individuals, corporations wholly owned by qualifying individuals, and partnerships, trusts, or estates with beneficial interests owned by qualifying individuals. Qualified agricultural property refers to single purpose agricultural or horticultural property. The definition of \"agricultural property\" includes single purpose agricultural structures placed in service over 20 years before transfer, along with related real property, equipment, or fixtures. \"United States real property\" refers to real property located in the United States. Property received must be identified and the exchange completed within 180 days. The rules for property exchanges require identification within 45 days and completion within 180 days. Similar rules regarding basis, exchanges not solely in kind, and related parties apply. For like-kind exchanges of qualified agricultural property, section 1031 rules apply. Gain from the disposition of such property may not be recognized under section 1046 until later. The gain taken into account by the transferor under subsection (a)(1) should not exceed the sum of the gain recognized on the disposition and the fair market value of property acquired that is not section 1245 property or United States real property. If United States real property acquired in an exchange is disposed of by the transferee, the ordinary income recapture is the lesser of certain amounts. If United States real property acquired in an exchange is disposed of by the transferee, the ordinary income recapture is the lesser of the excess of the amount realized on the disposition over the adjusted basis, or the excess of the amount of gain that would have been treated as ordinary income under this section. The amendments made by subsection (a) shall apply to transfers after the date of the enactment of this section, where qualified agricultural property sold at fair market value will have any excess gain treated as ordinary income. The amendments made by subsection (b) will apply to dispositions after the date of the enactment of this Act. SEC. 3. SPECIAL RULES FOR INSTALLMENT SALES OF QUALIFIED AGRICULTURAL PROPERTY. Special rule for qualified agricultural property under section 453 of the Internal Revenue Code allows income from installment sales to be accounted for under the installment method. The amendments made by this section apply to sales after the enactment of this Act, recognizing recapture income in proportion to total income from the sale."
