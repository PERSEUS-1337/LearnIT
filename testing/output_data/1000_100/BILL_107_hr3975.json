The Congress finds that HIV/AIDS is predicted to become the worst infectious disease epidemic in history, surpassing past pandemics like the bubonic plague and the 1918 influenza outbreak. Disparities in HIV transmission from mother to child between rich and poor countries are increasing, potentially doubling child mortality rates in heavily affected regions by 2010. The National Intelligence Council predicts a dramatic increase in the number of AIDS orphans worldwide, potentially tripling in the next 10 years. This could lead to economic decay, social fragmentation, and political destabilization in already volatile societies. The economic costs of infectious diseases, especially HIV/AIDS, could reduce gross domestic product by 20 percent or more by 2010 in some sub-Saharan African nations. Despite discouraging HIV/AIDS statistics, some developing nations like Uganda, Senegal, and Thailand have successful prevention programs. United States financial support for global medical research and disease containment benefits all Americans. Contributing to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria would be a significant step in combating infectious diseases worldwide. The international community endorsed the proposed Fourth Amendment in September 1997, but it has not been implemented due to lack of Congressional authorization. The amendment has been accepted by 109 out of 110 members of the International Monetary Fund. Approval by the United States, which holds 17.16 percent of the voting power, would enable allocation of Special Drawing Rights. The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria leverages resources from donor nations to combat the HIV/AIDS crisis through a multilateral burden-sharing approach. The Bretton Woods Agreements Act is amended to accept the Fourth Amendment to the Articles of Agreement of the Fund and contribute Special Drawing Rights to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. The United States Governor of the Fund accepts the Fourth Amendment to the Articles of Agreement. The Secretary of the Treasury is instructed to seek an agreement for the Global Fund to hold Special Drawing Rights. Upon achieving the agreement, the Secretary of the Treasury will provide contributions. The Secretary of the Treasury is directed to contribute 1/3 of Special Drawing Rights to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria from 2004 to 2006. Additionally, negotiations will be pursued to encourage other Fund members to make similar contributions."
