Investors and speculators were drawn to the rapidly rising market values of land and equities, leading to risky investments. Banks considered loans with real estate collateral as secure, but when the bubbles burst, the Nikkei stock market average peaked. The bursting of Japan's economic bubble in the late 1980s led to a significant drop in stock market and real estate values. The Nikkei stock market average peaked in 1989 and then dropped drastically, causing banks to suffer from reduced capital reserves. Land values in major metropolitan areas also fell sharply, leading to a financial and banking crisis that slowed down the overall Japanese economy. The financial crisis in Japan led to a stagnant economy with companies facing excess capacity, inventories, and lower profits. Banks reported $280 billion in non-performing loans in 1995, which was underestimated. Unlike the US, Japanese financial institutions did not bundle loans as collateralized debt obligations or rely heavily on derivatives. Mortgage defaults were mainly on commercial property, and lending was often relational rather than purely market-based. The Japanese financial crisis led to a stagnant economy with companies facing excess capacity and lower profits. Banks extended commercial loans based on close corporate ties rather than market-based criteria, leading to a high number of non-performing loans. The bursting of real estate and stock bubbles had adverse effects on the economy, with growth rates falling significantly. The economy experienced a temporary recovery in 1996 but fell into recession in 1998 and 1999 due to fiscal policy tightening and the Asian Financial Crisis. The bursting of Japan's stock and real estate bubbles in 1989 and 1990 led to an extended L-shaped recession in the 1990s. The government initially used forbearance to address the banking crisis, protecting depositors and providing emergency liquidity. Economic growth rates did not recover to pre-crisis levels after the recession of 2001. During Japan's banking crisis in the 1990s, the government intervened extensively to protect depositors, provide emergency liquidity, and assist in mergers of failed institutions. The banking system was compared to a convoy of ships, with stronger banks helping weaker ones to prevent major bank failures. The \"community banking mentality\" led banks to prioritize long-term profits over short-term gains, resulting in continued lending to defaulting firms. In the 1990s, Japan faced a banking crisis with many \"zombie companies\" defaulting on repayments, leading to more non-performing loans. To address this, the government established the Cooperative Credit Purchasing Company (CCPC) in 1992, similar to the Resolution Trust Corporation in the US. The CCPC helped banks dispose of non-performing loans with real estate collateral. In 1993, top banks sold \u00a51.3 trillion in non-performing loans to the CCPC, accounting for 54% of all loans written off that year. The selling bank would extend credit to the CCPC for the purchase cost plus expenses, allowing the bank to claim a capital loss for tax purposes. The CCPC helped banks dispose of non-performing loans with real estate collateral. About half of the underlying value of the non-performing loans was recovered through sales of the assets. Despite billions in write-offs, nonperforming loans continued to appear. During Japan's financial crisis, banks wrote off $318 billion in non-performing loans, but new ones kept appearing, leading to a peak of $330 billion in 2002. The government implemented multiple stimulus packages between 1992 and 1995, providing fiscal stimulus of 0.3% to 1.5% of GDP in each package. The economy began to slowly recover after 1993, but worsened in 1995 with the bankruptcy of housing loan companies. In 1996, the government injected capital to purchase assets from struggling housing lenders. In 1996, the Japanese government injected capital to purchase assets from ailing housing lenders, which was politically unpopular and may have affected later government policies. The burst speculative bubble problem was resolved by 1995, but weak fiscal, monetary, and supervision policies led to the sorry state of the economy. Policy errors made the burst bubble problem worse than necessary. Recovery in 1996 was attributed to spending for reconstruction after the Kansai earthquake and anticipation of a consumption tax rise in 1997. In 1997, Japan implemented a consumption tax increase amidst a banking crisis. The government provided $250 billion, with $108 billion going to banks and $142 billion to the Deposit Insurance Corporation. They acquired and later sold Long-Term Credit Bank and Nippon Credit Bank, injecting additional funds in 1998 and 1999. By October 1998, the government had invested $495 billion, equivalent to 12% of GDP, to stabilize the financial sector. The Japanese government invested $495 billion (\u00a560 trillion yen), equivalent to 12% of GDP, to support banks during the financial crisis. This included capital injections, new regulations, oversight, and a reorganization of the banking sector. By September 2005, banks reported 3.5% of total lending as non-performing. The government implemented monetary policy, direct intervention, and fiscal stimulus packages to combat the crisis, announcing nine stimulus packages in the 1990s. The Japanese government implemented nine stimulus packages in the 1990s to combat the financial crisis, investing $495 billion (\u00a560 trillion yen), equivalent to 12% of GDP, to support banks. The packages included capital injections, new regulations, oversight, and reorganization of the banking sector. The total amounts for the packages were somewhat misleading due to items already included in previous budgets. The government indicated new spending as \"real water\" (mamizu) and listed percentages of GDP based on new spending only. The Japanese government implemented nine stimulus packages in the 1990s, investing $495 billion to support banks during the financial crisis. The bank rescue operations were primarily administered by the Deposit Insurance Corporation of Japan (DICJ), providing various forms of assistance to prevent financial institutions from failing. The DICJ's activities also include insuring bank deposits and managing ongoing operations. The DICJ provided financial assistance totaling $399 billion as of March 2007, including grants, asset purchases, capital injections, and other forms of aid. The grants were funded by DICJ bonds and deposit insurance premiums, with asset purchases totaling $83 billion, of which $79 billion was recovered. Capital injections of $106 billion were part of five rescue packages. The DICJ injected $106 billion into 25 banks through five rescue packages, holding $31.3 billion in assets as of March 2007. An additional $51 billion was allocated for various purposes including loans, asset management, and debt assumption. The last capital injection was in March 2003, and the RCC, a DICJ subsidiary, purchases and disposes of assets from financial institutions. The Resolution and Collection Corporation (RCC) purchased troubled assets at a discounted price, selling them for a profit. The RCC paid 9 cents on a dollar for assets, consulting with the Purchase Price Examination Board. Japan's government debt increased as the economy stagnated, following a pattern seen in other financial crises worldwide. Japan's central government debt as a percent of GDP rose from 47% in 1990 to 65%. Japan's central government debt as a percent of GDP rose from 47% in 1990 to 65% in 1995 and to 106% in 2000. The Ricardian equivalence theorem suggests that government deficits may not stimulate demand as individuals save to pay off future tax increases. In the 1990s, Japan experienced rising government debt, with fiscal stimulus packages having expected multiplier effects despite high saving rates. Tax cuts targeted at the most liquidity constrained had the largest effects. Stimulus was deemed necessary due to limitations on monetary stimulus, but the impact on restoring growth was muted without addressing non-performing loans or economic deregulation. The impact of fiscal deficits on restoring growth in Japan was muted in the 1990s. Despite efforts to reduce the budget deficit, the government debt-to-GDP ratio rose to 141% by 2003, exceeding the target of 60%. Tightening fiscal policy too soon may have prolonged the recession, as the government overestimated the strength of the economic recovery in 1996. The Japanese government's debt-to-GDP ratio increased to 5.4%, highlighting the challenge of reducing the debt burden in a stagnant economy. Despite periods of economic growth, the national debt continued to grow, requiring payments for interest, redemptions, and administrative costs. The interest payments as a percentage of federal government expenditures for the United States and Japan have decreased in recent years. Japan's share of expenditures for interest dropped from 17% in the early 1990s to 11.5% in 2007, while the United States saw a decrease from 15% to 8.3% in 2008. The question remains whether this trend can continue with the large fiscal deficits incurred in 2009. Lessons from the Japanese experience include authorities initially underestimating the seriousness of the banking problem, delaying resolution by keeping zombie firms alive, and the importance of transparency in recognizing the true extent of non-performing loans. The Japanese government intervened to rescue ailing financial firms by injecting capital through the Deposit Insurance Corporation of Japan. The DICJ had the authority to assist troubled institutions as directed by the Prime Minister, buying troubled assets at a discount to address the banking crisis. The Japanese government intervened to rescue ailing financial firms by injecting capital through the Deposit Insurance Corporation of Japan. Troubled assets were bought at a discount from sound financial institutions and disposed of without disturbing markets. Capital injections took various forms such as stock subscriptions and grants. Japan's banks wrote off $318 billion in non-performing loans despite receiving $495 billion in financial support packages between 1998 and 2003. The government's holdings of corporate shares generated income for the DICJ. Recovery efforts were focused on a smaller number of banks and financial institutions compared to the United States. Japan's early financial rescue package had stringent conditions that banks rejected, leading to a lack of lending and worsening economic conditions. The DICJ enforced conditions on assistance to failing institutions due to challenges in risk management from new technologies and globalization. The real estate bubble burst in Japan caused more bank difficulties than the stock market bubble. Japan's slow response in monetary and fiscal policies exacerbated problems. Japan's slow response in monetary and fiscal policies exacerbated problems, tightening fiscal policy too soon once the economy began to recover."
