    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Identity Theft Notification and Credit Restoration Act of 2003\". The findings section follows. Congress finds that the privacy and financial security of individuals are increasingly at risk due to the widespread collection of personal information. Credit card transactions, real estate records, consumer surveys, credit reports, and Internet websites are all sources of personal information for identity thieves. Identity theft is a fast-growing crime in the United States, posing a major law enforcement challenge. Criminals use stolen personal information to open fraudulent credit card accounts. Identity theft is a growing concern in the United States, with over 160,000 reported victims in 2002. This crime is costly to consumers and the marketplace, requiring victims to contact various authorities and agencies over many years to address each instance of fraud. Financial institutions and credit reporting agencies that handle personal information share a responsibility in preventing identity theft. The private sector has a shared responsibility to protect consumers' sensitive personal information from identity thieves and assist identity theft victims. They can improve customer notification, implement fraud alerts, provide greater consumer access to credit reports, and establish financial identity theft prevention measures. SEC. 3. TIMELY NOTIFICATION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO PERSONAL INFORMATION. Subtitle B of title V of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act is amended to include a new section requiring notification to customers of unauthorized access to personal information. In this section, a breach refers to the unauthorized acquisition of data compromising the security of personal information held by a financial institution. Personal information for a customer includes their first name or initial, last name, and additional data. The breach of personal information at a financial institution requires prompt notification if sensitive data like social security numbers, driver's license numbers, credit card information, or access codes are involved. The financial institution must promptly notify affected customers, consumer reporting agencies, and law enforcement agencies in case of a breach affecting a large number of customers. Any entity holding personal information for the institution must also notify the financial institution. A financial institution must promptly notify affected parties of any customer information breach. Notification should be made without delay, taking into account law enforcement needs and measures to assess the breach. Delays in notification may occur if law enforcement deems it necessary for a criminal investigation. The financial institution must promptly notify affected parties of any customer information breach, taking into account law enforcement needs. Notification may be provided in writing or electronically, following guidelines set forth by the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act. Other forms of notification may be used if deemed necessary by the Federal Trade Commission. In cases where a breach or suspected breach makes other forms of notification prohibitive, a financial institution may notify affected customers through email, a website posting, or media notification. The notification of a breach of personal information compromising customer data must be made through media, as prescribed by the Federal Trade Commission. Notifications must also be sent to consumer reporting agencies and law enforcement agencies. Each customer notification must include a statement that credit reporting agencies have been informed of the breach. The Federal Trade Commission requires that in the event of a breach or suspected breach of personal information, customer credit reports must contain a fraud alert. Creditors must be informed that customer authorization is needed for any new credit issuance. Financial institutions must have a comprehensive information security program to comply with these regulations. The financial institution must comply with regulatory standards, notify affected customers and consumer reporting agencies of breaches, and have internal security policies consistent with FTC rules. Customers can seek damages for violations, and actions violating the section may be enjoined. Violation or potential violation of this section may be enjoined. The rights and remedies available under this section are in addition to any other rights and remedies available under applicable law. Compliance with this section by a financial institution shall not be construed as a violation of any provision of federal or state law prohibiting the disclosure of financial information to third parties. Nothing in this section requires or authorizes a financial institution to disclose information that it is otherwise prohibited from disclosing under federal or state law. The section does not impose new recordkeeping obligations on financial institutions beyond what is required by law. SEC. 4. INCLUSION OF FRAUD ALERTS IN CONSUMER CREDIT REPORTS. Section 605 of the Fair Credit Reporting Act is amended to include a definition of fraud alerts, which notify users of potential identity theft and unauthorized credit issuance. The Fair Credit Reporting Act is amended to include provisions for obtaining consumer preauthorization through designated phone numbers or other means, as well as requiring consumer reporting agencies to include fraud alerts in consumer files upon notification from financial institutions. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires consumer reporting agencies to promptly include a fraud alert in a consumer's file upon request, along with evidence of identity theft. The agency must also ensure that anyone accessing the consumer's credit information is aware of the fraud alert. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act mandates consumer reporting agencies to add a fraud alert to a consumer's file upon request, ensuring that anyone accessing the credit information is informed of the alert. The Federal Trade Commission will establish the duration of fraud alerts and procedures for their removal. Failure to notify users of a fraud alert can result in violations for the consumer reporting agency. Failure to comply with preauthorization procedures contained in a fraud alert in a consumer credit report and issuing or extending credit in the name of the consumer to someone else is a violation. It is also a violation to take adverse action against a consumer solely based on the presence of a fraud alert in their file. Access to credit reports and scores is addressed in Section 5. Section 612(c) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act is amended to provide consumers with free access to credit reports and scores upon request. A credit reporting agency can charge a reasonable fee for disclosures related to fraud alerts. The Fair Credit Reporting Act is amended to include credit scores in disclosures, as required by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. Within 180 days of the Act's enactment, the Federal Trade Commission, in consultation with other financial regulatory agencies, must issue final regulations to implement the Act's amendments."
