The Biodiesel Promotion Act of 2002 offers incentives for biodiesel use as fuel through a new section in the Internal Revenue Code. The biodiesel fuels credit for the taxable year is determined as the biodiesel mixture credit, calculated based on the biodiesel mixture rate for each qualified biodiesel mixture and the number of gallons of the mixture. The biodiesel mixture rate is 1 cent for each whole percentage point of biodiesel in the mixture, not exceeding 20 percentage points. The Biodiesel Promotion Act of 2002 provides incentives for biodiesel use as fuel through a new section in the Internal Revenue Code. A qualified biodiesel mixture is a blend of diesel and biodiesel sold or used by the taxpayer in their trade or business. Biodiesel used in the mixture is eligible for a tax credit based on the percentage of biodiesel in the blend, up to 20 percentage points. The Biodiesel Promotion Act of 2002 offers tax credits for biodiesel use in qualified mixtures sold or used by the taxpayer in their trade or business. The credit is reduced for any benefit received under specific excise tax exemptions. The term 'biodiesel' is defined for this purpose. The term 'biodiesel' refers to monoalkyl esters of long chain fatty acids from various vegetable oils for use in diesel engines. It must meet registration requirements set by the EPA and the American standards. The American Society of Testing and Materials D6751 sets requirements for biodiesel. If biodiesel is separated from a qualified biodiesel mixture or used for purposes other than fuel, a tax is imposed on the person. The tax imposed on biodiesel mixtures is subject to applicable laws and penalties. Taxpayers can elect to not apply for the biodiesel fuels credit for a taxable year. Regulations similar to those for estates and trusts apply for pass-thru situations. An election can be made or revoked for the biodiesel fuels credit within a 3-year period from the last date to file the tax return. The manner of making this election is determined by the Secretary's regulations. The section regarding the credit does not apply to fuel sold after December 31, 2012. The credit is considered part of the general business credit under Section 38(b) of the Code. The biodiesel fuels credit under Section 40A cannot be carried back before January 1, 2003, as per the new amendments made to the Internal Revenue Code. The biodiesel fuels credit under Section 40A is subject to new amendments in the Internal Revenue Code, including changes to Section 6501(m) and the table of sections for subpart D of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1. The amendments made to Section 40A of the Internal Revenue Code regarding biodiesel fuels include a reduction in motor fuel excise taxes on biodiesel mixtures. This amendment applies to taxable years starting after December 31, 2002. Section 4081 is amended to include a new subsection (f) for biodiesel mixtures, allowing for a reduced tax rate for qualified biodiesel mixtures. The tax rate for diesel fuel used in producing qualified biodiesel mixtures is reduced by a specific amount based on the percentage of biodiesel in the mixture. The tax rate for diesel fuel used in producing qualified biodiesel mixtures is reduced based on the percentage of biodiesel in the mixture, as defined in section 40A of the Code. The tax rate for diesel fuel used in producing qualified biodiesel mixtures is reduced based on the percentage of biodiesel in the mixture, as defined in section 40A of the Code. Amendments to Section 6427 of the Code provide for the payment of an amount equal to the per gallon applicable biodiesel mixture rate for fuel used in producing qualified biodiesel mixtures sold or used in a person's trade or business. Effective from December 31, 2002, to January 1, 2013. The Highway Trust Fund is protected from reductions in receipts by transferring amounts from the Commodity Credit Corporation funds based on estimates made by the Secretary of the Treasury. Transfers will be adjusted for any errors in the estimates."
