    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Incentives to Educate American Children (I Teach) Act of 2002\". Congress finds that there is a need for 2,000,000 new teachers in the next decade. The No Child Left Behind Act requires States to recruit qualified teachers by 2006, especially in rural and high-poverty schools. Rural education is crucial in 25 States, and high poverty schools often lack certified teachers in their fields. The National Board for Professional Teaching Standards was established in 1987 to set high standards for accomplished teachers. Over 16,000 teachers nationwide have completed certification through this rigorous assessment process. High poverty schools may require special assistance to meet the goals of the No Child Left Behind Act. The National Board for Professional Teaching Standards certifies teachers through a rigorous assessment process. Recent data shows that certified teachers outperform their peers on key teaching measures. Teacher salaries have stagnated, with many states below the national average. The Act aims to incentivize teachers to work in rural or high-poverty schools through tax credits. The Act aims to provide a tax credit to teachers who achieve certification from the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards to recruit and retain highly qualified teachers in public schools. The Act introduces a tax credit for individuals teaching in high poverty or rural schools and certified teachers. A tax credit is available for eligible teachers in high poverty or rural schools, with an applicable amount of $1,000 for those teaching in public kindergartens or elementary/secondary schools meeting specific criteria. The tax credit is available for eligible teachers in high poverty or rural schools, with an applicable amount of $1,000 for those teaching in schools where at least 75% of students receive free or reduced-cost lunches or have a School Locale Code of 7 or 8.

An eligible teacher is defined as a full-time kindergarten through grade 12 classroom teacher in a public elementary or secondary school for any academic year ending after December 31, 2002.
