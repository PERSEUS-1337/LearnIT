    "content": "It is a federal crime to assault, kidnap, or kill a federal judge or their family members with the intent to obstruct or retaliate for the judge's duties. The law also protects federal law enforcement officers, prosecutors, and any federal officer or employee. Penalties are based on the seriousness of the offense. Section 207 of P.L. 110-177 increases the maximum penalties. Section 207 of P.L. 110-177 increases penalties for voluntary manslaughter to 15 years and for involuntary manslaughter to 8 years in cases involving federal judges, officers, and witnesses. The amendment extends to various federal jurisdictional circumstances, providing protection against murder, assaults, and threats to influence or retaliate against witnesses in federal proceedings. The penalties for murder, manslaughter, and attempted murder of federal witnesses are the same as for federal officials, with assault and conspiracy carrying slightly harsher penalties. Sections 205 and 206 of P.L. 110-177 increase the maximum penalty for witness tampering or retaliation involving physical force from 20 years to 30 years, threats of physical force from 10 years to 20 years, and harassment from 1 year to 3 years. Section 204 adds a venue provision to witness retaliation offenses, allowing prosecution in either the place of violation or where the proceeding occurred, potentially raising constitutional concerns. The misuse of firearms and dangerous weapons in federal facilities is prohibited by federal statutes, with penalties for possession or attempted possession of such weapons. For example, 18 U.S.C. 930 outlaws the use of firearms or dangerous weapons in fatal attacks within federal facilities, with imprisonment for up to 5 years for possession with intent to use, and up to 1 year for simple possession. The possession of dangerous weapons in federal courthouses is prohibited by federal statutes, with penalties including imprisonment for up to 2 years. The definition of \"dangerous weapon\" is broad and includes items like shoes and belts. Possession of such items in a federal courthouse can lead to practical problems. The possession of dangerous weapons in federal courthouses is prohibited by federal statutes, with penalties including imprisonment for up to 2 years. However, there is ambiguity in defining what constitutes a dangerous weapon in other federal facilities. Retaliation against federal officials through false liens and legal nuisance actions has been prosecuted under federal statutes prohibiting obstruction of justice or conspiracy to inflict economic damage. Section 201 of P.L. 110-177 establishes a separate federal crime for knowingly filing false liens against federal officers' property, punishable by up to 10 years in prison. It is a federal crime to threaten or harm federal officers, employees, their families, witnesses, or jurors to impede their duties. Aiding or abetting these crimes incurs criminal liability. Section 202 of P.L. 110-177 criminalizes the public disclosure of certain personal information of federal officials, employees, witnesses, and jurors with the intent to incite violence, punishable by up to 5 years in prison. The proposal does not require the victims to be targeted based on their federal status, immediate violence to be imminent, or the information to be private. First Amendment concerns may limit its scope. The United States Marshals Service is under the Department of Justice. The United States Marshals Service, part of the Department of Justice, is responsible for the security of federal courts, executing warrants, protecting witnesses, and arresting fugitives. Marshals are appointed by the President and serve four-year terms. Additional funding is requested to hire more marshals for security purposes. The President's budget for FY2008 includes a request for additional appropriations of $25.7 million for the Marshals Service to investigate threats against the Judiciary, enhance trial security, and enforce the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act. P.L. 110-177 bolsters the authority of the Marshals Service to serve the Tax Court, allowing marshals to attend sessions upon request by the chief judge. P.L. 110-177 amends the organic statutes for the Marshals Service and the Judicial Conference to ensure regular consultation concerning judicial security and protection of judicial personnel. Federal judges and prosecutors face threats, but only marshals have express authority to carry firearms. Prosecutors can be deputized as deputy marshals for this purpose. Section 401 of P.L. 110-177 directs the Attorney General to report on the security of federal prosecutors, including firearm possession matters. Part H of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 authorizes grants for state prosecutors, with appropriations authorized through 2011. Sections 515 and 516 of the Omnibus Crime and Safe Streets Act of 1968 authorize Correctional Options grants. Section 302 of P.L. 110-177 allows for grants to improve security for state, territorial, or tribal court systems, with priority given to those demonstrating the greatest need. The percentage of appropriations available for corrections alternatives would be reduced from 80% to 70% to accommodate this new allotment. Matching grants for armored vests for state and territorial court officers are also included in the amendment. The Attorney General may require applicants for grants under Department of Justice programs to show eligibility. The United States Sentencing Commission, established in 1984, promulgates sentencing guidelines for federal courts in criminal cases. While these guidelines are now advisory, they still hold persuasive force. The Commission may enter into contracts to fulfill its responsibilities, with appropriated funds generally available for obligation only during the fiscal year for which they were allocated. The heads of executive agencies and the judicial branch have exceptions to the general rule regarding contracts and payments. Section 501 of P.L. 110-177 grants the Sentencing Commission authority, while Section 502 eases life insurance costs for magistrate judges. Senior judges can be designated to perform judicial duties within the circuit. Federal statutes outline the appointment authority for various positions in the judicial branch, with different judges having the power to appoint certain staff members. Only judges in \"regular active service\" and not senior judges can make certain decisions, such as presenting an appeal to all judges of a particular circuit. Senior judges can participate in en banc appeals if they were part of the original panel. They also have roles in the Judicial Conference and judicial councils, with their terms determined by active service judges. Certain senior judges, when designated, have full powers of a judge in their appointed court. The amendment expands the participation of senior judges in various court matters, including appointment of court officers and magistrates. It raises interpretative challenges due to the inclusion of retired judges in the appointment process. The amendment expands the participation of senior judges in court matters, including appointing court officers and magistrates. It also increases judgeships on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and directs studies on the impact of state and local laws on federal judicial security and the consequences of conviction under federal and state law."
