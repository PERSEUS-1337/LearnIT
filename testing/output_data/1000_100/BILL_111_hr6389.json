    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Prostate Research, Outreach, Screening, Testing, Access, and Treatment Effectiveness Act of 2010\" or the \"PROSTATE Act\". Congress finds that prostate cancer is a significant health issue, being the second leading cause of cancer death among men. In 2009, over 190,000 new cases were diagnosed, resulting in more than 27,000 deaths. Approximately 2,000,000 Americans are living with prostate cancer. Younger men are also at risk, with aggressive forms appearing in early middle age. Racial disparities exist, with African-Americans having double the mortality rates compared to the White population. Underserved rural populations also face higher rates of prostate cancer. Innovative methods using telehealth can improve rural access to high-quality care for prostate cancer. Urologists play a key role in diagnosing and treating prostate cancer patients. Many unanswered questions remain about the disparities in disease etiology, access to care, and community education. The causes of prostate cancer are still unknown. Prostate cancer causes are unknown, leading to significant overtreatment. Improved tests could reduce physical, emotional, and financial trauma for patients and save billions in healthcare costs. Prostate cancer research and health care programs should be coordinated across Federal agencies to improve accountability and encourage the translation of research into practice. This will help identify and implement best practices for effective prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of the disease. Prostate cancer coordination and education. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs, in collaboration with the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Health and Human Services, will establish an Interagency Prostate Cancer Coordination and Education Task Force. This task force will develop a summary of prostate cancer research advances and compile best practices for diagnosis, prevention, and treatment. They will also consider guidance for physicians on screening men over a certain age. The Interagency Prostate Cancer Coordination and Education Task Force will enable physicians to screen men over age 74 on a case-by-case basis, considering quality of life and family history. They will share and coordinate information on Federal research and health care programs to improve programs, identify gaps, promote research translation, and collaborate to maximize effects. The Interagency Prostate Cancer Coordination and Education Task Force aims to develop a comprehensive strategy for collaborative research and health care programs related to prostate cancer. This includes innovative approaches, key research questions, methodologies, and ensuring consistent action. They also focus on developing a coordinated message related to screening. The Prostate Cancer Task Force aims to develop a coordinated message for screening and treatment in Federal health programs. They will submit recommendations to improve research and health care programs within two years of establishment. The Prostate Cancer Task Force aims to improve research and health care programs by ensuring they are free of duplication, increasing public participation, disseminating information effectively, and expanding partnerships. The Prostate Cancer Task Force aims to improve research and health care programs by expanding partnerships between public and private entities, assessing cost savings, identifying priority action items, and determining funding needs for implementing recommendations. The Prostate Cancer Task Force includes representatives from Federal agencies to coordinate a uniform message on screening and treatment. Expert advisory panels are appointed for input and concurrence from individuals and organizations. The Prostate Cancer Task Force convenes meetings at least twice a year to gather input from experts in prostate cancer diagnosis, treatment, and research. Recommendations are submitted to Congress, and the Federal Advisory Committee Act applies to the Task Force. The Prostate Cancer Task Force meets biannually to consult experts on diagnosis, treatment, and research. Recommendations are sent to Congress, and the Task Force is exempt from termination under the Federal Advisory Committee Act. SEC. 4. PROSTATE CANCER RESEARCH. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs, in coordination with other departments, will establish a program to intensify prostate cancer research. This program aims to develop better diagnostic methods, understand the disease's causes, and focus on different ethnic and socioeconomic groups at higher risk. The establishment of a Prostate Cancer Scientific Advisory Board aims to accelerate real-time sharing of the latest research on prostate cancer. This includes expanding basic research, identifying novel agents for prevention and treatment, establishing clinical registries, and utilizing appropriate imaging modalities. The Prostate Cancer Scientific Advisory Board aims to accelerate research sharing and medicine delivery. The Underserved Minority Grant Program focuses on addressing racial disparities in prostate cancer incidence and mortality rates, barriers to care access, and clinical trial participation for underserved minorities. Men with a family history of prostate cancer require outreach, education, and access to imaging modalities. SEC. 5. TELEHEALTH AND RURAL ACCESS PILOT PROJECT. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will establish telehealth pilot projects to analyze clinical outcomes and cost effectiveness in underserved populations. Projects aim to improve specialist care coordination and utilize tumor boards for patient counseling. Eligible entities will be selected to participate in the pilot projects. The Secretary will prioritize entities in underserved areas, including African-Americans, Latin-Americans, Indian Health Service facilities, and rural areas for pilot projects. The evaluation will focus on the effective delivery of care for prostate cancer using telehealth services in underserved areas, improving nonmedical providers' capacity to offer health services for prostate cancer. The Secretary will prioritize underserved areas for pilot projects focusing on providing health services for prostate cancer. This includes exploring innovative medical home models with collaboration between urologists, oncologists, radiologists, and primary care teams. The effectiveness of using telehealth services for prostate cancer treatment in underserved areas will be evaluated, including the use of tumor boards for patient counseling. A report on the outcomes, cost savings, and efficiencies of the pilot projects will be submitted to Congress within 12 months. The Secretary will evaluate the outcomes, cost savings, and efficiencies of pilot projects focusing on providing health services for prostate cancer, including the use of telehealth services. Recommendations may be provided for expanding telehealth services. SEC. 6. EDUCATION AND AWARENESS. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will develop a national education campaign for prostate cancer, focusing on encouraging men to seek screening. The campaign will address racial disparities and target men with a family history of prostate cancer, with grants awarded to nonprofit private entities for implementation. The Secretary will award grants to nonprofit private entities for testing alternative outreach and education strategies. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2011 through 2015 is provided to carry out the Act."
