    "content": "The \"Coastal Resources Enhancement and Restoration Act of 2000\" establishes National Science Foundation research grants for coastal engineering and shoreline protection, allocating at least 10 percent of engineering research grants for this purpose starting in fiscal year 2001. Additionally, the Act includes provisions for supplemental environmental programs in coastal areas. SEC. 3 amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to allow federal agencies violating the Act to choose to construct artificial reefs or restore aquatic habitats instead of paying fines. SEC. 4 grants access to publicly owned shores. The amendment allows publicly owned shores with insufficient public access to be considered privately owned for eligibility and cost-sharing purposes. The Secretary of the Army will issue rules to ensure public access to publicly owned shores for which assistance is provided, with exceptions for environmentally sensitive areas. SEC. 5. BEACH NOURISHMENT ACCOUNT. Establishment of the Beach Nourishment Account in the Treasury to receive funds from the general fund for beach nourishment projects without the need for further appropriation. The Beach Nourishment Account in the Treasury receives funds for beach nourishment, shore protection, and erosion control projects. The Secretary of the Army carries out these projects in accordance with cost-sharing requirements and reports transactions to Congress. The Secretary of the Treasury invests funds in the account. The Secretary of the Treasury invests funds from the Beach Nourishment Account in interest-bearing obligations of the United States, which can be acquired on original issue or by purchasing outstanding obligations at market price. Any obligations acquired can be sold at market price, with interest and proceeds credited back to the account. SEC. 6. COMPREHENSIVE OCEAN OBSERVING SYSTEM PILOT PROGRAM. The Secretary of Commerce and the Administrator of NASA will jointly implement a pilot program to establish a comprehensive ocean monitoring network in the United States. Partnerships will be formed with local interests to collect a wide range of data on coastal oceans and inland waterways in real or near real-time, including wave heights, periods, swell direction, and water temperature. The pilot program will involve monitoring various aspects of coastal oceans and inland waterways, including wave heights, coastal currents, mammal movement, sewage outfall, water quality, fishing boat tracking, oil spill tracking, beach erosion data, weather, river mouth outflow sediment observation, and coastal mapping. Federal cooperation will include partnerships with the Geological Survey, Navy, and Environmental Protection Agency, with regional test projects established. The Secretary and the Administrator will establish 2 regional test projects, one in Southern California Bight and the other at a location to be determined. They will coordinate existing efforts in monitoring ocean conditions without duplicating them. $4,000,000 will be available annually from the Beach Nourishment Account for this program. In fiscal years 2001 through 2006, $2,000,000 per year will be allocated for 2 regional test projects as part of the program established by the Secretary and the Administrator."
