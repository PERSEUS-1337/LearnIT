    "content": "Title X of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include a new section called \"Physical Education for Progress Act.\" This part aims to provide grants and contracts to local educational agencies to enhance physical education programs for all K-12 students. Congress finds that physical education is crucial for children's development, improving their health, self-esteem, relationships, behavior, and independence. Participation in quality physical education programs leads to better health and fitness, especially important as the rate of overweight youth has more than doubled in the past 30 years. The prevalence of obesity among children in the US has increased significantly, costing the economy over $100 billion annually. Inactivity and poor diet contribute to 300,000 deaths yearly. Physically fit adults have lower risks of heart attacks and stroke. Children are not active enough, with less than 1 in 4 getting vigorous activity daily. Recommendations include daily physical education for all students from kindergarten to grade 12. The text emphasizes the importance of providing high-quality daily physical education programs for all students from kindergarten to grade 12, highlighting the lack of progress in achieving this goal despite recommendations made by Congress. It stresses the role of physical education in developing health-related fitness, physical competence, and cognitive understanding about physical activity to promote healthy and active lifestyles. The Secretary is authorized to award grants to local educational agencies for physical education programs for K-12 students, including equipment, curriculum development, and teacher training. Each local educational agency must submit an application to the Secretary outlining a plan to enhance physical education programs in schools to meet specific requirements. These requirements include providing students with a minimum of 150 minutes per week of instructional physical education and incorporating fitness education and assessment. Physical education programs in schools should include fitness education, motor skill instruction, cognitive concepts about physical fitness, social and cooperative skill development, multicultural perspectives, and appropriate physical activity for all children. Physical education teachers must have a bachelor's degree and receive ongoing professional development. Extracurricular activities like team sports and ROTC are not part of the assisted physical education curriculum. The Secretary ensures equitable distribution of grants and contracts between urban and rural educational agencies. Private school and home-schooled students can participate in funded activities. Reports are required for continued funding. \"Annual reports are required for continued funding of grants or contracts under this program. The Secretary must submit a report to Congress detailing program success and recommendations for improvement. Administrative costs are also addressed.\" \"Administrative costs for local educational agencies receiving grant funds are limited to 7 percent. The Federal share of project costs cannot exceed 90 percent in the first year and 75 percent in subsequent years. Funds must supplement, not replace, other available Federal, State, and local funds for physical education activities. Authorization of appropriations is also addressed.\" Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2000 to 2004 is set at $30,000,000 for 2000, $70,000,000 for 2001, and $100,000,000 for each year from 2002 to 2004. The allocated funds will remain available until expended."
