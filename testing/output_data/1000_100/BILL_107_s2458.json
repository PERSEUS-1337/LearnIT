Establishment of programs to promote a positive image of the United States in predominantly Muslim countries by increasing familiarity with American society and values. The Secretary of State will establish programs in predominantly Muslim countries to promote American society and values, including a journalism program for foreign journalists and students, and a demonstration program to assist foreign governments with libraries. The program aims to help foreign governments improve their public library systems, literacy, education, and youth recreation centers by providing training in library sciences and exchange opportunities for postsecondary study in the United States. Additionally, a program will be established to grant US citizens the opportunity to work as English language teaching assistants in middle and secondary schools for at least an academic year, with possible cost-sharing by the host government or local educational agency. The Secretary will expand sister city partnerships to increase global cooperation at the community level, focusing on economic development, municipal cooperation, health care, youth programs, disability advocacy, emergency preparedness, and humanitarian assistance. A program for middle and secondary school students to visit the US during school holidays for cultural and educational activities will be established. The Secretary aims to increase awards under the Fulbright exchange program for individuals from the US to study, teach, or conduct research in predominantly Muslim countries. This includes encouraging direct school-to-school linkages and coordinating visits with American schools for cultural and educational activities. The Secretary aims to increase awards for scholars and teachers from predominantly Muslim countries, including Hubert H. Humphrey Fellowships. Programs will be carried out under specific acts. The Secretary will establish a database of American and foreign alumni of exchange programs to promote networking and communication. Additionally, a report will be made on the inclusion of freedom and democracy advocates in educational and cultural exchange programs. The Secretary of State must submit a report to Congress within 90 days regarding the implementation of a specific section of the Human Rights, Refugee, and Other Foreign Relations Provisions Act of 1996. The report will detail the number of grants for exchange programs, measures taken to ensure inclusion of freedom and democracy supporters, and an evaluation of the openness of U.S. exchange programs to such individuals in certain countries. The Act does not authorize visas for inadmissible aliens. $35,000,000 is authorized for the Department of State for 2003 and 2004. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of State."
