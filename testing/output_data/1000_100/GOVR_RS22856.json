    "content": "Most civilian federal employees are covered by either the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) or the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS). CSRS employees hired before 1984 do not pay Social Security taxes or earn benefits, while FERS employees do. Both systems allow contributions to the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP), with only FERS employees receiving employer matching contributions. CSRS and FERS are not governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), which applies to private sector retirement plans. ERISA establishes rights for spouses of private-sector plan participants, requiring default joint and survivor annuities in defined benefit plans and written consent for non-spouse beneficiaries in defined contribution plans. Federal employee retirement benefits are governed by Title 5 of the United States Code. Title 5 of the United States Code, like ERISA, establishes rights for spouses of federal employees, requiring joint and survivor annuities and written consent to waive the survivor annuity. However, there are differences in when pension payments to a former spouse can begin between ERISA and Title 5. Title 5 of the United States Code, similar to ERISA, mandates joint and survivor annuities for spouses of federal employees. However, differences exist in when pension payments to a former spouse can commence. Under Title 5, payment to a former spouse is prohibited until the federal employee has separated from service, is eligible for an annuity, and has applied for it. Additionally, ERISA requires spousal consent for naming beneficiaries in defined contribution plans, while federal regulations allow flexibility in naming beneficiaries in the Thrift Savings Plan for federal employees. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) allows a former spouse of a federal employee to be named as a beneficiary in the event of the participant's death through a state court decree of divorce, annulment, or legal separation. The court order must specify the benefits, and OPM will only pay the benefits outlined in the order. CSRS retirement annuities are generally exempt from state court proceedings, but a former spouse can be awarded a share of the employee's annuity according to the terms of a court decree or property settlement. OPM will divide the retired employee's monthly annuity as directed by a court order and pay the specified share to the former spouse. Payments are made after OPM receives the court order. The right of a former spouse to receive a share of the annuity ends upon the retired employee's death. To receive a survivor annuity, the retiree must have elected it or a court order must specify it. A former spouse of a deceased federal employee may receive a CSRS survivor annuity if the employee elected a survivor annuity for the former spouse or if a state court decree of divorce, annulment, or separation requires a survivor annuity. The survivor annuity is 55% of the retired worker's single-life annuity. The retired worker's annual pension is reduced to fund the joint and survivor annuity. The sum of CSRS survivor annuities paid to the employee's spouse and former spouses cannot exceed 55% of the single-life annuity. If a full survivor annuity has been awarded to a former spouse through a court order, the employee's right to receive a share of the annuity ends upon their death. If a survivor annuity is awarded to a former spouse through a court order, the employee's current spouse is not entitled to receive it unless the former spouse dies or remarries before age 55. The annuity terminates if the former spouse dies or remarries before age 55, except if the marriage lasted at least 30 years after January 1, 1995. The annuity can be restarted in case of remarriage ending in death, divorce, or annulment. Any modifications to the survivor annuity must be made before the employee retires or dies. If a former spouse waives survivor annuity rights, OPM won't honor a court order awarding it. Refunding retirement contributions forfeits CSRS annuity rights. State courts can block refunds if a former spouse is entitled. FERS annuities can be divided per state court decree, with OPM following court orders to pay the former spouse. OPM will divide retirement annuity payments as directed by a court order, with payments starting after OPM receives the order. A former spouse's right to a share of the annuity ends upon the retiree's death unless a survivor annuity is elected or specified in a court order. Federal employees can elect a FERS survivor annuity for a former spouse, and state courts can award a survivor annuity in case of the employee's death. A survivor annuity under FERS is equal to 50% of the single-life annuity for the spouse of a federal employee if the employee passes away. This annuity is funded by reducing the retiree's single-life annuity by 10%. The total amount of FERS survivor annuities for all spouses cannot exceed 50% of the annuitant's single-life annuity. If a former spouse has been awarded a survivor annuity through a court order, the current spouse is not entitled to receive one. A court order can award a survivor annuity to a former spouse of a federal employee under FERS. The current spouse is not entitled to a survivor annuity if the former spouse is still alive or remarries before age 55. If the former spouse's marriage to the employee lasted at least 30 years, an exception applies to the termination of the survivor annuity. The annuity can restart in the same amount if the remarriage ends in death, divorce, or annulment. Any modifications to the survivor annuity must be made before the employee retires or dies. If a federal employee under FERS dies after completing at least 18 months but fewer than 10 years of service, the spouse may receive a lump-sum survivor benefit. This benefit can be paid to a former spouse or divided between a current and former spouse as per a court order. If the employee dies after 10 years of service, the surviving spouse or former spouse per court order receives a lump sum and annuity. Refunding contributions forfeits the right to a FERS annuity, which can be blocked by a state court. A former federal employee who refunds contributions to the retirement system forfeits the right to receive a FERS annuity. A state court can block this refund if a former spouse has been awarded a share of the employee's FERS retirement annuity or survivor annuity. The employee can designate beneficiaries for their TSP account balance by filing Form TSP-3 with the Thrift Board. Spousal consent is required for certain actions involving the TSP account, such as obtaining a loan or making withdrawals. The TSP account rules require spousal consent for certain actions like loans or withdrawals. CSRS participants do not need spousal consent, but notification is given. FERS participants' spouses are entitled to a joint and survivor annuity unless waived in writing. State court orders regarding divorce, annulment, alimony, and child support are recognized by the TSP. Former spouses of workers enrolled in FERS can receive Social Security benefits if married for at least 10 years. Remarriage may affect eligibility unless it ends by death, divorce, or annulment. Divorced spouses can receive survivor benefits if married for 10 years, but benefits may end if remarried before age 60. Children of deceased workers can still receive survivor benefits regardless of the former spouse's marital status."
