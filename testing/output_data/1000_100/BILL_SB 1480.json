    "title": "SB 1480",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 254.5 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to require claims for welfare and veterans' organization exemptions to be filed by February 15th each year with the assessor. The assessor must review the claims to ensure they meet specific requirements before approving them. Any capital investment for plant expansion must be justified by expected returns and serve community interests. Property claiming exemption must be used for exempt activity and not exceed necessary amount. Assessor can audit to verify compliance with requirements. Assessor can deny welfare exemption claim even with organizational clearance certificate. If the assessor determines property is ineligible for exemption, claimant will be notified in writing. Claimant can seek refund of taxes paid by filing claim with county, and if denied, can file refund action in superior court. An applicant granted a welfare exemption for property exempted under certain conditions is not required to reapply in subsequent years if there are no changes and the property is used by a governmental entity or nonprofit. The applicant must notify the assessor if they become ineligible or no longer own the property by February 15. The assessor will send an annual notice before the lien date to those exempt from filing. The notice provided by the board outlines the circumstances under which a property may no longer be eligible for exemption and advises the applicant to inform the assessor if this occurs. It also informs applicants on how to maintain eligibility for the welfare exemption in the next fiscal year and states that failure to do so does not automatically waive the exemption but may lead to further verification by the assessor. Upon indication of incorrectly granted welfare or veterans' organization exemptions, the assessor will reassess eligibility and cancel exemptions if necessary. Incorrectly allowed exemptions will result in an escape assessment with interest and a penalty for failure to notify the assessor. The board reviews the assessor's administration of welfare and veterans' organization exemptions to ensure proper implementation. Counties can request a review, equalization, or adjustment of property assessments by applying to the board in writing before November 30 or within 60 days of receiving a tax bill for assessments made outside the regular period. Every application for relief must include the necessary information and be filed with the assessor. The board will provide notice and a hearing to the applicant upon receiving a timely application. Failure to file on time will result in the applicant being barred from relief under Section 11 of Article XIII or this section. Section 4674 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended. Section 4674 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to allow for the retention of excess proceeds in the delinquent tax sale trust fund. Any remaining funds after distribution can be claimed by parties of interest in the property. Unclaimed excess proceeds may be transferred to the county general fund after a specified period, with deductions for administrative costs."
