    "content": "Some Members of Congress have long been interested in the rules governing patentable subject matter. The Leahy-Smith America Invents Act of 2011 restricted patents on human organisms and tax avoidance strategies. Courts and the USPTO have interpreted Section 101 broadly, but exceptions exist for laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas. The Supreme Court's decisions since 2010 have increased the use of Section 101 to invalidate patents and reject applications at the USPTO. Many patents granted under earlier standards may now be deemed invalid. The recent prominence of Section 101 in the U.S. patent system has sparked debate, with some calling it a crisis due to confusing legal standards set by the Supreme Court. Others believe these decisions could lead to better quality patents and reduce abusive litigation. This report reviews current patent law and proposed reforms. The report provides an overview of the patent system, discusses Supreme Court decisions on Section 101 of the Patent Act, examines implications for the information technology and life sciences industries, and reviews legislative reform options. Applicants must submit detailed applications to the USPTO for patent protection, meeting specific requirements outlined in the Patent Act of 1952. The patent acquisition process, known as \"prosecution,\" involves an examiner determining if the claimed invention meets patentability criteria such as novelty, nonobviousness, and utility. Novelty requires the invention to not be fully anticipated by prior art, while nonobviousness means it must not have been readily achievable based on prior art teachings. Utility is satisfied if the invention is operable and provides a tangible benefit. Section 101 of the Patent Act defines patentable subject matter as any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter. Process patents claim a series of steps to achieve a specific result, often related to methods of manufacture or use. The Supreme Court has defined patentable subject matter as processes, machines, manufactures, or compositions of matter. The term \"machine\" includes mechanical devices, \"manufacture\" refers to production of articles from raw materials, and \"composition of matter\" encompasses all compositions of substances. Courts and the USPTO have set limits on the types of processes that can be patented. The USPTO has limits on patentable processes, excluding laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas. The Supreme Court views these as essential tools for scientific and technological work. If a patent application meets requirements, it will be granted, giving the proprietor the right to exclude others from using the invention. A patent grants exclusivity to inventors for twenty years, allowing them to practice their inventions or license others. Patent owners must monitor competitors for infringement and may need to litigate to enforce their rights. Accused infringers can challenge a patent's validity or enforceability. The Federal Circuit has national jurisdiction over most patent appeals, with the Supreme Court having discretionary authority to review cases. Recent decisions have shaped the law of patentable subject matter, with key cases in 1980 and 1981 broadening the range of patentable subject matter for information technologies and life sciences. The Supreme Court has significantly impacted the patent system by narrowing patent eligibility through a series of decisions from 2010 to 2014. In the 2010 Bilski v. Kappos case, the Court ruled a method of hedging risk in commodities trading as unpatentable under Section 101. The USPTO rejected a patent application for a commodity provider's fixed price transactions, citing ineligibility under Section 101. The Federal Circuit questioned if the application was trying to claim a fundamental principle or a mental process. The Federal Circuit rejected Bilski's patent application for not claiming patentable subject matter under Section 101, as it did not tie to a specific machine or involve a physical transformation. The USPTO denied Bilski's patent application because his invention did not meet the physical object or substance requirement. The Supreme Court issued three opinions, with Justice Kennedy's opinion agreeing that Bilski's invention could not be patented based on the traditional rule that abstract ideas are not patentable. The machine or transformation test was considered an important clue but not the sole standard for identifying patentable processes. Justice Kennedy argued that hedging was a common economic practice and allowing it to be patented would create a monopoly over an abstract idea. Justice Stevens concurred, stating that the machine-or-transformation test was reliable but not exclusive. Justice Breyer also concurred, highlighting four points of agreement among all nine justices. In Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc., the Supreme Court shifted focus to life sciences, specifically regarding patents for methods of determining optimal dosages of thiopurine drugs. The Court agreed on key points, including the broad but limited range of patentable subject matter and that not everything achieving a \"useful, concrete, and tangible result\" qualifies for a patent. The patents claim methods of administering a thiopurine drug to a patient and determining the levels of the drug or its metabolites in red blood cells. If the measured metabolite levels are outside the known range, the physician adjusts the drug dosage for optimal treatment efficacy. The Supreme Court ruled that claims related to adjusting drug dosage based on metabolite levels in red blood cells were unpatentable as they were directed towards natural laws. The Court emphasized that patenting natural phenomena could hinder innovation. The Supreme Court recognized that inventions embody laws of nature but processes applying these laws in a useful way can be patented. In a specific case, the Court found claims involving relationships between metabolite concentrations and drug effectiveness to include steps beyond natural laws, such as administering the drug and adjusting dosage. Justice Breyer questioned whether the claims added enough to qualify as patent-eligible processes. The Supreme Court found that adding steps like administering drugs and determining metabolite levels did not make the inventions patentable. Justice Breyer emphasized that simply applying natural laws in a specific technological environment does not qualify for a patent. Conventional activities like measuring metabolites were considered routine and did not make the invention patentable. The Supreme Court in Mayo v. Prometheus ruled that adding steps like administering drugs and determining metabolite levels did not make inventions patentable. Justice Breyer emphasized that applying natural laws in a specific technological environment does not qualify for a patent. Conventional activities like measuring metabolites were considered routine and did not make the invention patentable. In Mayo v. Prometheus, the Supreme Court ruled that measuring metabolite levels alone did not make an invention patentable. Justice Breyer argued that applying natural laws in a specific context does not meet patent requirements. He rejected the idea that any step beyond stating a law of nature should fulfill patent standards, emphasizing that Section 101 standards are separate from novelty and nonobviousness requirements. In a June 2013 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that genomic DNA was ineligible for patenting under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7101 due to the \"product of nature\" doctrine. The Court was reluctant to depart from precedent denying patents on natural laws, as it may limit physician access to critical scientific data. The Supreme Court decision in Myriad in June 2013 ruled that genomic DNA was ineligible for patenting under the \"product of nature\" doctrine. This decision was a result of a lawsuit filed against the USPTO and Myriad Genetics, Inc. by the Association for Molecular Pathology and other plaintiffs. The lawsuit challenged Myriad Genetics' patents on BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes associated with breast and ovarian cancers. The U.S. District Court ruled the gene patents invalid, stating human genes are naturally occurring and not patentable. The U.S. District Court ruled that Myriad Genetics' patents on BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes were invalid as human genes are naturally occurring and not patentable. The Federal Circuit later reversed this decision, stating that isolated DNA is chemically manipulated to be markedly different from native DNA, making it patentable subject matter. The Supreme Court vacated the judgment and remanded the case back to the Federal Circuit for reconsideration. The Supreme Court ruled that Myriad Genetics did not create anything by discovering the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, stating that isolating DNA does not constitute an act of invention. They were unimpressed by Myriad's claims regarding isolated DNA but viewed claims on \"complementary DNA\" more favorably. The Supreme Court ruled that cDNA, synthetic DNA with a complementary sequence to natural DNA, could be patented as it is not a \"product of nature.\" The Court clarified that the case did not involve innovative gene manipulation methods or altered nucleotide sequences. The Supreme Court ruled that isolated genomic DNA is not patent eligible under \u00a7101, while cDNA can be patented as it is a synthetic creation not found in nature. Justice Scalia concurred with the judgment but disagreed with the fine details of molecular biology. In a recent decision, the Court considered the patentability of a computer-implemented financial exchange system in Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank. The Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank case involved a computer-implemented financial exchange system designed to mitigate settlement risk. The patents in question covered a method for exchanging financial obligations, a computer system to carry out the methods, and a computer-readable medium containing program code. The district court and Federal Circuit ruled the inventions unpatentable as they represented a basic business or financial concept. The Supreme Court agreed to hear the case to address the patentability of computer-implemented inventions. The Supreme Court upheld the Federal Circuit's decision that the patents in question were directed to a patent-ineligible abstract idea. Justice Thomas explained the two-part test for identifying patents claiming laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas. Justice Thomas established a two-part test for identifying patents claiming abstract ideas, natural phenomena, or laws of nature. The Court determined that the method claims in question were directed to the abstract idea of intermediated settlement, and lacked an inventive concept to transform the idea into a patent-eligible application. The Supreme Court rejected patent claims involving abstract ideas implemented on a computer, stating that simply adding generic computer hardware does not make an abstract idea patentable. The Court emphasized the importance of a specific technological environment and meaningful restrictions in patent claims. This decision aligns with previous rulings on patent eligibility. The current law regarding patent eligibility involves a two-part test to determine if an invention is eligible for patenting. The Court analyzes if a claim recites a law of nature, natural phenomenon, or abstract idea, and if it includes additional inventive elements. If a claim covers every practical application of a fundamental concept, it cannot be patented. Recitation of routine hardware does not affect eligibility under Section 101. The machine-or-transformation test is a useful guidepost for patent eligibility, with Section 101 determinations often resolved early in litigation. Courts do not always require a formal construction of patent claims to address Section 101 challenges. Statistical analysis shows a high probability of invalidating challenged claims, with a 66.5% average invalidation rate as of June 19, 2016. The Federal Circuit upheld 3 patents and invalidated 34 patents, with an average invalidation rate of 91.9%. The USPTO rejected over 36,000 published patent applications under Alice, indicating a good chance of success in invalidating patent claims not complying with Section 101. Recent Supreme Court interest in patentable subject matter has impacted patent validity in information technologies and life sciences. The courts have invalidated numerous patents on computer-related inventions following standards set in Bilski and Alice. Patents that lack specific solutions or improvements in technology are most vulnerable to Section 101 challenges. The curr_chunk discusses various patents related to computer systems and methods, including extracting data from hard copy documents, administering life insurance policies, and processing credit applications over electronic networks. These patents were invalidated in a representative decision. The Federal Circuit deemed the concept of providing out-of-region access to a local broadcast as an abstract idea, not directed to how to implement out-of-region broadcasting on a cellular telephone. The Federal Circuit concluded that a patent claiming the idea of out-of-region broadcasting on a cellular telephone was abstract and did not describe how the invention achieved the claimed functions. The court has upheld patents in cases involving e-commerce systems, information management systems, Internet content filtering, and animated character expressions, with claims more likely to survive Section 101 if they avoid broad functional language and specify specific structures for achieving results. The Supreme Court decisions in Mayo v. Prometheus and Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics have had consequences for the life sciences industry. Mayo v. Prometheus affects predictive diagnostic methods dependent on biomarkers, making patents narrow or difficult to obtain. The Myriad case questions the patentability of isolated bodily substances like genes and proteins. Fewer judicial opinions have addressed Section 101 in life sciences compared to information technologies, with the 2015 ruling in Ariosa Diagnostics, Inc. v. Sequenom, Inc. being a notable case. The 2015 ruling in Ariosa Diagnostics, Inc. v. Sequenom, Inc. involved a non-invasive prenatal diagnostic method for detecting fetal DNA in maternal plasma or serum. Sequenom held the exclusive license for U.S. Patent No. 6,258,540, which focused on amplifying and detecting paternally inherited nucleic acid of fetal origin in the sample. The Federal Circuit explained the discovery of cell-free fetal DNA in maternal plasma or serum and the implementation of the method using known laboratory techniques. The Federal Circuit ruled that the prenatal diagnostic method for detecting fetal DNA in maternal plasma or serum was not patentable as it focused on a naturally occurring phenomenon and conventional techniques. Judge Linn expressed dissatisfaction with the decision, highlighting the significance of the invention in replacing invasive prenatal diagnosis methods. Congress has options regarding patentable subject matter laws. No new bills have been introduced since the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act in 2011. Industry associations have proposed changes to Section 101. The AIPLA and IPO have similar proposals to replace Section 101. The AIPLA proposal suggests replacing Section 101 with new language that defines patentable inventions and sets eligibility standards without considering other patent requirements. The IPO and ABA have proposed amendments to Section 101 regarding patent eligibility, focusing on defining eligible subject matter for patents and addressing preemptive claims. The AIPLA and ABA propose amendments to Section 101 for patent eligibility, emphasizing the need to define eligible subject matter and prevent preemptive claims. The ABA Section on Intellectual Property and IPO criticize recent Supreme Court decisions for injecting ambiguity into patent eligibility criteria, turning it into a patentability test. Some argue against the need for legislative reform, stating that restrictive patent eligibility rules have not impacted innovation or investment significantly. The proposed amendments to eligibility rules could eliminate limits on software patenting and subject matter eligibility. The AIPLA proposal would change the current statutory phrase to restrict patent entitlement. This may unintentionally remove common law patentability standards. Patents in software and life sciences have been controversial, with recent Supreme Court decisions making patenting in these fields more challenging. The debate over patentable subject matter, particularly in software and life sciences, has intensified due to recent Supreme Court decisions. Section 101 is seen as maintaining a balance between innovation and patent rights, but concerns exist about potential limitations on patent availability impacting innovation and investment in the US. This debate may lead to further examination of what types of inventions should be eligible for patents."
