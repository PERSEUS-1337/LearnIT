    "content": "The \"Small Lands Tracts Conveyance Act\" allows for special conveyance authority regarding small parcels of national forest system land and public lands. The \"Small Lands Tracts Conveyance Act\" defines terms like \"adjacent landholder\" and \"eligible Federal lands parcel\" for special conveyance authority over small parcels of National Forest System land or public lands. The \"Small Lands Tracts Conveyance Act\" outlines criteria for eligible Federal lands parcels, including population requirements, absence of existing rights, lack of exceptional resources, and non-habitat for endangered species. Exceptional resources are defined as valuable scientific, historic, cultural, or recreational resources on public lands. The \"Small Lands Tracts Conveyance Act\" specifies that eligible Federal lands must be documented by a governmental authority and require extraordinary conservation for public benefit. The term \"Indian tribe\" and \"National Forest System land\" are defined within the Act. The term \"public lands\" excludes certain areas managed by the Forest Service, such as national monuments, wilderness areas, and lands held in trust for Indian tribes. The term \"public lands\" excludes certain Bureau of Land Management-managed lands in national monuments, conservation areas, recreation areas, and wilderness areas. The term \"public lands\" excludes certain Bureau of Land Management-managed lands in national monuments, conservation areas, recreation areas, and wilderness areas. Regional Forester concerned means the Regional Forester with jurisdiction over the National Forest System land of a specific Forest Service Region. The Director or Regional Forester shall select an eligible Federal lands parcel for conveyance in response to a request from an adjacent landholder or upon the recommendation of the Bureau of Land Management District Office. The Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior shall create a process for adjacent landholders to request to purchase eligible Federal lands parcels. The process must be consistent with other public purchase request processes and be open to the public and available online. The process for adjacent landholders to request to purchase eligible Federal lands parcels must be open to the public within 90 days of the enactment of the Act. The Director or Regional Forester will review the parcel within 30 days of receiving the request to determine if it meets the criteria for conveyance. If the parcel does not meet the criteria, the request may be rejected. If a parcel of National Forest System land or public lands covered by an adjacent landholder request fails to meet the criteria for conveyance, the concerned Director or Regional Forester will provide the landowner with a written explanation detailing the reasons for rejection, including which elements of the definition of eligible Federal lands parcel were not satisfied and how the continued administration by the Bureau of Land Management or the Forest Service would impact the parcel and surrounding economy. The Federal Government needs to maintain ownership of the parcel and would be the best land ownership steward. An eligible Federal lands parcel conveyed under this section may not exceed 160 acres unless approved for additional acreage. An adjacent landholder may acquire one eligible Federal lands parcel per year, with the option for additional parcels if they are less than 160 acres in size. The Director or Regional Forester must provide public notice of available eligible Federal lands parcels for conveyance. The total acreage acquired by an adjacent landholder cannot exceed 160 acres unless approved for additional acreage. The Director or Regional Forester must provide public notice of available eligible Federal lands parcels for conveyance. Single adjacent landholders can negotiate sales, while multiple adjacent landholders must use competitive bidding procedures. Rejection of offers is also allowed. The Director or Regional Forester may reject offers that do not meet minimum requirements. Purchasers must comply with local land use ordinances. Eligible Federal lands parcels must be sold according to specified procedures. The Director or Regional Forester shall convey all right, title, and interest of the United States in a parcel to be sold. An appeals process is available if a request or offer is rejected, using the expedited Forest Service appeals process. The expedited Forest Service appeals process can be used for rejection of requests or offers. The Director or Regional Forester must require a cash payment equal to the fair market value for the sale of eligible Federal lands parcels. The fair market value of an eligible Federal lands parcel is established by an appraisal submitted by the adjacent landholder, unless rejected within 45 days. If rejected, another appraisal must be conducted within 30 days. The Secretary of the Treasury establishes a fund for the treatment of proceeds. The Secretary of the Treasury establishes a special fund in the Treasury for collecting and distributing funds from the conveyance of eligible Federal lands parcels. Funds collected are distributed annually to States where the Federal Government owns more than 33 percent of the land area. 50 percent of the amount collected from a conveyance is distributed to the State. The conveyance of eligible Federal lands parcels results in funds being distributed to States, with 50 percent going to the State of conveyance and the remaining 50 percent divided equally among other identified States. States receiving funds must use them for purchasing additional eligible Federal lands parcels and complying with Federal requirements such as the Endangered Species Act. The Director or Regional Forester must ensure the purchaser covers costs for conveyance, including survey, appraisal, environmental documentation, and administrative costs. Refunds are given if the purchaser pays more than necessary in advance. The Director or Regional Forester must ensure the purchaser covers costs for conveyance, including survey, appraisal, environmental documentation, and administrative costs. Refunds are given if the amount collected exceeds the actual costs incurred, with excess amounts credited back to the fund used for the conveyance. The conveyance of eligible Federal lands parcels should be completed within 18 months. Such conveyances are categorically excluded from environmental assessment requirements. This authority is additional to existing sale authority under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act."
