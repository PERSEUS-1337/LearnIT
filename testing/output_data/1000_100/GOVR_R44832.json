    "content": "Prescription drug affordability has become a major concern due to the rapid rise in retail drug spending. Factors contributing to this increase include the introduction of new drugs at higher prices, fewer brand-name drugs losing patent protection, and a forecasted 6.3% annual growth in drug spending. Despite efforts to reduce growth rates, retail drug spending is expected to outpace other areas of medical spending in the next decade. This report will address common questions about government and private-sector policies. This report addresses frequently asked questions about government and private-sector policies affecting drug prices and availability, including federally funded research, regulation of direct-to-consumer advertising, legal restrictions on reimportation, and federal price negotiation. It provides a broad overview of the issues and references more in-depth CRS products. The appendix includes references to relevant congressional hearings. The National Health Expenditures (NHE) accounts compiled by CMS track annual spending on prescription drugs in retail settings. The United States spent $328.6 billion on prescription drugs in 2016, forecasted to reach $338.1 billion in 2017, accounting for 10% of national health care spending. By 2027, prescription drug spending is expected to rise to about 11% of total health care expenditures. Retail drug spending has ranged from 5% to 10% of total health care expenditures since 1960. However, the data only provide information on retail drug sales, leading to an incomplete picture of U.S. drug spending. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued a study in April 2016 to estimate total U.S. prescription drug spending, including retail and institutional use. Various studies show a trend of increasing drug spending in recent years, with retail drug spending growing at a double-digit pace from the 1980s to the early 2000s. Retail drug spending in the U.S. slowed from 2003 to 2013 due to various factors such as the economic recession, fewer expensive new drugs, and increased use of generic drugs. However, spending accelerated in 2014 with a 12.4% increase, followed by 8.9% in 2015. Growth slowed to 1.3% in 2016 and is forecasted to be 2.9% in 2017. Retail drug spending is projected to increase by about 6.3% annually through 2027, driven by faster drug price growth, especially for specialty drugs. Retail drug spending in the U.S. is projected to increase due to faster drug price growth, particularly for specialty drugs. This growth rate is expected to be higher than other areas of health care spending, with physician services and hospital care growing at lower rates. Congressional hearings have been held to address the sharp increases in drug prices. Retail prescription drug spending can be influenced by changes in drug availability, pricing, and usage volume. The increase in retail drug spending in 2014 and 2015 was driven by new high-cost drugs, price increases for existing drugs, and the impact of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The rate of prescription drug spending slowed in 2016 due to fewer new drug approvals, less use of high-cost drugs, and a deceleration in spending for diabetes treatment. Drug mix refers to the cost difference between new and older drugs. Newly approved generic drugs can lower therapy costs. FDA approved many expensive specialty drugs for hepatitis C, cancer, diabetes, and heart disease. In 2016, over half of U.S. drug spending growth came from drugs less than two years old. Hepatitis C drugs drove up spending in 2014 and 2015 but impact is decreasing as prices drop. Since 2009, patents for best-selling brand-name drugs have expired, leading to the production of new generic versions. In 2012, spending for brand-name drugs subject to generic competition fell by $32.6 billion. Changes in drug mix, particularly the development of biologics with high introductory prices, will continue to impact drug spending. FDA has approved biosimilar substitutes for some biologics, but savings from brands losing patent protection have decreased since 2012. Prescription drug prices have risen faster than overall U.S. inflation since 2014, with drug inflation mainly driven by price increases for brand-name drugs and adoption of expensive new innovator drugs. Despite the approval of biosimilar substitutes for some biologics, savings from brands losing patent protection have decreased since 2012. Prescription drug prices have risen faster than overall U.S. inflation since 2014, mainly driven by price increases for brand-name drugs and adoption of expensive new innovator drugs. The ACA expansion of prescription drug coverage has boosted demand for prescription drugs. Generic price increases were not a major contributor to inflation according to a 2016 HHS study. Brand-name drug prices rose 10.7% from 2015 to 2016, while generic drug prices declined by 8.7% over the same period. Biologics and specialty drugs have driven much of the price inflation in the brand-name drug category. The ACA expansion of prescription drug coverage has led to a significant increase in drug spending for insured consumers. This increase is mainly driven by higher utilization, with Medicaid coverage also expanding to include drug coverage for low-income individuals. The aging population, particularly the baby boomers, has also contributed to the rising demand for prescription drugs. Patients aged 50 and older accounted for a majority of dispensed prescriptions and the increase in drug dispensing since 2011. Out-of-pocket spending for prescriptions has decreased over the years, with consumer payments making up a smaller percentage of U.S. retail drug spending compared to previous years. Out-of-pocket spending for prescriptions has decreased over the years, with consumer payments making up a smaller percentage of U.S. retail drug spending compared to previous years. In 2017, out-of-pocket spending declined to 13.2% of drug spending, versus 86.2% for commercial payers and taxpayer-financed health programs. By 2026, out-of-pocket spending is forecast to account for 12.1% of retail drug costs. Consumers may still face high out-of-pocket expenses depending on factors such as the specific drugs prescribed, insurance coverage, health plan policies, and eligibility for manufacturer drug discount coupons or charitable assistance programs. Health plans have been increasing cost sharing for prescription drugs to control spending. From 2012 to 2015, the share of plans with a drug deductible rose to 46% from 23%. Deductibles are common in plans sold on ACA exchanges. Tiered pricing and coinsurance for expensive drugs are becoming more prevalent, with consumers facing higher financial burdens. The widening of health plan price tiers has increased financial burden on consumers using higher-priced drugs. In 2017, enrollees in employer-sponsored health plans with multiple drug tiers had higher co-payments for expensive drugs compared to generic ones. Cost-sharing increases have been partially offset by ACA regulations and pharmaceutical manufacturer assistance programs. Generic drug use rates have risen as cost sharing remains low for them. The out-of-pocket costs for retail drugs have declined overall, but the number of consumers with high costs has increased, especially for those with serious conditions or needing specialty drugs. In 2014, nearly 3% of enrollees had out-of-pocket costs exceeding $1,000, accounting for a significant portion of drug spending. The share of people with high drug costs has tripled since 2004, with median out-of-pocket spending for outpatient specialty drugs rising by 46% from 2003 to 2014. Out-of-pocket spending for retail prescription drugs has declined overall, with median spending for nonspecialty drugs decreasing by 57% from 2003 to 2014. Per person out-of-pocket spending is forecasted to decrease to $137 in 2017 before gradually increasing to $207 by 2026. Government subsidized drug coverage has expanded, leading to a rise in the government share of U.S. retail prescription drug spending. The government's share of U.S. retail prescription drug spending has increased from 25% in 2005 to an estimated 44.1% in 2017, with a forecasted rise to 47% by 2026. Unlike other countries, the U.S. does not have a centralized system for government-sponsored drug benefits or setting drug prices. Various departments and agencies oversee different systems for drug discounts and procurement, including market-based negotiations in Medicare Part D and direct procurement in the Veterans Health Administration. FDA regulates drug safety and effectiveness but does not have authority to set drug prices. The FDA does not have the authority to set drug prices or consider them during the approval process. Federal agencies can secure discounts for prescription drugs, but the discounts vary among programs. Medicaid rebates were 47% of Medicaid spending in 2012, while only 15% of Part D spending. Some Medicaid rebates were significantly larger than Part D rebates for the same drugs. Legislation has been introduced to give the HHS Secretary more power to negotiate Medicare Part D drug prices. Federal health care programs like Medicare Part D, Medicare Part B, Medicaid, and the Veterans Health Administration health system were chosen as they are among the largest federal health programs. Medicare Part D is a market-oriented program where commercial health payers compete for enrollees based on drug coverage price and scope. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 prohibits the HHS Secretary from intervening in negotiations to bolster market competition. The Medicare Part D program prohibits the HHS Secretary from intervening in negotiations between plan sponsors, drug manufacturers, and pharmacies. Congress has debated the effectiveness of the market-based model in controlling drug prices and enrollee costs. Program spending has been below initial budget projections, with drug rebates increasing over the years. A 2014 CBO study found that Part D premiums were lower in areas with robust plan competition, but Part D plans have higher average drug prices than Medicaid. Some lawmakers propose modifying the noninterference provision to allow the Secretary to negotiate drug prices for Medicare Part D, leveraging the combined purchasing power of beneficiaries for larger discounts. In 2007, the House approved a bill for this purpose, but it was not passed by the Senate. A CBO analysis suggested that significant savings would require the Secretary to have authority to set prices and create a central formulary. Several proposals have been made to modify the noninterference provision in Medicare Part D, including giving the Secretary authority to negotiate drug prices and create a central formulary. Patient and consumer groups have raised concerns about potential reductions in drug coverage. Lawmakers have introduced various bills to address this issue, with the Obama Administration recommending price negotiation for high-cost drugs. The Trump Administration has also suggested changes, such as requiring plans to pass on more drug rebates to enrollees and moving certain drugs from Part B to Part D for lower prices. Lawmakers have proposed legislation to apply Medicaid's rebates to Part D drugs for low-income enrollees, aiming to lower costs. The CBO predicts initial savings, but warns that prices may rise over time. State governments regulate drug use and pricing, with some offering patient assistance programs for free prescription drugs to low-income residents. States are implementing various approaches to address prescription drug spending and access, including setting caps on cost sharing for drugs and requiring transparency in drug prices. Vermont passed a law in 2016 that requires manufacturers to disclose drugs with large price increases and justify the price hikes to the state attorney general. This legislation aims to force drug companies to justify prices based on costs. The United States is taking steps to address prescription drug spending, including legislation to justify prices based on costs and prohibiting gag clauses in pharmacy contracts. Maine allowed drug imports from other countries, but a federal court ruled it unconstitutional. The U.S. spends more on prescription drugs than other nations, with a projected increase in global drug spending share. The United States spends more on prescription drugs than other nations, projected to reach 12%-13% of global drug spending by 2021. Studies show U.S. per capita spending is significantly higher than the OECD average, with prices for specific drugs often double that of other countries. Academic research suggests reasons for the higher U.S. spending and prices include faster adoption of new drugs and patent protections. The United States spends more on prescription drugs than other nations, with higher per capita spending and prices due to faster adoption of new drugs and patent protections. OECD countries may have government-run health care systems that set price limits for drugs, while EU nations use external reference pricing. Value-based pricing is used in national health programs, and in Canada, the Common Drug Review assesses the effectiveness of new and existing drugs. The U.S. government and commercial payers are experimenting with alternative pricing models for drugs, such as value-based purchasing. The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) produces reports on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of newly approved drugs, raising concerns in the pharmaceutical industry. The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) has raised concerns in the pharmaceutical industry with its research methodology for valuing prescription drugs. The pharmaceutical industry focuses more on clinical trials than on discovery activity, making it challenging to assign credit for therapeutic advancements. Various studies have tried to quantify the contribution of research to drug development. Various studies have attempted to quantify the contribution of publicly funded research to the discovery of new drugs, compared to private industry. A study found that only a small percentage of new drugs approved by the FDA originated from sources other than private industry. Another study focused on truly innovative new drugs, known as new molecular entities (NMEs), and found that a significant percentage of them originated from publicly funded work. The study by Ashley J. Stevens et al. in 2011 found that 9.3% of drugs approved by the FDA from 1990 to 2007 resulted from publicly funded research. Of the total drug applications, 19% that received priority review were from publicly funded research, showing a higher rate compared to private-sector research. The FDA gives priority review to drugs that offer significant improvements in treating serious conditions. Publicly funded research tends to discover drugs with important clinical effects. A 2011 study by Stevens considered public sector research involvement in drug discovery. The study evaluated platform technologies that enabled the development of FDA-approved products. These technologies, developed with public funds, were excluded from the study as they were not used to develop specific drug candidates. Without these technologies, the pharmaceutical industry's economic outlook may have been significantly different. The 2018 study found that public funding from the NIH was associated with every NME approved by the FDA from 2010 to 2016. Up to 20% of the NIH budget allocation, around $100 billion, contributed to research associated with new drug approvals during that period. This suggests that the NIH's contribution to new drug research is greater than previously thought. The cost of developing specific drugs is not publicly disclosed, but academic studies estimate average spending for drug development. The Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development uses data from large drug manufacturers to estimate average spending for clinical research on new drugs. According to a 2014 Tufts estimate, the pretax cost of developing an FDA-approved prescription drug was $2.6 billion. The 2014 Tufts estimate for developing an FDA-approved prescription drug was $2.6 billion, including $1.4 billion in clinical spending and $1.2 billion in time costs. Academic and government research has questioned the assumptions made in the study, such as the rate of return needed to attract capital and the impact of federal tax breaks. A 2016 HHS study noted that development costs range from $1.2 billion to $2.6 billion and are influenced by factors like development time and cost of capital. Price transparency legislation is being debated in Congress and state legislatures to compel drugmakers to provide data on research, marketing, and other costs for high-priced drugs. Research and development costs are not always the main factor in drug pricing, as shown in studies of specific drugs like Gilead Pharmaceutical's hepatitis C drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni. The pricing strategy for hepatitis C drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni by Gilead focused on maximizing revenue rather than research and development costs. Pfizer's pricing of the breast cancer drug Ibrance considered factors like existing drug prices, reimbursement, and prescriber feedback. The US allows direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription drugs, with the FDA regulating to prevent false or misleading information. The FDA has the authority to regulate direct-to-consumer ads for prescription drugs to ensure accuracy and balance in the information provided. Pharmaceutical companies can deduct advertising expenses from their taxes, and DTC advertising is just one part of their marketing efforts. Pharmaceutical advertising has evolved since 1962 when the FDA was given authority over prescription drug advertising. The FDA regulates direct-to-consumer prescription drug advertising to ensure accuracy. Pharmaceutical advertising has evolved over the years, with DTC advertising reaching over $6 billion in 2015. Recent data shows a rapid increase in DTC advertising in the past few years. The FDA regulates direct-to-consumer prescription drug advertising to ensure accuracy. DTC advertising spending increased to over $6 billion from 2012 to 2015, with a focus on newly introduced drugs. Internet-based drug ads are the fastest-growing area of promotion, while TV promotions remain flat. FDA requires drug companies to submit ads for assessment. Supporters of pharmaceutical advertising argue it leads to more informed consumers who are proactive in their healthcare. Critics believe it may result in inappropriate prescribing and increased drug spending, especially for new brand-name drugs with higher prices. The effectiveness and safety of these new drugs compared to existing treatments are often unclear. Recent studies suggest a link between drug advertising and increased use of prescription drugs. A 2015 study found that a 10% rise in drug advertising views leads to a 5.4% increase in filled prescriptions for the advertised drugs. Government reports have shown that advertising may have direct benefits but also encourage the use of advertised drugs even if alternatives may be more appropriate. Public opinion on direct-to-consumer (DTC) drug advertisements is divided, with concerns about insufficient information on benefits and risks. Congress has debated restricting DTC drug advertising to protect public health and prevent unnecessary spending. In November 2015, the American Medical Association and the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists recommended a ban on direct-to-consumer (DTC) drug ads. Legislation in the 114th Congress proposed a moratorium on advertising for new drugs. Concerns persist about promoting new drugs to consumers without long-term safety and effectiveness evidence. The Institute of Medicine suggested in 2006 that the FDA restrict DTC advertising of new drugs for two years post-introduction. Congress has debated a moratorium on advertising for new drugs and legislation to disallow federal tax deductions for pharmaceutical DTC advertising. FDA regulates the sale of pharmaceuticals in the United States, requiring detailed clinical data on safety and effectiveness for marketing approval. The Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987 clarified that only the manufacturer of an FDA-approved prescription drug can legally bring it back into the United States, even if it was sold or transferred to a foreign country. The Medicine Equity and Drug Safety Act of 2000 allowed pharmacists and wholesalers to import FDA-approved prescription drugs, but in practice, this has not been widely implemented. The MEDS Act, included in the Medicare Modernization and Prescription Drug Act of 2003, required the HHS Secretary to certify to Congress that importing prescription drugs would not pose additional risks and would reduce costs. However, no HHS Secretary has made these certifications, leading to the importation provision never being carried out. This has resulted in consumers, pharmacists, and wholesalers being prohibited from importing prescription drugs from abroad. The MEDS Act and MMA legislation aimed to allow importation of prescription drugs from abroad, but it has not been implemented due to lack of certifications from HHS Secretary. Lawmakers have attempted to bypass restrictions on drug importation through the agriculture appropriations bill. FDA enforcement on importation has been lenient. The FDA has a lenient enforcement policy on personal importation of non-FDA-approved drugs for personal use, allowing individuals to bring in a 90-day supply with written affirmation and physician information. This policy aims to save FDA resources and permit medical treatments not available in the US. The FDA has a lenient policy on personal importation of non-FDA-approved drugs for personal use, allowing individuals to bring in a 90-day supply with written affirmation and physician information. Some states have tried to enact laws allowing prescription drug importation, but the policy is now mainly used by consumers seeking lower foreign prices for FDA-approved drugs available in the United States. The Senate Special Committee on Aging discussed Valeant Pharmaceuticals' business model and its impact on patients and the healthcare system. They also addressed sudden price spikes in decades-old prescription drugs and off-patent drugs. The Senate Committee on Finance examined the proposed Medicare Part B Drug Demonstration. The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions discussed the cost of prescription drugs and examined the National Academies of Sciences report on making medicines affordable. The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions held hearings on various topics related to prescription drugs, including EpiPen price increases, generic drug user fee amendments, biosimilar implementation, and pharmaceutical competition barriers. The House Energy and Commerce Committee conducted hearings on topics such as the drug supply chain, utilization of the 340B Drug Pricing Program, patient access to investigational drugs, and FDA's regulation of over-the-counter drugs. The FDA's regulation of over-the-counter drugs was discussed in hearings by the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The topics included the Prescription Drug User Fee Program, Generic Drug and Biosimilar User Fee Program, Medicare Drug Experiment, and Antitrust Concerns related to the FDA approval process. The curr_chunk discusses various hearings related to antitrust concerns, FDA approval process, competition in pharmacy benefit manager and pharmacy marketplaces, federally funded cancer research coordination and innovation, impact of voluntary restricted distribution systems in the pharmaceutical supply chain, and rising prices of EpiPens. The curr_chunk provides links to hearings on the rising price of EpiPens and developments in the prescription drug market."
