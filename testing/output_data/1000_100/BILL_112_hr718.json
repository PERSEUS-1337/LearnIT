    "content": "The \"Huntington's Disease Parity Act of 2011\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. Congress finds that Huntington's Disease is a progressive neurological condition causing physical and mental deterioration in approximately 30,000 individuals in the US, with 200,000 more at genetic risk. Symptoms include loss of movement control, cognitive decline, and behavioral changes. No effective treatment exists to halt or slow the disease progression. Adult-onset Huntington's Disease typically presents symptoms between ages 30-50, while late-onset occurs after 50 with milder effects. Juvenile Huntington's Disease affects those under 19 and progresses rapidly. The disease leads to personality changes, anxiety, depression, and inability to work. The Social Security Administration has not updated its rules for evaluating Huntington's Disease since 1985, leading to outdated and inaccurate designations. This impacts individuals relying on Social Security Disability Insurance and Medicare. After qualifying for Social Security Disability Insurance, individuals with Huntington's Disease face a 24-month waiting period before receiving Medicare benefits, despite often becoming incapacitated before reaching the age-eligibility requirement of 65 years. In contrast, the Centers for Medicaid & Medicare Services waived this waiting period for individuals disabled by ALS in 2000, highlighting the urgent need to update guidelines for Huntington's Disease. Individuals with Huntington's Disease face challenges in accessing disability benefits and Medicare coverage due to a 24-month waiting period. There is a need to revise the evaluation criteria and remove this waiting period, similar to the exemption for ALS patients. Revision of medical and evaluation criteria for evaluating disability caused by adult-onset and juvenile Huntington's Disease. The Commissioner of Social Security will revise medical and evaluation criteria for Huntington's Disease under titles II and XVI of the Social Security Act in consultation with medical experts. This includes amending sections 11.00 and 12.00 of the Listing of Impairments to provide criteria for Huntington's Disease and remove references to \"Huntington's Chorea.\" The Commissioner of Social Security will amend the Listing of Impairments to include medical and evaluation criteria for Huntington's Disease in adults and children, including Juvenile Huntington's Disease. The term \"Listing of Impairments\" refers to appendix 1 to subpart P of part 404 of title 20 of the Code of Federal Regulations. The Social Security Act is amended to waive the 24-month waiting period for Medicare coverage for individuals diagnosed with Huntington's Disease. This amendment applies to benefits under title XVIII of the Social Security Act for items and services provided after the enactment of this Act."
