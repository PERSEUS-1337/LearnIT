    "content": "The \"Landmine Elimination Act of 1997\" is the short title of this Act. It includes findings related to landmines. Congress finds that on August 4, 1995, the Senate voted to impose a moratorium on US use of anti-personnel landmines starting in February 1999. In April 1996, senior retired US military officers urged the President to ban the production, stockpiling, sale, and use of landmines, stating it would be humane and militarily responsible. In Vietnam, over 7,000 US military personnel were killed and over 56,000 were injured by landmines. The curr_chunk discusses the impact of landmines in various countries, including Bosnia, where soldiers have been killed and injured. It also mentions the efforts of the United States and international organizations to ban anti-personnel landmines. The United States and international organizations are working towards a treaty banning anti-personnel landmines, with negotiations set to begin in Oslo, Norway in September 1997. The United States is aiming to secure broad support for a legally binding international treaty banning anti-personnel landmines to further its security and humanitarian interests. SEC. 3. RESTRICTION ON NEW DEPLOYMENTS OF ANTI-PERSONNEL LANDMINES. Beginning on January 1, 2000, no funds may be used for new deployments of anti-personnel landmines. The Secretary of Defense must submit a report to Congress within 180 days outlining alternative actions for the Korean Peninsula. The President can delay the restriction if certifying no new deployments annually. Congress must certify that new deployments of anti-personnel landmines on the Korean Peninsula are essential for the defense of the Republic of Korea during a war or emergency. The report should detail efforts to implement proposed alternatives and any additional suggestions by the Secretary of Defense and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"anti-personnel landmine\" refers to munitions designed to detonate by person contact, excluding command-detonated Claymore munitions. \"New deployments of anti-personnel landmines\" are those placed after January 1, 2000."
