    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Independence Hall Commemorative Coin Act\" and includes findings. The Congress finds that historic buildings in Philadelphia, including Congress Hall and Independence Hall, were cared for by local government before the National Park Service took over preservation duties. The Federal Government has been unable to meet the capital needs of historic sites due to financial constraints and increased responsibilities of the National Park Service. Minting a United States coin is proposed as a way to commemorate these buildings and help fund their maintenance and preservation. SEC. 3. COIN SPECIFICATIONS. The Secretary of the Treasury will issue up to 1,000,000 $1 silver coins with specific weight, diameter, and composition. The coins will feature the Liberty Bell and Independence Hall designs, along with inscriptions of various patriotic phrases. These coins will be legal tender as per section 5103 of title 31, United States Code. The Secretary will obtain silver for coins from stockpiles under the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act. The design for the coins will be selected by the Secretary in consultation with the Commission of Fine Arts and reviewed by the Citizens Commemorative Coin Advisory Committee. SEC. 6. ISSUANCE OF THE COINS. The coins authorized under this Act may be issued in uncirculated and proof qualities at a designated Mint facility for a period of up to one year after enactment.
