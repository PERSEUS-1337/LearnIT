    "content": "The Older Americans Act (OAA), enacted in 1965, provides social services for individuals aged 60 and older. Services include nutrition programs, caregiver support, employment services, and programs to prevent abuse. Most programs are administered by the Administration on Aging (AOA) in the Department of Health and Human Services, except for Title V which is managed by the Department of Labor. The Older Americans Act (OAA) provides social services for individuals aged 60 and older. OAA funding is provided in annual appropriations for various titles, with the last reauthorization in 2006. Despite authorizations expiring in FY2011, Congress continues to appropriate funding for OAA programs and activities. The report details FY2015 funding for Older Americans Act programs and activities, reviews funding history since FY2001, summarizes legislative activity, and discusses funding decisions for selected programs. Appendixes provide additional funding information and history. For more background, refer to CRS reports on DOL and HHS appropriations and the Older Americans Act. The FY2015 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act funded Older Americans Act programs at $1.878 billion, with Title III programs receiving the largest proportion of funding at 70.7%. Title V received 23.1% of the funding, while the remaining funds were allocated to other AOA-administered activities. In FY2015, funding for Older Americans Act programs remained the same as in FY2014, except for $2.5 million allocated for Aging Network Support Activities for Holocaust survivors and $4.0 million for Elder Rights Support Activities. Total discretionary funding for OAA programs increased slightly from FY2001 to FY2002, remained flat through FY2006, then increased annually from FY2006 to FY2010. Overall OAA funding levels have stayed below FY2010 levels since then, with a steady increase from $1.783 billion in FY2006 to $2.328 billion in FY2010. Total discretionary funding for Older Americans Act (OAA) programs increased from $1.783 billion in FY2006 to $2.328 billion in FY2010, a 31% overall increase. Additional funding was provided in FY2009 under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Funding declined in FY2011 through FY2013, with FY2013 funding falling below the FY2007 level. Funding for FY2014 and FY2015 was slightly below the FY2012 level. President Obama signed the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (P.L. 113-235) on December 16, 2014, providing $1.878 billion in FY2015 funding for OAA programs. The FY2015 appropriations law reflected the new consolidated ACL account structure. Prior to P.L. 113-235, FY2015 discretionary funding for OAA programs was provided through three continuing resolutions. In 2015, temporary government-wide funding was provided through a series of continuing resolutions, maintaining funding for Labor-HHS-Education programs at the same rate as FY2014, with a slight reduction. The House Appropriations Committee did not pass a FY2015 appropriations bill, but a bill was introduced for Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education funding. The bill proposed funding increases for OAA Title V and Title III senior nutrition programs in 2015. It did not specify amounts for other OAA programs. The Senate Appropriations Labor-HHS-Education Subcommittee approved an FY2015 appropriations bill with funding levels similar to FY2014, except for a few exceptions. The Senate Appropriations Labor-HHS-Education Subcommittee approved an FY2015 appropriations bill with a 3.8% increase in family caregiver funding under Title III and a $5.9 million (3.7%) decrease in funding for the Nutrition Services Incentive Program. Additionally, $10.0 million was proposed for a new Elder Justice Initiative. President Obama's FY2015 budget request proposed $1.819 billion for OAA programs, with some programs funded at their FY2014 levels and exceptions for new funding for Aging and Disability Resource Centers and a decrease in funding for the CSEOA Program. The FY2015 budget proposed $5.0 million for a Holocaust Survivor Assistance Fund, $3.0 million for the White House Conference on Aging, and $25.0 million for an Elder Justice Initiative. The administration of the CSEOA program was suggested to be transferred from DOL to ACL. The Senate subcommittee-approved FY2015 Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill included a 3.8% increase in family caregiver funding and a $5.9 million decrease for the Nutrition Services Incentive Program. The FY2015 budget proposed funding for various programs including the CSEOA program, Holocaust survivors' support, ADRCs, and the White House Conference on Aging. The administration suggested transferring the CSEOA program from DOL to ACL with a proposed funding of $380.0 million, 13% less than FY2014. The FY2015 budget proposed transferring the CSEOA program from DOL to ACL with $380.0 million in funding, 13% less than FY2014. ACL shared CSEOA's mission of helping older Americans maintain independence and active participation in communities. Congress would need to pass legislation for the transfer to take effect. The FY2015 budget proposed transferring the CSEOA program from DOL to ACL with $380.0 million in funding. ACL would target the program to those with the greatest need, consider all sources of income for eligibility, and focus funds where impact potential is highest. ACL also suggested restructuring CSEOA as a community service program, as it did not align well with the Workforce Investment Act framework. The Senate bill would have funded CSEOA at the FY2014 level, and the subcommittee recommended keeping CSEOA in DOL. In FY2015, the CSEOA program remained funded and administered under DOL with the same appropriations as in FY2014. Approximately 130,000 Holocaust survivors live in the US, with 25% living in poverty. The President's budget proposed $5.0 million for a Holocaust Survivor Assistance Fund, with matching dollars from private philanthropy. The Senate and H.R. 5464 bills did not specify funding for the Holocaust Survivor Assistance Fund due to budget constraints. However, FY2015 included $2.5 million in new discretionary funding for supportive services for aging Holocaust survivors. Aging and Disability Resource Centers aim to provide information and counseling on long-term services and supports. Aging and Disability Resource Centers (ADRCs) offer counseling on LTSS options, access to Medicaid and VA programs, discharge planning, and care transition services. There are over 500 ADRC sites nationwide with 5.2 million client contacts in FY2012. ADRCs received $10 million in mandatory funding under ACA and $6.1 million in discretionary funding in FY2014. The President's FY2015 budget proposed no discretionary funding but $20 million each year for five years in renewed mandatory funding. The budget justification noted that since 2003, AOA and CMS have provided $100 million for ADRC services. Additional funding could help ADRC programs assist states in meeting requirements for enhanced federal matching rates under Medicaid. The Senate bill proposed $6.1 million in discretionary funding for ADRCs and urged ACL to improve coordination among ADRCs, AAAs, and CILs. H.R. 5464 did not specify a dollar amount for ADRCs. Final FY2015-enacted funding provided $6.1 million in discretionary funding to ADRCs. The FY2015 funding provided $6.1 million in discretionary funding to ADRCs, matching the FY2014 amount. The President's budget request for additional mandatory funding was not met. White House Conferences on Aging have historically focused on older individuals' concerns and guided federal policymakers. The President's FY2015 budget proposed $3.0 million for a White House Conference on Aging in 2015, but the Senate bill did not allocate dedicated funding due to budget constraints. The Senate bill in 2015 did not provide dedicated funding for the White House Conference on Aging, citing budget constraints. The conference was planned to be held in Washington, DC, with no specified funding from H.R. 5464 or final FY2015-enacted appropriations. The conference aimed to use technology to engage more people and recognize the anniversaries of Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and the Older Americans Act. The White House Conference on Aging will focus on retirement security, healthy aging, long-term services and supports, and elder justice. Regional forums and listening sessions will be held to gather input for the conference. For more information, visit http://www.whitehouseconferenceonaging.gov. Appendices provide details on authorizations of appropriations and funding history for Older Americans Act programs from FY2006 to FY2015. The White House Conference on Aging will cover retirement security, healthy aging, long-term services, and elder justice. Appendices detail funding history for Older Americans Act programs from FY2006 to FY2015."
