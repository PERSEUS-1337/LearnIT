    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 2290.5 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to define terms related to telemedicine, including \"asynchronous store and forward,\" \"distant site,\" \"health care provider,\" and \"originating site.\" Telehealth is the delivery of healthcare services via technology to facilitate patient care, diagnosis, treatment, and education. It includes synchronous interactions between patients and providers at distant sites. Prior to delivering healthcare via telehealth, the provider must inform the patient, obtain consent, and document it. Patients can still receive in-person care if they agree to telehealth first. Non-compliance is considered unprofessional conduct. This section does not change a provider's scope of practice or allow unauthorized healthcare delivery. (f) Laws on health information confidentiality and patient rights apply to telehealth. (g) Excludes patients under Department of Corrections jurisdiction. (h) Hospitals can grant privileges to telehealth providers based on medical staff recommendations. The Legislature intends to authorize hospitals to grant privileges and verify credentials for telehealth providers. Telehealth includes telemedicine as defined in federal regulations.

Trainees can receive credit for supervised experience in settings that provide mental health counseling or psychotherapy. An intern can gain supervised experience in settings that provide mental health counseling or psychotherapy, overseen by a qualified supervisor. The setting must not be a private practice owned by certain licensed professionals. An intern must receive oversight to ensure their work meets experience and supervision requirements in mental health counseling or psychotherapy settings. They cannot work in a private practice until registered, and fair remuneration is encouraged for interns. An intern in private practice must be directly supervised by a licensee meeting specific requirements, except during supervisor's absence. Experience must be gained within the intern's volunteering or employment position. Registration as an intern is necessary for postdegree supervised experience hours towards licensure. (g) Postdegree hours of experience credited towards licensure if intern registration applied for within 90 days of qualifying degree. Trainees, interns, and applicants cannot receive payment from patients and must be paid by employers. Trainees and interns must work at their employer's place of business under supervision, following laws and regulations. They can provide services via telehealth with licensed supervision. Trainees and interns cannot have a financial interest in their employer's business. Trainees, interns, or applicants receiving up to $500 per month for expenses incurred in lawful work settings are considered employees, not independent contractors.

Each educational institution and supervisor should consider encouraging students, interns, and trainees to undergo counseling or psychotherapy as appropriate.
