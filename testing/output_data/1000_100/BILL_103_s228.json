Between 1984 and 1988, 2,985 bicyclists in the US died from head injuries and 905,752 suffered head injuries treated in emergency rooms. 41% of bicycle-related head injury deaths and 76% of injuries occurred among American children under age 15. Deaths and injuries from bicycle accidents cost society $7.6 billion annually, with a child's head injury costing $4.5 million over their lifetime. Universal bicycle helmet use in the US would have prevented 2,600 deaths and 757,000 injuries. Only 5% of children in the nation who ride bicycles.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration can provide grants to promote bicycle helmet use among individuals under 16. Grantees have flexibility in designing effective programs. Grants can be used to enforce helmet laws, provide helmets, educate on helmet importance for bicycle safety, or a combination of these activities. Bicycle helmets manufactured 9 months after this Act must conform to interim standards like ANSI Z90.4-1984 and Snell B-90, until a final standard is established by the Consumer Product Safety Commission within 60 days of the Act. The Consumer Product Safety Commission must establish a final standard for bicycle helmet safety within 60 days, including provisions to prevent helmets from coming off and addressing injury risks to children. The final standard will not be subject to certain provisions of the Consumer Product Safety Act and will take effect 1 year after issuance. The final standard for bicycle helmet safety must be established by the Consumer Product Safety Commission within 60 days, with provisions to prevent helmets from coming off and address injury risks to children. Any bicycle helmet not meeting the interim standard will be considered in violation of a consumer product safety standard until the final standard takes effect. The final standard developed will be considered a consumer product safety standard under the Consumer Product Safety Act. Authorization of appropriations for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration grant program: $2,000,000 for fiscal year 1994, $3,000,000 for fiscal year 1995, and $4,000,000 for fiscal year 1996.
