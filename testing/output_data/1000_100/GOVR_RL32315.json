Conflict arises between environmental concerns and the need for increased domestic energy production. The Bush Administration has its own initiative to expedite the oil and gas permitting process on public lands. The Bush Administration has its own initiative to expedite the oil and gas permitting process on federal lands. Oil and gas development practices have sparked debate in Congress since the early years of the industry. Originally, oil and gas resources on public lands could be transferred to private ownership under the Mining Law of 1872. Conservationists argued against the abuse of the Mining Law, leading to President Taft withdrawing 3 million acres of lands prospective for oil in Wyoming and California. Taft's action led to the Pickett Act of 1910, which recognized executive branch authority to make public land withdrawals. The Mineral Lands Leasing Act of 1920 removed oil and gas from the patenting process and placed it under a leasing system, allowing the federal government to raise revenues from royalties. Split-estate situations arise when minerals are owned by the federal government under privately held lands. Federal statutes allow the government to issue patents to land while reserving mineral rights. The Mineral Lands Leasing Act of 1920 established federal leasing for oil and gas, with split-estate situations where minerals are owned by the government under private lands. Environmental concerns have led to support for public land withdrawals and restrictions on development. The impact of development on water and land is a topic of debate, with development supporters citing environmental laws in place to regulate oil and gas development on public lands. The industry faces delays due to environmental reviews, while proposed energy bills aim to address concerns over domestic oil and gas supplies. The House approved Title III of H.R. 6 and S. 2095 to establish a White House Office of Federal Project Coordination for expediting permitting on public lands. Environmentalists argue it could harm the environment. The Senate's substitute bill, S. 2095, is pending action. The report provides an overview of oil and gas leasing on U.S. public lands, including permitting, production, and reserves. The report discusses meeting U.S. energy demand and estimates of reserves in restricted areas. Leasing of onshore federal public lands for oil and gas development is based on Resource Management Plans developed by the Bureau of Land Management. Tracts of public land with oil and gas potential are offered for competitive leasing each quarter. After a lease is awarded, a drilling permit is required for each exploratory or production well. In FY2002, the federal government issued 1,765 new oil and gas leases on public lands totaling about 1.4 million acres, with a total of 18.6 million acres leased for development. The Bureau of Land Management must consider environmental impacts in Resource Management Plans for public lands, which cover diverse uses like timber, grazing, wildlife conservation, recreation, and energy. The Bureau of Land Management must consider environmental impacts in Resource Management Plans for public lands, covering diverse uses like timber, grazing, wildlife conservation, recreation, and energy. RMPs weigh impacts of various uses early in the process to be weighed equitably. Plans also consider the benefits of public lands to serve the community and must be consistent with environmental regulations. The BLM determines which lands with oil and gas potential will be available for leasing through the land-use planning process. Public lands available for lease are offered to the highest responsible qualified bidder through quarterly auctions to provide a \"fair market value\" return to the federal government. The Bureau of Land Management offers oil and gas leases on lands where bids are below the minimum acceptable bid on a noncompetitive basis. Tracts are available for noncompetitive leasing for two years, with priority given to applicants based on filing time. Geophysical exploration permits may be issued for unleased public lands, excluding drilling for core samples or oil and gas. Applicants must comply with specific practices and procedures outlined by the BLM. Once a lease is obtained from the Bureau of Land Management, the lessee is granted exclusive rights to explore, develop, and produce on the land. An Application for a Permit to Drill (APD) must be approved for each oil and gas well, including a drilling plan, surface use plan, and evidence of bond/surety coverage. The surface use plan should detail drill pad location, construction, waste disposal methods, and surface reclamation plans. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) requires an Application for a Permit to Drill (APD) to be approved for each oil and gas well, including details on pad construction, waste disposal, and surface reclamation plans. The APD is posted for a 30-day review period, with BLM required to process the application within 35 days. Delays in approval are often due to the need to update outdated Resource Management Plans (RMPs). The need to update outdated Resource Management Plans (RMPs) is highlighted by both BLM and IPAMS due to increased natural gas leasing and development. Plans must be revised before drilling permits can be issued, with several plans currently being revised. The Secretary of the Interior is required to develop, maintain, and revise land use plans with public involvement under FLPMA, section 1712. Preparation of an environmental impact statement (EIS) is required under current planning regulations. The rapid pace of coalbed methane (CBM) development has led to concerns about outdated Resource Management Plans (RMPs), with some arguing that plans older than 20 years are not suitable for current land management decisions. IPAMS stated that rewriting RMPs can now take up to three years, compared to less than one year in the past. Environmentalists emphasize the need for revised/amended RMPs to address new land use concerns and ensure proper site-specific analysis in the drilling permit process. The BLM announced new strategies in April 2003 to expedite the APD process, including processing multiple permit applications together, implementing geographic area development planning, and establishing standard operating practice agreements. The availability of public lands for oil and gas leasing is divided into three categories. The BLM divides the availability of public lands for oil and gas leasing into three categories: lands open under standard lease terms, open with restrictions, and closed to leasing. Areas closed to leasing consist of wilderness areas, national parks, and other environmentally sensitive areas unlikely to be reopened. Some lands are closed pending land use planning or compliance, while others are closed due to federal land management decisions. Approximately 165 million acres of federal subsurface minerals have been withdrawn from mineral entry, leasing, and sale. Approximately 182 million acres of public lands are subject to approval for mineral development, with restrictions imposed by the Department of the Interior. These lands include wildlife refuges, wilderness study areas, and roadless areas, among others. Leasing may come with restrictions such as no surface occupancy or timing limitations to protect the environment. Industry sources argue that stringent lease stipulations, such as directional drilling and controlled surface use, can hinder oil and gas development. Despite this, development has proceeded under some stipulations. Energy and mineral industry representatives claim that federal withdrawals limit exploration and reserve base, while environmental groups argue that withdrawals are necessary to protect non-mineral values of public lands. The Rocky Mountain region contributes 37% of natural gas production. The Rocky Mountain region contributes significantly to natural gas and crude oil projections on public lands in the lower 48 states. About 60% of the undiscovered resource base in the region is on public lands, with some areas inaccessible or subject to lease restrictions. This has made the region a focal point for U.S. oil and gas policy, with reports highlighting restrictions on natural gas development. The EIA and NPC studies focus on natural gas supplies in the Rocky Mountain region, with similar definitions of the region. Data shows a resource base of 335 trillion cubic feet in the region, with estimates of technically recoverable natural gas resources around 293.6 trillion cubic feet. The EPCA study found 138.5 trillion cubic feet in five major geologic basins. The EPCA study found 138.5 tcf of natural gas in the five major geologic basins in the Rocky Mountain region. The NPC and EIA studies show differences in the amount of natural gas open to leasing, with 60% and 51.5% respectively. The EPCA study also found that 63% of proven reserves on federal lands are open under standard lease terms. The EPCA study identified 138.5 tcf of natural gas in Rocky Mountain basins, with 63% open under standard lease terms. Oil resources in the region are less significant for U.S. supply, with 600 million barrels falling under \"no access\" and 3.2 billion barrels available for leasing, one-third with restrictions. About 2.5 billion barrels of oil are estimated on non-federal lands, representing 7% of all technically recoverable oil in the U.S. The EPCA study found 138.5 tcf of natural gas in Rocky Mountain basins, with 63% available under standard lease terms. The NPC and EIA studies suggest that developing natural gas in restricted land would likely face costly delays. The EIA report indicates that with greater flexibility in federal regulations, 29 tcf could become immediately available, and removing certain lease stipulations could make 51 tcf less costly to develop, freeing up a total of 80 tcf. Environmental groups argue for ecological concerns. Environmental groups argue that there is an ecological basis for most of these restrictions on natural gas development in the Rocky Mountain region. The NPC study estimates that 41% of gas resources are either closed or restricted, totaling 335 tcf as of 1999. Major policy disagreements exist regarding the importance of oil and gas reserves on public lands in meeting U.S. energy needs. The region represents 37% of the unproved technically recoverable natural gas resource base in the United States. The United States has a significant natural gas resource base, with estimates suggesting that the Rocky Mountain region alone could last between 20-30 years if its 108 tcfof natural gas were produced at a rate of 4-5 tcf per year. This would meet about 15% of the country's annual demand. The Wilderness Society stated that the U.S. has enough natural gas supply to meet domestic needs for the next 40 years, based on projected demand growth. The NPC estimates 1,351 tcf of natural gas could be available for development in the future, with 16% subject to restrictions. They argue that 70 tcf of Rocky Mountain natural gas could be brought into production soon by resolving impediments and relaxing land-use constraints on federal lands in the intermountain west. The RAND Corporation's 2002 Issue Paper suggests focusing on reserve categories for oil and gas resources to reduce access restrictions on federal lands in the intermountain west. This approach aims to minimize environmental damage while maximizing resource production. Total U.S. oil production was 1.9 billion barrels in 2002, forecasted to decrease to 5.3 mbd by 2025. Oil imports are expected to make up 65% of U.S. supply in 2025. Federal onshore oil production accounted for 5.4% of total U.S. production in 2002, mainly in Wyoming, New Mexico, and California. Onshore federal oil production has been declining over the past decade. U.S. natural gas production varied between 18-20 tcf annually from 1993-2002, with projections showing it reaching 20 tcf - 24.3 tcf by 2025. Imports from Canada are forecasted to rise to 3.7 tcf in 2010, then fall to 2.6 tcf in 2025. Canadian reports of declining gas production and increased domestic use in oil sands production led to adjustments in forecasts. LNG imports are projected to increase from 170,000 bcf in 2002 to 4.8 tcf in 2025. Gas production on public lands increased to 2.2 tcf in 2002 from 1.7 tcf in 1993, accounting for 11.5% of all U.S. production. Gas production on public lands increased to 2.2 tcf in 2002 from 1.7 tcf in 1993, with New Mexico and Wyoming leading in production. Federal onshore share of U.S. domestic oil and gas production is expected to remain stable. U.S. oil reserves were 22.7 BBO and natural gas reserves were 187 tcf in 2002, with Texas leading in both reserves. U.S. oil reserves have declined by 1.2 billion barrels over the past decade. The U.S. oil reserves have declined by 1.2 billion barrels over the past 10 years, with production also decreasing by 500 million barrels. Discoveries in 2001 were three times higher than the average annual discovery since 1976. In 2002, discoveries were 6% above the annual average. The technically recoverable oil resources in the U.S. are estimated at 92 billion barrels. The United States has seen an increase in natural gas reserves by 16.5 tcf (10%) since 1991, with production also rising. Gas imports have risen to 17% from about 9% in 1991. Annual discoveries were up 70% above the average since 1976. Technically recoverable gas resources are estimated to be about 1,000 tcf, over five times the amount of current proved reserves. Over two-thirds of the total onshore natural gas is on nonfederal land and may be available for exploration and development. The 2002 oil and gas resource assessment records an estimated 1.9 billion barrels of oil, 183 tcf of natural gas, and 3.1 billion barrels of natural gas liquids. The Rocky Mountain West has significant undiscovered oil and gas resources, with over 90% of the gas classified as unconventional. Proven reserves in the region show that a majority of oil and natural gas liquids are on public lands. Estimates by the EIA suggest that federal onshore oil accounts for 12.5% of all technically recoverable oil, while natural gas on public lands makes up 22.3% of all technically recoverable gas. Undiscovered conventional oil is estimated at 30.1 billion barrels, and undiscovered conventional natural gas resources are estimated at 319.7 trillion cubic feet. The estimate for undiscovered unconventional natural gas is 358.7 trillion cubic feet. Coalbed methane gas is trapped in coal beds and extracted by removing water through pumping. Concerns about groundwater contamination have arisen due to the varying quality of water pumped out of coal beds. Coalbed methane (CBM) production involves extracting water along with gas from coal beds, which can be reused if fresh or disposed of through injection or discharge. Water quality and disposal are key concerns in CBM production, with a significant increase in production since 1991. In 2002, CBM accounted for 8% of natural gas production in the US, with 10,000 wells producing 1.65 million barrels of water per day. Production rates vary due to coalbed geology, and federal lands are expected to host a large number of new wells by 2010. By 2010, 23,900 wells are expected on federal lands for coalbed methane (CBM) production. Only about 100 tcf of the estimated 700 tcf of CBM in the US are economically recoverable. CBM proved reserves were 18.5 tcf in 2001, accounting for 10% of US dry gas reserves. Colorado and New Mexico hold over half of US CBM reserves, with the San Juan Basin being the most productive, containing 65% of known reserves and 80% of production. Wyoming, Utah, and Alabama also have significant CBM reserves. The Warrior Basin in Alabama is the second most productive for coalbed methane (CBM) production in the US, with 9% of production and 8% of reserves. The Powder River Basin (PRB) has estimated CBM resources of 39 tcf, with most production on private lands. Concerns arise over surface use agreements between surface owners and mineral lessees, with stakeholders in Wyoming like the Petroleum Association, ranchers, and the Farm Bureau involved. The Wyoming Split-Estate Initiative was established in 2002 to resolve conflicts between surface owners and mineral owners in the state. Environmental concerns related to coalbed methane (CBM) production include land disturbance, water issues, and the process of hydraulic fracturing. Major issues involve surface infrastructure, water removal, effects on the water table, salinity levels, and disposal of water that may impact wildlife and surface water resources. The EPA expressed concern over the use of diesel fuel in hydraulic fracturing due to its potential impact on underground drinking water. An agreement was reached to end the use of diesel fuel as an injection fluid. Proposed energy legislation may prohibit EPA regulation of fluid injection for hydraulic fracturing under the Safe Drinking Water Act. Dennis Hemmer noted that water from CBM production typically does not reach surface water sources. CBM production results in water discharges of 602 million barrels annually, with concerns about pollution of drinking water, depletion of underground aquifers, and impacts on wildlife and vegetation. Holding ponds used for wastewater treatment are unlined and may leak into groundwater, raising worries about the lowering of the water table. Wildlife Management Institute warns of potential loss of natural vegetation and aquatic life in waterways receiving CBM water. CBM production impacts groundwater quality and wildlife habitats. BLM requires monitoring wells for CBM leases to assess water quality and levels. IBLA invalidated leases due to insufficient environmental evaluations. EA for Powder River Basin aids in decision-making. Environmental assessments (EA) in the Powder River Basin have led to increased CBM drilling but with new conditions imposed on some producers. The Wyoming Outdoor Council (WOC) sued BLM over leases in violation of an IBLA ruling, leading to a halt in lease sales on public lands with high CBM content. The IBLA dismissed the case in December 2003, and the Wyoming BLM office is finalizing a new EA and RMP for future permits. The office finalized a new EA and RMP and is anticipating approving 39,000 permits for new wells over a 10-year period. Demand for oil is forecast to rise 1.6% annually to 28 mbd by 2025, with imports projected to reach nearly 65%. U.S. demand for natural gas is forecast to rise 1.4% annually, reaching 31.4 tcf by 2025. The outlook is mixed for increased oil and natural gas production from leases on U.S. public lands. The Bush Administration has initiated actions to ease restrictions in instances where this can be done administratively. The media reports challenges to initiatives easing restrictions on public lands for oil and gas production. Concerns include violations of BLM's multiple-use mandate and potential environmental damage. Industry seeks greater access to federal lands for drilling, while environmental groups and surface owners worry about habitat and water quality. The United States is expected to rely more on natural gas imports and increased domestic production to meet energy demand. The Rocky Mountain region could contribute up to 40% of U.S. natural gas production by 2025. Oil and gas companies are exploring worldwide for investment opportunities, considering factors like political stability and resource availability. Environmental impact and societal concerns are also taken into account when making investment decisions. The terms for competitive and noncompetitive leases on public lands include maximum acreage limits, minimum bonus bids, rental rates, royalties, and bond requirements. The onshore leasing program generates significant annual revenues for the U.S. Treasury. The leasing program on public lands brings in significant annual revenues to the U.S. Treasury, including bonus bids, rents, and royalties. Revenues are collected by the Minerals Management Service and distributed to states, the U.S. Treasury's General Fund, and other designated programs. States receive a percentage of the revenues collected from oil and gas leases within their boundaries, with Alaska receiving a higher percentage. Revenues from federal leases fluctuate due to price changes, with a significant increase in 2000. In 2001, there were 23,000 federal oil and gas leases covering over 17 million acres of federal public lands. The National Park System (NPS) was established in 1916 to conserve natural and historic objects and wildlife for future generations. Early tensions arose between conservationists promoting National Parks and utilitarians promoting National Forests. The focus of the public lands withdrawal debate in the early 1900s was on the authority of the Commander-in-Chief. The debate on public lands withdrawal focused on the President's authority to make the order based on national security. Withdrawals changed land designation from available to unavailable for various activities. While Congress has authority over public lands, Presidents have historically reserved lands for purposes like military reservations. National monuments can be created by the executive branch through statutory delegation under the Antiquities Act, preserving historic landmarks and objects of scientific interest on federal lands. The Taylor Grazing Act withdrew 140 million acres from homesteading laws, while the Organic Act regulated recreation and designated \"primitive areas.\" The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act and the Wilderness Act of 1964 also play significant roles in land management. Congressional designations as \"wilderness\" are considered essential to prevent administrative revocation of protections. The Wilderness Act of 1964 required the Forest Service to study designated primitive areas for wilderness suitability. Wilderness is defined as off-limits to development to preserve nature's pristine characteristics. Federal lands can only be designated as wilderness areas by Congress or as provided for in the Wilderness Act. Congress has sole authority to create National Parks and wilderness areas, while the executive branch can create national monuments under the Antiquities Act. The executive branch can use delegated power to create national monuments under the Antiquities Act. Congress has the authority to designate national wildlife refuges and withdraw specific resources like oil and gas. The Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA) governs modern executive withdrawals, allowing for public and congressional input in land use planning. Withdrawals can be made by either the executive or Congress under FLPMA. Under FLPMA, withdrawals of public lands can be temporary or permanent and require specific procedures. Withdrawals exceeding 5,000 acres need congressional approval and can last for 20 years with the possibility of renewal. Proposed withdrawals must be detailed and include reasons, economic and environmental effects, alternatives, consultations, and geological/mineral potential. The Secretary of the Interior can make emergency withdrawals for up to three years. FLPMA also mandates a review of existing withdrawals in 11 Western states. The Secretary of the Interior can determine the continuation of existing withdrawals on public lands in 11 Western states. BLM is reviewing approximately 70 million withdrawn acres, prioritizing 26 million acres for potential return or alternative uses. As of November 2000, BLM had reviewed 7 million acres, revoking withdrawals on over 6 million acres. Retention of a withdrawal requires a compelling show of need according to the BLM Manual. The withdrawal process for public lands in 11 Western states involves a rigorous review by BLM managers to determine if lands should remain closed to multiple uses, such as mining and mineral leasing. The process requires convincing the BLM Director, Secretary of the Interior, and the public that there is no reasonable alternative to continued withdrawal. This review is ongoing and must be supported by documentation under the National Environmental Policy Act. Some lands may be opened for oil and gas development, while others will likely remain closed or restricted."
