    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Fracturing Regulations are Effective in State Hands Act\". Congress acknowledges the effectiveness of state regulations in protecting water resources during oil and gas activities, as highlighted in reports by the Ground Water Protection Council and the Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA's 2004 study found no evidence of drinking water contamination from hydraulic fracturing, while the Ground Water Protection Council's 2009 report stated a lack of risk to groundwater from fracking in deep and shallow formations. The Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission affirmed in 2009 that states have comprehensive laws to ensure safe operations and protect drinking water. The EPA and state reports have not found any verified cases of groundwater contamination from hydraulic fracturing. Testimonies from EPA officials and Bureau of Land Management Director also support the safety of fracking operations and chemicals used. Activities related to hydraulic fracturing are already regulated at the Federal level for surface discharges, wastewater disposal, and air emissions. The hydraulic fracturing process is not included in the underground injection control program under the Safe Drinking Water Act. In 2011, the Secretary of the Interior announced plans for new Federal regulations on hydraulic fracturing on Federal land. The University of Texas at Austin study found no evidence of hydraulic fracturing chemicals in aquifers. The Ground Water Protection Council report highlighted improvements in state oil and gas regulations for groundwater protection. SEC. 3 of the Act defines \"Federal land\" as public lands, National Forest System land, Bureau of Reclamation land, and Corps of Engineers land. SEC. 4 addresses state authority. State authority is granted to regulate well treatment with fluids under pressure for fracturing purposes within a State's boundaries. Federal land must adhere to the State's regulations for such activities."
