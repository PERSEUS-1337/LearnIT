    "content": "In April 2009, a novel influenza virus, initially referred to as \"swine flu,\" emerged and spread globally. The World Health Organization explained that the virus resulted from the reassortment of swine, avian, and human flu viruses in pigs. This type of genetic mixing had been observed in pigs since 1998 and can also occur in humans. The current influenza A (H1N1) virus circulating is a reassortment of genes from swine, avian, and human origins. The novel influenza virus, known as H1N1, emerged in April 2009 from a combination of swine, avian, and human flu viruses. It is now being transmitted from human to human and is slightly more lethal than seasonal flu. The virus, also referred to as 2009 H1N1 flu, is not as deadly as H5N1 avian influenza but has the potential to become more virulent as it spreads globally. On April 21, 2009, CDC reported cases of unique influenza strain in California with gene segments from swine flu viruses. The novel H1N1 influenza virus emerged in April 2009, containing gene segments from swine flu viruses. CDC reported cases in California, followed by more cases in California and Texas. Mexico announced a new influenza strain with over 1,000 suspected cases, leading to school closures and event cancellations. WHO raised the pandemic alert level to Phase 5 due to human-to-human transmission. Phase 4 and Phase 5 of WHO's pandemic alert levels indicate human-to-human transmission of influenza virus with potential for community-level outbreaks and spread to multiple countries in a region. On June 11, 2009, WHO raised the alert level to Phase 6, the highest level, signaling an imminent pandemic. Director-General Margaret Chan described the virus as \"moderately severe\" with the potential to become more virulent. As of June 22, 2009, WHO reported over 50,000 confirmed H1N1 cases in 80+ countries with 231 deaths. The virus does not spread through pork consumption. WHO advises against travel restrictions but recommends ill individuals to delay international travel. According to WHO, most people with H1N1 experience influenza-like symptoms and recover without antiviral treatment. Drugs like oseltamivir and zanamivir can reduce symptoms and prevent severe illness. Older antiviral drugs have been ineffective against H1N1. WHO has a global stockpile of oseltamivir for treatment. WHO has a global stockpile of 5 million adult treatment courses of oseltamivir donated after H5N1 outbreaks. 3 million courses are being distributed to developing countries. No vaccine is available for H1N1, but efforts are underway to develop one, which could take 5-6 months to mass-produce. Sanofi-Aventis has pledged to donate 100 million vaccine doses once developed. Sanofi-Aventis and GlaxoSmithKline plan to donate vaccine doses to WHO for distribution to poor countries. China quarantined Mexican nationals, leading to flight bans between Mexico and China. Some countries advised against nonessential travel to the United States and Mexico. The European Union Health Commissioner urged Europeans to postpone nonessential travel to the United States. On May 15, 2009, the CDC downgraded the recommendation for U.S. travelers to Mexico to a \"travel health precaution.\" Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano defended the decision not to close U.S. borders with Mexico, citing the strain of the virus already present throughout the United States. Closing borders could pose legal and logistical challenges. Several countries have implemented measures to prevent the spread of H1N1, including installing thermal scanners in airports to screen travelers for high body temperatures. Egypt ordered the slaughter of pigs, and some countries have banned pork imports from the United States, Canada, and Mexico. USAID established a Pandemic Influenza Response Management Team to coordinate the U.S. humanitarian response to H1N1 outbreaks. The United States has provided over $16 million to assist Latin America and the Caribbean with H1N1 outbreaks. Aid focuses on H1N1 and builds on pandemic preparedness efforts since the 2003 SARS outbreak. Responses are led by CDC, USAID, and DOD, focusing on commodity delivery and disease surveillance. USAID also donated PPE kits and disinfectant to Vietnam for quick response to potential outbreaks. The CDC has provided over 20,000 liters of disinfectant valued at $57,000 to help animal health workers respond to avian or H1N1 influenza outbreaks. CDC is actively involved in responding to H1N1 outbreaks and collaborates with WHO to develop testing kits for influenza subtypes. HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius announced support for strengthening laboratory capacity and training health experts to control virus spread. HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius announced the distribution of 400,000 treatment courses valued at $10 million to Mexico to control the spread of the virus. The Administration aims to distribute a total of 2 million courses in Latin America and the Caribbean. CDC has deployed staff to Mexico and Guatemala, including experts in influenza epidemiology, laboratory, health communications, and emergency operations. Teams are working to understand the severity and transmission patterns of H1N1 and improve laboratory capacity in Mexico. CDC's Emergency Operations Center collaborates with ECDC and China CDC to support pandemic influenza preparedness efforts in over 50 countries. USAID provided $5 million to WHO and PAHO for H1N1 response in Latin America and the Caribbean, focusing on disease surveillance and control measures. As of May 18, 2009, USAID has given $6.1 million for international H1N1 assistance. USAID has provided $6.1 million for international H1N1 assistance, with $0.9 million directed at H1N1 response efforts in Mexico, $0.2 million in Panama, and $5 million to the region. The assistance includes support to FAO for animal surveillance efforts in Mexico and Latin America, distribution of over 100,000 PPE kits valued at more than $1 million, and pre-positioning 400,000 PPE kits in 82 countries. Additionally, USAID held a pandemic preparedness exercise in Ethiopia as part of its Humanitarian Pandemic Preparedness Initiative. In April 2009, a pandemic preparedness exercise was held in Ethiopia with stakeholders and national authorities from nine East African countries. Participants identified roles, established coordination principles, developed a response action plan, and tested existing plans through a simulation exercise. The exercises aimed to prepare for potential influenza pandemics and address cross-border population movement issues. National leaders interacted to identify possible issues with an influenza outbreak. USAID conducted pandemic preparedness exercises in South Africa and Asia in 2009, working with the Department of Defense to provide military assistance in 30 countries across Africa and Asia. Joint exercises were also held with PACOM, AFRICOM, and WFP involving 27 countries. Congress provided emergency funds for global pandemic assistance in FY2005. The United States has provided $949 million for global avian and pandemic influenza efforts since FY2005, making up 30.9% of international donor pledges. This funding has supported preparedness, surveillance, and response efforts in over 100 nations and jurisdictions. The United States provided $949 million for global avian and pandemic influenza efforts since FY2005, supporting preparedness, surveillance, response, and containment. Funding was allocated for bilateral activities, support to international organizations, regional programs, global contingency, technical assistance, humanitarian aid, international coordination, influenza research, and wild bird surveillance. The United States allocated $949 million for global avian and pandemic influenza efforts since FY2005. This funding included support for surveillance, stockpiles of supplies, global communications, and outreach. Contributions came from various agencies, with USAID providing $542 million, HHS providing $353 million, USDA providing $37 million, DOD providing $10 million, and DOS providing $7 million. President Obama also requested an additional $1.5 billion in supplemental funding. President Barack Obama requested $1.5 billion in supplemental funding for pandemic preparedness. The 2009 Supplemental Appropriations bill allocated $50 million for USAID and $200 million for CDC for H1N1 activities. Concerns about infectious diseases threatening global security have increased due to outbreaks like H5N1 avian influenza and SARS. The emergence of influenza A H1N1 has shown the threat of infectious diseases, with 75% originating from animals. Responses require a multidisciplinary approach involving various sectors. Investments have been made to prepare for pandemics and monitor disease spread, aiding the global response to H1N1. Some health experts are concerned about the global spread of H1N1, especially in poorer countries with limited monitoring capacity. There are also worries about potential gene reassortment, particularly in countries dealing with H5N1 bird flu outbreaks. The debate continues on whether WHO should maintain its pandemic influenza phase system. There was a debate about whether WHO should maintain its pandemic influenza phase system, with some arguing for an alert system based on severity. Critics warned of panic and disruptions if the pandemic threat level was raised to Phase 6. Despite this, WHO raised the pandemic phase level from 5 to 6 on June 11, 2009, emphasizing that the shift did not indicate a change in severity. WHO updated its pandemic influenza preparedness and response guide, maintaining the six-phase structure but redefining phases to better reflect pandemic risk. USAID announced a new five-year program in collaboration with CDC and USDA to develop a global early warning system for diseases of animal origin that infect humans. USAID announced a new five-year program in collaboration with CDC and USDA to develop a global early warning system for diseases of animal origin that infect humans, such as SARS, H5N1, and HIV/AIDS. A significant portion of the funds will be used to establish a network of laboratories in Africa to improve the ability to diagnose new emergent pathogens in both animal and human populations. Concerns have been raised about the limited public health and surveillance capacity in sub-Saharan Africa, with South Africa being the only country to have confirmed cases of H1N1. CDC, USAID, and other international health experts are working to improve laboratory and disease surveillance capacity in African countries. CDC has distributed H1N1 testing kits to 237 laboratories in 107 countries, including 18 in Africa. Access to treatments and vaccines for diseases in poor countries has been a debated issue, especially during the peak of HIV/AIDS and H5N1 outbreaks. Indonesia has raised concerns about access to vaccines, fearing that poorer countries may not afford them or wealthier nations may hoard them. Some concerns have been raised about access to vaccines in poorer countries, with fears that wealthier nations may hoard them. USAID estimates that 30% of the world's population lacks regular access to medicines, and WHO reports that over 90% of global vaccine development capacity is in Europe and North America. This concentration of resources in richer countries raises questions about equitable access and the ability of poorer nations to effectively administer mass vaccination campaigns. The WHO expects national authorities to conduct mass vaccination campaigns for H1N1 instead of the organization. Concerns exist about countries with limited vaccine administration capabilities. In 2002, 1.4 million child deaths could have been prevented by routine vaccination. Health experts worry about the severity of H1N1, especially if H5N1 bird flu and H1N1 circulate together. The potential for H5N1 bird flu and H1N1 to reassort and create a new strain with human illness concerns health experts. H5N1 outbreaks in poultry led to human cases in 2004, sparking fears of a pandemic due to efficient human-to-human transmission. By 2006, 50 countries had confirmed H5N1 outbreaks, with cases reported in 2008 and 2009. H5N1 bird flu has become endemic in Asia, with ongoing cases being closely monitored for potential H1N1 cases. Indonesia and Cambodia have not reported H1N1 cases. H5N1 is more deadly but less easily transmissible than H1N1. Most H5N1 deaths result from direct contact with sick birds, while the source of H1N1 transmission remains unidentified."
