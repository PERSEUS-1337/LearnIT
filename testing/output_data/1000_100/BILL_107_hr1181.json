The Health Insurance Affordability and Equity Act of 2001 introduces section 25B in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, allowing individuals a tax credit for payments made towards qualified health insurance coverage for themselves, their spouse, and dependents. The credit is limited to $1,500 per eligible coverage month for each individual. The tax credit for health insurance coverage under section 25B of the Internal Revenue Code is limited to $1,500 per eligible coverage month for each individual. Not more than 2 individuals can be considered for the credit, with special rules for married individuals who do not file joint returns. The tax credit for health insurance coverage under section 25B of the Internal Revenue Code is limited to $1,500 per eligible coverage month for each individual. The term 'eligible coverage month' is defined as a month where the individual is covered by qualified health insurance paid by the taxpayer, and there was a 12-month period without coverage or eligibility for an employer-provided group health plan. The tax credit for health insurance coverage under section 25B of the Internal Revenue Code is subject to reduction based on the taxpayer's modified adjusted gross income. The reduction amount is calculated based on the excess of the taxpayer's income over the applicable dollar amount, with a ratio to $10,000. The term 'modified adjusted gross income' is defined as adjusted gross income plus any excluded amounts under specific sections. Amounts not multiples of $10 are rounded down. The 'applicable dollar amount' is $60,000 for coverage of more than one individual and $30,000 otherwise, or for married individuals. For married individuals filing separately, marital status is determined under section 7703. Qualified health insurance refers to insurance covering medical care, excluding coverage of excepted benefits. The term does not include subsidized coverage where less than 50 percent of the cost is borne by the taxpayer. Additionally, the credit is denied for amounts paid under certain government-provided programs. No credit allowed for amounts paid under specific government programs such as Social Security Act, Title 10, Title 38, or Indian Health Care Improvement Act. Coverage under these programs counts as qualified health insurance. Coordination with other deductions may impact eligibility for the credit. The credit for qualified health insurance payments is not allowed if the amount is already used for deductions under sections 162(l), 213, or 222. Dependents cannot claim the credit if they are eligible for a deduction under section 151 by another taxpayer. Dollar amounts for the credit will be adjusted for inflation after 2002. The dollar amount for the credit will be adjusted for inflation after 2002, rounded to the nearest multiple of $100. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections in the tax code. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2001. Part VII of subchapter B of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include a new section on costs of qualified health insurance. In general, individuals can deduct the amount paid for qualified health insurance coverage for themselves, their spouse, and dependents. Special rules apply, such as not counting this amount towards other deductions and not allowing the deduction for self-employment tax purposes. These amendments apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 2001. Amendments to the tax code allow for the deduction of costs of qualified health insurance for individuals, their spouse, and dependents.
