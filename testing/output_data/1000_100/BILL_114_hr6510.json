Congress acknowledges the humanitarian crisis faced by Syrian children due to the civil war and supports the temporary relocation and care of up to 25,000 young Syrian minor children refugees. The Act supports the relocation of up to 25,000 young Syrian child refugees to the United States over three years. Efforts should be made to reunite or relocate them back to Syria once the civil war violence decreases and displacement reduces. The Save the Children Program aims to relocate young Syrian child refugees to the United States with the goal of reuniting or relocating them back to Syria once the civil war violence decreases. The Save the Children Program grants visas for young Syrian children aged three to ten to enter the US until civil war violence in Syria decreases. After a designated time by the Department of State, there is a six-month grace period for guardians to be identified before visas expire. The Save the Children Program allows young Syrian children aged three to ten to enter the US until violence in Syria decreases. Children who can be established as orphaned or whose guardians can be identified within a six-month grace period are eligible for visas. The Office of Refugee Resettlement establishes a Coordinator for the program with supervisory authority in the United States. The Coordinator of the Save the Children Program can appoint additional personnel with approved pay, including private citizens or non-Federal Government employees. Federal departments can detail personnel to assist the Coordinator as needed. The Coordinator of the Save the Children Program is responsible for identifying qualifying young minor children for the Program and implementing their temporary resettlement in the United States. The Coordinator can utilize the staff and resources of the Division of Unaccompanied Children's Services. The Coordinator of the Save the Children Program works with governmental and nongovernmental organizations to implement the Program and assist those admitted under it. They consult with key government officials to ensure Program operations comply with relevant laws. The Program aims to reunite families in the United States after a reduction in civil war violence in Syria. It will terminate six months after certification of this reduction by the Secretary of State. The Program aims to reunite minor children admitted to the United States with their parents or caretakers after a reduction in civil war violence in Syria. The Program may be suspended or terminated if the President determines so.

Appropriations are authorized for each fiscal year to carry out the Program, with funds available from the Migration and Refugee Assistance Act of 1962. A report detailing the Program's implementation must be submitted to Congress within 180 days of the Act's enactment. SEC. 4. TEMPORARY NONIMMIGRANT VISA. The Program shall admit up to 5,000 alien minor children aged three to ten in the first year, and 10,000 more in the following years. Preference will be given to children already in custody outside Syria. A temporary nonimmigrant visa will be granted until civil war violence in Syria decreases significantly. The Syrian Civil War Minor Child Protection Act of 2016 aims to reduce displacement of Syrian children aged three to ten who are currently refugees or displaced persons. The Act allows for the admission of up to 5,000 children in the first year and 10,000 in subsequent years, with preference given to those already outside Syria. The Save the Children Act of 2016 allows aliens admitted to the United States to remain until civil war violence in Syria substantially reduces."
