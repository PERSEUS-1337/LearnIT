The Hall of Fame opened on September 7, 1963, enshrining a charter class of 17 players, coaches, and contributors including legends like Sammy Baugh, Red Grange, and Jim Thorpe. The Pro Football Hall of Fame, established in 1963, has 273 members. Three symbols represent membership: a bronze bust, a gold jacket, and a ring. The museum has welcomed 9 million visitors and has expanded multiple times, housing the world's largest football collection.
