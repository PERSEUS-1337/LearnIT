    "content": "The \"Bisti PRLA Dispute Resolution Act\" allows for the withdrawal of coal preference right lease applications. The \"Bisti PRLA Dispute Resolution Act\" allows for the withdrawal of coal preference right lease applications, with the Secretary of the Interior issuing a certificate of bidding rights to holders who withdraw their applications. The withdrawal of coal preference lease applications will be effective upon issuance of the certificate of bidding rights under section 4(a)(2). No further adjudication by the Secretary is required for these withdrawals and issuances. SEC. 3. METHOD FOR DETERMINING FAIR MARKET VALUE. The fair market value of coal reserves for withdrawn lease applications will be determined by a panel established by the Secretary within 30 days of the Act's enactment. The fair market value of coal reserves for withdrawn lease applications will be determined by a panel appointed by the Secretary, the lease applicant, and the Governor of New Mexico. The panel will be assisted by a qualified coal reserve appraiser and may supplement information as needed. A determination must be made within 75 days. The panel appointed by the Secretary, lease applicant, and Governor of New Mexico will determine the fair market value of coal reserves for withdrawn lease applications within 75 days. SEC. 4. ISSUANCE OF PATENTS TO RELINQUISHED PREFERENCE RIGHT LEASE APPLICATIONS. The Secretary must issue patents to the Navajo Nation for land, including mineral rights, within 120 days of withdrawing a coal preference right lease application. This is to satisfy the Navajo Nation's land selection rights and promote land consolidation and mineral development in northwest New Mexico. Additionally, a certificate of bidding rights must be issued based on fair market value. Enforcement of the Secretary's duties under this section is considered nondiscretionary and can be enforced through a mandamus proceeding under section 1361 of title 28, United States Code. SEC. 5. USE OF EXCHANGE BIDDING RIGHTS. The certificate of bidding rights issued under section 4(a)(2) allows for transferability and can be used as a credit against payments for Federal coal leases. The payment obligations for Federal coal leases can include bonus payments to the Secretary and the use of bidding rights as a credit, with 50% of the amount payable allowed to be covered by the bidding rights and the remaining 50% to be paid in cash or cash equivalent. Payment of Federal coal lease obligations by holders of bidding rights under section 4(a)(2) is treated as money received under the Mineral Leasing Act. The payment is credited and redistributed by the Secretary, with 50% in cash going to the State and the rest through crediting of bidding rights. The crediting of bidding rights is considered a payment subject to redistribution to the Reclamation and Miscellaneous Receipts accounts in the Treasury."
