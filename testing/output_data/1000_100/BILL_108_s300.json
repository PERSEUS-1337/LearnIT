FINDINGS.\" \"Congress finds that Jackie Roosevelt Robinson, born in 1919 in Cairo, Georgia, excelled in multiple sports at UCLA before becoming the first black player in Major League Baseball in 1947. He was awarded the National League's Rookie of the Year in his first season and voted the Most Valuable Player in 1949.\" Jackie Robinson was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1962. His achievements extended beyond athletics to have a significant impact on civil and human rights in America. He was the first black player in Major League Baseball, preceding key events in desegregation and civil rights movements. Robinson quickly gained public admiration for his fortitude, integrity, and athletic prowess. Jackie Robinson's popularity soared rapidly, surpassing notable figures in a 1947 national poll. He later held positions in companies and co-founded a bank. Robinson's influence extended to political leaders and he worked with various organizations to improve American lives. His legacy lives on through the Jackie Robinson Foundation, providing educational opportunities to children from low-income families. Jackie Robinson's legacy as an athlete, business leader, and citizen has positively influenced civil rights in the United States through leadership and educational opportunities. The President is authorized to present a gold medal to Jackie Robinson's family in recognition of his contributions to the nation. The Secretary of the Treasury will design and strike the medal. Duplicates in bronze may be sold under regulations set by the Secretary. The medals struck under this Act are designated as national medals. An amount not exceeding $30,000 is authorized to be charged for the cost of the medal. Proceeds from the sale of duplicate bronze medals will be deposited in the United States Mint Public Enterprise Fund. Congress suggests designating a national day to recognize Jackie Robinson's accomplishments, with the President issuing a proclamation for observance. The Senate passed S. 300 on October 17, 2003, awarding a congressional gold medal to Jackie Robinson posthumously for his contributions to the nation. Congress also suggests establishing a national day in recognition of Jackie Robinson."
