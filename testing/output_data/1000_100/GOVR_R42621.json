    "content": "Some in the 112th Congress wanted to cut international affairs spending, including foreign aid programs, to reduce the federal budget deficit. However, others believed a strong foreign affairs budget was crucial for national security and foreign policy interests, potentially saving money by avoiding costly military interventions. Congress considered the FY2013 Department of State appropriations in the context of the Budget Control Act of 2011. Congress delayed passing most appropriations bills, including State-Foreign Operations, until after the start of the new fiscal year and the fall elections. A continuing resolution (CR) was passed to provide government funding until March 27, 2013. Legislation (H.R. 933) was passed on March 6, 2013, to fund federal programs for the remainder of FY2013. The Senate approved an expanded version of the bill on March 20, 2013, which was signed into law on March 26, 2013 (P.L. 113-6). The State-Foreign Operations appropriation supports international affairs programs and activities within Function 150. The State-Foreign Operations appropriations bill funds international organizations, State Department, USAID, public diplomacy, and international broadcasting programs. It does not cover food aid, International Trade Commission, or Foreign Claims Settlement Commission. Some international commissions like the International Boundary and Water Commission are funded through this bill. A chart in Appendix A shows the bill's organizational structure. The report focuses on State-Foreign Operations appropriations bill funding international organizations, State Department, USAID, public diplomacy, and international broadcasting programs. President Obama signed the FY2013 Defense and Military Construction/VA, Full Year Continuing Resolution on March 26, 2013, funding State-Foreign operations accounts at FY2012 levels. Enacted FY2013 funding by account is updated in Appendix C. On September 28, 2012, President Obama signed the Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2013, H.J.Res. 117 into law (P.L. 112-175), funding the government until March 27, 2013. The bill provided 0.612% more than FY2012 levels for State and Foreign Operations non-OCO funded activities, with OCO-designated activities funded at the FY2012-enacted level. The annualized State-Foreign Operations funding rate under the CR was estimated to be $53.52 billion. The Operations appropriations bill provided $52.3 billion, with $2.3 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations. The Senate allocated $16.3 billion for the State Department and Related Agencies, and $36.0 billion for Foreign Operations. The House approved $40.3 billion for regular funding and $8.2 billion for OCO, totaling $48.5 billion, 12% less than requested. The House Appropriations Committee approved initial subcommittee allocations for State-Foreign Operations, with $48.38 billion allocated, including $8.2 billion in OCO funds. The Senate Appropriations Committee allocated $53.02 billion for the same subcommittee, including $3.2 billion in OCO funds, which was 3% less than the Administration's request. The Obama Administration submitted its FY2013 budget request to Congress, seeking a 2.6% increase in funding for the Department of State-Foreign Operations. The total request was $54.9 billion, including $8.2 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations. This represented a 2.6% increase over the estimated FY2012 funding level. The FY2013 budget request included a 4.5% increase in State Department accounts and a 0.1% increase in Foreign Operations accounts. The Administration requested $770 million for the Middle East and North Africa Incentive Fund and $800 million for the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund. The FY2013 request showed a slight increase in State Department Administration of Foreign Affairs funding. The FY2013 budget request included a slight decrease in affairs funding share, a small increase in security assistance funding, and a slight decrease in bilateral economic aid. These categories make up over 85% of the total State-Foreign Operations funding requested. The FY2013 budget request included a 4.5% boost in State Department and Related Agencies accounts to a total of $18.8 billion. This amount included funding for Administration of Foreign Affairs, supporting key efforts such as military-to-civilian transition in Iraq, State Department-led efforts in Afghanistan and Pakistan, internal reorganizations, and personnel issues. The State Department has taken over all U.S. programs in Iraq after the military withdrawal in 2011. The FY2013 budget requested 23% less funding for State Operations in Iraq compared to FY2012. The Department is handling a wide range of responsibilities, including air transport, environmental cleanup, and medical support. The FY2013 budget requested less funding for State Operations in Iraq compared to FY2012, reflecting the Administration's intent to \"normalize\" the U.S. presence. Cost-saving measures included a reduction in State Department presence by 25% and completion of construction funded in FY2012. The House appropriations bill included $2.8 billion for State Department operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, with increased security funding for staff. The Senate Appropriations Committee bill provided $2.1 billion for Department of State operations in Iraq in FY2013, reflecting reforms outlined in the QDDR. This included the establishment of a new Bureau of Energy Resources and elevation of the Office of the Coordinator for Counterterrorism to a Bureau in 2011 without additional funding from Congress. The Office of the Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization activities were absorbed into the Bureau of Conflict and Stabilization Operations. Funding for the State Department's Counterterrorism mission increased to $19 million in FY2013. The Bureau of Counterterrorism requested funds for 12 new positions. The Bureau of Energy Resources sought 22 positions. The Bureau of Energy Resources requested 22 additional direct-hire positions in the FY2013 budget to strengthen market incentives and engage more broadly on U.S. global energy priorities. The Administration's funding request also included plans for the Bureau to establish regional hubs in Istanbul, Singapore, Johannesburg, and Rio de Janeiro. The House Appropriations Committee recommendation did not include the additional $5.4 million and 22 new positions specifically for the Bureau. The Senate Appropriations Committee report did not mention the additional $5.4 million and 22 new positions for the Bureau of Energy Resources. The Administration's FY2013 request for the Bureau of Conflict and Stabilization Operations (CSO) included an 86% increase in funding, with a restructuring to reduce staffing levels by 64 positions for greater deployment capacity. The Civilian Response Corps (CRC) model was also modified to fund experts only when deployed. The House Appropriations Committee's FY2013 proposal reduced the number of CRC members by 76. The Senate Appropriations Committee did not provide funding for Conflict and Stabilization Operations but authorized transfers from other accounts. The Administration's FY2013 request for additional human resources D&CP was $2.5 billion, $71.2 million above its FY2012 request. The FY2013 request for additional human resources D&CP was $2.5 billion, with $24.9 million allocated to hire 121 new positions to fill staffing gaps and support new programs under the \"Diplomacy 3.0\" initiative. Secretary Clinton aimed to increase Foreign Service Officers by 25% by 2014, but with the proposed funding, State would have reached 18% growth since 2008. The budget also included $81.4 million for the final phase of Overseas Comparability Pay implementation for FSOs. The FY2013 budget included $81.4 million for the final phase of Overseas Comparability Pay (OCP) implementation for Foreign Service Officers (FSOs). This aimed to address the 23.1% pay cut FSOs experienced when transferring abroad prior to 2009, impacting entry and mid-level employees and affecting diplomatic readiness. Congress had approved two prior OCP adjustments, reducing the pay differential by nearly 70%. The FY2013 request sought to bring the comparability pay level to the Washington, DC, locality pay rate. In FY2013, the House and Senate Appropriations Committees did not provide funding for hiring above attrition or extend authority for overseas comparability pay. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) admitted Palestine as a full member in October 2011, sparking a U.S. policy debate. The United States opposes Palestinian statehood outside of negotiations with Israel. U.S. law prohibits funding to U.N. agencies accepting Palestinians as full members, including UNESCO. The Administration sought $80 million for UNESCO contributions in 2012, but the House committee withheld funding. The Senate legislation included restrictions on funding for the Palestinian Authority if they gain full membership in the United Nations. It also prohibited funding for UNESCO and other U.N. entities granting membership to the Palestinian Authority. Both proposals allocated less funding than requested for International Organizations and Programs. The Foreign Operations budget, managed by USAID and the State Department, includes U.S. contributions to various agencies and multilateral financial institutions like the World Bank. It also covers trade promotion activities of the Export-Import Bank. The Foreign Operations budget includes trade promotion activities and financial commitments to international institutions like the World Bank. The FY2013 budget request totaled $36.07 billion, with a focus on foreign assistance initiatives and funding for war-related states. Congressional priorities may differ from the Administration's initiatives. The congressional foreign aid funding debate focused on funding levels and policy issues such as restrictions on international family planning programs and aid conditions. Recent popular uprisings in the Middle East and North Africa have raised questions about using foreign assistance for democracy promotion. Members of the 112th Congress expressed interest in supporting these initiatives. The Administration proposed a $770 million Middle East and North Africa Incentive Fund (MENA IF) in its FY2013 budget request to support U.S. engagement in the evolving situation in the Middle East. This fund would include $65 million for the Middle East Partnership Initiative (MEPI) and $5 million for the Office of Middle East Programs (OMEP), with the remaining $700 million as unallocated funds to incentivize beneficiary countries. The Administration proposed a $770 million Middle East and North Africa Incentive Fund (MENA IF) in its FY2013 budget request to support U.S. engagement in the evolving situation in the Middle East. The fund would have included $65 million for the Middle East Partnership Initiative (MEPI) and $5 million for the Office of Middle East Programs (OMEP), with the remaining $700 million as unallocated funds intended to provide incentives for beneficiary countries to move toward democracy. Some Members of Congress expressed concerns about the proposed MENA IF, which some believe would have given the Administration too much discretion and Congress too little opportunity for oversight. The Administration proposed allocating $175 million in the ESF account and $25 million in the Foreign Military Finance account for \"Middle East Response,\" with $50 million for Jordan. The Senate committee report included $1 billion for MENA IF, increasing MEPI funding to $70 million. Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan are top U.S. aid recipients due to their strategic significance in the Global War on Terror. The Administration requested $6.8 billion for aid to these countries in FY2013. The Administration requested $2.1 billion in foreign operations funds for Iraq in FY2013, with $1.8 billion designated as OCO. This included $1 billion for the Police Development Program (PDP), described as a vital part of U.S.-Iraqi security engagement. Despite scrutiny and doubts, the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad emphasized the program's importance. The House legislation expressed support for the Police Development Program (PDP) in Iraq but did not provide specific funds. The Senate Appropriations Committee did not include funding for the PDP due to its unsuccessful implementation and Iraqi disinterest. The Administration requested $2.5 billion for FY2013. The Administration requested $2.5 billion in foreign operations funds for Afghanistan for FY2013, with almost half designated as OCO. The increase in funding was for infrastructure and economic growth investments, as well as justice sector programs transitioning to civilian management. The House legislation required security certification for aid workers, while the Senate bill allocated $1.8 billion, citing Afghan government control over more programs. The Administration's FY2013 budget requested $2.2 billion in foreign operations funds for Pakistan, with a focus on civilian assistance for energy, economic growth, stabilization, education, and health. The House legislation did not specify an aid level for Pakistan and prohibited assistance if Pakistan is uncooperative in anti-terrorism efforts. The Senate bill included $842.3 million for Pakistan, with $50 million for the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund. The Senate bill included new conditions on aid to Pakistan, withholding $33 million in Foreign Military Financing until Dr. Shakil Afridi is released from prison. The budget request for the Global Health Initiative was reduced by approximately $300 million compared to FY2012 levels. The FY2012-enacted amount for global health funding saw decreases in various areas, except for an increase in funding for international family planning and the Global Fund. The House and Senate proposed more funding than the request, with the Senate offering $8.5 billion for the Global Health Initiative, including $1.7 billion for the Global Fund. The Obama Administration's food security initiative, Feed the Future (FtF), received a FY2013 request for $1.1 billion in Foreign Operations funds. This initiative stems from a pledge made in 2009 to provide $3.5 billion over three years to address global hunger. The FY2013 request also included $134 million for the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP). The House proposal supported FtF goals without specifying funding levels, except for $99.8 million for GAFSP. The Senate recommended $1.2 billion in assistance for these programs. The Senate proposed allocating $1.2 billion for agricultural and food security, with $200 million specifically for GAFSP. The FY2013 request for the Global Climate Change Initiative was $770 million, supporting activities like adaptation and clean energy technologies. Funding for GCCI activities comes from various appropriations accounts. The House and Senate had differing positions on GCCI funding in FY2013. The House recommended zero funding for certain climate funds and only half of the requested funds for GEF. The Senate allocated $111 million for Sustainable Landscapes and exceeded the Administration's request for GEF, Strategic Climate Fund, and Clean Technology Fund. The Administration requested $643 million for family planning and reproductive health activities in FY2013, sparking debate in Congress over policy and funding concerns. Key issues include the Mexico City policy and U.S. funding of the UN Population Fund. The Mexico City policy, implemented by President Reagan in 1984, required foreign NGOs receiving USAID family planning assistance to certify they would not promote abortion. The Mexico City Policy has been rescinded and reissued by past and current Administrations. President Obama rescinded it in January 2009. The FY2013 House legislation proposed codifying the policy, while the Senate bill did not. Previous Administrations have suspended grants to UNFPA due to coercive family planning practices in China. The George W. Bush Administration suspended U.S. contributions to UNFPA from FY2002 to FY2008. President Obama resumed contributions in 2009 and requested $39 million for UNFPA in FY2013. The FY2013 House legislation proposed $461 million for family planning and reproductive health activities, while the Senate bill included $700 million, with $44.5 million for UNFPA. The Administration suggested dissolving the AEECA account in FY2013, cutting funding for programs previously under AEECA by 18%. Funding for these programs would come from ESF, GHP, and INCLE accounts. The House and Senate proposed merging AEECA funds with ESF, GHP, and INCLE accounts in FY2013. The change is not meant to reduce support for the region or the Coordinator of U.S. Assistance to Europe and Eurasia. Both proposals allow ESF and other accounts to assist AEECA-eligible countries without specifying a minimum funding level. U.S. national security, trade promotion, and humanitarian interests drive international affairs activities. Since the early 1990s, U.S. foreign policy objectives have shifted towards promoting economic development, trade, education, health care, human rights, and environmental protection. Following the 9/11 attacks, there has been a focus on national security objectives, including efforts to counter terrorism. President Bush's 2002 National Security Strategy established global development as a key pillar of U.S. national security. The Bush Administration emphasized global development as a key pillar of U.S. national security, highlighting foreign aid priorities in the war on terrorism. Reconstruction programs in Afghanistan and Iraq were a major focus, along with efforts to enhance diplomatic security and public diplomacy in Muslim communities. Additionally, aid to combat HIV/AIDS was significantly increased. The Bush Administration prioritized global development and increased aid to combat HIV/AIDS. The Obama Administration continued these initiatives, including the Millennium Challenge Corporation and global health funding. Funding for these efforts is now requested within Overseas Contingency Operations. The Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review (QDDR) in 2010 named USAID as the leading agency for development assistance. Reforms were implemented for the Department of State, including the establishment of the Bureau of Energy and elevating the Office of the Coordinator for Stabilization and Reconstruction. The FY2012 budget proposed changes in funding for Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, extending OCO funds to cover costs for the Department of State and USAID in these front line states. The OCO designation was adopted by Congress in the FY2012 State-Foreign Operations appropriations legislation, expanding to include funding for additional accounts and countries. This designation allows war-related funding to not crowd out core international affairs activities within the budget allocation. However, OCO funds are not exempt from automatic across-the-board reductions as determined by the Office of Management and Budget. The Obama Administration criticized the practice of using emergency supplemental funds for foreign operations in FY2002-FY2010, advocating for regular budget requests starting in FY2010. Despite a sharp increase in base funding in FY2010, supplemental funds were still requested for activities in Haiti, Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan. FY2011 was the only year in the last decade where all international affairs funding was part of the base budget before the OCO approach was adopted. In FY2013, $8.24 billion, or 15% of the international affairs request, was designated as OCO funding. This was 5% less than FY2012 and 26% less than what Congress enacted. The House and Senate had differing OCO designations, with the Senate allocating $2.3 billion, 72% less than requested. The State Department-Foreign Operations funding trended upward until 2011, with a spike in FY2004 due to reconstruction funds for Iraq and Afghanistan. Congress reduced foreign affairs spending in FY2011 to meet deficit reduction goals. FY2012 and FY2013 funding leveled off due to deficit reduction efforts, remaining below the FY2009 funding level after adjusting for inflation. See Table 2 and Figure 3 for appropriations over the past decade. The State Department and related agencies funding has been increasing steadily over the past decade, with a spike in foreign aid in 2004. However, State Department funding lagged behind that year. In recent years, funding for the State Department has been increasing at a faster rate than overall foreign affairs spending, reflecting efforts by the George W. Bush and Obama Administrations to increase human resource capacity. Foreign Operations, which makes up two-thirds of State-Foreign Operations appropriations, shows a similar upward trend in funding. Foreign aid funding levels off in FY2012 and FY2013, with Israel and Egypt traditionally receiving the largest amounts of aid. Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan have also been top recipients, with Iraq's funding decreasing in recent years. Security and economic aid to Pakistan has increased to combat extremist organizations. Top five aid recipients in FY2013 remained consistent. In FY2013, the top five aid recipients remained consistent, with Israel receiving $3,100 million in FMF, Afghanistan $2,505 million, Pakistan $2,228 million, and Iraq $2,045 million. Aid to Africa would have decreased by 10%, while aid to the Near East and South Central Asia would have increased. In FY2013, aid to South Central Asia would have increased by 6% to $5.3 billion, primarily for war-related costs in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Near East region request continued to be dominated by assistance to Israel, Iraq, Egypt, and Jordan. The Western Hemisphere's decline was due to reduced funding for Colombia. Europe and Eurasia saw a 14% decline, while aid to East Asia and Pacific remained consistent. Congress has shown interest in various aid sectors funded across multiple countries. The Administration's budget requests for key interest areas in FY2013 showed declines compared to FY2012, except for five sectors out of 23 listed. Two major initiatives, Food Security and Global Climate Change, also saw decreases in funding. Comparisons between past and present requested levels indicate the Administration's interests and priorities, but not those of congressional appropriators. In FY2013, funding requests for key interest areas showed declines compared to FY2012, including major initiatives like Food Security and Global Climate Change. Reduced funding requests were also seen in sectors such as Sustainable Landscapes, Neglected Tropical Diseases, Nutrition, Maternal and Child Health, Higher Education, Clean Energy, and Basic Education. However, increased funding was emphasized for Gender Funding and Science, Technology, and Innovation."
