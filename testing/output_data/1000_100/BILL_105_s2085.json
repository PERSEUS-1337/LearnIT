    "content": "The Act titled \"Fairness for Small Business and Employees Act of 1998\" is also known as the Truth in Employment Act. It includes findings related to employment practices. Congress finds that an atmosphere of trust and civility in labor-management relationships is crucial for a productive workplace and a healthy economy. The tactic of \"salting\" by union organizers has evolved into aggressive harassment, posing a threat to the balance of rights in collective bargaining. Increasingly, union organizers are seeking employment with nonunion employers to organize employees or cause economic harm to competitors. While no employer may discriminate based on employees' views on collective bargaining, they should expect job applicants to prioritize using their skills to further the employer's business goals. SEC. 102. PURPOSES.\n\nThe purposes of this title are to preserve the balance of rights between employers, employees, and labor organizations, protect workers' rights to organize, and prevent pressure on employers to hire disruptive individuals.\n\nSEC. 103. PROTECTION OF EMPLOYER RIGHTS. SEC. 103. PROTECTION OF EMPLOYER RIGHTS.\n\nThe National Labor Relations Act is amended to clarify that employers are not required to hire individuals who are not genuine job applicants seeking employment for the purpose of furthering another employment or agency status. This amendment does not affect the rights of bona fide employee applicants to self-organization, join labor organizations, bargain collectively, or engage in concerted activities for mutual aid or protection. TITLE II--FAIR HEARING\n\nSEC. 201. FINDINGS.\n\nCongress finds that bargaining unit determinations require case-by-case adjudication for accuracy. The National Labor Relations Board has a history of holding hearings to determine single location bargaining unit appropriateness. A blanket rule limiting factors considered in determining appropriateness detracts from promoting labor relations stability.\n\nSEC. 202. PURPOSE. The purpose of this title is to ensure that the National Labor Relations Board conducts a hearing process and specific analysis to determine the appropriateness of a single location bargaining unit. Section 9(c) of the National Labor Relations Act is amended to include provisions for determining the appropriateness of a bargaining unit that includes employees from multiple facilities of a single employer. The Board will consider various factors such as functional integration, centralized control, common skills, and bargaining history in making its determination. TITLE III--ATTORNEYS FEES\n\nSEC. 301. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. Congress finds that small businesses and labor organizations lack expertise and resources when facing actions by the National Labor Relations Board. The Equal Access to Justice Act has not effectively helped level the playing field for these entities. Due to the Board's greater resources, certain small entities should be awarded fees and costs when they prevail against the Board. The purpose of this title is to address this imbalance. The purpose of this title is to ensure that small businesses and labor organizations are not deterred from seeking review or defending against actions by the National Labor Relations Board due to costs. It aims to reduce the resource and expertise gap between these entities and the Board, and hold the Board more accountable by awarding fees and costs to small entities when they prevail. SEC. 302 amends the National Labor Relations Act to include a new section on awards of attorneys' fees and costs. Sec. 20 outlines the conditions under which an employer or labor organization can be awarded fees and expenses as a prevailing party in administrative and court proceedings conducted by the Board. The criteria include being the prevailing party in an adversary adjudication, having a small number of employees and limited net worth, and following the provisions of section 504 of title 5, United States Code. An employer or labor organization meeting specific criteria can be awarded fees and expenses as a prevailing party in court proceedings against the Board, regardless of the justification of the United States' position. SEC. 303 of the National Labor Relations Act applies to agency and court proceedings initiated after the enactment of the Act."
