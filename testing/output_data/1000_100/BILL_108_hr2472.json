    "content": "The Act titled \"District of Columbia Budget Autonomy Act of 2003\" amends Section 446 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act to address the enactment of the local budget. The Council must adopt the annual budget for the District of Columbia government within 50 days of receiving the proposal from the Mayor. Any budget supplements must also be adopted after a public hearing. In control years, the Mayor must submit the budget to the President for transmission to Congress, following specific budget procedures. The District of Columbia government must obtain approval from the Council or Congress before obligating or expending any amount, as outlined in specific sections of the budget regulations. Reprogramming of amounts after the annual budget adoption is also restricted. The annual budget for fiscal year 1995 onwards requires approval from the Council for any reprogramming of amounts, with additional expenditures needing offsetting reductions. The term 'control year' is defined in reference to the District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Act of 1995. Congressional review period for budget acts is also addressed in the amendments. The new paragraph specifies that Acts subject to section 446 and not in a control year will take effect after a 30-day period unless a joint resolution disapproving the Act is enacted. If the 30-day period ends when neither House is in session, an additional 5 days are granted. The new paragraph specifies that joint resolutions disapproving Acts subject to section 446 must pass both Houses of Congress within a certain period to repeal the Act. Conforming amendments are made to various sections of the Act. Amendments are made to various sections of the District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Act of 1995 and the National Capital Revitalization and Self-Government Improvement Act of 1997, specifically regarding the application of section 446 for control years.
