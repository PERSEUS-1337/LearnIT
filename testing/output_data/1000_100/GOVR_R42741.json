Approximately 8.2 million individuals are covered by FEHB each year, with participation being voluntary. Options include individual, family, and self plus one coverage in approved health plans, which are either fee-for-service (FFS) or health maintenance organizations (HMOs). Premiums are shared between the federal government and participants. The Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program offers private health insurance to federal employees, retirees, and their dependents. Premiums are shared between the federal government and participants. Benefits and cost sharing vary among FEHB plans, covering basic services like hospital and physician care with deductibles, co-payments, or coinsurance. Prior to FEHB's creation in 1959, federal employees had to purchase health insurance on their own or through union plans. By 1950, private sector employers were offering health insurance, prompting President Truman's Commission to recommend federal health insurance coverage. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Act of 1959 (FEHBA) established health insurance coverage for federal employees, with parameters for eligibility, types of plans, and government's share of premiums. It created an Employees Health Benefits Fund and outlined the role of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). OPM has the authority to contract with insurers and manage FEHB. FEHBA has been amended multiple times, maintaining a model of enrollees choosing coverage from private insurers. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Act of 1959 (FEHBA) established health insurance coverage for federal employees, with parameters for eligibility, types of plans, and government's share of premiums. While the model of enrollees choosing between multiple types of coverage offered by competing private insurers has remained unchanged, other aspects of FEHB have been modified over time. Changes include adjustments to the government's share of premiums, expanded eligibility, services, and benefits. Congress plays a role in modifying FEHB, either proposing changes or reacting to proposed changes, making it a model for private and public health insurance programs. The FEHB model allows federal employees to choose from various insurance plans provided by competing insurers, with minimal intervention from OPM. It has been successful in controlling costs and offering cost-conscious choices to enrollees. Researchers have explored exporting aspects of the FEHB model to other health care programs like Medicare, expanding access to FEHB, or creating new programs based on FEHB for small business employees and the uninsured. Policymakers have introduced legislation to expand FEHB eligibility or create new programs modeled after FEHB. The Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program has been suggested as a model for state-level health insurance exchanges and has provided lessons for establishing health insurance exchanges under the ACA. Congressional interest in FEHB extends beyond its applicability as a model, as policymakers have a responsibility for its viability and sustainability. Congress has a financial interest in FEHB and the authority to restructure it. This report aims to explain how FEHB has evolved into its current program. The report discusses how Congress has influenced the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program by conditioning federal funds, changing premium share formulas, modifying eligibility, and implementing policies affecting Medicare-FEHB relationship. Congress can place conditions on federal funds to make changes to FEHB, such as prohibiting the use of funds for abortions in 1983. The 103rd Congress passed a law prohibiting federal funds for abortions, except in cases of danger to the woman's life, rape, or incest. The government's share of FEHB premiums has increased over the years, with the \"big six\" formula introduced in 1971. The government's share of FEHB premiums has increased over the years, with the formula changing in 1974 and again in 1997 under the Balanced Budget Act. Currently, the government contributes 72% of the weighted average premium of all plans, not exceeding 75% of any one plan's premium. Eligible participants include federal employees, retirees, and their family members. Since its enactment, eligibility for enrollment in the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program has been extended to various categories of federal employees, retirees, and their family members. In 1978, part-time employees became eligible, followed by certain temporary workers in 1988. Temporary Continuation of Coverage (TCC) was also authorized in 1988, allowing separated employees to continue FEHB coverage for up to 18 months by paying the full premium. TCC can be extended to 36 months for children aging out. The Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program was established in 1959 for federal employees, with eligibility extended over the years. In 1982, Congress passed a law enabling federal workers to be eligible for Medicare based on their federal employment. Effective July 1, 1960, P.L. 86-382 established the FEHB program for federal employees, outlining eligibility, benefits, premium sharing, and OPM's role. Eligible participants included current employees, retirees with at least 12 years of service, and family members. OPM could approve health benefit plans to participate in FEHB. Plans to participate in FEHB include the Service Benefit Plan, Indemnity Benefit Plan, Employee Organization Plans, and Comprehensive Medical Plans. Service Benefit Plan and Indemnity Benefit Plan offer two levels of benefits, while Employee Organization Plans are sponsored by employee organizations. Comprehensive Medical Plans can be group-practice prepayment plans or individual-practice prepayment plans. Under P.L. 86-382, the government's share of premiums in FEHB plans was dependent on the type of plan and the type of enrollee. The government's share was 50% of the lowest rate charged by a carrier for the service benefit plan and the indemnity plan. Biweekly government shares ranged from $1.25 to $4.25 depending on the type of coverage. The government's share of premiums in FEHB plans under P.L. 86-382 was based on the type of plan and enrollee. The share ranged from $1.75 to $2.50 biweekly, with variations for different coverage types and enrollees. P.L. 86-568 extended FEHB coverage to employees of county committees under the Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act and their dependents. P.L. 88-59 extended the deadline for applications to participate in FEHB from December 31, 1959, to December 31, 1963, and removed the requirement for employee organizations to offer health care benefits before applying. P.L. 88-284 expanded FEHB coverage to include employees with work-related injuries and foster children. The act expanded FEHB coverage to include employees with work-related injuries, foster children, and unmarried children up to age 21. It also allowed retirees to continue their FEHB coverage if enrolled by December 31, 1964. Additionally, the act gave OPM authority to terminate contracts with carriers not meeting enrollment requirements and made the government's share of premiums the same for all enrollees. The government's share was 50% of the premium for both individual and family plans under P.L. 88-531, which authorized FEHB coverage for certain United States commissioners and their dependents. P.L. 88-631 amended the Federal Employees Health Benefits Act of 1959 to allow certain teachers in the District of Columbia to participate in a health benefits plan. P.L. 89-504, enacted on July 18, 1966, amended FEHB by changing the government's share of premiums to $1.62 biweekly for individual enrollment and $3.94 biweekly for family enrollment. The government share for all plan types for family enrollment was set at $3.94 biweekly, with a limit of 50% of the total premium. FEHB coverage for dependent children was extended to age 22. Employees on leave without pay for full-time officer roles could maintain coverage. Various acts in 1968 and 1969 expanded FEHB eligibility to National Guard technicians, U.S. magistrates, and federal employees during transfers. The government's share of premiums in FEHB was altered by P.L. 91-418 in 1970 to reflect medical price inflation. The \"big six\" formula was established to calculate the average premiums of six benefit plans for individual and family coverage. The government's share of FEHB premiums was set at 40% of the average of six plans for individual and family coverage. The act allowed family members of deceased employees with less than five years of service to continue enrollment. FEHB coverage was extended to noncitizen employees in the Panama Canal Zone. P.L. 91-648 also maintained FEHB eligibility for federal employees assigned to state or local governments. P.L. 93-160 extended FEHB coverage to eligible U.S. nationals employed by the federal government outside the U.S. and Panama Canal Zone. P.L. 93-246 increased the government's share of FEHB plan premium from 40% to 50% in 1974. The government's share of FEHB plan premiums was increased to 60% in 1975, with a maximum limit of 75%. Health insurance plans in FEHB had to comply with OPM decisions, and FEHB enrollees were granted direct access to clinical psychologists and optometrists without referrals. The amendments in P.L. 94-310 and P.L. 94-342 provided entitlements for FEHB enrollees regarding payment for services and eligibility for health benefits coverage for certain individuals. The P.L. 95-368 established uniformity in benefits and coverage under FEHB by preempting certain state and local laws inconsistent with FEHB contracts, providing protections to medically underserved populations. Beginning January 1, 1980, and ending December 31, 1984, FEHB contracts covered certain health services, with insurance carriers required to pay for licensed health practitioners up to contract limits for eligible recipients. The Federal Employees Part-Time Career Employment Act of 1978 (P.L. 95-437) allowed part-time career employees and their dependents to access FEHB coverage. Part-time career employment is defined as a 16-32 hour work week, excluding temporary or intermittent employment. Employees retiring after five years of service may be eligible to retain their life and health insurance benefits under certain circumstances. P.L. 95-583 reduced the creditable service requirement for FEHB coverage in retirement from 12 years to 5 years. P.L. 96-54 redefined employee for FEHB coverage purposes. P.L. 96-70 pertained to the Panama Canal Act of 1979. P.L. 96-70 redefined employee eligibility for FEHB to exclude non-citizens stationed outside the US, except for those in specific agencies in the Panama Canal Zone. P.L. 96-179 amended FEHB provisions for survivor benefits and child coverage requirements. The Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (P.L. 97-248) required federal employees to pay the Medicare Hospital Insurance tax, allowing them to count their federal employment towards entitlement for premium-free benefits under Medicare Part A. It also made Medicare payments secondary for employees aged 65 to 69 covered under certain employer group health plans, including FEHB. The amendments in P.L. 97-346 required OPM to determine the difference between the government's share of health plan premiums for 1983 and the amount if certain employee organizations were included. Funds appropriated by P.L. 98-151 in 1983 were prohibited from being used for abortions or administrative purposes. The Civil Service Retirement Spouse Equity Act of 1984 (P.L. 98-615) extended FEHB coverage to former spouses of federal employees, who must pay both the employee's and government's share of the premium. Abortion-related provisions in appropriations bills since P.L. 98-151 prohibit the use of funds for abortions or administrative expenses, except in cases where the woman's life is endangered. P.L. 99-53 authorized additional employee organization plans in FEHB if applied within 90 days. It allowed certain disability annuitants to enroll in FEHB if previously enrolled. P.L. 99-251 introduced mixed model prepayment plans in FEHB. P.L. 99-251 expanded FEHB plans to include mixed model prepayment plans and mandated studies on extending contracting authority to health practitioners like nurse midwives and chiropractors. It also extended contracting authority to clinical social workers and emphasized adequate treatment for mental illness, alcoholism, and drug addiction for FEHB enrollees. P.L. 99-251 expanded FEHB plans to include mixed model prepayment plans and mandated studies on extending contracting authority to health practitioners. It also emphasized adequate treatment for mental illness, alcoholism, and drug addiction. P.L. 99-272 required OPM to determine the minimum level of financial reserves for carriers to ensure stable health plan operation. The Federal Employees' Retirement System Act of 1986 (P.L. 99-335) provided FEHB eligibility to individuals first employed by the government of the District of Columbia before October 1, 1987. Additionally, the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1987 (P.L. 99-569) provided health benefits for certain former employees. Year 1987 saw several legislative actions related to health benefits for specific groups, including former spouses of CIA employees, qualified clinical social workers, USPS retirees, and survivor annuitants. These actions were outlined in various Public Laws passed in December 1987. In 1988 and 1989, several Public Laws were passed regarding FEHB coverage. P.L. 100-204 provided coverage for certain former spouses of Foreign Service employees. P.L. 100-238 declared that certain nonfederal employees were no longer eligible for FEHB benefits after October 1, 1988. P.L. 100-360 included provisions affecting FEHB that were later repealed by P.L. 101-234. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Amendments Act of 1988 (P.L. ) would have required OPM to reduce rates for retirees in FEHB who were Medicare eligible, based on estimated cost savings. It also mandated reports to Congress on incorporating health plans for Medicare-eligible individuals and adopting NAIC standards for Medicare supplemental plans under FEHB. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Amendments Act of 1988 (P.L. 100-654) authorized OPM to impose sanctions on health care providers for illegal activities and set time limits for debarment proceedings. It also allowed fines for false charges, created temporary continuation of FEHB coverage (TCC) for separating employees and families. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Amendments Act of 1988 (P.L. 100-654) authorized OPM to impose sanctions on health care providers for illegal activities and set time limits for debarment proceedings. It also allowed fines for false charges and created temporary continuation of FEHB coverage (TCC) for separating employees and their families for up to 18 months after separation. TCC enrollees must pay the full premium, plus a 2% administrative charge, and it is available to employees separated for reasons other than gross misconduct. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Amendments Act of 1988 (P.L. 100-654) authorized OPM to impose sanctions on health care providers for illegal activities and set time limits for debarment proceedings. It also allowed fines for false charges and created temporary continuation of FEHB coverage (TCC) for separating employees and their families for up to 18 months after separation. TCC enrollees must pay the full premium, plus a 2% administrative charge, and it is available to employees separated for reasons other than gross misconduct. P.L. 101-76 adjusted the big six formula in response to Aetna's withdrawal from FEHB for plan years 1990 and 1991, calculating the government's share of FEHB plans based on the average percentage change in the remaining five plans included in the formula. The provisions of this act would not apply if comprehensive reform legislation is enacted that amends FEHB financing provisions. OPM must transmit recommendations to Congress for comprehensive FEHB reform no later than 180 days after enactment. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 (P.L. 101-239) required USPS to pay FEHB premiums for survivors of postal employees who retired or died after October 1, 1986. The Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1990 and 1991 (P.L. 101-246) authorized FEHB coverage for former spouses of Foreign Service employees under specific conditions. P.L. 101-303 allowed federal retirees to pay health benefits premiums through direct payments if annuity is insufficient. P.L. 101-508 included FEHB reforms like hospitalization cost-containment measures and improved cash management. The act P.L. 101-508 exempted FEHB plans from state premium taxes, extended the big six formula, improved coordination between FEHB and Medicare, applied Medicare payment limits to services for retired FEHB enrollees aged 65 and older, and required USPS to pay the government's share of FEHB premiums for certain annuitants. The Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1991 (P.L. 101-513) entitled U.S. hostages in Iraq, Kuwait, and Lebanon, and their family members, to FEHB benefits while in hostage status and for 12 months thereafter, if they did not have other health insurance. The act appropriated up to $10 million for these benefits, with the authority to obligate funds expiring six months after enactment. P.L. 101-530 allowed National Guard technicians to be eligible for FEHB benefits without post-1968 service requirement. P.L. 102-88 restored FEHB eligibility for former spouses of certain CIA employees under specific circumstances. P.L. 102-90 addressed employees of the Senate Employee Child Care. P.L. 102-90, enacted on August 14, 1991, made Senate Employee Child Care Center employees eligible for FEHB coverage. P.L. 102-393, enacted on October 6, 1992, prohibited the use of funds to implement changes to FEHB affecting Medicare beneficiaries, including restrictions on OPM requiring retired FEHB enrollees eligible for Medicare to pay out-of-pocket differences for nonparticipating Medicare providers. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993 (P.L. 102-484) prevented OPM from making changes to FEHB plan coinsurance for prescription drugs used by Medicare-covered FEHB enrollees. It also provided for the continuation of FEHB benefits for individuals involuntarily separated from a position in the Department of Defense due to a reduction in force, with limits on payments for coverage. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (P.L. 103-66) required FEHB plans to apply Medicare Part B limitations on payments for physician services to retired FEHB enrollees aged 65 or older. Physicians and suppliers accepting Medicare payments must also accept equivalent payment and cost sharing from FEHB. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (P.L. 103-66) required FEHB plans to apply Medicare Part B limitations on payments for physician services to retired FEHB enrollees aged 65 or older. Physicians and suppliers accepting Medicare payments must also accept equivalent payment and cost sharing from FEHB. Additionally, the Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government Appropriations Act, 1994 (P.L. 103-123) extended and modified the restructured big six formula for plan years 1990 through 1998. P.L. 103-123 did not include a provision restricting funding for abortion coverage in FEHB plans, unlike previous appropriations acts. P.L. 103-409 and P.L. 104-37 allowed individuals covered under specific health benefit plans to enroll in FEHB plans upon termination of their office's plan. Any prior enrollment under the office's plan is considered enrollment under FEHB. P.L. 104-52 reinstated the provision prohibiting funds for abortion in FEHB plans, with exceptions for endangerment, rape, or incest. P.L. 104-106 changed TCC for certain individuals separating from surplus positions in Defense or Energy departments. The Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act, 1997 (P.L. 104-208) required OPM to create regulations for surviving children to enroll in FEHB plans if their survivor annuity was terminated due to marriage. It also mandated a report on establishing a demonstration program for certain beneficiaries of Department of Defense health programs to enroll in FEHB plans. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-33) modified the formula for determining the government's share of FEHB premiums, requiring OPM to calculate the weighted average premium of all plans by October 1st each year. The biweekly government share for an employee or retiree is 72% of the weighted average premium. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-33) maintained the provision that the biweekly government share of FEHB premiums cannot exceed 75% of any plan's premium. It also mandated that individuals enrolled in FEHB cannot enroll in a Medicare Medical Savings Account plan until OPM certifies to HHS that enrollment will not increase government expenditures. Additionally, the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999 (P.L. 105-261) directed the Secretary of Defense to conduct a demonstration project allowing certain individuals eligible for Department of Defense health benefits to voluntarily enroll in FEHB health plans. The Federal Employees Health Care Protection Act of 1998 (P.L. 105-266) allowed eligible beneficiaries to enroll in health plans offered through FEHB during a demonstration project conducted from 2000 to 2002. The act required reports on project costs, effectiveness, and the feasibility of making the program permanent. It also mandated administrative changes to FEHB, including debarring fraudulent health care providers. The Federal Employees Health Care Protection Act of 1998 modified the definition of a carrier under FEHB and allowed the government-wide plan to be underwritten by participating affiliates licensed in each state. It also revised preemption provisions, requiring contracts under FEHB to supersede any state or local laws related to health insurance. OPM is required to encourage carriers to obtain discounts from healthcare providers and ensure full disclosure of discount conditions. The Federal Employees Health Care Protection Act of 1998 clarified rules for FEHB plans, allowing direct access, payment, and reimbursement to licensed health care providers not specified in statute. It also allowed individuals from FDIC and Federal Reserve health plans to enroll in FEHB plans upon termination of their respective plans. The District of Columbia Courts and Justice Technical Corrections Act of 1998 and the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1999 provided various benefits for federal employees, including access to FEHB plans and coverage for contraceptives. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000 required the Secretary of Defense to compare health care coverage under TRICARE and FEHB, including cost-sharing requirements, overall costs, covered benefits, and exclusions from coverage. The Veterans Millennium Health Care and Benefits Act changed how TCC works for certain individuals. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Children's Equity Act of 2000 (P.L. 106-394) mandated that employees must provide health insurance coverage for dependent children under FEHB if required by court order. The National Defense Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2001 (P.L. 106-398) directs federal agencies to enroll employees in family plans with lower coverage if they are no longer enrolled in FEHB. Employees with individual coverage can switch to family coverage, and agencies are directed to change enrollment to family coverage if employees do not make the change. The District of Columbia Appropriations Act, 2001 (P.L. 106-522) allowed certain employees of the District of Columbia to be treated as federal employees for eligibility for FEHB benefits. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002 (P.L. 107-107) authorized employing agencies to pay both the employee's and employer's share of premiums for health care coverage under FEHB for certain reservists called to active duty. The Comptroller General was directed to study the health needs of reserve components of the Armed Forces and National Guard, assessing costs and effectiveness of options including FEHB coverage. P.L. 107-304 allowed OPIC health plan beneficiaries to get FEHB coverage when plans end, considering prior enrollment as FEHB enrollment. The State Justice Institute Reauthorization Act of 2004 extended FEHB coverage to employees who started after October 1, 1988. The Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005 allowed for temporary continuation of FEHB coverage for federal employees called to active duty in support of a contingency operation. The Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005 authorized the Director of the CIA to protect intelligence operations and establish a nonofficial cover employee health insurance program. The Federal Employee Dental and Vision Benefits Enhancement Act of 2004 directed OPM to submit a report. The Act of 2004 (P.L. 108-496) directed OPM to report to Congress on options for providing health insurance to unmarried, dependent children under 25 who are full-time students. P.L. 110-74 made U.S. citizens employed by the Roosevelt Campobello International Park Commission eligible for FEHB. P.L. 110-279 authorized certain federal employee benefits for Senate Restaurant employees after operations are contracted to a private business. P.L. 110-279 authorized federal benefits, including FEHB, for Senate restaurant employees under the Architect of the Capitol after operations are contracted out. P.L. 110-422 specified TCC requirements under FEHB for NASA employees affected by the Space Shuttle Program termination or other separations. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires NASA to pay the remaining share of the premium for FEHB coverage. FEHB plans must comply with ACA provisions, with OPM providing guidance on implementation. Some provisions have no impact on FEHB, while others introduce new requirements. OPM has expanded ACA provisions for FEHB plans, including allowing adult children up to age 26 to remain on their parent's health insurance plan. TCC is available for three years when the child ages out at 26. Certain disabled children can also remain dependents indefinitely if disabled before 26. New plans must offer preventive care with no out-of-pocket costs. FEHB plans must provide preventive care with no out-of-pocket costs as required by the ACA. Cost sharing can be waived for in-network providers only. Plans must offer a summary of benefits and coverage (SBC) and a glossary of terms to help consumers understand health insurance terms. The ACA required FEHB plans to eliminate lifetime limits on certain health benefits and establish restricted annual limits before January 1, 2014. Plans were also mandated to comply with coverage requirements for clinical trials and prohibited from having preexisting condition exclusions starting in 2013. The ACA prohibited preexisting condition exclusions in 2014, which does not impact FEHB plans. Another ACA requirement for FEHB plans is reporting a medical loss ratio and issuing rebates if the ratio falls below 85%. Rebates are sent directly to OPM. The ACA requires health plans to issue rebates to OPM, deposited into the contingency reserve for future premium reductions. It also changed qualified medical expenses for tax-advantaged accounts, excluding OTC medicines unless prescribed. The penalty for nonqualified HSA withdrawals was raised, and maximum HCFSA contributions were lowered under FEHB. The ACA lowered maximum contributions to a Health Care Flexible Spending Account (HCFSA) under FEHB from $5,000 to $2,500, indexed to inflation. Eligible Indian tribes can purchase FEHB for tribal employees, with the tribe paying the government's share of the premium. Employers must provide the aggregate cost of employer-sponsored coverage on an employee's W-2 starting in 2012. Insurers and self-insuring employers had new requirements starting in 2014. The ACA required insurers, employers, and government agencies to report minimum essential coverage details to the Secretary of HHS starting in 2014, with a delayed effective date until 2015. Members of Congress and certain staff could only access health plans created under the ACA or through an exchange from January 1, 2014. They could no longer purchase FEHB plans as active employees but could receive an employer contribution if they enrolled in a health plan through a SHOP exchange. The ACA includes provisions to raise revenues that may impact FEHB plans, such as annual fees on health insurance plans and a 40% excise tax on coverage exceeding certain thresholds. Members of Congress and designated staff eligible for retirement can enroll in an FEHB plan upon retirement. For more details, refer to CRS Report R43194, Health Benefits for Members of Congress and Designated Congressional Staff. The ACA includes a 40% excise tax on health insurance coverage exceeding thresholds of $10,200 for single coverage and $27,500 for family coverage. This tax applies to employer and employee premium payments, dental and vision coverage premiums, and payments towards health-related accounts. The thresholds will be indexed to inflation in subsequent years. Additionally, the ACA requires the Director of OPM to offer at least two multistate plans through each exchange in each state. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 allows FEHB enrollees to select \"self plus one\" coverage. The Director of OPM can establish separate units for MSPs without reducing resources for FEHB. FEHB plans are not required to offer an MSP. The government will determine the share of premiums for self plus one coverage in the same way as individual and family coverage in FEHB. OPM will pay either 72% of the weighted average premium or 75% of any given plan's premium, whichever is smaller. In the first contract year of self plus one option, OPM will calculate the weighted average premium based on actuarial analysis."
