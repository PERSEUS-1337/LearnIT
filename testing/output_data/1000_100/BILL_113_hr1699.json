    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Genetically Engineered Food Right-to-Know Act\" and its purpose and findings are outlined in Section 2. The \"Genetically Engineered Food Right-to-Know Act\" aims to establish a standard for labeling foods produced using genetic engineering, including fish, to inform consumers about the production process. Congress recognizes the material changes in genetically engineered food, the FDA's labeling requirements, and the right of individuals in the US to know if their food was genetically engineered. Over 60 countries, including the UK and EU countries, already require labeling for genetically engineered foods. Several countries, including EU countries, South Korea, Japan, Brazil, Australia, India, and China, have laws mandating disclosure of genetically engineered food on labels. The Codex Alimentarius adopted a text in 2011 allowing governments to decide on labeling genetically engineered foods. Mandatory identification of such foods can preserve economic value in exports and sensitive markets. SEC. 3. AMENDMENTS TO THE FEDERAL FOOD, DRUG, AND COSMETIC ACT. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to require clear disclosure of genetically engineered ingredients in food, with exceptions for certain types of food like those served in restaurants or medical foods. The term 'genetic engineering' involves in vitro nucleic acid techniques, fusion of cells beyond taxonomic family, and techniques not used in traditional breeding. 'Genetically engineered' refers to a material intended for human consumption that is altered through genetic engineering processes. The term 'genetically engineered ingredient' refers to a material derived from an organism that has been genetically engineered, regardless of detectable molecular or cellular changes, or the organism's suitability for human consumption. No person shall be subject to penalties for a violation of food misbranding if they establish a guaranty signed by a person in the US from whom the food was received in good faith. The exclusion from penalties for food misbranding applies to recipients who establish a guaranty stating that the food is not genetically engineered, regardless of how the food is used. The text discusses the responsibility and liability for misbranded food, prohibiting individuals from transferring this responsibility to others through contracts. It also defines the terms 'genetically engineered' and 'genetically engineered ingredient'. Additionally, it amends a section related to false guaranties in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The text amends section 303(d) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to address unintended contamination of food by genetically engineered materials. It provides exemptions for agricultural producers whose non-genetically engineered food is contaminated with genetically engineered food. The text amends section 303(d) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to address unintended contamination of food by genetically engineered materials. It provides exemptions for agricultural producers whose non-genetically engineered food is contaminated with genetically engineered food. The Secretary must establish labeling requirements within one year of the Act's enactment."
