    "content": "The Senate Appropriations Committee reported a bill appropriating funds for the Departments of Transportation and Housing and Urban Development for FY2013. The bill recommends $3.210 billion for activities funded under the Community Development Fund account, including the Community Development Block Grant Program. The President's budget proposal for FY2013 includes $3.143 billion for the same account. The Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program, administered by HUD, is a key source of financial assistance for neighborhood revitalization, housing rehabilitation, and economic development. Grants are allocated to various communities and states to address local development needs. The Obama Administration's budget request for FY2013 includes $3.143 billion for these activities. The Obama Administration's FY2013 budget proposal includes $3.143 billion for the Community Development Block Grant program administered by HUD. Additionally, the budget requests $100 million for the Sustainable Communities Initiative and transfers funding for the Capacity Building for Community Development and Affordable Housing program. The Obama Administration's FY2013 budget proposal includes $3.143 billion for the Community Development Block Grant program. Funding for the Capacity Building for Community Development and Affordable Housing program would be transferred to the CDF account. The budget also requests $100 million for the Sustainable Communities Initiative and reinstating funding for SCI program activities. The Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI) was funded at $99 million in FY2011 and proposed by the Obama Administration. For FY2013, the Administration is requesting $100 million to support SCI's components, including Regional Integrated Planning Grants and Community Challenge Grants. These grants aim to integrate planning requirements for sustainable communities in collaboration with federal agencies like DOT and EPA. The Obama Administration is requesting $46 million for grants to reform building codes and zoning ordinances in communities to promote sustainable growth. Additionally, $8 million would fund research on the benefits of various efforts, including Regional Integrated Planning Grants and Community Challenge Grants. $3 million would be allocated for technical support in developing a residential energy modeling system. The curr_chunk discusses an energy modeling system for estimating costs and savings of energy retrofits in HUD housing, common energy standards for construction and rehabilitation, and sources of funds for energy efficiency improvements. It also mentions the CDBG Section 108 Loan Guarantee program, which allows communities to borrow funds for economic development projects. The CDBG Section 108 Loan Guarantee program allows communities to borrow funds for economic development projects. The Administration's budget proposes doubling the program's loan commitment ceiling to $500 million in FY2013 to help finance job creation activities. The Administration proposed charging a fee-based assessment to borrowers accessing the CDBG program to eliminate the need for a credit subsidy. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $3.210 billion for CDBG activities in FY2013, including $3.100 billion for formula grants. The bill also supports $60 million in funding for Indian tribes and restores funding for SCI activities. The bill recommends restoring funding for SCI activities with an appropriation of $50 million, half of the Administration's request. It also allocates $12.5 million to SCI in communities with populations under 500,000. The bill supports converting Section 108 loan guarantees to a fee-based program and increasing the loan guarantee commitment to $500 million for FY2013. Additionally, it recommends continued funding of Section 4 activities at $35 million but does not support transferring the program from its current account. The House Appropriations Committee reported the Transportation and Housing and Urban Development and Related Agencies Appropriations act on June 20, 2012, recommending $3.404 billion for activities funded under the CDF account, including $3.344 billion for CDBG formula grants. H.R. 5972 supports the Administration's $60 million funding request for Indian tribes but does not include a set-aside of CDBG funds for SCI activities. The bill recommends $2 million for closeout and evaluation of previously awarded SCI awards, does not support the Administration's request for Section 108 loan guarantee conversion, and recommends $6 million in loan subsidies for a $244 million loan guarantee ceiling. It also recommends continued funding for Section 4 activities at $35 million and does not support transferring the program from its current account. The full House began floor consideration of the bill on June 27, 2012. During floor debate, several amendments were introduced calling for funding reductions or elimination of the CDBG and Section 108 loan guarantee programs, but none were approved. Amendments proposing funding reductions for salaries and expenses, CDF, and the Section 108 loan guarantee program were all defeated. During the FY2012 budget debate, a fifth amendment was challenged on a point of order and ruled out for seeking to change existing law in an appropriation bill. Congress aimed to reduce federal spending while supporting job creation to combat high unemployment and a sluggish economy. During the FY2012 budget debate, the Obama Administration proposed restructuring the CDF account by reducing funding for CDBG formula grants, eliminating funding for certain programs, and converting Section 108 loan guarantees to a fee-based program. Supporters vowed to defend the CDBG program against funding cuts. The Obama Administration proposed restructuring the CDF account in the FY2012 budget by reducing funding for CDBG formula grants, eliminating certain programs, and converting Section 108 loan guarantees to a fee-based program. The proposed funding level for FY2012 was $3.804 billion, representing a 14.5% reduction from FY2010 enacted appropriations but an 8.6% increase from FY2011. The Administration requested an 11.5% increase in funding for CDBG states and entitlement communities, along with funding for insular areas, Indian tribes, Rural Innovation Grants, and Guam. The Obama Administration's FY2012 budget proposed restructuring the CDF account by reducing funding for CDBG formula grants and eliminating certain programs. It also recommended transferring the SCI programs to a new stand-alone account with an appropriation of $150 million. This funding would support Regional Integrated Planning Grants, Rural Innovation Funds for rural areas, and assistance to Guam for community development needs related to military relocations. The Administration did not include funding for Economic Development Initiatives and Neighborhood Initiatives grants, opposing congressional earmarks for these programs.

It recommended transferring the SCI programs to a new stand-alone account with an appropriation of $150 million. This funding would support Regional Integrated Planning Grants, Rural Innovation Funds for rural areas, and assistance to Guam for community development needs related to military relocations. The Administration's budget proposed doubling the program's loan commitment ceiling from $250 million in FY2011 to $500 million in FY2012. The Obama Administration's FY2012 budget proposed increasing the CDF program's loan commitment ceiling from $250 million in FY2011 to $500 million in FY2012 to help local governments finance job creation activities. The Administration also suggested charging a fee-based assessment to borrowers accessing the program to eliminate the need for an appropriated credit subsidy. Congress rejected this proposal and maintained the status quo. The House Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, HUD, and Related Agencies approved a draft bill recommending $3.501 billion for CDF activities in FY2012. The subcommittee draft bill recommended $3.501 billion for CDF activities, including $3.466 billion for CDBG formula grants to states, local governments, and insular areas; and $35 million for Indian tribes. The draft bill did not eliminate funding for the CDBG program but suggested that states and local communities should use more of their own taxes for community development activities to increase transparency and accountability. The draft bill proposed changes to CDF funding priorities, including reducing funding for CDBG Indian Tribes and rejecting the Administration's proposal to restructure Section 108 loan guarantees. It recommended maintaining the current structure and providing credit subsidies to support Section 108 loan guarantees. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended reducing CDBG administrative expenses from 20% to 10% of the grantee's allocation in the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Act for FY2012. The bill proposed a $3 billion funding level for CDF, with $2.851 billion for CDBG formula funding, a 13.7% reduction from FY2011 levels. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended reducing CDBG administrative expenses from 20% to 10% of the grantee's allocation in the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Act for FY2012. The bill proposed a $3 billion funding level for CDF, with $2.851 billion for CDBG formula funding, a 13.7% reduction from FY2011 levels. The recommended funding level for the Sustainable Communities Initiative was $90 million, $60 million less than requested by the President and $9 million less than appropriated for FY2011. Senator Inouye submitted an amendment to consolidate three appropriations measures into a Minibus, which was approved by the Senate on November 1, 2011. Among the approved amendments was one proposed by Senator Coburn to prohibit the use of grants for repaying federal loans. The House and Senate reconciled differences in the bill H.R. 2112, with implications for the CDBG program and Section 108 loan guarantee program. The bill was signed into law as P.L. 112-55 on November 17, 2011, prohibiting the use of grants for repaying federal loans. The bill H.R. 2112, signed into law as P.L. 112-55 on November 17, 2011, appropriated $3.308 billion for CDF activities, including $300 million for CDBG disaster activities. The act funded core CDBG programs, allocating $60 million for Indian Tribes and $2.948 billion for formula grants to states, entitlement communities, and insular areas. This amount was 10.7% less than FY2011, 19.6% less than the President's request, and 15% less than the House recommendation, but 3.4% more than the Senate recommendation. Other CDF activities like the Sustainable Communities Initiative were not directly funded for FY2012. The bill H.R. 2112, signed into law as P.L. 112-55, allocated $3.308 billion for CDF activities, including $300 million for CDBG disaster activities. The funding decline reflects efforts to reduce federal spending. The act did not include provisions from the Senate version that would have restricted the use of federal grants and reduced the percentage of CDBG funds for administrative expenses. It did include a provision for a GAO study on the effectiveness of CDBG and HOME programs. The bill P.L. 112-55 allocated funds for CDF activities, including CDBG disaster activities. It required HUD to complete a study within 180 days and submit a progress report within 120 days. The Administration's proposal to convert Section 108 loan guarantees to a fee-based program was not supported for the third year. The act maintained the program's current structure and appropriated $5.952 million in credit subsidies for Section 108 loan guarantee commitments. The bill P.L. 112-55 allocated funds for CDF activities, including CDBG disaster activities. It included $240 million in Section 108 loan guarantee commitments with credit subsidies. The act also provided $400 million in CDBG supplemental disaster assistance for recovery efforts in areas declared disasters in 2011, focusing on housing, infrastructure, and economic revitalization. The act allowed HUD to waive CDBG program requirements, except for certain provisions, for disaster recovery efforts funded by FEMA or the Army Corps of Engineers. Grantees had to submit a recovery plan detailing fund use. $100 million of the $400 million allocated for disaster relief was exempt from spending limits. The Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act for FY2011, P.L. 112-10, included a provision appropriating $3.508 billion for the Community Development Fund (CDF). The act mandated a 0.2% rescission and a 1% discretionary transfer to the Department's Transformation Initiative, reducing the CDF account's total appropriation to $3.501 billion, approximately 16% lower than the previous year. The CDF, which includes the Community Development Block Grant program, was targeted for significant budget reductions in earlier legislation. In an earlier version of a consolidated appropriations bill, H.R. 1, funding for HUD's Community Development Fund, including the CDBG program, was targeted for a 62.5% reduction below the FY2010 appropriation. The House-passed H.R. 1 aimed to cut total discretionary program funding by $61 billion for FY2011, including the CDF account with the CDBG program. However, the bill failed to pass the Senate. After failed attempts in both the House and Senate to pass budget measures, negotiations between the Obama Administration and Congressional leaders led to the signing of P.L. 112-10, the Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act for FY2011. The act allocated $3.508 billion for the Community Development Fund, including $3.343 billion for the CDBG program, and included a 0.2% across-the-board rescission. The Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act for FY2011 allocated $3.508 billion for the Community Development Fund, with a 0.2% across-the-board rescission. This included a 0.2% mandatory cut and a 1% discretionary transfer from designated HUD funds to HUD's Transformation Initiative, reducing the CDF account by $7 million to $3.501 billion. The Senate committee's amended version of H.R. 1 (S.Amdt. 149) allocated $3.501 billion for the Community Development Fund (CDF), which is 21.3% less than the previous year's funding. The CDF account includes the CDBG program for formula-based grants to various entities. Funding for CDBG formula grants was reduced by 16.4% under P.L. 112-10. The House passed H.R. 1, reducing funding for the Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI) by 33% and the Community Development Fund (CDF) by 66.3% below the FY2010 level. The bill also prohibited funds from being used for earmarks and SCI. It did not specify how funds were to be allocated among different components of the CDBG program. The Senate Appropriations Committee submitted an amendment to H.R. 1, proposing $4.230 billion for Community Development Fund activities, including $3.990 billion for the CDBG program. The amendment aimed to freeze CDBG formula grant funds at the FY2010 level. The Senate bill proposed allocating $3.943 billion for formula grant funds to states and entitlement communities, with insular areas receiving $7 million and Indian tribes $40 million. The FY2011 appropriations for CDBG program components totaled $3.296 billion, a decrease of 16.4% from FY2010. In FY2012, allocations to entitlement communities and states were $2.942 billion, a 10.7% decrease from FY2011. The average grant amount for entitlement communities declined from $2.4 million in FY2010 to $1.7 million in FY2012, a 29.1% reduction. This decrease is due to lower appropriations and an increase in qualifying communities. State allocations also decreased by 25.4% from $23.2 million in FY2010 to $17.3 million in FY2012. Despite these reductions, they are less than the 62.5% reduction proposed in H.R. 1, which would have significantly impacted community and economic development plans. The proposed funding reduction in H.R. 1 would have impacted long-term community and economic development plans, forcing states and local governments to postpone or terminate activities supporting private sector development, job creation, public facilities, and services. Non-profit organizations serving as CDBG sub-grantees would also see reduced resources. Supporters argue that the funding cut disproportionately affects low and moderate-income households, as communities are required to allocate at least 70% of funds to benefit them. The FY2012 appropriations for the CDBG program are the lowest in over a decade, leading to delays and reductions in projects for entitlement communities. Table 5 shows the distribution of funds to states and entitlement communities. The funding cut impacts low and moderate-income households disproportionately. The Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act for FY2011 reduced CDBG formula allocations by 16.4% below FY2010 levels, while the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2012 decreased allocations by 25.1% below FY2011 amounts. 70% of CDBG funds go to entitlement communities, with the remaining 30% allocated to states and small communities. Formula A and Formula B are used to allocate funds to eligible entitlement communities and states based on population, poverty, and overcrowded housing factors. Formula A was created in 1974, while Formula B was enacted in 1977. The Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1977, P.L. 95-128, allocate funds to metropolitan cities and urban counties based on population growth lag, poverty share, and housing built before 1940 factors. CDBG funds distribution to states is governed by Formula A and Formula B, which consider population, poverty, overcrowded housing, and poverty housing built before 1940. The CDBG program uses Census Bureau data from the 2010 Decennial Census and the 2005-2009 American Community Survey to allocate funds based on poverty, overcrowded housing conditions, and pre-1940 housing. This allows for more accurate reflection of demographic changes in allocations. HUD released a study in December 2011 on the impact of using 2010 Census and ACS data for CDBG formula grant fund allocations. The study assumed constant eligible entities and appropriations from FY2011 to FY2012 to isolate the data source change's effect on fund distribution. Findings showed communities in Puerto Rico may be most negatively affected by the switch in data sources. Entitlement communities in Puerto Rico, the Mid-Atlantic, and Pacific/Hawaii regions saw a decline in CDBG allocations due to changes in data sources, while those in the Rocky Mountain, Great Plains, and Midwest regions experienced an increase. The shift to new data sources favored principal cities and urban counties, with a decrease in funding for other entitlement cities. The changes in funding allocations for entitlement communities are driven by increasing poverty in urban counties, decreasing overcrowding in satellite cities, and more pre-1940 housing in central cities. New Mexico and Puerto Rico experience the largest funding declines. The report includes a comparison of funding allocations for entitlement communities and a review of the CDF account's funding history from FY2000 to FY2011. Figure 1 illustrates the distribution of funding. The CDF account's funding history from FY2000 to FY2011 shows fluctuations in appropriations, with a focus on the CDBG-formula component. Supporters advocate for increased funding due to a decline in appropriations and an increase in communities gaining entitlement status. The CDBG program has faced criticism for the declining average grant amount allocated to entitlement communities from FY2000 to FY2010, leading to a shrinking share of funds for eligible recipients. Critics argue that increased funding is not justified, especially with the need to reduce domestic discretionary spending to address the federal budget deficit and national debt. The average allocation for CDBG entitlement communities has been fluctuating, with an increase from FY2001 to FY2008, a decline from FY2009 to FY2010, and a 9% increase from FY2008 to FY2010. However, the FY2011 estimated average allocation is $1.9 million, 34.5% less than FY2000. The number of entitlement communities receiving direct allocations increased from 1,012 in FY2000 to 1,167 in FY2011. The average annual grant amount awarded to states showed less pronounced fluctuations, with $1.183 billion allocated in FY2010. In FY2010, $1.183 billion was allocated among states and Puerto Rico for distribution to nonentitlement communities, which was 7.4% less than in FY2000. The average state allocation declined from $25.5 million in FY2002 to $21.1 million in FY2008 before rebounding to $23.2 million in FY2010. However, the FY2011 average state allocation decreased to $19.1 million, 23.3% less than in FY2000. Program funding declined by 40% in inflation-adjusted constant dollars from $4.235 billion in FY2000 to $2.545 billion in FY2011. Appropriations for CDBG formula grants fluctuated between $3.5 billion and $4.3 billion. Appropriations for CDBG formula grants in the CDF have varied between $3.5 billion and $4.3 billion over the last decade. The CDF also includes smaller programs with specific objectives and recipients, some of which have been funded at the expense of the CDBG formula grant program. Set-aside programs in the CDF saw fluctuations in both the number and appropriations from FY2000 to FY2011, with funding ranging from $647 million in FY2001 to $61 million in FY2007. In FY2001, Congress allocated $647 million for CDF set-asides, decreasing to $61 million in FY2007. By FY2010, $509 million was appropriated, mainly for Economic Development Initiative (EDI) and Neighborhood Initiative (NI) earmarks. However, funding for these programs was eliminated in FY2011 due to Congressional decisions on categorical grant programs within the CDF account. From FY2000 to FY2011, CDBG-related set-asides and earmarks fluctuated, with a significant decline in FY2008 followed by a rebound in FY2009 and FY2010 before declining again in FY2011. The EDI and NI programs were the main recipients of congressional earmarked projects within the CDF account, except for FY2007 and FY2011 when no earmarks were allocated. Earmarks have been a topic of debate in recent Congresses, with all earmarks being removed in FY2007. In FY2008 and FY2009, EDI and NI earmarks were the main components of CDBG-linked set asides programs, totaling twice the amount allocated for other activities. However, in FY2011, Congress did not provide funding for NI and EDI earmarks. Congress has utilized the CDBG program's framework for supplemental appropriations to support disaster relief and recovery efforts, such as after 9/11 and the Gulf Coast hurricanes of 2005. The CDBG program has been used to support disaster relief efforts after events like 9/11 and the Gulf Coast hurricanes of 2005, as well as to address the mortgage foreclosure crisis and economic recession. Funding was allocated to states and communities meeting specific criteria, with a focus on acquiring, rehabilitating, and reselling foreclosed properties under the Neighborhood Stabilization Program. In the case of CDBG disaster funding, only communities designated as disaster areas by a presidential declaration receive funds at Congress' discretion. Funds for NSP-1 and NSP-3 were allocated to states based on mortgage foreclosure rates, subprime loans, and delinquencies. Congress set a minimum grant amount for each state and required funds to be distributed to local governments with high foreclosure rates. The Neighborhood Stabilization Program allocated funds based on mortgage foreclosures, subprime loans, and delinquencies. NSP-1 funds were directly administered by qualifying communities, while NSP-3 funds had a minimum threshold for allocation. NSP-2 funds were awarded competitively to various entities. Legislation was introduced to rescind NSP-3 funds. The House Financial Services Committee's Subcommittee on Insurance, Housing, and Community Opportunity held a hearing on NSP and federal foreclosure mitigation programs. H.R. 861 was considered and approved with an amendment requiring HUD to publish a notice of termination of the NSP program. Representative Miller criticized the program as ineffective and a waste of taxpayers' dollars. Representative Miller criticized the NSP-3 program as ineffective and a waste of taxpayers' dollars, arguing for funding rescission due to the need to reduce federal debt. However, other Members defended the program's success in assisting communities affected by the mortgage foreclosure crisis. HUD's Assistant Secretary stated that NSP is expected to impact 100,000 properties and support over 93,000 jobs nationwide. The Department estimates that NSP will support over 93,000 jobs nationwide. The House passed the measure on March 16, 2011, by a vote of 242 to 182. A companion bill to H.R. 861 has not been introduced in the Senate."
