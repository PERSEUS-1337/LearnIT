FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\" Congress finds that the tax treatment of section 529 college savings plans was changed in 2001 to exempt qualified distributions from taxation. This favorable treatment was made permanent in 2006. 529 plans help middle-class families save for college, with 11.83 million accounts totaling $244.5 billion in assets. The average account size is $20,671. States sponsoring these plans benefit families seeking to offset rising college costs. The President's proposed tax on 529 college savings plans may discourage their use, leading to increased student debt. The Act aims to strengthen these plans by allowing qualified distributions for expenses like purchasing a computer. The Act aims to enact policies to strengthen and modernize 529 college savings plans, making them more consumer-friendly and responsive to students' current needs. Computer technology and equipment are now considered qualified higher education expenses for Section 529 accounts. Section 529 accounts now allow expenses for computer equipment, software, and internet access for beneficiaries enrolled in eligible educational institutions. Effective for taxable years starting after December 31, 2014. SEC. 3. ELIMINATION OF DISTRIBUTION AGGREGATION REQUIREMENTS. Amends Section 529(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 by removing subparagraph (D). Effective for distributions after December 31, 2014. SEC. 4. RECONTRIBUTION OF REFUNDED AMOUNTS. The amendment allows beneficiaries to recontribute refunded qualified higher education expenses to a qualified tuition program within 60 days of the refund, not exceeding the refunded amount. The amendment made by this section applies to refunds of qualified higher education expenses after December 31, 2014, with a transition rule for refunds received before the enactment of the Act. The House of Representatives passed the subparagraph for refunds within 60 days."
