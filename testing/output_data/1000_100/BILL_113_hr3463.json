The Border Patrol Pay Reform Act of 2013 aims to strengthen U.S. Customs and Border Protection, ensure Border Patrol agents are ready for necessary work and overtime, and provide flexibility for shift changes and work assignments based on operational needs. The act also introduces a new section, \"Border Patrol Rate of Pay,\" to address pay rates and definitions for Border Patrol agents. The term 'Border Patrol agent' refers to an individual accessible for unscheduled duty by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. They perform functions related to detecting and preventing illegal entry and smuggling activities. The duties of a Border Patrol agent include preventing illegal entry and smuggling activities, such as smuggling aliens, commercial goods, narcotics, weapons, or contraband into the United States. They also arrest individuals suspected of such conduct and attend authorized training by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Additionally, they have specific circumstances like being on leave, travel status, official time, excused absence, light duty, or performing administrative duties with law enforcement authority. The term 'level 1 border patrol rate of pay' for a Border Patrol agent is 1.25 times the hourly rate of basic pay, while 'level 2 border patrol rate of pay' is 1.125 times the hourly rate. A 'work period' refers to a 14-day biweekly pay cycle. The Border Patrol agent must choose between the level 1 or level 2 border patrol rate of pay each year, or decline both options. The term 'work period' refers to a 14-day biweekly pay cycle. The Director of the Office of Personnel Management will establish procedures for Border Patrol agents to make an election between different pay rates. U.S. Customs and Border Protection will provide information on the available elections to agents before each year. Failure to elect will result in a default choice. The sense of Congress is that U.S. Customs and Border Protection should ensure that no more than 10% of Border Patrol agents decline the level 1 or level 2 border patrol rate of pay. Level 1 border patrol rate of pay includes 8 hours of regular time per day and 2 additional hours of scheduled overtime. The Border Patrol agent shall receive pay at the level 1 border patrol rate of pay for regular time work and shall not receive additional compensation or compensatory time off for regularly scheduled overtime work. Any hours available to work during a work period shall be included in the regular time or scheduled overtime hours. The Border Patrol agent shall receive compensatory time off or pay at the overtime hourly rate for hours worked over 100 hours during a work period. They shall be charged leave in 8-hour increments for 1 shift of leave, regardless of shift length. Level 2 Border Patrol agents work 5 days a week, with 8 hours of regular time per day and 1 additional hour of scheduled work. The Border Patrol agent shall receive pay at the level 2 border patrol rate of pay for regular time work and scheduled overtime. They will not receive additional compensation or compensatory time off for scheduled overtime hours. The Border Patrol agent shall receive compensatory time off or pay at the overtime hourly rate for hours worked in excess of 90 hours during a work period. Leave for 1 shift is charged in increments of 8 hours, regardless of the shift length. The Border Patrol agent works 8 hours per day, 5 days a week, with any available work hours included. They receive compensatory time off or overtime pay for hours exceeding 80 in a work period. Additionally, they are eligible for premium pay for night work as per section 5545. The Border Patrol agent is entitled to Sunday and holiday pay, as well as overtime pay determined by specific sections. They are not eligible for other premium pay, except as provided. Pay received at certain rates is considered part of basic pay for various purposes. The Border Patrol agent is entitled to overtime work as needed for local or national emergencies, as specified in regulations and laws. The term 'Border Patrol agent' is defined in section 5550. Border Patrol agents assigned to the level 1 border patrol rate of pay are entitled to overtime work for hours exceeding 100 in a 14-day biweekly pay period. Overtime pay is provided for officially ordered or approved work, while compensatory time off is given for other overtime hours. Border Patrol agents with an election for the level 2 border patrol rate of pay are eligible for overtime work for hours over 90 in a 14-day biweekly pay period. They receive overtime pay for officially ordered or approved work and compensatory time off for other overtime hours. Border Patrol agents with an election for the level 2 border patrol rate of pay are eligible for overtime work for hours over 80 in a 14-day biweekly pay period. They receive overtime pay for officially ordered or approved work and compensatory time off for other overtime hours. During a 14-day biweekly pay period, Border Patrol agents are limited to 8 hours of overtime work without receiving compensatory time off. U.S. Customs and Border Protection can waive this limitation for certain circumstances with advance approval. Agents cannot accumulate more than 240 hours of compensatory time off in a year and must use any unused hours within 1 year of accrual. The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 is amended to include Border Patrol agents as eligible for certain benefits. Border Patrol agents are now eligible for benefits under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938."
