    "content": "The EPA believes there should be a higher rate of NSR permits for new or expanded facilities. The CAA requires a permit for major modifications or new sources, with approval from the state agency if the state has an EPA-approved SIP. The applicant must demonstrate compliance with NAAQS and PSD regulations to receive a \"Permit to Construct.\" The New Source Review (NSR) process is triggered for new sources emitting 100 tons annually of any criteria air pollutant or causing a significant increase in emissions. Sources subject to PSD must install Best Available Control Technology (BACT), while those under non-attainment provisions must install Lowest Achievable Emission. BACT must be at least as stringent as the federally determined New Source Performance Standard (NSPS) for that pollutant. The New Source Review (NSR) process requires new sources to install Best Available Control Technology (BACT) or Lowest Achievable Emission Rate (LAER) and obtain offsets. Despite NSR's broad coverage, few permits have been issued to coal-fired power plants due to stagnant capacity and minimal new construction. Emissions trends for electric utilities reflect this static situation. Emissions trends for electric utilities show a static situation with coal-fired capacity. SO2 emissions significantly dropped in 1995 due to the acid rain control program under title IV of the 1990 CAA Amendments, requiring power plants to reduce emissions by 30%. NOx emissions also decreased with the installation of Low-NOx burners. EPA reported a reduction in SO2 emissions from 10 million tons in 1990 to 5.3 million tons in 1995, and a decrease in NOx emissions by 0.4 million tons in 1996 compared to 1990 levels. The reductions achieved under title IV have been partially offset by increases in emissions from other plants. While title IV led to a 4.7 million ton reduction in SO2 by 1995, overall emissions only decreased by about 3.6 million tons. Similarly, a 0.4 million ton reduction in NOx by 1996 resulted in an overall reduction of only about 0.1 million tons. This slippage is due to phase 1 not covering all coal-fired facilities, indicating sources of increasing emissions within the relatively flat trends for coal-fired capacity and air emissions. Despite a lack of new plant construction, existing coal-fired facilities continue to operate. Despite the lack of new plant construction, coal-fired electricity generation and coal consumption have increased over the past decade. Utilities are optimizing performance of existing coal-fired facilities, leading to increased utilization and efficiency. This shift in plant maintenance economics raises questions about the sustainability of coal-fired generation. The issue at hand is whether maintaining or expanding generation from existing coal-fired facilities constitutes \"routine maintenance\" or a \"major modification\" under the Clean Air Act. Utilities are avoiding the term \"life extension\" for old power plants due to regulatory implications. The focus on plant economics in the electric utility industry is likely to intensify this issue in the future. The Clean Air Act requires power plants built after August 1971 to restrict emissions of air pollutants like sulfur dioxide. Plants constructed before 1971 are exempt, but can lose their exemption if they are modified in a major way. There is ongoing regulatory activity related to electricity generation and air quality, including the Ozone Transport Rule, Section 126 Petitions, and new NAAQS for Fine Particulates. Adding NSR enforcement to the list is being considered. The Department of Justice/EPA lawsuits under NSR are aimed at enforcing existing laws and regulations for stationary sources. NSR is a primary enforcement tool for permitting and is separate from regulatory development activities. EPA's enforcement actions under NSR are not linked to other regulatory initiatives and stem from an examination of coal-fired utilities starting in late 1996. NSR allows EPA to seek remedial actions and monetary penalties against violators. EPA can request affected sources violating NSR to install the latest BACT, such as FGD units for SO2 reduction and SCR units for NOx reduction. These control devices could reduce emissions by 70-90%. Administrator Browner highlighted potential substantial reductions in SO2 and NOx emissions from powerplants emitting 2.2 million tons of SO2 and 0.66 million tons of NOx in 2000. Administrator Browner stated that controlling sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides from power plants could lead to an 85 to 95 percent reduction in these pollutants, equivalent to removing 26 million cars off the road and reducing acid rain by 15 percent. Extending the life of existing coal-fired plants is seen as a cost-effective alternative to constructing new capacity in the electric utility restructuring. The focus on NSR reflects a belief that this trend will continue, with the potential for further renovations in the competitive generating market. The EPA is taking legal action against utilities for maintenance activities approved for decades. The trend of renovating coal-fired plants has been ongoing for almost two decades, with recognized emissions impacts. Enforcing NSR on existing facilities has been challenging due to budget constraints and defining major modifications. EPA's focus on NSR reflects the belief in continued renovations in the competitive market. The CAA defines a major modification as any physical or operational change that increases air pollutant emissions from a stationary source. EPA regulations also consider any replacement of components exceeding 50% of building costs as a modification. The focus shifted to NSR in 1977, requiring a different approach to defining modifications. The EPA shifted focus from enforcing NSPS emission rates to compliance with NAAQS and PSD, defining a \"significant\" increase in emissions as exceeding 40 tons per year for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. Enforcing these thresholds has proven challenging, as NSPS program thresholds do not constrain life extension efforts by utilities. Most life extension efforts improve unit availability and reliability without changing maximum hourly emission rates or exceeding the 50% asset value threshold. NSR review is triggered by a tonnage increase in pollutant output. The EPA shifted focus from enforcing NSPS emission rates to compliance with NAAQS and PSD, defining a \"significant\" increase in emissions as exceeding 40 tons per year for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. NSR review has a more sensitive trigger - a tonnage increase in pollutant output. In the late 1980s, EPA enforced NSR against facilities undergoing life extension efforts, leading to litigation and congressional debate. EPA modified the emissions trigger for electric utilities in 1992. The new \"test\" for NSR compares a facility's actual emissions before and after a modification. Actual emissions are based on a 2-year average prior to the change, while future actual emissions consider projected rates and utilization. Utilities are adapting to EPA regulations by spreading out life extension efforts to avoid triggering NSR. Utilities are adapting to EPA regulations by spreading out life extension efforts to fit into routine maintenance schedules, blurring the distinction between \"modification\" and \"routine maintenance.\" The term \"life extension\" has been replaced with terms like capital improvement and rehabilitation program. The Justice Department's lawsuits aim to enforce New Source Review requirements of the Clean Air Act. EPA has issued a \"Compliance Order\" regarding modifications at coal-fired power plants by investor-owned utilities and the Tennessee Valley Authority that should have triggered new source reviews. The Justice Department/EPA has identified facilities violating NSR requirements and types of rehabilitations considered modifications for NSR. Additional complaints may be issued by the agency. The EPA issued a Compliance Order for violations at coal-fired power plants by investor-owned utilities and the Tennessee Valley Authority. Complaints seek injunctive relief and civil penalties up to $25,000 per day. The order requires compliance with Clean Air Act requirements, installation of Best Available Control Technology, permit applications, and audits for past violations. TVA must develop a compliance schedule, audit coal-fired plants for NSR compliance, and retire SO2 allowances for reductions. The industry's response to EPA's enforcement action focuses on an exemption under NSR for \"routine maintenance.\" Industry argues that EPA has not objected to utilities engaging in activities now cited as NSR violations for the past 20 years. They claim these activities are necessary for reliable plant operation and accuse EPA of changing the rules mid-game. The EPA's enforcement action under NSR aims to reduce sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides emissions from power plants significantly. This reduction could lead to a 85 to 95 percent decrease in these pollutants, equivalent to 1.87 million tons of SO2 and 0.63 million tons of NOx emissions. The industry argues for an exemption for routine maintenance practices to ensure efficient plant operation, claiming these activities have been necessary for reliable operation for the past 20 years. The EPA's NSR action aims to reduce SO2 and NOx emissions from power plants significantly, potentially cutting emissions by 1.87 million tons of SO2 and 0.63 million tons of NOx. These reductions would more than compensate for previous slippages in emissions cuts. However, the complexity of the Clean Air Act means that reductions achieved under NSR would interact with reduction requirements under title IV, which limits total SO2 emissions from utilities to 8.9 million tons. The Clean Air Act limits total SO2 emissions from utilities to 8.9 million tons through tonnage limitations and emission offset requirements. Title IV created an emissions allowance system where allowances are allocated to existing facilities based on emission rate/fuel consumption formulas. Allowances can be used, traded, or banked for future use or sale, resulting in a successful program with 100% compliance. The 1990 CAA Amendments program for SO2 emissions has 100% compliance but does not integrate well with the 1977 CAA Amendments NSR program. NSR focuses on modifications at existing facilities and BACT installation, while Title IV focuses on reducing aggregate SO2 emissions with flexibility for compliance strategies. Compliance with the emissions cap is the key criterion for Title IV, while NSR ensures individual plant standards are met. The current SO2 NSPS requires a 70%-90% reduction in emissions depending on the coal burned. The SO2 reduction requirement under Title IV can be met with low-sulfur coal for existing coal-fired facilities. Installing BACT under NSR may result in excess SO2 allowances that can be sold. Title IV does not adjust allowance allocations based on NSR enforcement, potentially nullifying any reductions achieved. The NOx NSPS historically has not reflected cutting-edge technology. The standard set in 1979 could be met with simple modifications and did not require pollution control devices like SCR. In 1998, EPA issued a new NOx NSPS for coal-fired facilities at 0.15 lb. of NOx per million Btu, aligning with available technology. However, the new standard was challenged in court, leading to confusion over the floor for determining BACT or LAER for modified coal-fired sources. The 1998 NSPS for coal-fired facilities set a NOx reduction program under title IV, which differs from the SO2 program. The title IV program is based on emission rates, with existing facilities required to meet set rates by 1995 or 2000. Some coal-fired facilities have had more stringent emission controls since 1995 than the existing NSPS. The EPA is enforcing NSR requirements to reduce emissions, but it is uncertain if this will result in actual NOx reduction or just costly litigation. NSR was implemented as part of the Clean Air Act to control emissions from existing sources. The Clean Air Act implemented NSR to control emissions from existing sources, but more efficient methods have been developed since 1977. Title IV of the CAA significantly reduced SO2 and NOx emissions from utility plants, outperforming NSR. The \"cap and trade\" program under title IV had 100% compliance, while NSR's compliance has been questioned. EPA lawsuits regarding NSR could take years to resolve with uncertain outcomes. Expanding and building on title IV is proposed as an alternative approach. The alternative approach to NSR enforcement is to expand and build on the success of title IV's cap and trade program by lowering the cap on SO2 emissions from coal-fired powerplants. Lowering the existing cap by about two-thirds could achieve similar emission reductions as meeting the 1978 NSPS, providing utilities with flexibility in achieving reductions. Despite potential shutdown credits, the administrative and cost advantages of the allowance system may be worth considering. The administrative and cost advantages of the allowance system may be worth it, requiring new legislation. Implementing a regional cap and trade program for NOx could eliminate uncertainties in EPA initiatives. EPA is urging states to consider this program in compliance with Ozone Transport Rule and Section 126 petitions. However, implementing a regionwide cap and trade program for NOx would require extraordinary cooperation. The stalled NOx SIP Call for NOx may require extraordinary cooperation between affected states or new EPA authority. Another option is to focus on reducing SO2 and NOx emissions through various EPA regulatory initiatives, such as the OTR and Section 126 petitions, fine particulate NAAQS, and regional haze rule. These initiatives have long implementation schedules with limited reductions before 2010 and do not require additional legislative authority. Another alternative is to control other pollutants associated with NSR. A third alternative to NSR would be to initiate controls on pollutants like mercury and carbon dioxide from coal-fired power plants. Currently, CO2 is not considered an air pollutant under the CAA, and regulating mercury emissions has been slow. EPA argues it has authority to regulate CO2, but this is controversial. CO2 reductions may have to come from voluntary initiatives or ratification of the Kyoto Protocol. Another option is to reform NSR through new legislation. One reform option for NSR is to define \"modification\" based on plant age, simplifying the trigger. EPA has been considering reforms for years, including off-ramps like the \"Clean Unit Exclusion\" for units with state-of-the-art pollution control technology. NSR reform proposals include defining \"clean units\" as those with recent pollution control technology. EPA is considering alternatives like cap and trade programs to replace NSR, citing duplication and higher costs. EPA acknowledges the need for legislative action and the uncertainty of litigation outcomes in NSR cases. The Clean Air Act of 1970 has a loophole that allows older coal-burning power plants to emit more pollution than new plants. Industry lobbyists argued that requiring expensive retrofits for older plants would be wasteful as they were expected to retire soon, but many are still operating without environmental controls. The term \"grandfathered powerplant\" is commonly used in debates on emissions from existing power plants. The term \"grandfathered\" is used in debates on emissions from existing power plants, specifically to indicate if a plant is covered under Section 111 of the Clean Air Act. This section requires new power plants to meet emission standards, but older plants are often exempt. Currently, NSPS regulations cover sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter emissions from power plants. The term \"grandfathered\" refers to older power plants that are not subject to NSPS regulations for emissions. Some pollutants like CO2 and mercury are not covered by NSPS. EPA reviews NSPS every eight years for increased stringency. The EPA reviews NSPS every eight years to increase stringency for covered pollutants. The ambiguity of what powerplants are \"grandfathered\" arises due to no set baseline, with virtually all coal-fired powerplants considered \"grandfathered\" for NOx emissions. Title IV of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments changed regulations for existing powerplants regarding SO2 and NOx, sometimes imposing more stringent requirements than NSPS. For example, some \"grandfathered\" powerplants had to meet stricter NOx standards under phase 1 in 1995 than new powerplants. Under phase 2 of title IV, existing \"grandfathered\" coal-fired powerplants are required to meet SO2 standards equivalent to or more stringent than the 1971 NSPS for SO2. The term \"grandfathered\" becomes meaningless in this context. Age of plant is not relevant for NOx emissions debate; fuel source is. Coal-fired facilities, regardless of age, should be the focus for increasing NOx controls. For SO2 emissions debate, the title IV emissions cap is the relevant consideration, with age factoring into allocation of emission credits. The NSPS for SO2 for new powerplants is effectively nil as they must offset emissions under the cap. Shrinking the current cap on SO2 is suggested for reducing emissions. A cap on NOx emissions is also proposed for electric generating facilities. EPA favors state-by-state emissions caps to address transported pollution programs in the Northeast. The WEPCO decision and DOJ/EPA actions on NSR have sparked public debate and congressional oversight. The suits depend on interpretations of CAA provisions. The suits depend on interpretations of CAA provisions, especially regarding modifications of existing sources and addressing NSR issues. Many alternatives for NSR issues would require new legislation amending the CAA to bring consistency and update the Clean Air Act's approach to regulating the electric utility industry's environmental impact."
