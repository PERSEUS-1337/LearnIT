    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Ethical and Legal Elections for Congressional Transitions Act\" and requires a special election in case of a vacancy in the office of a Senator. The \"Ethical and Legal Elections for Congressional Transitions Act\" mandates a special election to fill a Senate vacancy, with the President of the Senate certifying the vacancy and the state issuing a writ of election within 90 days. The special election must adhere to state laws governing such elections, except in cases where the vacancy occurs near a regularly scheduled election. The President of the Senate can issue a certification for a Senate vacancy within specific timeframes before or after a general election. This section does not affect a state's authority to appoint a temporary Senator until a special election is held. An individual appointed to fill a vacancy in office holds authority until a special election is held. SEC. 297 of the Help America Vote Act of 2002 provides payments to states to reimburse a portion of the costs incurred in holding special elections to fill Senate vacancies. The Commission will make payments to eligible States to cover costs of holding special elections to fill Senate vacancies. States must submit a statement of incurred or anticipated costs, including those for primary elections. The Commission will provide 50 percent of the reasonable costs incurred by a State for holding a special election, to be paid within 30 days of receiving the State's statement. States must agree to repay any excess payment received. The State will receive a payment for the election, which should not exceed the actual costs incurred. Authorization of appropriations for payments under this part for fiscal year 2009 and beyond is granted to the Commission."
