Congress finds that approximately 60 percent of Indian tribe members and Alaska Natives live on or near Indian lands with a high unemployment rate of 45 percent. These individuals own over 197,000 businesses, generating more than $34 billion in revenue. The service industry is the largest sector, followed by construction and retail trade. The number of businesses owned by these groups increased by 84 percent from 1992 to 1997. The Small Business Development Center program is cost-effective, with clients generating additional tax revenues of $468,000,000 in 1998, six times the program's cost to the Federal Government. Businesses owned by Indian tribe members, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians receiving services under the program have a higher survival rate than average small businesses. The Act aims to stimulate economies, foster economic development, and support the creation and expansion of small businesses owned by Indian tribe members, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians through business counseling and technical assistance. Increased counseling has been shown to reduce default rates in lending programs. The Act aims to support small businesses owned by Indian tribe members, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians by seeking advice from Tribal Councils and ensuring access to business counseling and technical assistance. Small Business Development Center assistance is provided to Indian tribe members, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians. The Small Business Act is amended to provide an additional grant for Small Business Development Centers in eligible states to assist Indian tribe members, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians with business startups and expansions on Indian lands. An eligible State must have a population of Indian tribe members, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians comprising at least 1 percent of the total population. Grant applicants must submit a form detailing their goals and capabilities to provide training and services to these groups. The grant applicant must provide details on the proposed Small Business Development Center site, required grant funding, and consultation with local Tribal Councils. Matching funds requirements do not apply for this grant. The Small Business Development Centers receiving grants must adhere to standards for educational, technical, and support services. The maximum grant amount per applicant is $300,000 for one fiscal year. Final regulations for this grant program will be issued by the Administration after consultation with the recognized Association. The Small Business Development Centers receiving assistance must adhere to standards for work plans. Definitions for terms like 'Indian lands' are provided in this section. The curr_chunk defines terms related to Indian tribes, including 'Indian tribe' and 'Indian tribe member'. The definitions are based on specific criteria outlined in federal regulations and the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978. The curr_chunk provides definitions for 'Alaska Native' and 'Native Hawaiian' individuals based on specific criteria. The curr_chunk defines 'tribal organization' and authorizes appropriations of $7,000,000 for fiscal years 2006 through 2008 with funding limitations specified. The Administration can only carry out the defined paragraph with funds specifically appropriated for it. Section 21(c) of the Small Business Act is amended to require Small Business Development Centers to seek advice from tribal organizations on how to assist Indian tribe members, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians."
