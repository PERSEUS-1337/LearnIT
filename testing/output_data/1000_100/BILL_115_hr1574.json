    "content": "The \"Protecting Dissenting Viewpoints and Voices Act of 2017\" is a legislation that aims to provide viewpoint protection in communications. It amends Title I of the Communications Act of 1934 to include provisions for protecting viewpoints. The \"Protecting Dissenting Viewpoints and Voices Act of 2017\" prohibits the revocation of licenses or other actions based on viewpoints expressed in broadcast content. It also prohibits placing conditions on viewpoints in transaction reviews. The Commission retains authority to take action or impose conditions on approvals related to violations of specific sections of the United States Code, regardless of the Protecting Dissenting Viewpoints and Voices Act of 2017. The President is prohibited from directing any agency to retaliate against individuals based on their viewpoints expressed in broadcast or disseminated content. This restriction applies to actions related to public interest obligations, incitement under the First Amendment, or violations of specific sections of the United States Code. The President is restricted from directing agencies to impose conditions on approvals or decisions based on viewpoints expressed in broadcast or disseminated content by individuals or affiliated persons. This does not affect the President's authority to take action or place conditions on agency decisions for other reasons. The agency's decision-making jurisdiction includes violations of specific sections of the United States Code, such as section 1304, 1343, and 1464, or conduct that would constitute a violation of these sections if content was disseminated through radio or television broadcast. The term \"agency\" in this subsection refers to its definition in section 551 of title 5, United States Code. The President may execute duties under any provision of law, including the dissemination of content that constitutes incitement under the First Amendment."
