    "content": "The Act titled \"Tax Reduction and Economic Growth Act of 1995\" allows for tax reduction in the event of low growth. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget must notify the President and Congress if economic growth is below 1.5% and national unemployment is above 6.5% for specific testing periods. After notification of economic indicators, the President may authorize temporary tax reductions for a specified year to stimulate the economy. The declaration must be transmitted to Congress for approval. The President can authorize temporary tax reductions for a specific year to stimulate the economy. The tax rates for the first income bracket in the tax tables will be reduced by up to 3%, and the tax amounts in the tables will be adjusted accordingly. The Secretary of the Treasury can modify withholding tables under section 3402(a) to reflect the full calendar year effect of a reduction. A temporary surtax may be implemented if economic growth requirements are met in the following year. The tax tables in section 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 will be adjusted annually based on a percentage determined in paragraph (4). However, tax rates for individuals with Adjusted Gross Income below $50,000 and joint filers below $75,000 will not exceed the previous year's rates. Additionally, the tax amounts in the tables will be adjusted to reflect these rate increases. The tax tables will be adjusted annually based on a percentage determined in paragraph (4). The withholding tables will be modified to reflect the increase in tax rates. Economic growth requirements must be satisfied for any calendar year. The tax tables will be adjusted annually based on a percentage determined in paragraph (4), which is the percentage increase in tax rates resulting in an aggregate increase in receipts without raising taxes for individuals with Adjusted Gross Income of less than $50,000. Taxpayers with Adjusted Gross Income of less than $75,000 may qualify for a temporary tax reduction published in the Federal Register annually. The Act exempts any changes in revenue from being considered under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985."
