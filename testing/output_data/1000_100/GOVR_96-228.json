    "content": "A construction helper is a general utility employee who assists skilled workers, often unskilled but may have various skills. They could be craftsmen or journeymen forced by economic reasons to take lower-level work. Helpers are usually not union members and are paid less than skilled workers, but can perform equally well in certain tasks. They are valued for their lower cost and flexibility in accepting different types of work. A construction helper can be a valuable addition to a work crew, performing narrow aspects of complex tasks under supervision. The debate continues on the economic efficiency and quality of workmanship of having helpers work alongside skilled workers. Apprentices receive comprehensive training, while helpers receive minimal training required for the task at hand. The Davis-Bacon Act recognizes apprentices and trainees in formal programs for wage rate purposes but generally does not recognize helpers to protect the prevailing wage structure. The Act requires construction contracts over $2,000 to state minimum wages for laborers and mechanics. The Davis-Bacon Act delegates the determination of prevailing wages for laborers and mechanics to the Secretary of Labor, leading to ongoing debates and legal disputes over concepts like \"wages,\" \"prevailing,\" and \"project of a character similar.\" The Act also addresses the recognition of apprentices and trainees but generally does not acknowledge helpers to maintain prevailing wage standards. The Davis-Bacon Act delegates prevailing wage determination to the Secretary of Labor, leading to debates over concepts like \"wages\" and \"prevailing.\" The Act addresses apprentices and trainees but does not mention helpers to maintain wage standards. Congress legislated broadly, leaving definitions to the Secretary of Labor, who developed necessary regulations over time. The Davis-Bacon Act focused on prevailing wage determination for apprentices and trainees, overseen by the Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training. The term \"helper\" was loosely defined in regulations, causing confusion in wage rate determinations. Business economist Armand Thieblot highlighted the need for clear definitions in the Davis-Bacon regulations. The Davis-Bacon Act focuses on prevailing wage determination for apprentices and trainees. Helpers may need to be reclassified as journeymen or laborers if not enrolled in an approved apprenticeship program. Recognition of helpers for Davis-Bacon rate purposes depends on prevalent use in geographic areas with open shop firms. Unions rarely recognize the helper category. Unions view DOL's restrictions on helpers as crucial to upholding labor standards in the building trades under the Davis-Bacon Act. Contractors could exploit the use of helpers to undercut prevailing wage rates, causing conflict with the Building and Construction Trades Department. The Building and Construction Trades Department (BCTD) criticizes the use of \"helper\" and \"trainee\" titles as wage-cutting devices that undermine the Davis-Bacon Act. There is a push for reform or repeal of the Act through direct legislation or regulatory changes, with Congress having reviewed but not substantially altered it. In late December 1979, the Carter Administration proposed a rule revising the administration of the Davis-Bacon Act, emphasizing the classification of laborers and mechanics based on work performed rather than skill levels. The rule also addressed prevailing wages for apprentices and trainees. The proposed rule under the Carter Administration in late December 1979 aimed to revise the Davis-Bacon Act by focusing on laborer and mechanic classification based on work performed. It also addressed prevailing wages for apprentices and trainees. The rule established two tests for designating a special wage rate for helpers, emphasizing their utilization in the proposed work area and distinction from other labor classifications. Despite defining \"laborer,\" \"mechanic,\" \"apprentice,\" and \"trainee,\" the rule omitted a definition for helpers. In mid-January 1981, a final rule was published, with the Department of Labor explaining its position on the employment of helpers. The Department emphasized the availability of apprenticeship and training programs for young persons, minorities, and women to prevent them from being locked into low-paying jobs. It clarified that reduced wages for apprentices and trainees were exceptions to the Davis-Bacon Act, with strict conditions to prevent circumvention. The final rule defined apprentice and trainee but not helper, stating that wage differences were based on work performed, not skill levels. The Department faced challenges in recognizing the use of helpers and determining prevailing wage rates. The Reagan Administration delayed and then withdrew Davis-Bacon regulations for further review. Three periods of consideration during the Reagan era included a proposed rule in August 1981, a final rule in May 1982, and ongoing litigation. On August 14, 1981, a new proposed rule was issued. The Reagan Administration proposed a new rule for the Davis-Bacon Act on August 14, 1981, allowing for a helper classification on wage determinations in the construction industry. The Department aimed to recognize prevailing helper practices more broadly, permitting one helper to five journeymen. The new regulations under the Reagan Administration allowed for a helper classification in the construction industry, with a ratio of one helper to five journeymen. The purpose was to increase the use of helpers, defined as semi-skilled workers assisting journeyman with various tasks. The Department of Labor issued new regulations allowing for a helper classification in the construction industry, with a ratio of one helper to five journeymen. Helpers perform tasks under the direction of a journeyman and use tools of the trade. The final Davis-Bacon rule was issued in May 1995, changing the previous restrictive approach towards helpers. The Department of Labor raised the helper to journeyman ratio to 2:3 in the construction industry, allowing up to 40% of the workforce to be helpers. The decision was met with mixed reactions, with some criticizing the lack of evidence supporting the new ratio. The Building and Construction Trades Department criticized the new helper ratio rule for lacking credible evidence to support it, allowing almost unlimited use of helpers within a craft. Industry groups, such as the Associated General Contractors and the American Farm Bureau Federation, supported the regulatory change for projected cost savings. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and AFL-CIO had differing views on the new Davis-Bacon regulations, particularly regarding the treatment of helper classification. The Chamber of Commerce saw it as a positive change allowing for more flexibility in hiring, while the AFL-CIO criticized it for potentially lowering wages and impacting minority workers. The AFL-CIO filed a lawsuit to prevent wage-cutting and misclassification under the Davis-Bacon Act. Judge Greene issued a preliminary injunction against the Secretary of Labor, addressing concerns about the helper provision. Congress enacted the Davis-Bacon Act to prevent employers from avoiding paying skilled laborers' wages by classifying workers as \"helpers.\" The AFL-CIO filed a lawsuit to prevent wage-cutting and misclassification under the Davis-Bacon Act. Judge Greene issued a preliminary injunction against the Secretary of Labor, addressing concerns about the helper provision. The report highlighted issues with intermediate classifications of labor leading to skilled wages decreasing towards unskilled levels. It recommended construction contracts specify minimum wages based on prevailing rates for corresponding classes of laborers and mechanics. The new regulations risk allowing what Congress sought to prevent in 1935 by not maintaining clear lines between skilled and unskilled labor. Under new regulations, helpers are now considered \"general helpers\" and can perform any task in the construction field. This could lead to contractors assigning helpers tasks of higher skilled workers at lower pay, potentially undermining the requirement for wages to be based on corresponding classes of laborers and mechanics. The Wage Appeals Board expressed concern that allowing contractors to freely classify traditional craft work could undermine the Davis-Bacon Act, as wages should be based on corresponding classes of laborers and mechanics, not just identifiable helpers. The Wage Appeals Board is concerned that the new regulations under the Davis-Bacon Act may allow contractors to replace traditional craft workers with helpers, which goes against the original purpose of the Act. Judge Greene criticized the changes, stating that previous interpretations of the regulations have been consistent with the original understanding. Judge Greene, after reviewing the case, issued a permanent injunction against the implementation of the helper rule. The U.S. Court of Appeals partly upheld and partly overturned the District Court verdict on the helper issue, stating that the provision allowing a helper classification to be 'identifiable' in an area undermines the act's purpose of mirroring local prevailing wages on federal construction projects. The Appeals Court criticized the potential down-grading of work classifications, such as turning \"carpenter work\" into \"carpenter's helper work\" to reduce wages. It noted that Congress viewed underclassification as contrary to the act's purposes. The Court found the Secretary of Labor's attempt to redefine helper roles to better reflect local practices reasonable. The Appeals Court split on the helper issue, upholding Judge Greene on the \"identifiable\" versus \"prevailing\" practice but accepting the Secretary's new definition of \"helper.\" The decision blocked the implementation of the helper rule, leading the unions to appeal to the Supreme Court, which declined to hear the case in January 1984. The Secretary of Labor had to restructure the helper regulation to gain judicial approval, and on January 31, 1985, DOL implemented other approved portions of the general rule. In late August 1987, a new proposed rule on the use of helpers was issued by the Department, conforming to Judge Greene's standard. Defining \"prevailing\" remained a problem, with various options presented for public comment. A revised final rule was published on January 27, 1989, but had to be cleared through the District Court due to the 1982 injunction. Judge Greene vacated the rule on September 24, 1990. After Judge Greene vacated the injunction on September 24, 1990, the Department of Labor was allowed to implement the helper regulation. However, building trades unions filed an appeal on October 2, 1990. Despite the Department's notice that the helper rule would take effect on February 4, 1991, Congress intervened with the \"Dire Emergency Supplemental Appropriations\" bill of April 10, 1991, preventing the Secretary of Labor from implementing or administering the regulation. This restriction was in place until the end of the fiscal year, raising questions about its permanency. In late September 1991, BCTD President Robert Georgine urged Labor Secretary Lynn Martin to withhold implementation of the helper regulation until the judicial appeal was completed. The DOL's funding request to implement the regulation in FY1992 was denied by both the House and the Senate. The Appeals Court upheld the Department's definition of \"helper\" and \"prevailing\" but deemed the ratio of helpers to journeymen as \"arbitrary and capricious,\" leading to its invalidation. The court deemed the ratio of helpers to journeymen as \"arbitrary and capricious,\" leading to its invalidation. The Department issued a new final rule removing the ratio, allowing for an open-ended interpretation, which was a major blow to building trades. The Department's decision to implement the helper regulation in 1992 was seen as a blow to building trades unions and a victory for industry critics. Debate continued on the regulation's impact on manpower utilization, labor costs, and project expenses. Despite calls for major revision or repeal of the Davis-Bacon Act, reform through rulemaking was considered a more viable option initially. Senator Nickles introduced legislation in September 1982 to amend the Davis-Bacon Act by including the classification of \"helper\" for workers. Despite various efforts to codify the regulations, the helper issue resurfaced in Congress in 1993 during consideration of H.R. 2518. Senator Nickles proposed the deletion of committee language blocking the implementation of DOL-proposed regulations allowing the use of helpers on Davis-Bacon projects, citing potential savings of $600 million annually. Senator Harkin opposed the proposal, suggesting a one-year delay to evaluate the regulations. Senator Nickles proposed the deletion of committee language blocking the implementation of DOL-proposed regulations allowing the use of helpers on Davis-Bacon projects, citing potential savings of $600 million annually. Senator Harkin disputed the impact on minority workers and apprentice training programs, leading to a vote of 60 yeas to 39 nays in favor of suspending the regulations for one year. On June 21, 1994, the House Appropriations Committee defeated a proposal by Representative DeLay to remove funding restraint for helper regulations. During floor debate on H.R. 4606, DeLay argued for removing the restrictive language to allow helper regulation implementation, citing benefits for public construction and local contractors. Representative Ford opposed, stating that Davis-Bacon requirements ensure quality construction and prevent undermining wages and benefits in local communities. The House Appropriations Committee defeated a proposal to remove funding restraint for helper regulations, which would undermine apprenticeship training programs and create low-skilled jobs. Representative Ford urged against the DeLay amendment, which was ultimately defeated, retaining the language prohibiting implementation of the helper regulations in the bill. In the 104th Congress, there were efforts to repeal the Davis-Bacon Act and the related Copeland Act. Senator Kassebaum introduced S. 141 for repeal, while Representative Ballenger introduced H.R. 500 for the same purpose. The bills were referred to committees for consideration. In the 104th Congress, efforts were made to repeal the Davis-Bacon and Copeland Acts. The Subcommittee on Workforce Protections voted to report the measure to the full Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities. Additional bills, S. 1183 and H.R. 2472, were introduced as compromises to reform rather than repeal Davis-Bacon. Representative Weldon argued that repealing Davis-Bacon would harm skilled construction workers and their families. The Hatfield and Weldon bills proposed comprehensive revisions to the Davis-Bacon Act, including provisions for helpers. The Hatfield/Weldon bills proposed revisions to the Davis-Bacon Act, including provisions for helpers. The bills did not resolve technical issues regarding helper classifications and compensation rates. The term \"prevails\" remained undefined, and there was no specified ratio of helpers to other workers. The term \"prevails\" remained undefined, and no ratio of helpers to journeymen was established. The Hatfield/Weldon legislation was not acted upon by the 104th Congress, leading to a suspension of the helper regulation in November 1993. The spending prohibition continued until mid-fiscal 1996, with no further prohibition imposed for the latter half of fiscal 1996 and fiscal 1997. In June 1996, the Associated Builders and Contractors (ABC) filed a lawsuit to enforce the revised helper regulations. Builders and Contractors (ABC) sued the Department to enforce regulations regarding helpers. ABC President Gary Hess claimed the exclusion of helpers cost taxpayers over $500 million annually. Assistant Secretary of Labor Bernard Anderson stated the current helper regulation was unenforceable due to unclear distinctions between helpers and other workers. The Department had no intention of implementing the regulation in its current form. The Department of Labor (DOL) noted the need to review a suspended regulation regarding helpers on federal construction projects. The regulation was initially aimed at aligning the construction workforce with private sector practices and reducing costs. Additional information prompted the review, as data from implementing the regulation was not available during the rulemaking process. The Department of Labor expressed concerns about the potential abuse of the helper regulation and its impact on apprenticeship programs. Due to lack of public comment and Congressional controversy, DOL decided to reexamine the semi-skilled helper regulation. The Department of Labor decided to continue the suspension of the helper regulation while engaging in substantive rulemaking. Public comments received mainly focused on the substantive issues of the rule rather than the interim suspension. The Department of Labor continued the suspension of the helper regulation, with differing views on the interim suspension. The Building and Construction Trades Department agreed with the suspension, while the Associated General Contractors disagreed, arguing for a quicker implementation process. The Department believed that full implementation would take longer than 60 days based on past experience with similar regulations. The Department of Labor suspended the helper regulation immediately, providing a 60-day effective date for compliance. The regulation applies to contracts with bids advertised or negotiations concluded after the effective date, with bid solicitations requiring 30 to 60 days before contract award. Conforming changes in government procurement regulations and contract forms may take several months. Contractors can use helpers only if the contract contains a wage determination with a helper classification and rate. The Department of Labor suspended the helper regulation immediately, providing a 60-day effective date for compliance. Contractors can use helpers only if the contract contains a wage determination with a helper classification and rate. The Department aims to complete a substantive rulemaking action within approximately one year, and implementing helper regulations during this period would cause minimal savings and disruption. The Department of Labor has suspended the helper regulation due to disruption and uncertainty during rulemaking. Comments did not change their belief in continuing the suspension. They have not decided to repeal or amend the regulations but will reexamine the basis and effect of the semi-skilled helper regulations. New data suggests the use of helpers may not be as widespread as previously thought. The Department of Labor expressed concerns about the potential abuse of the helper classification and its impact on formal apprenticeship programs. They noted that the subjective standards for helper classification could make regulation and supervision more challenging. The Department of Labor is concerned about the subjective standards for the helper classification under Davis-Bacon, which could make enforcement more difficult. Critics worry that allowing lower wages for apprentices could discourage contractors from participating in formal training programs, threatening funding for apprenticeship and training. The Department of Labor is concerned about the impact of subjective standards for the helper classification under Davis-Bacon, which could threaten private funding for apprenticeship and training. Divergent opinions exist on whether the helper classification provides opportunities for workers to gain experience and skills. The Department of Labor suspended the helper regulation due to divergent opinions on its impact on apprenticeship programs. The Associated Builders and Contractors filed a lawsuit to implement the regulations, but the U.S. District Court ruled in favor of the Department's suspension. Judge Stanley Sporkin noted that the Department had \"good cause\" for the suspension in 1993. Judge Sporkin ruled that the Department of Labor was not obligated to implement the suspended regulations once the spending ban expired in 1996. He stated that the Department had the freedom to review and update the regulations as needed. Judge Sporkin ruled that the Department of Labor had collected new data on helper employment, which undermined the assumptions behind the revised regulations. This raised doubts about the cost-savings on federal construction projects. The Department was justified in considering new information and concerns that arose since the regulations were last implemented. Judge Sporkin reviewed the contentions of each side, noting that the plaintiffs focused on the substance of the regulations rather than procedural issues. They provided little evidence that delays by the Department of Labor were arbitrary and capricious. Judge Sporkin ruled in favor of the Department of Labor, suspending the helper regulation indefinitely. A new proposed rule on the use of helpers on Davis-Bacon projects was published, reflecting current practice. The Department of Labor's new policy on the use of helpers on Davis-Bacon projects reflects current industry practice and includes specific criteria for their use. The policy aims to align with private sector practices, reduce federal construction costs, and create more job opportunities. The Department of Labor's new policy on the use of helpers on Davis-Bacon projects aims to align with private sector practices, reduce federal construction costs, and create job opportunities. However, after nearly 2 decades of analysis, the agency found that the suspended rule may not be enforceable and could have a negative impact on apprenticeship and training. The findings under the Clinton Administration differ from those of previous administrations. The Department of Labor suspended a regulation on the use of helpers on Davis-Bacon projects, citing administrative difficulties and inconsistency in defining \"helper\" as a semi-skilled worker. Wage and Hour struggled with identifying job classifications and distinguishing between semi-skilled and skilled workers. The Department of Labor suspended a regulation on the use of helpers on Davis-Bacon projects due to difficulties in defining \"helper\" as a semi-skilled worker. The Department struggled with identifying job classifications and distinguishing between semi-skilled and skilled workers. The Department of Labor suspended a regulation on defining \"helper\" as a semi-skilled worker on Davis-Bacon projects due to difficulties in distinguishing job classifications and overlapping duties with laborers in the construction industry. The Department of Labor suspended a regulation on defining \"helper\" as a semi-skilled worker on Davis-Bacon projects due to difficulties in distinguishing job classifications and overlapping duties with laborers in the construction industry. The Department found that conducting a meaningful wage determination process for helpers was challenging due to contractors ascribing different meanings to the term. Survey data revealed that the use of helpers was substantially lower than initially assumed, leading to difficulties in defining and training programs for workers. The Department of Labor suspended a regulation on defining \"helper\" as a semi-skilled worker on Davis-Bacon projects due to difficulties in distinguishing job classifications and overlapping duties with laborers in the construction industry. This decision was made to encourage training for unskilled and semi-skilled workers, including women and minorities, through formal apprenticeship programs. The Department believes that allowing lower rates of pay in structured training programs will lead to better skilled, more productive, and safety-conscious workers. The Department of Labor suspended a regulation defining \"helper\" as a semi-skilled worker on Davis-Bacon projects to encourage training for unskilled and semi-skilled workers. A proposed new helper rule allowed the use of helpers instead of apprentices and trainees in formal programs, with a comment period until June 8, 1999. Legislation was introduced to establish helpers as a separate classification under the Davis-Bacon Act, but no action was taken. The bill H.R. 1012 defined a \"helper\" as a semi-skilled worker assisting a journeyman with various tasks. Introduced in March 1999, the bill was referred to the Committee on Education and the Workforce. The Department of Labor proposed a new rule in April 1999, without directly referencing H.R. 1012, to review the approach taken in the legislation. In 1999, the Department of Labor reviewed legislation regarding the use of helpers on Davis-Bacon projects, finding it imprecise and burdensome. A final rule was issued in November 2000, recognizing helpers as a separate category of workers. The regulation took effect in January 2001. The Department explained its reasoning for the proposed rule changes, following a pattern similar to prior years. The Department of Labor reviewed regulations on the use of helpers on Davis-Bacon projects, finding the proposed rule difficult to administer. Industry spokespersons disagreed, suggesting helpers could be identified through area practice surveys. The Department emphasized that helpers should be classified based on the duties they perform, as they may undertake tasks of other classifications without limitations. The Department of Labor found that the suspended rule on the use of helpers on Davis-Bacon projects would have undermined the prevailing wage structure by allowing helpers to perform duties of other classifications at lower wages. The Department cited vague criteria in the definition of a helper as a reason for the rule's suspension. The Department of Labor expressed concerns about the difficulty in distinguishing between semi-skilled and skilled work in the construction market, where craft workers and laborers often perform a range of duties. They also highlighted the challenges of defining supervision on a worksite and the ambiguities in the suspended rule. The Department of Labor expressed concerns about the challenges of conducting a meaningful wage determination process due to differing interpretations of the term 'helpers' in the suspended rule. The Mercatus Center at George Mason University highlighted the potential cost-saving benefits of the rule, but the Department emphasized the importance of protecting prevailing wages as mandated by the Davis-Bacon Act. The Department of Labor clarified that the Davis-Bacon Act aims to establish a wage floor, not to seek the cheapest labor. They found that the use of helpers is less common than previously thought, with only 3.9% of classifications utilizing helpers. The Department of Labor found that the percentage of helpers employed in construction is extremely low, with estimates ranging from 1.2% to slightly higher figures. They believe that helpers are not as widespread as previously assumed and expressed concerns that suspended helper regulations could negatively impact training programs in the construction industry. The building trades unions argued that allowing contractors to use low-wage helpers instead of apprentices would undermine formal apprenticeship programs in the construction industry, potentially leading to a shortage of skilled craft workers. Employers disputed this claim, stating that the use of helpers would not have a negative impact on training programs. The Department expressed concern that the use of helpers over apprentices in construction projects could undermine formal training programs and lead to a shortage of skilled workers. They argued that structured training programs are more effective than on-the-job training alone. The increased use of helpers under the suspended rule poses a significant risk to the growth of apprenticeship programs. The Department expressed concern that increased use of helpers in construction projects could undermine formal apprenticeship programs. The final rule restored the definition of \"helper\" to its original meaning, with specific criteria for classification in wage determinations on Davis-Bacon covered projects. In the 108th Congress, legislation was introduced to address the issue of helpers in construction projects, proposing that helpers be considered a separate classification for Davis-Bacon purposes. Representative Marsha Blackburn, along with Representatives Norwood and Steve King, introduced the \"Helpers Job Opportunity Act\" (H.R. 2283). The \"Helpers Job Opportunity Act\" proposed that helpers in construction projects be considered a separate classification for Davis-Bacon purposes. Helpers would be paid the prevailing wage of helpers and laborers or mechanics on similar projects in the locality. The bill defined a helper as a semi-skilled worker who assists a journeyman and may use tools under supervision. The proposal was introduced by Representative Blackburn in the 109th Congress but did not progress beyond committee referral. In the 109th Congress, the \"Helpers Job Opportunity Act\" aimed to create a separate classification for helpers in construction projects under the Davis-Bacon Act. However, no action was taken on the measure. The issue of helpers has not resurfaced in the 110th Congress, while the Davis-Bacon Act continues to be a topic of debate and review. The act saw a significant change in 1964 with the inclusion of a fringe benefit component to the prevailing wage. In the late 1970s, the Carter Administration reviewed the Davis-Bacon Act, leading to new regulations proposed in 1981. Litigation ensued, with court approval for some parts of the rule, including the helper provision in 1992. Congress intervened in 1996, blocking enforcement of the helper regulation. By 1996, the Department of Labor deemed the regulation \"non-administrable\" and stopped enforcing it. In 1996, the Department of Labor suspended enforcement of the helper regulation due to it being deemed \"non-administrable.\" Litigation ensued, leading to a court ruling in 1997 that the Department acted appropriately in withdrawing the regulation. The Department of Labor reinstated its longstanding practice regarding the use of helpers on Davis-Bacon projects after a new rule was proposed in 1999. The final helper rule was published in 2000, taking effect in 2001. This process spanned over 2 decades, with the regulation never fully implemented until the mid-1990s. The Department defended various versions of its proposed reforms between 1981 and 1993 before reassessing its position. After reassessing its position in the mid-1990s, the Department of Labor reverted to its longstanding practice regarding helpers on Davis-Bacon projects. The final rule in 2000 largely repudiated the policies of the 1980s and 1990s. Congress debated the \"helper\" issue, with legislation introduced but not passed in the 109th Congress. The issue has not resurfaced in the 110th Congress."
