    "content": "The United States is a key player in the global economy, being the largest investor and recipient of foreign direct investment. Its foreign investment policy aims to benefit both the U.S. and foreign investors, with exceptions for national security risks. The Trump Administration has not formally outlined its foreign investment policy, but has expressed openness to foreign investment. The United States welcomes foreign investment, with a global inward foreign direct investment position of $6.4 trillion in 2016. The Commerce Department uses three measures to publish data on U.S. direct investment position. In 2016, foreign direct investment in the United States increased by $876 billion at market value and $390 billion at historical cost and current cost. The total cumulative foreign direct investment position reached $7.4 trillion at market value, $4.0 trillion at current cost, and $3.5 trillion at historical cost. The United Kingdom and Japan are often the largest foreign direct investors in the U.S. economy. Foreign direct investment in the United States fluctuates annually, influenced by economic conditions. In 2014, a significant drop was seen due to a $130 billion stock buyback between Verizon and Vodafone. Despite not reaching pre-financial crisis levels, foreign direct investment in the U.S. surpassed 2007 levels in 2015 and 2016. Global foreign direct investment flows also experienced fluctuations, reaching $1.76 trillion in 2015, below the peak of $1.9 trillion in 2007. Foreign direct investment in the United States increased in 2016, with a 10% drop in net equity investments by foreign-owned firms. Equity capital accounted for 53.0% of foreign direct investment in the U.S., raising questions about its impact on the economy. Foreign direct investment in the U.S. saw a shift towards equity investments in 2016, accounting for nearly 67% of investment funds. Intercompany debt also shifted from outflows to positive inflows, with total debt falling by about 18% in 2015. Reinvested earnings from foreign firms fell by 15% between 2014 and 2015, with a slight decrease expected in 2016. In 2015, reinvested earnings from foreign firms fell by 15%, with a slight decrease expected in 2016. U.S. direct investment abroad rose by 1.5% in 2015 to $349 billion, and is estimated to increase by 2.4% in 2016 to $357 billion. Foreign firms' investment spending in the U.S. economy was 8.2% in 2013, down from 10.4% in 2012. In 2015, reinvested earnings from foreign firms fell by 15%, with a slight decrease expected in 2016. U.S. direct investment abroad rose by 1.5% in 2015 to $349 billion, and is estimated to increase by 2.4% in 2016 to $357 billion. U.S. trade is characterized by extensive intrafirm trade, accounting for 31% of exports and 35% of imports in 2014. Foreign investors from various countries have heavily invested in the U.S. economy, with over 90% of foreign direct investment coming from developed economies. The investments, valued at $1.2 trillion in 2015, are mainly in the manufacturing sector, particularly in chemicals and transport. Other sectors like finance, insurance, wholesale trade, and information also attract significant foreign direct investment. Foreign direct investment in the U.S. manufacturing sector is heavily concentrated in chemicals and transport, accounting for half of all investments. Labor productivity in the U.S. manufacturing sector doubled from 1993 to 2010, outperforming other sectors and advanced economies. U.S. unit labor costs decreased by 15% from 2002 to 2011, while costs rose in 18 other countries. Foreign direct investment in the U.S. manufacturing sector rose by nearly one-fourth in 2015 compared to the previous year. The largest percentage increase in foreign direct investment by industry was seen in commercial real estate, with a one-third increase in investments in 2015. The United Kingdom is the largest foreign direct investor in the U.S., followed by Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Canada, and Switzerland. At year-end 2015, foreign investments in the U.S. were dominated by Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Canada, Switzerland, Germany, and France. Certain industrial sectors show international specialization in investment patterns. The Netherlands and the United Kingdom led investments in the U.S. petroleum sector, with Japanese and British investments in wholesale trade, and European investments in retail trade. German investors were prominent in the information sector. Foreign direct investment in the U.S. is dominated by various countries in different sectors. German investors lead in the information sector, while French, German, and British investments dominate the banking sector. Investments in the finance sector are mainly from Dutch, Canadian, British, and French investors. In the manufacturing sector, Luxembourg, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Japan, Switzerland, France, and Germany account for nearly 80% of foreign direct investment. Canada's investment in the finance and insurance sectors surpasses Japan and Switzerland. Foreign direct investment in the United States amounts to $60 billion from Switzerland. Foreign firms' affiliates in the U.S. employ over 6.6 million workers, with half of them employed by the top six countries. One-third of foreign affiliate employment is in the U.S. manufacturing sector. New investments, known as \"greenfield\" investments, are preferred for adding local employment, while foreign acquisitions may not add new jobs. In 2015, outlays for new investments were made by both foreign investors and existing U.S. firms. Foreign direct investment in the United States saw a significant increase in 2015, with investments totaling $421 billion. Acquisitions of existing U.S. firms accounted for over 96% of new foreign investments, while U.S. affiliates of foreign firms made up more than 80% of total transactions. Acquisitions also accounted for 99% of employment associated with foreign investment, raising questions about the economic impact on U.S. employment. Since the end of World War II, U.S. foreign investment policy has supported foreign direct investment, with a recent increase in national security-related concerns. Many countries have implemented new measures to restrict foreign investment, raising policy issues. The United States addresses national security concerns through a multiagency process for foreign acquisitions of U.S. firms. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) oversees foreign investment in U.S. firms to determine national security implications and has the authority to block transactions that threaten national security. The process is voluntary but firms risk future review and possible divestiture if they do not notify CFIUS of impending investments. CFIUS oversees foreign investment in U.S. firms to determine national security implications and has the authority to block transactions. In an annual report, CFIUS indicated that 42% of notified foreign investment transactions from 2008 to 2014 were in the manufacturing sector. Investments in finance, information, and services sectors accounted for 31% of total notified transactions. Within manufacturing, over 40% of transactions were in computer and electronic products. Services sector had half of total transactions in finance, information, and services category. The growing international presence and investment activity of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) are raising concerns over economic and security implications. An estimated 22% of the world's largest firms are under state control, leading to worries about preferential treatment and anticompetitive effects in the global marketplace. Policymakers fear that SOEs may gain competitive advantages through market protection and access to below-market financing terms. State-owned enterprises (SOEs) may blur the line between commercial and government-driven activities, potentially compromising national security objectives. Concerns exist over preferential treatment and lack of market competition leading to a lack of long-term competitiveness. The OECD has found little evidence that advantages given to SOEs impact their international economic performance. The OECD found that ownership does not necessarily influence a company's operations. In 2014, there were over 3,790 U.S. parent companies with 32,000 foreign affiliates, while foreign firms had 6,600 affiliates in the U.S. U.S. parent companies employed 26 million workers in the U.S. and 13.8 million abroad. U.S.-based affiliates of foreign firms paid 80% more in employee compensation in the U.S. than foreign affiliates of U.S. parent companies. The data shows that U.S. parent companies are more efficient than U.S. affiliates of U.S. firms or foreign firms in the U.S. Foreign firms in the U.S. are more capital intensive. U.S. affiliates of foreign companies have higher gross output, while foreign affiliates of U.S. firms have higher total sales. Foreign affiliates of U.S. firms pay more taxes to foreign governments. Foreign firms operating in the United States pay more taxes than U.S. parent companies and foreign-owned affiliates. They have a presence in every state, with California having the highest number of employees. In 2014, 38% of foreign firms' employment was in the manufacturing sector, with an average annual compensation of $82,000 per worker. Retail and wholesale trade also accounted for a significant portion of total affiliate employment. Foreign firms in the United States have a significant presence in various sectors. Dutch-affiliated firms are the largest employers in retail trade, while Japanese and German firms dominate wholesale trade. British and Japanese firms lead in professional services, and the finance sector has the highest average employee compensation. Other sectors like information, finance, and real estate also contribute to total affiliate employment. The affiliates of foreign firms in the United States have a significant economic impact, with $248 billion spent on new plants and equipment in 2014. Foreign direct investment has increased eight-fold since 1980, reaching 6.4% of U.S. GDP. However, the performance of foreign-owned establishments compared to U.S.-owned ones shows a mixed picture, with historically lower rates of return that have narrowed over time. Foreign-owned manufacturing firms in the U.S. outperform their U.S. counterparts, with higher value added and shipments. They have larger plant sizes, on average six times larger, due to the absence of small plants among foreign-owned establishments. This difference in plant size is attributed to the costs associated with acquiring or establishing a new business that disappear over time. Foreign-owned manufacturing firms in the U.S. outperform their U.S. counterparts with higher wages, productivity, and output. These firms also exhibit higher capital intensity across various industries. However, comparisons between foreign-owned and U.S. firms should be approached with caution due to differences in firm sizes and additional factors influencing performance. Foreign firms investing in the United States are typically large with proven technologies, opting for larger-scale and higher-capital-intensity plants to offset risks and generate higher profits. In 2015, foreign direct investment in the U.S. increased sharply, reflecting a growing economy and rising equity values. Globally, foreign direct investment inflows rose by 38% to $1.7 trillion in 2015, although they have not fully recovered from pre-financial crisis levels. Global foreign direct investment flows have not fully recovered from pre-financial crisis levels, with inflows in 2007 at $2.0 trillion. In 2015, many regions in Africa and parts of Latin America experienced a slowdown in foreign direct investment, with economies in transition seeing a 38% decrease. As the U.S. economy improves relative to other advanced economies, interest rates remain low, and inflation stays in check, foreign direct investment in the U.S. is expected to increase. Estimates suggest that foreign direct investment in the U.S. economy may slightly rise in 2016. Public concerns over globalization's impact on jobs and the economy will be crucial. Concerns over foreign direct investment in the U.S. economy are driven by potential job losses from mergers and acquisitions, regardless of whether the acquiring company is foreign or U.S.-owned. These concerns are balanced by perceived benefits of capital inflow and job creation. Opposition to certain foreign investments also stems from national security concerns, particularly after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Despite national security concerns, the U.S. economy remains a top destination for foreign direct investment, with the potential for increased investments as economic growth outpaces foreign economies."
