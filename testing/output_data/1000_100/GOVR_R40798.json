    "content": "The unemployment rate is defined as the percentage of persons in the civilian labor force age 16 and older who are unemployed. It is calculated by dividing the number of unemployed individuals by the total number of employed and unemployed individuals in the labor force. The rate can fluctuate based on changes in both the number of unemployed workers and the size of the labor force. During a recession, the size of the labor force may decrease as unemployed workers stop searching for jobs out of discouragement. Conversely, the number of labor force participants may increase if the economy shows signs of improvement. The unemployment rate is a lagging economic indicator, improving only after other indicators signal recovery. Firms are hesitant to hire until they are confident in sustained economic growth. The economy will continue growing, with employers likely to boost production by restoring hours and having employees work overtime before hiring new workers. Job growth may not happen immediately upon the economy showing signs of a turnaround. The Current Employment Statistics program is a reliable source for job data, querying nonfarm employers each month. The U.S. economy has experienced 10 recessions since World War II, with varying severity in GDP decline and duration. The unemployment rate typically continued to increase even after the recession ended, peaking at different points in different instances. The unemployment rate continued to rise after the end of 10 recessions since World War II, peaking at different times. Job growth did not occur steadily until some months after each recession ended. After the end of 10 recessions since World War II, job growth failed to ensue immediately. In most cases, the number of jobs fluctuated for months after the recession's end. Sustained job growth occurred within three to five months of seven recoveries, but in some instances, like after the 1990-1991 and 2001 recessions, steady job growth was delayed for over a year, leading to jobless recoveries. Since the recession's end, observers believe the nation is in another jobless recovery. Private sector employment has been increasing steadily since January 2010, but fiscal issues in local governments are slowing overall job growth."
