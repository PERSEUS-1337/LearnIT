    "content": "The Navy conducted training exercises off the coast of southern California using mid-frequency active sonar, which environmentalists claimed harmed whales. The Navy issued an environmental assessment stating minimal harm to marine mammals. Environmental groups sought relief, leading to a preliminary injunction granted by the district court. The district court modified the preliminary injunction to allow the Navy to use sonar with mitigation measures. The Ninth Circuit affirmed the modified injunction, finding a \"possibility\" of irreparable injury. The Supreme Court ruled that plaintiffs must show \"likely\" irreparable injury for an injunction. The Court reversed the decision and vacated the preliminary injunction, stating that the Navy's interest in effective training outweighed the potential harm to marine mammals. The Court did not address whether the Navy's actions violated environmental laws. The Court reversed a preliminary injunction challenging the Navy's training exercises, citing national security interests. The Ninth Circuit's \"mere possibility\" test for injunctions was rejected. The Forest Service Decision-making and Appeals Reform Act was invoked on June 4, 2003. The Forest Service implemented regulations under the ARA, excluding notice, comment, and appeals for projects covered by categorical exclusions. This led to a timber sale approval without appeal, which was later challenged in court. The Ninth Circuit invalidated the regulations in Earth Island Institute v. Ruthenbeck. The Ninth Circuit in Earth Island Institute v. Ruthenbeck, 490 F.3d 687 (9th Cir. 2007), found plaintiffs had standing due to injury in fact and ruled against Forest Service regulations conflicting with the ARA. The Supreme Court granted certiorari on the case. The Supreme Court is reviewing whether the Forest Service's regulations are subject to judicial review, if environmental groups have standing, if the challenges to the regulations are still relevant after a timber sale was withdrawn, and if the Ninth Circuit was correct in affirming a nationwide injunction. The case was argued in 2008 but a decision has not been made yet. The Supreme Court is considering the implications of a decision on program-wide reform challenges. A ruling against environmental groups could increase the burden on them by requiring multiple lawsuits. The case involves the withdrawal of billions of gallons of water from waterways by industrial operations for cooling, trapping aquatic organisms in the process. The Clean Water Act (CWA) section 316(b) addresses the issue of cooling water intake structures harming aquatic organisms. In 2004, EPA issued a rule for existing power plants, allowing cost-benefit analysis to determine the best technology available. However, in Riverkeeper Inc. v. United States, the Second Circuit invalidated the use of cost-benefit analysis, stating that facilities must adopt the best technology available without considering cost. The Supreme Court granted certiorari on April 14, 2008 to determine if CWA section 316(b) allows EPA to compare costs with benefits in selecting the best technology for minimizing adverse environmental impact at cooling water intake structures. The case was argued on December 2, 2008. The case argued on December 2, 2008, will test the Supreme Court's stance on cost-benefit analysis in environmental laws. There has been a shift towards greater acceptance of this analysis, which could benefit industries seeking to legitimize its use in the Clean Water Act and other pollution control statutes. Justice Breyer's views on government regulation are also under scrutiny. Justice Breyer, a former critic of government regulation for not considering costs, is involved in a case regarding the revival of a gold mine in Alaska's Tongass National Forest. The proposed wastewater disposal would harm aquatic life, leading to a debate on cost considerations in the Clean Water Act. In Southeast Alaska Conservation Council v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Ninth Circuit addressed conflicting CWA regulations regarding Coeur Alaska's gold mine discharge. The Corps issued a 404 permit, allowing fill material discharge, but EPA's new standard prohibits Coeur's ore processing discharge into U.S. waters. The Ninth Circuit addressed conflicting CWA regulations regarding Coeur Alaska's gold mine discharge. The court concluded that the CWA's plain language requires the Section 306 performance standard to apply through an NPDES permit, and that waste products subject to performance standards should not be regulated as fill material. The Supreme Court granted certiorari on June 27, 2008. The Supreme Court granted certiorari on June 27, 2008, to address the Ninth Circuit's decision on reallocating permitting authority from the Corps of Engineers to the EPA under CWA sections 404 and 402. The case was argued on Jan. 12, 2009. The unexpected grant of certiorari could have significant consequences if the Court allows the Corps to redefine \"fill material\" and remove discharges from the EPA's NPDES program. EPA and California sued to recover cleanup costs under CERCLA for toxic contamination at an agricultural chemical facility. The EPA and the state sued various parties under CERCLA for cleanup costs at a contaminated site, including a defunct facility operator, railroads, and Shell Oil Co. The district court found the railroads liable as owners and Shell liable as an \"arranger,\" assigning 9% of total cleanup costs to the railroads. In United States v. Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway Co., the Ninth Circuit found the railroads and Shell liable for cleanup costs, with the railroads responsible for 9% and Shell for 6%. The court determined that the harm could be apportioned, but neither party provided a reasonable basis for it. Shell was also found liable as an \"arranger\" for the contamination. The court found Shell liable as an \"arranger\" for contamination, with broader liability beyond direct disposal. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to review the Ninth Circuit's decision on apportionment of responsibility under CERCLA. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to review the Ninth Circuit's decision on liability for \"arranging\" disposal of hazardous substances under CERCLA, including joint and several liability for potentially responsible parties. This case raises significant Superfund Act issues that the Court has previously declined to address. The Supreme Court is reviewing a Superfund case involving liability for hazardous substance disposal under CERCLA. The case questions the reasonable basis for apportioning liability, which could impact the government's ability to recover cleanup costs. If a lax standard is adopted, it may affect court awards or settlements, potentially impacting the federal treasury. The Supreme Court is reviewing a Superfund case involving liability for hazardous substance disposal under CERCLA. If a lax standard is adopted, it may impact the government's ability to recover cleanup costs, potentially affecting the federal treasury. The cases accepted by the Supreme Court are important for their individual programs and may reveal the environmental direction to be taken. The Supreme Court is reviewing five environmental cases, with industry optimistic and the environmental community apprehensive. The appellate court decisions favored the environmental side, but the Supreme Court may rule differently, especially since four cases are from the Ninth Circuit known for high reversal rates. The outcome of these cases could impact environmental policies. The Supreme Court is currently reviewing five environmental cases, with industry hopeful and the environmental community concerned. The Court has historically ruled against environmental positions in NEPA decisions. The current Court is seen as less supportive of regulations and more sympathetic to business interests compared to previous decades. There are speculations that the increase in environmental cases this term may be due to random selection or conservative justices wanting to address these issues before potential changes in the Court. Eminent Supreme Court practitioners are also showing a growing interest in environmental matters. The Supreme Court practitioners are increasingly involved in environmental cases, increasing the chances of the Court accepting such cases. Despite this, the Court continues to reject difficult cases, including those related to the Endangered Species Act and the Clean Water Act. The reasons for nonacceptance are speculative, but most petitions for certiorari are turned down. The Supreme Court practitioners are increasingly involved in environmental cases, increasing the chances of the Court accepting such cases. Despite this, the overwhelming majority of petitions for certiorari are turned down. The reason for nonacceptance in the case of Rapanos is likely due to the same justices on the Court as in 2006 when the decision was made, leading to confusion in lower courts. If a post-Rapanos case were accepted now, a similar outcome is expected."
