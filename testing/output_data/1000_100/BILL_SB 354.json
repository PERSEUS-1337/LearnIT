    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 7522.02 of the Government Code is amended. Section 7522.02 of the Government Code applies to all state and local public retirement systems and participating employers, including various specific systems and individual retirement plans. The article is subject to the Internal Revenue Code and Section 17 of Article XVI of the California Constitution. Compliance with relevant provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and Revenue and Taxation Code is required for administration. The article exempts certain entities and public employees from its application, including those protected under federal law. Retirement plans approved before January 1, 2013, by excluded entities are not affected. The article exempts certain public employees from its application if the Secretary of Labor determines it conflicts with federal law. Additionally, a multiemployer plan established before January 1, 2013, regulated by ERISA, is also exempt. The benefit plan applies to new public employee members. Individuals employed by a public employer before January 1, 2013, and then by a subsequent public employer on or after January 1, 2013, will be subject to the retirement plan of the subsequent employer if they had concurrent membership or reciprocity within the previous six months. An individual employed before January 1, 2013, who changes positions without a break in employment and moves to a different public retirement system will be subject to the new defined benefit plan available to employees hired on or before December 31, 2012. If a public employer offers a defined benefit pension plan with a lower benefit factor before January 1, 2013, they can continue with that formula. If they adopt a new formula after January 1, 2013, it must meet certain requirements or be approved by the Legislature. New members can only participate in the new formula. New members of the defined benefit plan may only participate in the lower cost defined benefit formula that was in place before January 1, 2013, or a formula approved by the Legislature. If a public employer offers a retirement benefit plan consisting solely of a defined contribution plan before January 1, 2013, they can continue with that plan. However, if they adopt a new defined benefit pension plan after January 1, 2013, it must meet certain requirements or be approved by the Legislature. New members can only join the defined contribution plan in place before 2013 or a plan that meets the article's requirements. The subdivision does not prohibit an employer from offering a defined contribution plan on or after January 1, 2013, with or without a defined benefit plan, regardless of previous offerings. If the Cities of Brea and Fullerton form a joint powers authority after January 1, 2013, they may offer employees the same defined benefit plan they had before joining the authority. This applies to employees from the City of Brea, City of Fullerton, or other specified cities who are not new members and are hired by the joint powers authority within 180 days of the city joining. On or before January 1, 2017, a city in Orange County contiguous to Brea or Fullerton may join a joint powers authority, with a limit of three cities. New members joining after January 1, 2013, must adhere to defined benefit plan requirements. Judges' Retirement Systems are exempt from certain benefit and compensation limitations. On January 1, 2013, public retirement systems must modify their plans to comply with the article's requirements. Individual eligibility for membership in a public retirement system is not granted by this article."
