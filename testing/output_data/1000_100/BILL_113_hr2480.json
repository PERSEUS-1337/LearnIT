The Act titled \"Nurse and Health Care Worker Protection Act of 2013\" highlights the high number of musculoskeletal disorders among nurses and nursing assistants due to patient lifting and transferring, leading to chronic back pain and injuries that force many to leave the profession. The Act \"Nurse and Health Care Worker Protection Act of 2013\" emphasizes the impact of musculoskeletal disorders on nurses and health care workers, leading to chronic back pain and injuries that often result in leaving work. Patient handling technology has made manual lifting outdated, improving patient safety and reducing injuries. (5) Health care facilities implementing safe patient handling technology have seen a significant decrease in injuries among nursing staff and workers, leading to reduced lost work days and staff turnover. Assistive patient handling technology also lowers workers' compensation costs for musculoskeletal disorders.\n(6) Several States have adopted safe patient handling standards, showing success at both facility and State levels.\n(7) Establishing safe patient handling practices is crucial for improving patient safety and reducing injuries. Establishing a safe patient handling standard for healthcare workers is essential for protecting their health, addressing the nursing shortage, and increasing patient safety. The table of contents for this Act is provided. The Safe Patient Handling, Mobility, and Injury Prevention Standard is established under this Act for healthcare workers to protect their health and increase patient safety. The Secretary of Labor must create an interim final standard on safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention within 1 year of this Act, with a final standard to follow within 2 years. This standard aims to prevent musculoskeletal disorders for healthcare workers, including registered nurses, by implementing engineering and safety controls for patient handling. The interim final standard on safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention aims to prevent musculoskeletal disorders for healthcare workers, including registered nurses, by implementing controls and measures to minimize the risk of injury from manual patient handling. This includes the use of mechanical technology and devices where feasible, and alternative controls such as trained lift teams where not feasible. The employer must establish a safe patient handling program within 6 months, including hazard identification and control measures. Health care employers must purchase and provide safe patient handling equipment within 2 years. Input from health care workers, including registered nurses, is required. The health care employer must involve workers, including registered nurses, in developing and implementing a safe patient handling program. Data tracking and review of the program's implementation are required, including analyzing circumstances where safe patient handling equipment was not utilized according to standards. Each health care employer must provide findings and data from reviews to health care workers, their representatives, and federal agencies. Employers should consider incorporating safe patient handling technology into facility design and construction. Training on safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention policies is required initially and on an annual basis. Training for health care workers, including designated lift teams, must identify and control musculoskeletal hazards. It should be conducted by knowledgeable individuals in an interactive simulated format. Employers are required to post a notice explaining safe patient handling standards and rights. Annual evaluation is required for health care employers to assess the implementation of safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention programs, including procedures, technology, equipment, and injury assessment. Nurses and other healthcare workers must be involved in the evaluation process. The involvement of nurses, healthcare workers, and their representatives in the evaluation of safe patient handling programs is required. Health care employers must take corrective action based on the evaluation. Employees have the right to refuse unsafe assignments if they believe it may result in injury. The Secretary of Labor will conduct unscheduled inspections to ensure compliance with safe patient handling standards if healthcare workers are unable to resolve safety concerns with their employer. SEC. 3. APPLICATION OF SAFE PATIENT HANDLING, MOBILITY, AND INJURY PREVENTION STANDARD TO FACILITIES RECEIVING MEDICARE AND MEDICAID FUNDS. The Social Security Act is amended to include safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention standards for health care facilities receiving Medicare and Medicaid funds. The amendments will apply one year after the issuance date. The Social Security Act is amended to include safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention standards for health care facilities receiving Medicare and Medicaid funds, which will apply one year after the issuance date of the final standard. SEC. 4. NONPREEMPTION. This Act does not preempt any State laws unless they conflict with this Act. It also does not diminish the authority of States to enact laws that provide equal or greater protections for employees. Rights of health care workers under Federal or State laws are retained. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines key terms such as \"direct-care registered nurse,\" \"employee,\" \"employment,\" and \"handling\" in relation to healthcare workers and their responsibilities. The term \"health care worker\" refers to individuals assigned by a health care employer to engage in patient handling, including direct-care registered nurses and other health care workers in various healthcare facilities. A lift team consists of health care workers trained in safe patient handling and injury prevention practices."
