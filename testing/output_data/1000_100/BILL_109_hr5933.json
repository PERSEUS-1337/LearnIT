The conditions for provision of services by business facilitation visitors include the alien's employer paying all remuneration and expenses, and the alien being qualified for the services. The alien must be qualified to provide services, with expert knowledge and all necessary licenses, for the provision or receipt of management or technical training.

The alien seeking management training must have expert knowledge, necessary licenses, and at least 5 years of relevant experience. The period of authorized admission for business facilitation visitors providing professional services is 1 year, with a possible 6-month extension granted by the Secretary of Homeland Security. The Secretary may grant a single extension of up to 6 months for business facilitation visitors if there is an unforeseen delay in completing services and replacing the alien would further delay the contract fulfillment. The maximum duration for management or technical training for business facilitation visitors is 1 year. Business facilitation visitors are not eligible for a change of status or adjustment to immigrant status while in the US. The Secretary of Homeland Security can prohibit nationals from admission as business facilitation visitors if there is a pattern of fraud. A qualifying services contract is defined as a contract between a foreign provider of professional services and a United States entity, outlining the time period, duties, remuneration, and working conditions for the alien in the US. The qualifying services contract must ensure that the alien's compensation is comparable to similar providers, the alien has necessary credentials, and the foreign provider is responsible for the alien's compliance with US admission terms. The alien must return to their home country at the end of their admission to the United States."
