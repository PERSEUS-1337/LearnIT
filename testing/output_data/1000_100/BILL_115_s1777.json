    "content": "The \"Corporate Responsibility Fee Act of 2017\" imposes an excise tax on corporations with low-wage employees under a new chapter in the Internal Revenue Code. The \"Corporate Responsibility Fee Act of 2017\" imposes a tax on applicable employers with low-wage employees based on the aggregate amount of wages paid during the calendar year. The term \"applicable employer\" refers to any employer required to make tax deposits under specific chapters for more than 180 days in the preceding year. The \"Corporate Responsibility Fee Act of 2017\" imposes a tax on applicable employers with low-wage employees based on wages paid during the calendar year. The term \"applicable employer\" excludes governmental entities, churches, or qualified church organizations. Aggregation rules from section 414 apply, with a substitution of 'more than 50 percent' for 'more than 80 percent' in certain cases. A \"low-wage employee\" is defined as an employee receiving wages from an applicable employer during the calendar year. The \"Corporate Responsibility Fee Act of 2017\" imposes a tax on applicable employers with low-wage employees based on wages paid during the calendar year. Low-wage employees are individuals who receive wages from an applicable employer during the year, with specific calculations for employees employed for less than the entire year. The applicable percentage for determining the tax on low-wage employees is calculated based on specific criteria outlined in the Corporate Responsibility Fee Act of 2017. The applicable employee ratio determines the percentage for low-wage employees as follows: 25% or less = 25%, greater than 25% but not greater than 50% = 50%, greater than 50% but not greater than 75% = 75%, greater than 75% = 100%. The low-wage employee ratio is calculated as the percentage of low-wage employees to total employees. An applicable employer meeting certain requirements will have their applicable percentage reduced by 25 points. An applicable employer must offer full-time low-wage employees the opportunity to enroll in minimum essential coverage under an eligible employer-sponsored health plan that covers at least 60 percent of allowed costs. The employee's required contribution must not exceed a certain percentage of their annual wages and must meet retirement plan requirements for low-wage employees. The applicable percentage is determined by section 36B(c)(2)(B)(II) for the plan year. The applicable employer must meet certain requirements for low-wage employees to participate in eligible retirement plans, which include defined contribution plans with a minimum employer contribution of 5% of the employee's compensation or defined benefit plans. The defined benefit plan must provide an annual retirement benefit not less than 2% multiplied by the employee's years of service with the employer or 20%, multiplied by the employee's final average pay. The defined benefit plan must meet interest credit requirements and provide a pay credit of at least 5% of compensation for the plan year to be considered an eligible retirement plan. The defined benefit plan must meet interest credit requirements and provide a pay credit of at least 5% of compensation for the plan year to be considered an eligible retirement plan. The Secretary may prescribe regulations for an applicable employer to meet the requirements of this subsection through a combination of defined contribution plans or defined contribution plans. The defined benefit plan must meet interest credit requirements and provide a pay credit of at least 5% of compensation for the plan year to be considered an eligible retirement plan. Plans can be a combination of defined contribution or defined benefit plans. Certain employees may be excluded based on age and years of service. Employees eligible to participate in the defined benefit plan include those covered under a collective bargaining agreement or described in section 410(b)(3)(C). Definitions and special rules apply, with wages defined as per section 3121(a). Employees eligible for the defined benefit plan include those covered under a collective bargaining agreement or described in section 410(b)(3)(C). The tax imposed by subsection (a) will be allocated among different entities treated as a single employer under subsection (b)(1)(C). A conforming amendment is made to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The amendments made by Chapter 37--Corporate Responsibility Tax apply to calendar years beginning after the enactment of this Act."
