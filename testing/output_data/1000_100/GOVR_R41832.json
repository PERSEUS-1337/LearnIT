    "content": "Pakistan's stability and efforts to combat religious militancy are crucial to U.S. interests due to its involvement in various urgent policy areas such as terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and regional tensions with India. Despite initial cooperation in counterterrorism efforts, doubts about Islamabad's commitment to U.S. interests have deepened in recent years. Pakistan's stability is crucial to U.S. interests due to its involvement in counterterrorism efforts. The country's mixed record on battling Islamist extremism includes ongoing tolerance of Afghan insurgents and anti-India militants. Economic troubles, political instability, and security challenges pose serious obstacles for U.S. decision makers. Islamist radicalism has spread in Pakistan, with the border region near Afghanistan becoming a haven for insurgents and jihadists. The \"war on extremism\" has cost Pakistan thousands of lives and billions in financial losses. In 2011, Pakistan experienced over 26 terrorist attacks per week, ranking third after Afghanistan and Iraq. The revelation of Osama bin Laden's presence in Pakistan led to increased scrutiny from the U.S. government. Admiral Mike Mullen accused Pakistan of supporting Afghan insurgents attacking U.S. interests, straining bilateral relations. NATO troops in Afghanistan faced challenges in late November. In late November 2011, NATO troops in Afghanistan were attacked by Pakistani army outposts at Salala, resulting in 24 Pakistani soldiers dead. Poor coordination and miscommunication were blamed for the incident. Pakistan demanded a full apology from the United States for restored cooperation. The closure of Pakistani ground lines of communication (GLOCs) for NATO supplies into Afghanistan remains unresolved, overshadowing a NATO summit in May 2012. Pakistani negotiators are seeking a significant fee increase per truck, causing tension with senior U.S. officials. Additionally, a Pakistani doctor involved in a CIA operation received a 33-year prison sentence for treason, sparking confusion and anger among Americans. The American audience was perplexed and angered by a Pakistani doctor receiving a 33-year prison sentence for treason. In response, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved a provision to dock $1 million from U.S. aid funding each year of the sentence unless the doctor is freed. Bilateral relations between the two governments have remained strained, with anti-American sentiments prevalent among ordinary Pakistanis. Pakistan has replaced India as the least favored nation by Pakistanis, while Americans have increasingly negative views of Pakistan. The State Department warns of high travel risks in Pakistan, with American diplomats facing restrictions and civilians being abducted, including the execution of Daniel Pearl. Islamist extremism in Pakistan is a major concern for U.S. foreign policy, hindering progress on key goals such as defeating terrorist groups and resolving the Pakistan-India rivalry. Concerns about American citizens being recruited for Islamist terrorism by Pakistan-based elements have intensified. The United States faces challenges with Pakistan-based Islamist terrorism, with key figures like Al Qaeda chief Ayman al-Zawahiri believed to be in Pakistan. Increasing numbers in Congress question the effectiveness of current U.S. policy towards Pakistan, with calls to curtail foreign assistance. Legislation to limit aid and military reimbursements to Pakistan is being considered in Congress. Pakistan received $2 billion in direct aid from the US in FY2012, making it a top recipient of US foreign assistance. The closure of Pakistani GLOCs to Afghanistan did not have the expected logistical impact. By keeping the routes closed, Islamabad has strained relations with Washington. Pakistan risks diplomatic isolation and may need to work positively with the US and NATO to change course. The civilian government's negotiating strategy could lead to the loss of billions in aid. The civilian government's negotiating strategy in Pakistan could result in the loss of billions in foreign aid and influence in post-war Afghanistan. Despite complications in Pakistan's ties to terrorist groups, the US maintains a relationship with Pakistan. Continued engagement with Pakistan is seen as the only realistic option for the United States. The United States maintains engagement with Pakistan as the only realistic option, despite some advocating for a confrontational approach. The US has increased nonmilitary aid to improve Pakistani lives and conditions military aid on progress in combating militancy and promoting democracy. However, in 2011, the US suspended $800 million in security assistance and is rigorously evaluating Pakistan's cooperation before releasing further aid. Additionally, $1 billion in approved coalition support fund reimbursements remains undisbursed due to disagreements. Developments in 2011 have validated the view that Pakistani behavior is unlikely to change due to long-held geostrategic perspectives of decision makers in Islamabad and Rawalpindi. Pakistan's foreign policy behavior is influenced by the military's strategic interests, leading analysts to advocate for strong U.S. support for Pakistan's civilian authorities to reduce conflict. Ambassador Cameron Munter emphasizes the need for a strong civilian government for successful U.S.-Pakistan cooperation. Pakistan's civilian leaders have not shown willingness to address security policies and extremism, blaming the United States instead. Official Pakistani support for Islamist militancy continues, with President Obama not visiting Pakistan during his term. President Obama's decision to visit India in 2010 without stopping in Pakistan heightened concerns among Pakistani officials about a perceived \"pro-India\" stance in Washington. The Administration's policies towards India, including refraining from involvement in the Kashmir dispute and supporting U.S.-India civil nuclear cooperation without a similar offer to Pakistan, are viewed with suspicion and even as a threat by Pakistani leaders and citizens. Additionally, Afghanistan's closer ties with India and subsequent U.S.-Afghanistan partnership are seen as evidence of Pakistan being strategically encircled by external forces. Pakistan is under threat of strategic encirclement by external forces, leading to a shift towards a more narrow, issue-based engagement with the US in 2012 and beyond. The country seeks a formal, business-like relationship with agreed-upon limits, moving away from the broad strategic partnership envisioned in the past. The FY2013 congressional legislation suggests new restrictions on U.S. foreign assistance to Pakistan, leading to a more focused, issues-based engagement. Ambassador Sherry Rehman outlined Islamabad's prerequisites for resetting the bilateral relationship, including apologizing for the Salala incident and halting drone strikes. The outlook for a \"strategic bond\" between the U.S. and Pakistan is poor, according to former diplomats. They suggest forging a more normal relationship by reducing mutual expectations, targeting economic aid better, fostering business ties, and supporting initiatives for regional stability. Optimism is found in the Pakistani military's reduced influence and improvements in Pakistan-India relations. The Obama Administration is advised to consider the positive trends in Pakistan, including reduced military influence and better Pakistan-India relations. Some U.S. analysts criticize Pakistan's stance on GLOCs and the Salala incident, warning it could harm cooperation with the U.S. One commentator calls Pakistan's position a \"catastrophic mistake\" driven by short-term thinking. Some analysts suggest a shift to a more adversarial posture towards Pakistan, advocating for \"focused hostility\" and considering Pakistan an enemy of the United States in terms of Afghanistan policy. Threats to end assistance and retaliate are proposed if Pakistan fails to comply. Some analysts propose a more adversarial approach towards Pakistan, advocating for threats to end assistance and retaliate if Pakistan fails to comply with U.S. demands. However, others argue that a shift to a \"two Pakistans\" approach would be counterproductive and could strengthen conservative Islamist elements in the country. Instead, they suggest a more passive approach focused on providing security assurances and bolstering Pakistan's civilian governance institutions. The Pakistani military's stance on relations with India and Afghanistan is uncertain, with potential consequences for Pakistan's geostrategic status. Analysts suggest prioritizing energy and trade cooperation with neighbors over conflict with India and involvement in Afghanistan for long-term security. Pakistan's security services and domestic public hinder a more robust pursuit of policies by civilian leaders. Governor Salman Taseer's assassination in 2011 highlighted the challenges faced by liberal politicians in the country. His killer, Malik Mumtaz Qadri, was praised by sections of Pakistani society, including leaders of the Barelvi Muslim sect. The assassination of Governor Salman Taseer in 2011 and Minorities Minister Shabaz Bhatti in March 2011 were major blows to liberal forces in Pakistan. Both leaders were vocal supporters of reforming blasphemy laws and promoting tolerance towards religious minorities. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton condemned the killings, emphasizing the values of tolerance and respect for all faiths championed by Pakistan's founding father, Mohammed Ali Jinnah. President Zardari addressed the assassinations in an op-ed, highlighting the challenges faced by liberal politicians in the country. The Taseer and Bhatti assassinations in Pakistan highlighted the increasing Islamist radicalism in the country. In January 2011, Raymond Davis, an American working at the U.S. Consulate in Lahore, shot and killed two men, claiming self-defense during a robbery attempt. Despite U.S. officials asserting diplomatic immunity, Pakistani authorities accused Davis of murder. President Obama referred to Davis as \"our diplomat,\" but it was later revealed that he was a CIA operative. In February 2011, Raymond Davis, a CIA contractor tracking militant groups in Pakistan, was involved in a shooting incident. The U.S. government admitted his CIA affiliation after weeks of controversy. Senator Kerry visited Islamabad to ease tensions, expressing regret for the loss of life. The CIA negotiated with the ISI for Davis's release, which was eventually secured in March 2011 after a payment of $2.3 million in \"blood money\" to the victims' families. After paying \"blood money\" to the victims' families, Raymond Davis was released and left the country. Following this, Osama bin Laden was found and killed in Abbottabad, Pakistan, raising doubts about Pakistan's commitment to fighting extremism and leading to calls to reduce U.S. aid. President Obama's chief counterterrorism advisor, John Brennan, stated that it was likely Osama bin Laden had a support system in Pakistan, leading to doubts about the country's military and intelligence services. Pakistan's credibility suffered as it was believed that officials were complicit in hiding the fugitive or were incompetent in their search for top Al Qaeda leaders. The military and intelligence services faced criticism for failing to detect a foreign military raid and for their alleged incompetence in detecting extremist figures in the country. The U.S. raid on Pakistani territory led to strong condemnation from Army Chief Gen. Kayani and Parliament, sparking anti-American demonstrations and threats to close vital supply lines for NATO troops in Afghanistan. Bilateral distrust and acrimony increased, with Congress questioning continued engagement due to suspicions of Pakistan's knowledge of Osama bin Laden's whereabouts. Calls for greater oversight and accountability for future U.S. assistance were made. Calls for greater oversight and accountability for future U.S. assistance to Pakistan were made following the U.S. raid on Pakistani territory, which led to increased bilateral distrust and acrimony. Despite reasons for discouragement, the United States has continued to engage with Pakistan, with some officials divided over the future of the relationship. President Obama and top U.S. officials maintained a positive posture towards Pakistan, but serious questions arose over Osama bin Laden's refuge in the country. On May 22, 2011, heavily armed militants attacked Pakistan's naval base near Karachi, killing security personnel and destroying U.S.-supplied aircraft. The Pakistani Taliban claimed it was in retaliation for the killing of bin Laden, causing embarrassment and questions about military security. The attack on Pakistan's naval base near Karachi in May 2011 raised concerns about the security of the country's nuclear weapons. Suspicions of inside help led to arrests, including a former navy commando. Three navy officers, including the base commander, are facing court-martial for negligence. The Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency is accused of ordering the torture and murder of journalist Syed Saleem Shahzad. Syed Saleem Shahzad disappeared in May 2011 after writing an article linking the Mehran attack to Al Qaeda cells within the Pakistan Navy. He had received threats from the ISI, and a closed government inquiry began in June. U.S. officials later claimed that senior ISI officials directed Shahzad's attack to silence critics. Admiral Mike Mullen stated that Shahzad's killing was sanctioned by the Pakistani government. An official Commission of Inquiry in January 2012 was unable to identify the culprits. The Commission of Inquiry could not identify the culprits behind Shahzad's murder. The Obama Administration suspended $440-$500 million in aid to Pakistan due to reduced military presence and delays in agreements. The Obama Administration suspended $300 million in planned FY2011 Coalition Support Fund reimbursements to Pakistan due to delays in visa processing. This move was seen as a warning to Islamabad about the potential closure of key assistance spigots. Pakistani military officials downplayed the impact, suggesting reprogramming U.S. security assistance towards development projects. However, some observers believed the decision would lead to greater resentment and validation of anti-U.S. sentiments among ordinary Pakistanis. In October 2011, a Pakistani-American businessman revealed a memo allegedly dictating U.S. assistance to prevent a military coup in Pakistan. This scandal, known as \"Memogate,\" led to the resignation of the Pakistani Ambassador to the U.S. and put pressure on the President. The \"Memogate\" scandal in Pakistan led to the resignation of Ambassador Haqqani and pressure on President Zardari. Despite denials of involvement, the investigation lacked evidence of wrongdoing by civilians. Concerns arose about potential military overthrow, with army officials claiming the memo was genuine. Prime Minister Gilani warned against conspiracies to destabilize the government. The military in Pakistan is urged to be accountable to parliament and not act as a separate entity. Despite rumors of a coup, the army publicly pledged support for democracy. The civilian government was upset with the army and intelligence chiefs for bypassing them in engaging the court. However, the likelihood of a military coup is low due to public aversion and lack of support from opposition politicians. In January, Parliament reaffirmed its supremacy and urged the army and Supreme Court to stay within constitutional limits. Gilani toned down criticism of the military, diffusing the crisis. In November 2011, U.S. forces near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border were fired upon by hilltop positions inside Pakistan, leading to a military response. In November 2011, a gunship, two F-15 jets, and two AH-64 Apache helicopters were ordered to neutralize hilltop positions in Pakistan. Pakistani soldiers were killed during the air assault, leading to accusations of intentional killings by NATO forces. Prime Minister Gilani condemned the attacks as a breach of sovereignty and violation of international law, leading to the closure of NATO's ground logistics routes through Pakistan and eviction of U.S. personnel from Shamsi airfield. Pakistani anger resulted in a boycott of a conference on Afghanistan and the supply routes remaining closed for over five months. The Pakistani government demands a formal apology from the U.S. for the air assault that led to the closure of NATO's ground logistics routes through Pakistan. The Pentagon's investigation concluded that U.S. forces acted in self-defense, with no intentional targeting of Pakistanis, but acknowledged serious miscommunication and poor coordination. Pakistan's military criticized the partial blame placed on them as unjustified. The Pakistani government criticized the partial blame placed on them for the air assault, calling it unjustified and unacceptable. A document released in January 2012 detailed the Pakistani perspective, acknowledging that Pakistani forces fired first in self-defense. It criticized NATO investigators for claiming no Pakistani posts were in the area and blamed the incident on the failure of US/ISAF to share information with Pakistan. The Obama Administration considered issuing an apology for the incident, with advocates believing it would help mend relations, while opponents argued against it. The Obama Administration considered issuing an apology for a reopening of the GLOCs and a mending of relations with Pakistan. Pentagon figures believed an apology would be seen as admitting fault. Secretary Clinton planned to apologize in February, but it was canceled after Koran burning incident. U.S.-Pakistan relations were strained further in 2012 due to a hearing on Baluchistan. The hearing on Baluchistan in 2012 sparked congressional attention to the issue, leading to the introduction of H.Con.Res. 104 expressing support for Baluchistan's right to self-determination. This angered the Islamabad government and caused a backlash in the Pakistani media. The Obama Administration distanced itself from the resolution, stating it had no policy supporting Baluchistan's independence. The Salala incident prompted the Islamabad government to freeze relations with the United States for a review by Parliament. The review process, completed in April 2012, resulted in the issuance of 14-point guidelines for revised terms of engagement with the U.S., including demands to cease drone attacks and infiltration into Pakistani territory. The 14-point guidelines issued after the Salala incident include demands to stop infiltration into Pakistani territory, transportation of arms to Afghanistan, seek an apology from the U.S., bring those responsible to justice, and prohibit foreign bases on Pakistani soil. The Obama Administration has expressed respect for Pakistani sovereignty despite ongoing drone strikes. U.S. Special Representative Marc Grossman visited Islamabad for talks following the Salala incident, but hopes for a reset in the bilateral relationship were not met. Pakistan requested a civil nuclear deal similar to India's in 2005. Pakistan's hopes for a reset in the bilateral relationship with the U.S. were dashed as Grossman departed without any breakthrough. The major point of contention remains Pakistan's demands for a cessation of drone strikes, including \"signature strikes\" that target suspected militants based on surveillance. Pakistani leaders may refuse to open NATO's ground supply lines until drone strikes are ended, with the main sticking point being Pakistan's demand for an unconditional apology for the inadvertent deaths of Pakistani soldiers at Salala. At the time of writing, major issues between the U.S. and Pakistan remain unresolved, with the U.S. withholding $1 billion in military reimbursements. Pakistan insists on following Parliament's recommendations. Pakistan boycotted a NATO conference in 2011 but President Zardari was invited to a NATO summit in Chicago. President Zardari attended a NATO summit in Chicago amidst U.S.-Pakistan tensions and the unresolved GLOCs issue. President Obama's refusal to meet with Zardari and lack of apology for Salala led to criticism in Pakistan, with some calling it an embarrassment. Foreign Minister Khar defended Pakistan's participation, while Urdu-language editorials praised Zardari for standing up to international pressure. On May 23, 2012, a tribal court in northwestern Pakistan convicted Shakil Afridi of treason and sentenced him to 33 years in prison for working with the CIA to collect DNA samples from Osama bin Laden's compound. The sentence sparked outrage in the United States, with officials calling it \"shocking and outrageous.\" The Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee criticized the punishment of Shakil Afridi for helping the US in capturing Osama bin Laden, stating it will strain the US-Pakistan relationship. Islamabad defends the legal process but there are concerns about the conviction, including lack of legal representation and unclear appeal rights. The Administration's assessment in March 2011 showed little progress in achieving key objectives in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The US reported limited progress in combating Al Qaeda in Pakistan during the latter half of 2010. Despite improved cooperation in counterinsurgency efforts, there was no effective execution of the COIN cycle in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas. The lack of 'hold' and 'build' planning hinders the path to defeating the insurgency in Pakistan. The certification for releasing security-related FY2011 aid to Pakistan under the Enhanced Partnership With Pakistan Act of 2009 included confirmation of Islamabad's efforts in combating terrorist groups and ceasing support to extremists. However, skepticism arose due to concerns about Pakistan's actions against the Haqqani Network and the certification's political motivations. The Secretary explained the certification for FY2011 aid to Pakistan, stating that Pakistan met the legal threshold. However, there was no similar certification for FY2012. The Administration's assessment showed little positive news, with indicators for civilian control and COIN capabilities remaining static or declining. The Pentagon's recent report to Congress highlighted continued negative trends in bilateral security cooperation with Pakistan, attributing it to decreased international assistance. The report noted limited progress in funding for stabilization efforts in Pakistan and highlighted the ongoing threat posed by the Taliban insurgency operating from sanctuaries in Pakistan. The Pentagon's report to Congress highlighted security challenges in Afghanistan, with concerns about Pakistan's role in supporting insurgent activities. Pakistan's actions, including selective counterinsurgency operations and provision of safe havens, were seen as undermining security in Afghanistan. U.S. leaders believe Pakistan's desire for a Pashtun-led Afghan government with limited Indian influence drives its support for insurgent sanctuaries. Relations between the U.S. and Pakistan have been strained by these issues. U.S.-Pakistan relations have been strained by issues such as freedom of travel for U.S. diplomats in Pakistan and the revelation of U.S. citizens working for the ISI. President Obama has not visited Pakistan since taking office, and formal sessions of the bilateral Strategic Dialogue have not occurred since October 2010. Despite this, high-level interactions, especially among military and intelligence officials, have continued. In late 2011/early 2012, the Obama Administration sent a high-level delegation to Islamabad led by Secretary Clinton to address the issue of militant safe havens in western Pakistan. The U.S.-Pakistan Strategic Dialogue has been postponed indefinitely, but engagement has continued at other levels, with Secretary Clinton meeting with Foreign Minister Khar in February 2012. In February 2012, Secretary Clinton met with Foreign Minister Khar in London, conveying U.S. respect for Parliament's right to review bilateral relations. She expressed eagerness to resume crucial areas like counterterrorism and Afghanistan. Khar mentioned dealing with upcoming Senate elections before addressing Parliament's recommendations. Amb. Grossman later met with President Zardari in Tajikistan, emphasizing the U.S. commitment to a constructive relationship with Pakistan. President Obama also reaffirmed the desire for cooperation with Prime Minister Gilani at a nuclear security summit in Seoul. In March and April 2012, U.S. officials continued discussions with Pakistani counterparts on important shared interests, including counterterrorism and Afghanistan. Meetings between senior military commanders and diplomats aimed to address border coordination issues and build upon previous conversations. Deputy Secretary of State Thomas Nides expressed optimism for achieving a balanced approach that respects Pakistan's sovereignty while addressing U.S. concerns. In April, USAID Administrator Rajiv Shah visited Pakistan to strengthen ties through civilian assistance. Amb. Grossman and Foreign Secretary Jilani discussed reopening GLOCs and drone strikes, with no breakthroughs. Washington's refusal to apologize for the Salala incident led to a stalemate. The U.S.-Pakistan-Afghanistan Tripartite Commission met in Rawalpindi for the 35th time in mid-May. Missile strikes in Pakistan by American UAVs have been controversial but effective against militants. President Obama personally approves the targeting \"kill list.\" Drone strikes have taken a toll on Al Qaeda but are criticized for killing civilians. The Pakistani government condemns drone strikes as a violation of sovereignty and international law, but there is debate within the country about their necessity and effectiveness. Islamabad has been accused of tacitly allowing the strikes and providing intelligence for them. The drone campaign in Pakistan has been effective against Al Qaeda and its allies, with strikes following key events like the release of Raymond Davis and the suspension of U.S. military aid. There are differing opinions within the Administration on the wisdom of continuing UAV strikes, with some urging for a reduction in pace to avoid aggravating the situation further. The CIA drone program in Pakistan has raised concerns about destabilizing the country, leading to changes in strike decisions and notification to Pakistani officials. The program has reportedly reduced \"signature strikes\" on suspected militants. The White House review reaffirmed support for the program, with claims of no collateral deaths due to precision capabilities. President Obama publicly defended the program three years into his term. President Obama acknowledged and defended the CIA drone program in Pakistan, claiming it had not caused many civilian casualties. However, independent analysts dispute this, estimating 145-535 civilian deaths, including children. Despite killing militants and commanders, violence in western Pakistan has not subsided. With a NATO troop drawdown in Afghanistan, the U.S. may have no better option than to continue the tactic. U.S. links with Pakistan's ISI date back to the 1980s. The ISI, Pakistan's intelligence agency, has a history of training Afghan fighters and using militant proxies for its perceived interests. The agency is also involved in extralegal activities and manipulation of domestic politics. Lt. Gen. Zaheer-ul-Islam, the current Director-General, is seen as a potential candidate for the Chief of Army Staff position. Lt. Gen. Zaheer-ul-Islam, the current Director-General of the ISI, is considered a potential candidate for the COAS position after Kayani's retirement in 2012. U.S. officials have accused the ISI of supporting Afghan insurgents with money, supplies, and planning guidance, leading to ongoing concerns about sanctuaries in Pakistan aiding the insurgency. Reports suggest increased ISI support for the Taliban, including supplying them with explosives manufactured in Pakistan. A leaked NATO report indicates that Afghan insurgents still receive direct support from the ISI. The ISI continues to support Afghan insurgents, manipulating Taliban leadership and advising on strategy. Pakistan's foreign minister dismisses the report as old news. The ISI is also linked to anti-India terrorist groups, including the Lashkar-e-Taiba responsible for the 2008 Mumbai attack. Secretary of State Clinton has expressed concerns about Pakistani government's ambivalence towards cracking down on terrorism. Pakistan's security services are suspected of being infiltrated by Islamist extremists, with some military officers allegedly receiving anti-U.S. training. The security services are seen as divided between a nationalist group led by Gen. Kayani and a leaderless group driven by a revisionist Islamist ideology. This division reflects Pakistan's fractured national identity between nationalism and Islamism. The Raymond Davis episode strained CIA-ISI relations due to suspicions of ISI backing militant groups. The ISI demanded accountability for all CIA operatives in Pakistan after Davis was revealed as a contractor. OBL's death raised concerns about ISI links to extremism, leading Pakistan to crack down on citizens working with the CIA. Pressure increased for American investigators to access bin Laden-related information. Pressure increased for American investigators to access bin Laden's widows in Pakistani custody, which was subsequently granted. A Pakistani newspaper linked to the military and intelligence services revealed the name of the CIA's Islamabad station chief, the second time in six months. U.S. officials believed these disclosures were deliberate to show ISI's leverage and express anger at U.S. policies. The ISI leadership faced more frequent confrontations with U.S. evidence of collusion with Afghan insurgents, including instances where the CIA informed Islamabad about bomb-making facilities in FATA. The Pakistani military denied accusations of tipping off militants at bomb-making facilities in FATA, citing incorrect intelligence. Despite interagency discord, joint intelligence work led to the arrest of a senior Al Qaeda operative in Karachi with U.S. assistance. Pakistan's efforts to improve relations with the U.S. included capturing key Al Qaeda courier Mohammed Ali Qasim Yaqub and granting visas to CIA officers. Drone strikes in 2011 killed top Al Qaeda leaders, including Ilyas Kashmiri and Atiyah Abd al-Rahman. Pakistan also arrested senior Al Qaeda operatives with CIA assistance near Quetta. Bilateral intelligence cooperation targeted Al Qaeda and militants in the FATA region. The CIA has maintained bilateral intelligence cooperation with Pakistan, focusing on Al Qaeda and the \"Pakistani Taliban\" despite strained government relations. There are reports of a significant effort by the CIA to establish a network of trusted individuals within Pakistan. Pakistani leaders have historically sought strategic depth through friendly relations with Afghanistan, supporting mujahideen fighters in the past. The British colonialists divided Pashtun tribes with the Durand Line in 1893. The border dispute between Pakistan and Afghanistan hinders US interests in combating Islamic militancy. Pakistan aims for a post-NATO Afghanistan that is aligned with Islamabad's interests. The U.S.-led coalition aims for an independent Afghanistan, while Pakistan seeks to maintain influence through proxies like the Quetta Shura and Haqqani Network. Washington relies on Islamabad for support in Afghan reconciliation talks, despite tensions in their approaches. Pakistani officials are confused by U.S. goals for Afghanistan and pressure to use force against militants in North Waziristan. Some believe Washington risks rewarding Pakistani intransigence by involving them in peace talks with insurgent groups they have supported. U.S. officials stress the need for Pakistani cooperation for long-term stability in Afghanistan, despite troubled relations with Kabul. The relationship between Islamabad and Kabul is strained, with Afghan insurgents finding safe havens in Pakistani cities like Quetta and Karachi. US military commanders see these havens as major obstacles to stabilizing Afghanistan. Declassified documents show that the Taliban's resurgence in the mid-2000s was linked to sanctuaries in Pakistan. Despite some improvement in Pakistan-Afghanistan ties, Afghan officials still accuse Pakistan of supporting terrorism in Afghanistan. Afghan wariness of Pakistani influence remains strong. Analysts are skeptical of Islamabad's use of Pashtun jihadi proxies for its own interests. The Pakistani military uses Pashtun jihadi proxies to advance its interests in Afghanistan. Islamabad is concerned about the potential abandonment of the region by the international community, as seen in the 1990s. President Obama's 2011 announcement of a military drawdown signaled a focus on an exit strategy, raising doubts about long-term U.S. commitment to stabilizing the region. Pakistani leaders emphasize the importance of Afghan stability and have engaged in efforts to enhance cooperation with Afghanistan. In 2011, the Afghanistan-Pakistan Joint Commission was upgraded to accelerate the peace process. Reports indicated that Gilani aimed to shift Kabul's allegiance from the US to Pakistan and China. The Joint Commission met in June 2011, with Gilani and President Karzai committing to an \"Afghan-led and Afghan-owned\" process. Friction arose between Islamabad and Kabul due to increased \"reverse infiltration\" incidents. Friction escalated between Islamabad and Kabul in 2011, with cross-border attacks and accusations. Afghan officials claimed Pakistan fired rockets into Afghan provinces, leading to civilian casualties. Tensions peaked with the assassination of Afghan High Peace Council chairman Rabbani, hindering reconciliation efforts. The assassination of Afghan High Peace Council chairman Rabbani in 2011 dealt a major blow to reconciliation talks. Afghan officials suspect ISI involvement, criticizing Islamabad for lack of cooperation in the investigation. Pakistani officials deny involvement, but Afghan president accuses Pakistan of supporting terrorism. Afghan intelligence claims to have thwarted a plot to assassinate Karzai, with culprits linked to Al Qaeda and Haqqanis in FATA. Islamabad supports peace talks with Afghan Taliban, emphasizing Kabul's role in setting parameters. Pakistan sees itself as crucial to successful Afghan peace talks. Pakistan's leaders are motivated by a desire to deny India influence in post-conflict Afghanistan, seeking control over Taliban negotiators. In 2010, Mullah Baradar was captured, possibly orchestrated by Pakistani elements to facilitate talks with Taliban commanders. Pakistan launched efforts to broker reconciliation between Kabul and the Haqqani Network, sparking concerns of exploiting the political situation for a settlement. Pakistan's leaders aim to deny India influence in post-conflict Afghanistan by seeking control over Taliban negotiators. In 2010, Mullah Baradar's capture may have been orchestrated by Pakistani elements to facilitate talks with Taliban commanders. Efforts were made to broker reconciliation between Kabul and the Haqqani Network, raising concerns about exploiting the political situation for a settlement. In 2011, there were indications of Islamabad's influence over Afghan insurgents, with reports of secret meetings facilitated by NATO and hesitance from Pakistan to allow Taliban leaders to travel to Kabul for reconciliation talks. President Karzai has expressed concerns about insurgent leaders in Pakistan not being independent enough to negotiate. In early 2012, the Islamabad government seemed to be allowing U.S.-Taliban talks. Despite Karzai's request for Pakistani influence, Foreign Minister Khar called it unrealistic. However, Prime Minister Gilani later urged Taliban leaders to participate in Afghan reconciliation efforts. The Obama Administration welcomed this, but there are ongoing concerns about Pakistan's ties to Afghan insurgent groups. The Haqqani Network, based in the FATA region, is seen as the most dangerous Afghan insurgent group by many observers. They are closely linked to al-Qaeda and pose a strategic threat to Afghan stability and U.S. national security interests. Experts believe they are not reconcilable and must be addressed through sustained action. The Haqqani Network, based in the FATA region, is considered the most dangerous Afghan insurgent group closely linked to al-Qaeda. Islamabad officials have been hesitant to launch operations against them in North Waziristan, citing stretched military forces. The Haqqanis have carried out high-profile attacks in Afghanistan, including the 2011 assault on Kabul's Intercontinental Hotel and a truck bomb attack in September. This inaction is believed to stem from Pakistan's long-standing relationship with Jalaluddin Haqqani and a desire to exert influence in post-ISAF Afghanistan. In September 2011, a well-planned attack on the U.S. Embassy compound in Kabul by gunmen and suicide bombers left 16 Afghans dead, including 5 police officers and 6 children. This assault significantly impacted U.S.-Pakistan relations and raised concerns about the security situation in Afghanistan. Following the attack, Admiral Mullen urged General Kayani to take action against Haqqani bases, but the response was deemed unsatisfactory. Mullen escalated pressure on Pakistan, accusing ISI of supporting Haqqani network for attacks in Afghanistan. Panetta issued a warning to Pakistan to protect US forces. Mullen stated Haqqani network acts as an arm of ISI, with evidence linking them to attacks on US embassy and truck bombings. The US accused Pakistan of supporting the Haqqani network for attacks in Afghanistan, including the assault on the embassy and the Intercontinental Hotel. Secretary Panetta urged putting pressure on Pakistan to address the issue. President Obama expressed uncertainty about the ISI-Haqqani relationship but emphasized the need for Pakistan to resolve the problem. The Wardak truck bombing was a turning point for Secretary Clinton's attitude towards the Haqqanis. Pakistan denies responsibility for attacks in Afghanistan and rejects supporting the Haqqanis. The US accusations have strained the bilateral relationship, with President Zardari warning against verbal assaults on Pakistan. Pakistani officials have been trying to facilitate negotiations between the Haqqanis and the Kabul government, but Haqqani links with Al Qaeda have been a major obstacle. Pakistan, with its influence over the Haqqanis, is seen as the only actor capable of pushing them towards talks. Some Pakistani military officials claim they can bring the Haqqanis to the negotiating table to avoid a military conflict that Pakistan may not win. By engaging in negotiations, Islamabad would secure a central role in the process. The Obama Administration is considering designating the Haqqani Network as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) under U.S. law, despite potential negotiations with the Haqqani leadership for sustainable peace. Senator Carl Levin and Senator Dianne Feinstein are among those pressuring for the FTO designation. Seven Haqqani leaders are already under U.S. sanctions, and Secretary Clinton designated Badruddin Haqqani in 2011. The Obama Administration is considering designating the Haqqani Network as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) under U.S. law, despite potential negotiations for sustainable peace. Congressional frustration has increased over the delayed formal review on the FTO designation. Ammonium nitrate (AN) is a widely used fertilizer and explosives precursor in Afghanistan, with most IEDs using AN arriving from Pakistan since the Kabul government's ban in 2010. The summer of 2011 saw a peak in IED events in Afghanistan, but improved detection and clearing capabilities have led to a decline in effective IED attack rates. Legislation required a report on countering IED networks in Pakistan and Afghanistan, with efforts focused on urging Islamabad to restrict access to explosives. Efforts to combat illicit cross-border trafficking of chemical explosives precursors in Afghanistan involve diplomatic, law enforcement, and science and technology initiatives. Operation Global Shield, a multilateral law enforcement operation, has been successful in monitoring the movements of these precursors. Adding urea fertilizer granules to Ammonium Nitrate (AN) can complicate the process of making explosives, as recommended by experts. The largest fertilizer complex in Pakistan, Pakarab Fertilizers Ltd., produces over 300,000 metric tons of Ammonium Nitrate annually since 2004. Legislation in Islamabad aims to restrict Ammonium Nitrate and other precursors, but changes are unlikely in the near term. The government has established a National Counter-IED Forum for agencies to collaborate on an action plan. The United States relies on Pakistani agencies for logistics routes to supply forces in Afghanistan. These routes have been closed for six months due to Pakistan's anger over incidents. Insurgents have targeted these supply lines, especially near the Khyber Pass. The Khyber Pass route from Peshawar to Jalalabad and Karachi to Kandahar via Quetta and Chaman border faced attacks, leading to destruction of trucks and deaths of Pakistani drivers. Truck drivers often pay bribes to reach the Afghan border from Karachi. The US military started using alternative routes like the Northern Distribution Network (NDN) from Central Asia and Russia to reduce reliance on Pakistan for supplying NATO forces in Afghanistan with nonlethal cargo. The US military has expanded aerial and NDN routes as alternatives to the Pakistani GLOCs, despite the higher cost and reliance on authoritarian regimes in Central Asia. The loss of Pakistani GLOCs has not had as much impact on Afghan operations as expected, with British and US officials stating they are managing well without them. However, the continued closure of the GLOCs is seen as a strategic concern that has hampered Afghan security forces by causing backlogs of equipment. The closure of Pakistani GLOCs has caused backlogs of equipment for Afghan security forces, with over 4,100 vehicles stranded in Pakistan. NATO needs to remove 100,000 shipping containers and 70,000 vehicles worth $30 billion. U.S. commanders pushed for the reopening of Pakistani GLOCs in early 2012, with agreements made in mid-March and finalization in mid-April. By mid-May, senior Pakistani officials indicated that reopening was imminent. Foreign Minister Khar stated that Pakistan has made its point regarding the fee for NATO supply trucks. Initially seeking $1,500-1,800 per truck, Pakistani negotiators later proposed $5,000 per truck, a 20-fold increase. This drastic price hike was deemed unacceptable by the Senate Armed Services Committee, with one member calling it \"extortion.\" Negotiations on the issue remain unresolved. Islamist extremism and militancy continue to pose a threat to Pakistani society. Islamist extremism and militancy have been a significant threat to Pakistani society since 2007, with a peak in attacks and victims in 2009. Pakistan also faces a separatist insurgency in Baluchistan and politically motivated violence in Karachi. Despite a decline in terrorist incidents since 2009, Pakistan still ranks third in the world for both attacks and deaths, after Afghanistan and Iraq. Suicide bombings have increased in Pakistan, with 84 recorded in 2009, dropping to 41 in 2011. In recent years, Pakistan has seen a decline in Islamist attacks due to military operations and drone strikes. However, concerns remain about the presence of Al Qaeda terrorists operating in the country. Islamist militant groups in Pakistan have become more intertwined and supportive of each other since 2009. The Al Qaeda terrorists operate in Pakistan, despite recent losses in leadership. The Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) emerged in 2007, with representatives from tribal agencies and settled districts. The Quetta Shura Taliban and Haqqani Network are also active in the region. Punjab province houses militant groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), posing a threat to U.S. national security. The LeT is seen as a growing threat to U.S. national security, with analysts identifying it as the most dangerous terrorist group in South Asia. The group's charity wing, JuD, has a strong presence in Pakistan. Pakistan's Ambassador to the U.S. criticizes the country's focus on sovereignty violations over combating jihadist ideology. The Pakistan army has deployed 150,000 troops in response to militancy in western Pakistan, with over 3,000 soldiers killed in combat. Conflict has affected all seven FATA agencies and adjacent regions, with notable offensives in Swat Valley and South Waziristan in 2009. U.S. government assessments paint a discouraging picture of recent efforts. The Pakistani military's operations in Swat and FATA from 2009 to 2011 have had mixed results, with some successes in dislodging militants but limited progress in sustained counterinsurgency. The air force has conducted numerous combat sorties and bombings in the FATA, with ongoing fighting in Kurram and Khyber agencies. The Pakistani military has been successful in degrading the capabilities of TTP-allied Lashkar-i-Islam in Khyber agency, driving civilians from their homes. However, a simmering insurgency still affects most FATA agencies, with sporadic offensives in Kurram and Khyber. TTP militants overran a Frontier Constabulary fort in South Waziristan, while Bajaur suffered a major militant attack. North Waziristan agency is home to Al Qaeda- and Taliban-allied groups, including the Haqqani Network and TTP forces. The Haqqani Network and TTP forces in North Waziristan are key havens for militants. Pakistani officials have been hesitant to move their military into the area, citing the need to consolidate control. Pakistan's military is inexperienced in counterinsurgency and lacks the necessary hardware. The expulsion of U.S. military trainers in 2011 has hindered efforts to enhance Pakistan's capabilities. Pakistan's military operations, political strategies, drone strikes, and internal militant power have been criticized by independent analysts. The Pakistani Taliban was effectively splintered in 2011 through a \"divide-and-conquer\" political approach, drone strikes, and internal power struggles. This led to smaller factions not following orders from TTP leader Hakimullah Mehsud, resulting in a decrease in suicide bomb attacks in Pakistan. Mehsud's conflicts with other militant commanders and his own deputy, Wali-ur-Rehman, have further destabilized the TTP. Pakistani officials considered new negotiations with TTP militants in late 2011 as the United States leaned towards talks. The Pakistani Taliban was splintered in 2011 through political tactics, drone strikes, and internal power struggles. New negotiations with TTP militants were considered by Pakistani officials as the US favored talks with the Afghan Taliban. Deputy TTP chief Maulvi Faqir Muhammad claimed meetings with government representatives began in November, although Rawalpindi remained silent. Concerns arose due to past failed negotiation attempts in FATA. Despite denials, negotiations seem to have occurred, possibly influenced by Afghan Taliban leader Mullah Omar. The Haqqani group mediated an intra-militant pact to unify factions under Omar's leadership in Waziristan. The pact aims to direct hostility towards Afghanistan, not Pakistan. The Haqqanis seek to shift focus from anti-Pakistan insurgency to Afghanistan, which is a concern for the US and other governments. The U.S. government offered a $10 million reward for information leading to the conviction of Hafiz Saeed, the leader of the terrorist group behind the 2008 Mumbai attack. This move was criticized by Pakistan, causing further strain in U.S.-Pakistan relations. In another incident, militants attacked a prison in Bannu, freeing nearly 400 prisoners, including a terrorist sentenced to death for a plot against President Musharraf. An inquiry blamed various security forces for the security lapse. The raid bolstered Pakistani Taliban force levels and raised concerns about the effectiveness of Pakistan's security apparatus. Secretary of State Clinton urged Pakistan to take more action against terrorist sanctuaries and criticized the government for not acting against Hafiz Saeed. U.S. officials are worried about extremist groups in Pakistan operating with impunity, including the Afghan Taliban, Haqqani Network, LeT, and Jaish-e-Mohammed. In Pakistan's Punjabi heartland, threats to the United States and its allies persist, with concerns about American citizens being recruited for Islamist terrorism. In 2010, Faisal Shahzad, a U.S. citizen of Pakistani origin, attempted a car bomb attack in Times Square, claiming training in western Pakistan. Other cases link U.S. citizens to terrorist plots in Pakistan and beyond, such as the 2008 Mumbai attack involving a Pakistani-born American. In 2009, David Coleman Headley, a Pakistani-born American, was charged with aiding the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attack. He traveled to Mumbai multiple times as a scout for the LeT terrorist group. Headley interacted with a retired Pakistani major and Ilayas Kashmiri, a former Pakistani special forces commando with ties to Al Qaeda. Indian officials requested direct access to Headley for interrogation in 2010. In 2010, Indian officials gained access to David Coleman Headley for interrogation, revealing a Pakistani role in the Mumbai attack. Headley testified in a Chicago court in 2011, implicating LeT members and an ISI officer. This strained US-Pakistan relations and raised suspicions of Pakistani involvement in supporting terrorism. Rana was acquitted of Mumbai attack charges but found guilty of aiding LeT and conspiring to attack a Danish newspaper. The bitter rivalry between Pakistan and India, stemming from wars and unresolved issues like Kashmiri sovereignty, has led to decades of military preparedness. Despite some successes in the Composite Dialogue, 2008 saw a significant deterioration in relations between the two nuclear-armed countries. In 2008, Pakistan-India relations deteriorated significantly following the terrorist attack on Mumbai. Militarized territorial disputes over Kashmir, Siachen Glacier, and Sir Creek remain unresolved. Conflict over water resources also emerged as a factor. The U.S. government has refrained from mediating the Kashmir dispute. Pakistan and India are engaged in a \"shadow war\" in Afghanistan. Following the 2008 Mumbai attack, India held Pakistan responsible for supporting anti-India terrorist groups. Despite initial reluctance, India agreed to resume peace talks with Pakistan in early 2011, leading to high-level discussions after a two-year hiatus. This marked a shift from focusing solely on terrorism to broader dialogue. Following the 2008 Mumbai attack, India blamed Pakistan for supporting terrorist groups. In early 2011, peace talks resumed after a two-year break, leading to discussions on various issues such as establishing a terror hotline, economic cooperation, confidence-building measures, and trade expansion. The dialogue process showed positive signs, with efforts to enhance peace and bilateral relations. After a two-year hiatus, India and Pakistan's trade ministers met in New Delhi to liberalize bilateral trade. India also dropped opposition to waiving duties on Pakistani exports from flood-ravaged areas. The circumstances of OBL's death impacted relations, with Indian PM calling it a significant step forward but expressing concerns about a U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. New Delhi saw the discovery of OBL in Pakistan as an opportunity to press demands for extradition of Mumbai attack perpetrators and other anti-India terrorists. Afghan President Karzai's visit to India in 2011 and strategic framework agreement heightened Pakistan's fears of encirclement. Afghanistan's closer ties with India may be linked to efforts to reconcile with the Taliban. The Afghan President signed a pact not directed at any country, but some analysts found it provocative towards Pakistan. Pakistan's relations with India have improved, with plans to grant MFN trade status. This move could significantly increase bilateral trade and build peace constituencies in both countries. Pakistan's offer to move towards freer bilateral trade with India, shown by the shift from a \"positive list\" to a \"negative list\" of import items, indicates a shift in its stance on Kashmir as a prerequisite for progress. There have been no terrorist attacks in India linked to Pakistan in over three years, and President Zardari's visit to India in 2012 marked the first by a Pakistani head of state since 2005. The avalanche tragedy in Kashmir highlighted the ongoing conflict between Pakistani and Indian troops in the region. Despite the negligible military value of the area, both governments refuse to redeploy their forces. In 2012, Pakistan and India signed agreements with Turkmenistan to build a gas pipeline through Afghanistan, supported by the US as part of the New Silk Road Initiative. Despite security concerns in Afghanistan, India's willingness to make concessions is limited by Pakistan's support for Islamist militancy. India criticizes Pakistan for not prosecuting Mumbai attack masterminds and seeks extradition of suspects residing in Pakistan. Pakistan and China have a close relationship with China being a primary arms supplier for Pakistan and heavily involved in the Pakistani economy. China intends to build two new civilian nuclear reactors in Pakistan, potentially violating international guidelines. During Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao's visit to Islamabad in late 2010, Pakistan and China signed multiple agreements totaling $35 billion in various sectors. In response to China's concerns about Islamist militants in Pakistan, ISI Director Pasha visited Beijing in 2011. China has expressed worries about Uighur separatists finding refuge in Pakistan in 2012. In 2011, Chinese concerns about Uighur separatists in Pakistan strained bilateral relations. Pakistani leaders showed increased closeness with China, with PM Gilani's visit resulting in a deal for fighter jets and negotiations for submarines worth $3 billion. The United States and China have a shared interest in strengthening Pakistan's counterterrorism capabilities. China sees its relationship with Pakistan as a way to balance against India but also recognizes the risk of Pakistan-based terrorist groups causing a crisis harmful to Chinese economic interests. This could lead to greater U.S.-China coordination to improve Pakistan's military and intelligence services and potentially pressure Islamabad to dismantle jihadist groups. Cooperation between the U.S. and China could extend to other areas like nonproliferation. China's military and diplomatic support for Pakistan hinders India's regional ambitions. The \"all-weather friendship\" with Pakistan no longer guarantees blanket support from China. Beijing is unlikely to get involved in any U.S.-Pakistani rift and has no intention of replacing Washington as Islamabad's primary foreign benefactor. Relations between Pakistan and Iran have been troubled by differences. Relations between Pakistan and Iran have been troubled by differences over Afghanistan and the presence of anti-Shia terrorist groups. Despite this, both countries aim to complete a natural gas pipeline project, which the US opposes due to sanctions on Iran's nuclear program. The US opposes the construction of a pipeline on the Pakistani side of the border due to Iran sanctions. Pakistan is determined to complete the project despite US concerns. Tehran has tried to bypass sanctions by trading oil for wheat and rice with Pakistan. The security of Pakistan's nuclear arsenal is a top US concern, especially with the presence of Islamist militants. Pakistan has been involved in illicit nuclear proliferation in the past, including the network led by A.Q. Khan. Pakistan's nuclear security is a concern as A.Q. Khan's network remains intact without facing criminal charges. There are worries about potential leakage of nuclear know-how. Pakistan is rapidly expanding its nuclear arsenal, possibly in response to US-India civil nuclear cooperation. China's plan to build reactors in Pakistan raises nonproliferation concerns for the Obama Administration. The Obama Administration is facing a dilemma over China's proposed deal to build reactors in Pakistan, which raises nonproliferation concerns. Pakistan's economy is struggling with inflation, unemployment, food and energy shortages, exacerbated by devastating flooding in 2010 and 2011. Corruption hampers economic development and foreign investment, with foreign direct investment dropping significantly in recent years. In FY2010/2011, Pakistan's economy faced a decline in revenue, attributed to increasing militancy, global recession, and political instability. Economic priorities include addressing inflation, budget deficit, and reviving growth. India's economic growth surpassed Pakistan's in the early 2000s, leading to higher national wealth figures. A 2008 balance-of-payments crisis prompted Islamabad to seek multi-billion dollar loans. In 2008, Pakistan faced a balance-of-payments crisis and sought multi-billion dollar loans from the IMF. The current IMF-supported program is a $11.3 billion Stand-By Arrangement, with $3.6 billion yet to be disbursed. Islamabad's failure to implement required reforms led to a hold on the program in 2010. Security concerns in 2011 further delayed disbursement of funds, prompting Pakistan to seek U.S. help to influence the IMF for relaxed conditions. The Pakistani government faces constraints on its federal budget due to repayment of IMF loans, exacerbated by low revenue generation and high military spending. Efforts to increase tax revenue and implement reforms have faced challenges, with Secretary Clinton criticizing Pakistan's low tax-to-GDP ratio. The government's attempt to lower fuel subsidies in early 2011 caused political turmoil as a PPP coalition partner withdrew support. Electricity shortages have led to economic decline, with businesses forced to shut down due to power outages. Public protests over gas shortages have turned violent, with citizens ransacking offices and torching vehicles. Inflation is the top concern for Pakistanis, with 52% citing it as the most important issue. Inflation is the most pressing issue in Pakistan, overshadowing unemployment and terrorism. Despite 2.4% economic growth in FY2011, public debt, double-digit inflation, and energy shortages are hindering growth. Structural deficiencies in the economy persist, including low tax revenues and power shortages. Plans to reform taxes and subsidies are delayed, with power outages estimated to reduce GDP growth by up to 4%. The State Bank of Pakistan identifies these issues as central causes of economic problems. The World Bank and IMF have highlighted poor governance as the central cause of economic problems in Pakistan. They recommend focusing on human development sectors like education and health to prevent poverty alleviation gains from being at risk due to renewed growth. The IMF report in February 2012 highlighted Pakistan's bleak near- and middle-term prospects due to low growth, high inflation, and a weakening external position. Urgent policy actions recommended include strengthening public finances, reforming the energy sector, and implementing financial measures to reduce inflation and ensure financial stability. Pakistani leaders aim to improve access to Western markets, with exports, especially from the textile sector, seen as crucial for future recovery. The textile sector in Pakistan is crucial for future recovery, with efforts to reduce tariffs on textile exports ongoing. The sector directly employs 3.5 million Pakistanis and accounts for 40% of urban factory jobs. Abolishing American tariffs could boost exports by $5 billion annually. Pakistan's democracy has faced challenges, with power struggles among presidents, prime ministers, and army chiefs. The bicameral Parliament holds federal power under the constitution. President Zardari was elected in September 2008 to lead Pakistan's government, which still faces challenges from the military in foreign and national security policies. The civilian-led coalition struggles to maintain power and enact reforms, while the judiciary battles with the executive branch over corruption charges. The political turmoil in Pakistan includes battles between the judiciary and executive branch over corruption charges, threats to the government's majority status, and coalition instability due to economic issues like rising fuel prices and inflation. The MQM's withdrawal and rejoining of the ruling coalition in 2011 posed a risk of government collapse. In 2011, the PPP strengthened its standing by forming a new alliance with the PML-Q faction, bolstering its support in Punjab and potentially threatening the PML-Nawaz faction. The ANP, a PPP coalition ally, also runs the government in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Senate elections in February 2012 were crucial. The PPP strengthened its position by forming an alliance with the PML-Q faction in 2011, which also threatened the PML-Nawaz faction. The ANP, a PPP coalition ally, governs the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Senate elections in February 2012 were important for Zardari's political safety, as PPP gains secured the party's control of the Senate until 2015. The circumstances of OBL's death embarrassed the Pakistani military, leading to criticism and potentially allowing civilian leaders to have more influence over foreign and national security policies. Media criticism of the security establishment continued throughout the year due to scandals and abuse of power. The civilians have not taken advantage of recent openings and have supported the security services instead of calling for resignations. A commission was formed to investigate bin Laden's presence in Pakistan and American forces' incursion. Civil-military tensions post-bin Laden raid raised concerns of a military coup in late 2011. In early 2012, Prime Minister Gilani faced contempt charges for not complying with Supreme Court orders regarding a corruption case. The court orders Prime Minister Gilani to request Swiss authorities to reopen a corruption case against President Zardari, despite Gilani's argument of presidential immunity. Gilani is found guilty of contempt but is only sentenced to the time it takes for the court to adjourn. Legal scholars predict Gilani may be disqualified from office after the appeal period ends in June. The State Department considers the case a domestic political issue for Pakistan. In late 2011, former cricket hero Imran Khan rose as a new political star in Pakistan with his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, attracting support from young and middle-class Pakistanis with anti-corruption and anti-American sentiment. Khan's rallies in Lahore and Karachi drew huge crowds, and the PTI has gained converts from major national parties, posing a threat to former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League. Imran Khan's rise in late 2011 with his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party reflected the public's desire for honest politicians. Khan vowed to cut off U.S. aid, end conflict with the Pakistani Taliban, and tackle corruption if he came to power. Despite skepticism, his popularity grew due to his anti-corruption stance and appeal to young and middle-class Pakistanis. There are concerns about his sympathy for Islamist causes and alleged military backing. The emergence of Pakistan's conservative Islamist political forces through the Difa-e-Pakistan Council (DPC) is marked by large street rallies demanding an end to cooperation with the US and rapprochement with India. Led by figures like Hafiz Saeed of the Lashkar-e-Taiba group, the DPC opposes reopening GLOCs and accuses the US and India of involvement in Baluchistan's insurgency. Banned terrorist groups also operate openly within the country. The Difa-e-Pakistan Council (DPC) in Pakistan is gaining influence by rallying against US cooperation and accusing the US and India of involvement in Baluchistan's insurgency. Human rights abuses persist in Pakistan, with extrajudicial killings and torture being major issues. The government's lack of accountability allows abuses to go unpunished, fostering a culture of impunity. In 2011, human rights abuses in Pakistan included extrajudicial killings, torture, disappearances, poor prison conditions, arbitrary detention, weak criminal justice system, lack of judicial independence, privacy rights infringements, harassment of journalists, censorship, restrictions on freedom of assembly and movement, religious freedom violations, discrimination against religious minorities, widespread corruption, and issues of rape and domestic violence. Human rights abuses in Pakistan include rape, domestic violence, sexual harassment, \"honor\" crimes, child abuse, human trafficking, discrimination against minorities, worker rights violations, and violence by militant groups. Pakistan is considered the world's most dangerous country for journalists. The Obama Administration has concerns about human rights abuses by Pakistani security forces, leading to withholding funding for certain army units. Blasphemy laws in Pakistan aim to protect Islamic beliefs but are criticized for being discriminatory and arbitrary. In late 2010, a Pakistani Christian woman was sentenced to death under these laws, sparking international scrutiny. The Obama Administration has concerns about human rights abuses by Pakistani security forces, leading to withholding funding for certain army units. Blasphemy laws in Pakistan aim to protect Islamic beliefs but are criticized for being discriminatory and arbitrary. In late 2010, a Pakistani Christian woman was sentenced to death under these laws, sparking international scrutiny. Despite calls for reform, the government backed away after pressure from Islamist hardline groups, leading to the withdrawal of reform proposals and the assassination of government proponents. US Congress renewed large assistance packages to Pakistan, totaling $15.3 billion in overt assistance over ten years. In 2009, Congress passed the Enhanced Partnership with Pakistan Act (EPPA) authorizing increased nonmilitary aid to Pakistan and establishing the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund (PCCF) to enhance security forces' ability to combat militancy. Congress has also appropriated billions of dollars to reimburse Pakistan for its support of U.S.-led counterterrorism operations, totaling nearly $9 billion paid to date. The U.S. has provided nearly $9 billion in \"coalition support funds\" to Pakistan for its support in counterterrorism operations. Recent oversight has led to more rejected claims. The Administration's Pakistan Assistance Strategy Report outlines objectives for nonmilitary aid, focusing on infrastructure programs in energy and agriculture sectors. Washington is considering grants to help Pakistan launch construction of the Diamer Basha dam, a $12 billion project led by the Asian Development Bank. The dam could generate 4,500 megawatts of electricity, addressing the country's current shortfall. Concerns about corruption and oversight capacity have led to delays in aid distribution, reinforcing Pakistani perceptions. The delay in security-related U.S. assistance to Pakistan has reinforced Pakistani perceptions of unreliability. Major arms transfers since 2001 have included items for counterterrorism and conventional warfare. Pakistani officials have criticized the slow delivery of defense equipment needed for counterinsurgency operations. Security assistance to Pakistan's civilian sector aims to strengthen law enforcement capabilities. The U.S. has been reevaluating its aid programs to Pakistan, with a focus on law enforcement capabilities and counterterrorism efforts. There is growing criticism that military aid has not effectively addressed Islamist militancy and may hinder Pakistan's development. Congressional figures have expressed strong concerns about the bilateral relationship. The U.S. is reevaluating aid programs to Pakistan, focusing on nonmilitary aid to strengthen civil society. Major bills in FY2013 include provisions like limiting CSF payments to $650 million and requiring reports on conditions for aid. The U.S. is reevaluating aid programs to Pakistan, focusing on nonmilitary aid to strengthen civil society. Major bills in FY2013 include provisions like limiting CSF payments to $650 million and requiring reports on conditions for aid. Unless the Secretary of Defense reports to Congress on the claims process, any new conditions Pakistan has placed on use of its GLOCs, and estimates any differences in transit costs from FY2011 to FY2013; withhold FY2012 CSF payments to Pakistan unless the Secretary certifies that the Islamabad government is supporting counterterrorism operations against various terrorist organizations, dismantling IED networks, preventing nuclear-related proliferation, and issuing visas in a timely manner for official U.S. visitors; and limit the obligation or disbursement of FY2013 PCF funds to 10% of those appropriated or transferred unless the Secretary of Defense, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State, reports to Congress an updated strategy on utilization of the Fund, metrics for determining relevant progress, and a strategy for enhancing Pakistan's efforts to counter. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved a bill to fund the State Department and foreign operations for FY2013, providing $50 million for the PCCF if Pakistan reopens the GLOCs to Afghanistan and uses the funds efficiently. Funds for Pakistan under various programs will be withheld unless the Secretary of State certifies cooperation in counterterrorism efforts against specific terrorist organizations. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved a bill to fund the State Department and foreign operations for FY2013, providing $50 million for the PCCF if Pakistan reopens the GLOCs to Afghanistan and uses the funds efficiently. Funds for Pakistan under various programs will be withheld unless the Secretary of State certifies cooperation in counterterrorism efforts against specific terrorist organizations. Additionally, conditions include not supporting terrorist activities against the United States or coalition forces in Afghanistan, dismantling IED networks, preventing nuclear-related proliferation, and implementing policies to protect judicial independence and rule of law in Pakistan. The total State Department aid to Pakistan is limited to about $800 million, with specific allocations for different programs. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved a bill for FY2013 funding for the State Department and foreign operations, with specific conditions for aid to Pakistan, including withholding funds unless cooperation in counterterrorism efforts is certified. The bill also includes provisions for assistance to Pakistan, such as a spend plan with goals for development, countering extremism, and promoting transparent governance, with the possibility of suspending aid if progress is not made. The bill for FY2013 funding for the State Department and foreign operations includes provisions withholding funds for Pakistan unless cooperation in counterterrorism efforts is certified. It also allows $100 million of ESF funds for Overseas Contingency Operations if designated by Congress. The FY2013 funding bill includes provisions withholding funds for Pakistan unless cooperation in counterterrorism efforts is certified. It also requires Pakistan to meet various conditions such as dismantling IED networks, preventing nuclear-related proliferation, and providing humanitarian access. Additionally, the Secretary of State must submit a spend plan to Congress with goals for development, countering extremism, and promoting transparent governance. The FY2013 funding bill includes provisions withholding funds for Pakistan unless cooperation in counterterrorism efforts is certified. It also requires Pakistan to meet various conditions such as dismantling IED networks, preventing nuclear-related proliferation, and providing humanitarian access. Additionally, the Secretary of State must submit a spend plan to Congress with goals for development, countering extremism, and promoting transparent and accountable governance. The bill recommends suspending all assistance to Pakistan if measurable progress is not made towards stated goals and benchmarks. It allows for funds to be used for cross border stabilization and development programs between Afghanistan, Pakistan, and central Asian republics. INCLE and FMF funds can be transferred to PCCF with notification to Congress and an implementation plan."
