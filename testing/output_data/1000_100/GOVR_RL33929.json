    "content": "Each year, Congress funds the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to renew over 2.1 million Section 8 vouchers, which are rental subsidies for low-income families in the private market. Administered by local public housing authorities, the vouchers cover the difference between rent and 30% of the tenant's income. In recent years, Congress has made changes to the Section 8 voucher renewal funding distribution, leading to funding uncertainty for many local public housing authorities. This has prompted pressure on Congress to establish a permanent funding formula, possibly through Section 8 voucher reform legislation. The report discusses the changes in the renewal funding formula starting in FY2003 and their effects on PHAs administering the voucher program. Despite receiving full funding, many public housing authorities (PHAs) struggled to lease 100% of their authorized vouchers, leading to low utilization rates below the expected 95%. This resulted in PHAs having excess budget funds and rarely needing to dip into their one-month reserves, even if costs increased. HUD and each PHA would reconcile their budgets at the end of the year. HUD and PHAs reconciled budgets annually, with HUD recapturing excess funds from PHAs' reserves. Funding for Section 8 vouchers was determined based on actual costs, inflation, and the number of vouchers. PHAs could use excess funds for maximized leasing. Congress provided more funds than needed, recapturing unused funds the following year. In FY2003, Congress changed the funding for PHAs to reduce recaptures of unspent funds and provide more accurate funding levels based on actual voucher usage. HUD was directed to fund PHAs based on their average annual per-voucher cost from the previous year, adjusted for inflation, and multiplied by the expected number of leased vouchers. HUD implemented a provision based on PHAs' utilization rates and costs reported on their financial statements. Renewal calculations for FY2003 were determined by the total number of unit months under lease and actual cost data from the most recent year-end settlement. HUD implemented a provision based on PHAs' utilization rates and costs reported on their financial statements. Actual costs will be adjusted using Annual Adjustment Factors. Expiring voucher funding increments will generally be renewed for three-month terms to enable more accurate funding calculations. Congress created a Central Reserve fund for the Secretary to replenish PHA reserves if needed. The bill introduced amendments to address cost increases and leasing restrictions for Public Housing Authorities (PHAs). It required funding based on actual voucher utilization and limited funds for maximized leasing. PHAs had to adjust leasing levels to match authorized levels to receive funding. The FY2004 appropriations law aimed to control cost increases in the voucher program by restricting funds for maximized leasing. The Secretary was expected to utilize administrative tools to control costs, including renewing expiring contracts based on unit months under lease. The FY2004 appropriations law aimed to control cost increases in the voucher program by restricting funds for maximized leasing. The Central Reserve fund could only be used to replenish reserves depleted due to increased utilization, not increased costs. HUD implemented the FY2004 appropriations law by basing PHAs' budgets on utilization rates and costs from end-of-the-year statements, adjusted by the annual adjustment factor. PHAs could appeal if rental costs in their areas rose higher than the inflation factor adopted by HUD. This notice was controversial among housing advocates. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act directed HUD to fund PHAs based on voucher costs, utilization rates, and the HUD-published AAF, adjusted for new tenant protection vouchers. HUD granted appeals requests from 380 out of 400 agencies, distributing $160 million from the Central Reserve. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act directed HUD to fund PHAs based on voucher costs, utilization rates, and the HUD-published AAF. PHAs were expected to manage their voucher programs within their budgets for CY2005, with reduced reserves and no Central Reserve provided. The act also continued the prohibition on maximized leasing and made changes to the way PHAs received their voucher renewal funding. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act changed the funding for PHAs to a calendar-year cycle, resulting in budget adjustments and appeals limited to data errors. HUD provided guidance on the new provisions in December 2004. The final calculations for agency budgets were published on January 21, 2005, with agencies funded at 4.03% less than their actual cost levels. A proration factor of just under 96% was implemented due to insufficient funding from Congress. HUD identified options for PHAs to lower costs in 2005 in Notice PIH 2005-9. In 2005, PHAs were advised to lower costs by adjusting payment standards, reducing utility assistance, restricting portability, reviewing rents, suspending voucher reissuance, limiting bedroom sizes, implementing minimum rents, monitoring income eligibility strictly, and terminating assistance if funds were insufficient. The FY2006 HUD Appropriations Act distributed renewal funding based on CY2005 eligibility, adjusted for inflation and prorated to fit within the allocated amount. The Secretary was given $45 million to adjust agency budgets in two categories. The FY2006 HUD Appropriations Act provided $45 million for agencies to adjust budgets based on low leasing costs or unforeseen circumstances. PHAs were funded at 94% of their eligibility due to insufficient funding from Congress. Changes in FY2005 and FY2006 incentivized PHAs to reduce costs and helped reverse the cost growth trend seen in 2003. The rental housing market saw a reversal in cost growth trends from 2003 to 2006. Average annual per voucher costs remained flat in 2004-2005 and decreased by 1.5% in 2005-2006. Utilization dropped, leading to 100,000 fewer households receiving assistance in 2006 compared to 2004. PHAs had accumulated reserve funds as most were not spending all their funding. Budget utilization decreased nationally from over 98% in 2003-2004 to under 92% in 2006. In FY2007, the debate continued between a budget-based funding formula and a unit-based formula for PHAs administering voucher programs. President Bush requested Congress to fund the voucher program using a budget-based formula and lift the prohibition on maximized leasing. Some PHAs had excess funding they were not permitted to use to serve additional families. In FY2007, Congress rejected President Bush's proposal to fund PHAs based on a unit-based formula. Instead, they adopted a formula based on PHAs' leasing and cost data from the most recent 12 months, adjusted for various factors, and prorated to fit within the appropriated amount. The law also included a central reserve fund for adjustments due to unforeseen circumstances or voucher portability. The act made adjustments for public housing agencies facing funding decreases due to a formula shift, with exceptions for Hurricane Katrina-affected agencies, those under receivership, and agencies that overspent in the prior year. Under the FY2007 formula change, PHAs were funded based on their FY2006 usage rather than received amounts. Agencies with higher costs did better under this formula, while those with lower costs did worse. Funding was sufficient for all agencies to serve at least the same number of families as before. The FY2007 funding formula for PHAs was a combination of unit-based and budget-based elements. It allocated funds based on the number of vouchers used, with caps in place, and provided a fixed budget for program administration. President Bush's FY2008 budget proposed a strictly budget-based formula, similar to previous years, adjusting funding based on 2007 eligibility and other costs. The FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 110-161) adopted a cost and utilization-based funding formula for agencies, similar to FY2007. It funded agencies based on leasing and costs from the prior year, adjusted for various factors. A central reserve fund was provided for HUD to make adjustments, with an alternative formula for specific categories of agencies. Unlike FY2007, the FY2008 Act included a rescission. The FY2008 Act included a rescission that reduced each PHA's funding level by the amount of their unusable reserves exceeding 7% of their FY2007 total. This freed up unusable reserves, allowing Congress to cut $723 million in renewal funding without reducing the total amount of new appropriations for voucher renewals in FY2008. In FY2008, Congress reduced PHAs' funding by cutting $723 million in renewal funding without decreasing the total amount of new appropriations for voucher renewals. In FY2009, HUD was directed to fund PHAs based on a hybrid formula that considered the number and cost of leased vouchers in FY2008, adjusted for inflation and other factors. PHAs' allocations were prorated based on HUD's estimate of their Net Restricted Assets. The FY2009 funding for Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) was based on a hybrid formula considering leased vouchers in FY2008, adjusted for inflation. PHAs were expected to supplement their allocations with unused Net Restricted Assets (NRA). HUD's estimates of costs, utilization, and NRA balances were sometimes inaccurate. Some PHAs faced funding shortfalls in CY2009 due to inaccurate estimates and changes in leasing conditions. HUD estimated that 15% of PHAs administering the voucher program were affected. HUD provided additional funding from the FY2009 renewal set-aside and advised agencies on cost-cutting measures to address the shortfall. In CY2009, some PHAs faced funding shortfalls, leading to concerns about families losing assistance. HUD provided additional funding to prevent termination of assistance, with Congress enacting legislation allowing up to $200 million in funding. This policy change increased set-aside renewal funding to adjust PHAs' budgets and prevent assistance termination. The FY2010 budget request under the Obama Administration represented a different approach to voucher funding. The Obama Administration's FY2010 budget requested a new approach to voucher funding, similar to the model in place since FY2007. It included the authority to offset agency budgets for excess reserves and reallocate funding to high-performing or needy agencies. The final funding law adopted a similar formula based on FY2009 data, but did not grant the Secretary the authority to offset budgets. The FY2010 budget did not grant the Secretary authority to offset agency budgets based on reserves or lift the prohibition on over-leasing. The FY2011 and FY2012 allocation formula directed HUD to allocate Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher renewal funding to PHAs based on their costs and utilization. The FY2012 law included a rescission of $650 million to be offset from PHAs with reserves above a certain level. PHAs were serving more families than authorized and spending nearly every federal dollar they received following funding formula changes since FY2003. Since FY2003, PHAs have been serving fewer families and spending a smaller share of federal funding. Low utilization of funding and vouchers persisted until FY2007 when the funding formula changed again. With the shift to a hybrid cost and utilization-based model, PHAs have seen an increase in funding utilization from 91% in 2006 to 95% by the end of 2009. By 2009, PHAs were serving over 150,000 more families than in 2006, surpassing the previous high point in 2003. Large reserves accumulated during the budget-based formula days of 2005 and 2006 were depleted by the end of FY2009. By FY2009, reserves from 2005 and 2006 were spent due to rescissions in FY2008 and FY2009. Per voucher costs rose from CY2007 to CY2009 and were expected to continue in CY2012. Congress members introduced voucher reform legislation with changes to funding formulas, but Appropriations Committees could still override it annually since FY2003. Since FY2003, Congress has made changes to the Section 8 voucher program's funding structure, moving away from an entitlement program to a discretionary program with fixed annual funding. This shift aimed to address concerns about inefficient funding allocations and rising costs, giving Congress more control over cost growth. The Appropriations Committees could still override voucher reform legislation introduced by Congress members annually. The Section 8 voucher program underwent changes in funding structure, transitioning from an entitlement to a discretionary program with fixed annual funding. This shift aimed to give Congress more control over cost growth, but many Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) found it challenging to administer. PHAs had limited control over costs, with subsidies set by statute. Some PHAs made adjustments like lowering payment standards and conducting rent reviews, leading to landlords accepting reduced rents or opting out of the program. Many Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) faced challenges in administering the Section 8 voucher program due to changes in funding structure. PHAs had limited control over costs, with subsidies set by statute. Some PHAs intentionally reduced their utilization rates to save money, leading to fewer households receiving vouchers. Data from HUD showed that voucher costs leveled off and utilization rates declined from 2005 to 2006. According to CRS analysis of HUD data, average voucher costs and utilization rates declined from 2005 to 2006. Some PHAs had excess funds they were not allowed to spend, leading to controversy among low-income housing advocates and PHA industry groups. In FY2007, low-income housing advocates and PHA groups faced challenges with the funding formula, but the funding bill reverted to a previous formula. PHAs were funded based on previous year's usage, leading to some receiving less funding despite program sufficiency. In FY2007, low-income housing advocates and PHA groups faced challenges with the funding formula, but the funding bill reverted to a previous formula. PHAs were funded based on previous year's usage, leading to some receiving less funding despite program sufficiency. The FY2008 and FY2009 formulas closely followed the FY2007 formula, with reductions in agency budgets that had excess reserves. FY2010 and FY2011 formulas were similar, without reductions related to reserves. In FY2012, agency reserves were used to offset renewal costs. The funding model has shifted to a cost and utilization-based model, incentivizing PHAs to increase utilization. Costs and utilization are rising, increasing the program's cost to Congress. The rising costs of the program may pressure policy makers to contain costs while maintaining services to families. Proposed Section 8 voucher reform aims to serve more families without capping cost growth, but future appropriations could override it. Past cost containment strategies reduced costs but also decreased the number of families served and led to unspent funds accumulation. Tailoring policies to balance service levels and minimize unspent funds may be necessary for future cost containment efforts."
