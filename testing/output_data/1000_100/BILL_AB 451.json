If a city or county allows public use of privately owned offstreet parking facilities, the owner must provide instructions on contesting parking fees and cannot involve the Department of Motor Vehicles in collecting unpaid fees. An ordinance or resolution enacted for offstreet parking facilities must have a notice posted at each entrance warning of public moving vehicle laws and potential parking invoice fees. A parking receipt must also include language about the possibility of a parking invoice fee. Prior to enacting any ordinance or resolution, a public hearing and written notice to the owner and operator of the offstreet parking facility is required.
