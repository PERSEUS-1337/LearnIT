    "title": "AB 1366",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature aims to boost enrollment and graduation rates for AB 540 students by mandating Dream Resource Centers at public higher education institutions. Approximately 65,000 undocumented students graduate from high schools each year, but only 20 percent attend college. Many are unaware of laws like AB 540, the California Dream Act, and DACA that make college more accessible. Most college campuses lack centralized support services for these students. The creation of Dream Resource Centers would streamline financial aid and academic opportunities for students meeting AB 540 requirements, empowering and creating a safe environment for them. These centers aim to increase enrollment, transfer, and graduation rates among this population. Several college campuses have established Dream Resource Centers to support undocumented students, offering workshops, legal assistance, information on available programs, and peer mentoring. These centers aim to raise awareness of resources, enhance professional development, and improve employment opportunities for this population. Each campus of the California Community Colleges and California State University is encouraged to designate a Dream Resource Liaison knowledgeable in financial aid and academic opportunities for students meeting specific requirements, including undocumented students. This staff person should be placed in the campus' extended opportunity programs and services office or financial aid office. Each campus of the California State University is encouraged to have a designated Dream Resource Liaison knowledgeable in financial aid, services, and academic opportunities for students meeting specific requirements, including undocumented students. The University of California is encouraged to designate a Dream Resource Liaison on each campus. Dream Resource Centers may offer various support services. The section allows Dream Resource Centers to be housed within existing student service or academic centers, and the space where the Dream Resource Liaison is located can be considered a Dream Resource Center. The California State University, California Community Colleges, and University of California can accept gifts to aid in creating and operating Dream Resource Centers. The act mandates reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for costs determined by the Commission on State Mandates."
