Congress finds that bullying and harassment in schools can seriously harm students' physical and psychological health, leading to academic issues such as high dropout rates and absenteeism. These behaviors include physical violence, name-calling, intimidation, social exclusion, and cyberbullying. Students are targeted for bullying and harassment based on various factors like race, gender, and disability. Schools with anti-bullying policies see increased reporting and intervention, reducing the frequency of incidents. Some experience relational aggression, causing harm through manipulation or threats. Interventions to address bullying and harassment in schools include creating a positive and safe climate, implementing evidence-based discipline policies like PBIS and restorative practices. 85 percent of Americans support a Federal law to prevent bullying in schools. Students, parents, educators, and policymakers are uniting to address the national crisis of bullying and harassment. The purpose of the Safe Schools Improvement Act is to address bullying and harassment in public elementary and secondary schools by implementing anti-bullying policies. The Safe Schools Improvement Act aims to address bullying, including cyberbullying, in public schools by requiring states receiving grants to establish policies that prevent and prohibit severe, persistent, or pervasive conduct that limits a student's participation or creates a hostile educational environment. The Safe Schools Improvement Act requires states to establish policies prohibiting bullying or harassment based on various characteristics, including race, color, national origin, sex, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, and other defining traits. The Safe Schools Improvement Act mandates local educational agencies to provide annual notice of prohibited conduct and grievance procedures for complaints, including designated officials and resolution timelines. The Safe Schools Improvement Act requires schools to collect and report accurate data on incidents of prohibited conduct, while also promoting positive disciplinary approaches to minimize student removal from instruction and prevent disproportionate punishment. The Safe Schools Improvement Act mandates State reports on local educational agencies' data and plans to address prohibited conduct, along with biennial evaluations. The Secretary conducts biennial evaluations of anti-bullying programs in schools, including data collection on prohibited conduct. A report is submitted to the President and Congress every two years. The Secretary conducts biennial evaluations of anti-bullying programs in schools, including data collection on prohibited conduct.

The text chunk discusses Section 4706, which clarifies that states and local entities can enact laws to prevent bullying or harassment of students as long as they are not inconsistent with the regulations outlined in the Safe Schools Improvement section."
