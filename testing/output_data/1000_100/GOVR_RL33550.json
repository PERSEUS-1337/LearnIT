    "content": "Countervailing duty laws aim to help domestic industries affected by subsidized imports. Relief is provided through additional import duties equal to the estimated subsidy amount. Two conditions must be met for relief: the International Trade Commission must find material injury to the domestic industry, and the International Trade Administration must confirm the subsidies. Before a 2007 investigation on CFS paper from China, CVD laws were not applied to NME countries like China. The International Trade Administration (ITA) previously did not apply countervailing duty laws to nonmarket economy (NME) countries like China due to difficulties in measuring market distortions caused by subsidies. However, in a 2007 investigation, the ITA found it possible to identify subsidies in China as many industries operate based on market principles. The ITA reaffirmed China as an NME country but made a China-specific determination regarding subsidies, not applicable to other NME countries. The ITA is responsible for designating NME countries as those not operating on market principles of cost or pricing structures. The ITA designates NME countries based on factors like currency convertibility, wage rates, and government control of production and resources. Current NME countries include Armenia, China, and Vietnam. The ITA first decided not to apply CVD action to NME countries in 1983-1984. The ITA designates NME countries based on factors like currency convertibility, wage rates, and government control of production and resources. China, designated an NME country in 1983, is the United States' second largest trading partner and its third largest export market. The U.S. trade deficit with China has led to calls for increased use of trade remedy laws against Chinese products, particularly concerning alleged illegal subsidy programs. The 1984 ITA ruling limited recourse for addressing China's industry subsidies. China faces over 80 AD duty orders, with higher duty amounts due to ITA methodology for NME countries. Concerns include China's undervalued currency, alleged to contribute to the U.S. trade deficit and harm U.S. production and employment in various sectors. The issue of alleged Chinese \"currency manipulation\" has led to renewed congressional interest in countervailing action against imports from China, impacting U.S. production and employment in sectors like apparel and furniture. The NME classification for China was determined in a 1983 ITA ruling, reaffirmed in 2006. The ITA's determination on China being a nonmarket economy country remains in effect until revoked. The NME designation for China has a time limit specified in its WTO accession package. The United States and other WTO members can no longer use nonmarket economy or \"surrogate country\" methodology in CVD or AD investigations after December 11, 2016. Two countervailing duty laws were in force during the 1983-1984 investigations, requiring determination of subsidization amount and injury to U.S. industry. The countervailing duty law, Section 303, was repealed in January 1995 and allowed for the levying of a countervailing duty without the need for injury determination. It was applicable to products of countries not \"under the Agreement\" as defined by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 added comprehensive provisions to the countervailing duty law, implementing international Subsidies and Countervailing Code agreed upon in multilateral trade negotiations under the GATT. This legislation required a determination of subsidy provision for imported merchandise. The URAA amended the countervailing duty law of the 1979 Act by incorporating provisions comparable to section 303, which do not require injury determination in countervailing investigations of subsidized imports from countries other than \"Subsidies Agreement countries.\" This version is still in effect. Parallel countervailing duty investigations of carbon steel wire rod imports from Czechoslovakia and Poland were initiated on December 13, 1983, based on petitions filed by four U.S. steel manufacturers. Allegations included public benefits in the form of exchange rate systems, tax exemptions, and price equalization payments in both countries. The countervailing duty investigations of carbon steel wire rod imports from Czechoslovakia and Poland were initiated based on petitions filed by U.S. steel manufacturers. The determinations on common issues were identical with minor country-specific differences. The ITA found both countries to be \"countries not under the Agreement\" and considered them nonmarket economy countries. The issue of whether the countervailing duty provision of Title VII applies to nonmarket economy countries was addressed in preliminary determinations in carbon steel wire rod cases. The ITA found that nonmarket economy countries are not exempted from the countervailing duty law, based on statutory terms and legislative history. The ITA, in analyzing government intervention in market and nonmarket economies, found that nonmarket economies set prices without considering economic value, leading to prices not reflecting scarcity or abundance. In contrast to market economies where scarce goods increase in price, in nonmarket economies, prices remain unchanged unless mandated by central planners. The ITA analyzed alleged subsidization programs to determine if they confer a subsidy in a market economy or a nonmarket economy. They concluded that various programs do not constitute a bounty or grant, including multiple exchange rates, currency retention schemes, trade conversion coefficients, and price equalization payments. The ITA also found that the Polish adjustment coefficient program did not qualify as a bounty or grant, and they lacked sufficient information on the Czechoslovak tax exemption program to make a determination. In its findings, the ITA determined that alleged Czechoslovak and Polish practices did not provide bounties or grants under the CVD law. The investigations continued into the final phase, focusing on the application of the CVD law to nonmarket economy countries. The ITA concluded that Congress never directly addressed this issue, pointing out the lack of debate or legislation on the matter in 1974. Legislation and remedies were provided specifically with respect to imports from nonmarket economy countries in 1979, when the CVD law was restructured. Congress recognized the need for special remedial legislation applicable to State-controlled-economy countries in the context of antidumping and market disruption, but not with respect to countervailing action. The CVD law was restructured in 1979 to address imports from nonmarket economy countries. Special remedial legislation was recognized as necessary for State-controlled-economy countries in the context of antidumping and market disruption, but not for countervailing action. The legislation aimed to regulate unfairly priced imports from NME countries under either antidumping or countervailing duty legislation. The ITA consulted various sources and concluded that identifying and quantifying subsidies in nonmarket economy countries is challenging. The countervailing duty law requires measuring state-to-producer resource transfers, which is difficult in nonmarket economies. The ITA claimed discretion in determining subsidies, as recognized by the judiciary. The ITA concluded that in nonmarket economy countries like Czechoslovakia and Poland, no bounties or grants could be found, leading to final negative countervailing duty determinations. Additionally, petitions were filed alleging subsidization of potassium chloride imported from the German Democratic Republic and the Soviet Union, resulting in investigations being initiated. The ITA rescinded potassium chloride investigations in NME countries after determining no bounties or grants could be found. A countervailing duty investigation of Ceiling and Oscillating Fans Imported from China was initiated in 1991 based on a petition claiming China operates under market principles. The petition for a countervailing duty investigation of Ceiling and Oscillating Fans Imported from China was based on the claim that the Chinese fan industry operates as a market-oriented industry with self-provided data. The ITA introduced the concept of market-oriented industry to determine fair market value in antidumping investigations of imports from NME countries. In its preliminary investigation, the ITA found that several input prices were not in line with market principles. The ITA concluded in its final investigation that the PC fans industry is not an MOI due to non-market-determined input prices, leading to a final negative determination in the case. Petitioners challenged the ITA's actions in the U.S. Court of International Trade, which held that countervailing duty law applies to countries with nonmarket economies. The U.S. Court of International Trade, on July 30, 1985, ruled that countervailing duty law applies to countries with nonmarket economies, reversing carbon steel wire rod cases and ordering investigations to resume in potash cases. The court addressed grounds for nonapplicability of countervailing procedure to NME countries. The U.S. Court of International Trade ruled that countervailing duty law applies to countries with nonmarket economies, reversing previous decisions and ordering investigations to resume in specific cases. The court emphasized that subsidies can be found in nonmarket economies and that the plain language of the law must be followed without exemptions for any political entity. The U.S. Court of International Trade ruled that countervailing duty law applies to countries with nonmarket economies, emphasizing that subsidies can exist in such economies and must be investigated without exemptions for any political entity. The court criticized the ITA's argument that NME countries were exempt from the CVD law, stating that the agency has the authority to detect irregularities and investigate deviations regardless of the type of economy. The U.S. Court of International Trade ruled that countervailing duty law applies to countries with nonmarket economies, emphasizing the need to investigate subsidies without exemptions. The court dismissed the ITA's argument that NME countries were exempt from the law, stating that subsidies can exist in such economies and must be investigated. The U.S. Court of International Trade emphasized the need to investigate subsidies in countries with nonmarket economies, rejecting the ITA's argument for exemptions. The court criticized administrative actions that attempted to amend countervailing duty law by fiat. The U.S. government appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which reviewed the legislative history and development of relevant trade remedy laws. The appellate court could not determine if section 303 applies to nonmarket economies due to Congress not defining key terms in the statute. The court had to decide if the countervailing duty law from 1897 would have applied to nonmarket economies if they existed then. Based on the potash case, the court concluded that economic incentives were relevant. The appellate court concluded that economic incentives provided by the Soviet Union and East Germany for potash exports to the US did not constitute bounties or grants under the CVD law. The court upheld the ITA's discretion in determining the existence of bounties or grants. The Court of Appeals vacated the CIT order that reversed the ITA's final CVD determinations. The U.S. Court of Appeals vacated the CIT order regarding final CVD determinations in wire rod and potash cases, instructing dismissal due to lack of jurisdiction. This decision prompted a reaction in Congress, leading to the introduction of H.R. 3 in the 100th Congress, which proposed applying countervailing duty laws to nonmarket economy countries. In the 100th Congress, H.R. 3 was introduced to apply countervailing duty laws to nonmarket economy countries, with detailed procedural provisions and a requirement of injury determination by the U.S. International Trade Commission. Companion bills S. 770 and H.R. 1687 were also introduced but not further considered. The application of countervailing duty law to nonmarket economy countries was addressed in subsequent Congresses as well. The Tariff Act of 1930, as amended by the Uruguay Round Agreements Act, applied the CVD duty law to non-market economy (NME) countries using a surrogate market-economy country method. Identical bills were introduced in multiple Congresses to extend this provision to investigations of subsidies provided by NME countries. In the 109th Congress, bills were introduced to apply countervailing duties to subsidized imports from non-market economy (NME) countries. This included standalone bills like S. 593 and H.R. 1216, as well as broader trade-remedial legislation like the United States Trade Rights Enforcement Act. Additionally, H.R. 3306 focused on trade issues with China but also included provisions for countervailing action against all NME countries. In the 110th Congress, bills were introduced to apply countervailing duty law to nonmarket economy (NME) countries, including China. The bills aimed to address alleged foreign exchange-rate manipulation by China and define it as a countervailable subsidy. Several bills were introduced, such as S. 364, H.R. 571, H.R. 708, H.R. 782, and H.R. 2942. In the 110th Congress, bills were introduced to apply countervailing duty law to nonmarket economy (NME) countries, including China. Several bills were introduced, such as H.R. 782 and H.R. 2942, to address alleged foreign exchange-rate manipulation by China and define it as a countervailable subsidy. In the 111th Congress, bills like H.R. 496 and H.R. 499 sought to apply countervailing duties to nonmarket economies without regard to ownership or subsidy source. The subsidy is provided on the manufacture, production, or export of merchandise, regardless of the country's economic status. The bills aim to prevent the ITA from considering market economy treatment for individual businesses in AD proceedings, and provide a China-specific methodology for determining subsidy amounts. The bill aims to prevent the ITA from considering market economy treatment for individual businesses in AD proceedings and provides a China-specific methodology for identifying and calculating subsidy amounts, taking into account the possibility that Chinese terms and conditions may not be applicable as appropriate benchmarks. If China is designated as a nonmarket economy country, authorities are directed to adjust for Chinese terms and conditions, but if not practicable, they may use terms prevailing outside of China. If China is considered an NME country, special difficulties are presumed, making it impracticable to adjust for Chinese terms and conditions. The bills aim to amend current law regarding China's nonmarket economy status and subsidies. The Bush Administration took steps in 2006 to address China's alleged subsidies, including initiating a CVD investigation and consultations in the WTO. In a CVD investigation on CFS paper against China, the ITC preliminarily determined that a U.S. domestic industry is materially injured by allegedly subsidized coated paper from China. The ITA also made an affirmative preliminary determination of subsidy, with net countervailable subsidy rates ranging from 10.9% to 20.35%. The final determination by the ITA confirmed that countervailable subsidies are being provided to producers and exporters of coated free sheet (CFS) paper. Subsidies ranging from 7.40% to 44.25% are provided to producers and exporters of coated free sheet (CFS) paper from China. The ITA noted China's significant state involvement in the economy despite economic reforms. China's economy is different from Soviet-style economies, with government control over investment decisions, money allocation, wage bill, and access to foreign currency. The ITA found that market forces determine prices for over 90% of products in China, wages are negotiated, foreign currency access is easier, and private ownership rights are recognized by the government. Despite being an NME country, China's economy allows the agency to assess benefits to Chinese producers. The ITC announced a negative determination of injury in investigations on CFS paper from China and Indonesia. Factors considered include production capacity, potential for product shifting, price effects, inventories, and impact on domestic industry. It was concluded that material injury will not occur without antidumping and countervailing duty orders against imports from China and Indonesia. The ITC issued a final negative CVD determination on imports from China and Indonesia, concluding that the domestic CFSP industry is not threatened with material injury. The ITA was able to measure subsidies in China, leading to countervailing duties being placed on 13 products from China. On January 9, 2007, China filed suit to prevent the ITA from continuing the CVD investigation. The Court ruled it lacked jurisdiction due to no final determination. China requested WTO dispute settlement consultations on CFS paper duties. China has been active in using AD investigations against products from the US and other countries since joining the WTO. In 2009, China initiated its first CVD case and had ongoing investigations on US products in 2010. The US requested WTO dispute settlement consultations with China over alleged illegal subsidies in 2007. China agreed to terminate one of the challenged subsidy programs in March 2007. The United States requested WTO dispute settlement consultations with China in 2007 over alleged illegal subsidies, including tax laws and measures providing advantages to Chinese businesses. The USTR stated that these subsidies can distort trade conditions for U.S. manufacturers and inhibit exports to China. China agreed to terminate all subsidies in November 2007. China agreed to terminate all subsidies alleged to be illegal under WTO rules by January 1, 2008. They signed MOUs with the United States and Mexico to eliminate prohibited subsidies. In 2010, the USTR confirmed that China had eliminated the subsidies. In 2008, the US requested consultations with China over export-contingent benefits, leading to a settlement in 2009 where China confirmed the elimination of these benefits. Despite the ITA's ability to identify subsidies in China, some remain. Congress may want to consider legislation ensuring that the CVD laws and actions specifically apply to other NME countries as well as China, such as Vietnam. The amount of trade with other NME countries is not significant, and there are no outstanding trade disputes with them. There are no specific methodologies provided for identifying subsidies in nonmarket economies. Making CVD procedures available to U.S. industries has its challenges. AD duties tend to be higher than countervailing duties, especially on imports from nonmarket economy countries. The use of the third-country data methodology can result in higher AD duties. If China retains its NME status and subsidies are found on targeted merchandise, some AD duties may need to be revised downward to avoid double counting. This introduces uncertainty about the total level of protection applied to Chinese products. ITA's determination to target subsidies in China or amend legislation could lead to lower combined rates than expected, potentially reducing overall protection. However, different remedies for price manipulation may allow some U.S. industries to obtain relief through CVD procedures."
