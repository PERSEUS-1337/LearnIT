    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Police Gun Buyback Assistance Act\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings. Congress finds that decommissioned firearms once used by law enforcement agencies have been involved in over 3,000 crimes in the past 9 years, including 293 homicides, 301 assaults, and 279 drug-related crimes. Additionally, white supremacist Buford Furrow used a Glock pistol decommissioned by a law enforcement agency in Washington to shoot children at a Jewish community center in Los Angeles and kill a postal worker. Twelve firearms stolen from the Miami-Dade Police Department have been traced to crimes in Chicago, including a shooting near a playground. Many State and local law enforcement departments also resell firearms that were previously used. The Act aims to reduce the circulation of decommissioned firearms used in crimes by preventing their transfer to individuals. Law enforcement agencies in various states have started destroying these firearms to curb their resale. SEC. 3. PROGRAM AUTHORIZED. The Attorney General may provide grants to States or local governments to purchase new firearms and destroy decommissioned firearms. To be eligible for a grant, a State or local government must have a policy that prohibits transferring decommissioned firearms to individuals and mandates their destruction, with an exception for transfer to law enforcement agencies. The Attorney General provides grants to States or local governments to purchase new firearms and destroy decommissioned firearms. Grant recipients must only use funds to buy new firearms and can transfer decommissioned firearms only to law enforcement agencies. To apply for a grant under this Act, the chief executive of a State or unit of local government must submit an application to the Attorney General with required information. Regulations for the grants are also outlined. SEC. 5.
