    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Recent public opinion research in California shows that residents, regardless of political party or income level, are concerned about the costs of aging. Two-thirds of respondents worry about affording long-term care, with 63% expressing equal concern for long-term care costs as for future healthcare. A majority cannot afford more than three months of nursing home care at $6,000 per month, and 40% cannot afford even a single month. Among Latino voters, 88% lack long-term care insurance or are unsure about coverage for services like in-home care, highlighting widespread financial worries across income levels and political affiliations. The Legislature aims to establish a task force to explore creating a culturally competent statewide insurance program for long-term care services. The Long Term Care Insurance Task Force will be created in the Department of Insurance to design and implement the program, consisting of nine members including the commissioner and representatives from relevant departments appointed by the Governor. The Long Term Care Insurance Task Force will consist of nine members appointed by various entities, including a certified actuary, a health policy expert, a long-term care provider association representative, a senior or consumer organization representative, an employee representative from a long-term care worker organization, and a member from the long-term care insurance industry. Task force members will not receive compensation, and meetings will be subject to the Bagley-Keene Open Meeting Act. The task force's responsibilities include exploring the creation of a culturally competent statewide insurance program for long-term care services. The Long Term Care Insurance Task Force will explore designing a statewide long-term care insurance program to provide options for insuring against costs related to disability. This includes examining program design, eligibility, benefits, financing, and integration with Medi-Cal. Consideration will be given to incorporating the program into the state disability insurance structure and potentially funding it through a payroll tax increase. The Long Term Care Insurance Task Force is exploring a statewide program for working adults to make voluntary premium contributions for long-term care insurance. The program would include mandatory enrollment with a voluntary opt-out option and provide basic insurance benefits for those with functional or cognitive limitations. It aims to help individuals remain in their communities by purchasing nonmedical services and offset costs for adults with chronic conditions. Coordination with existing private health care coverage benefits will be evaluated. The Long Term Care Insurance Task Force in California is considering ways to prepare the workforce for the growing demand in long-term care. They are also looking into establishing a joint public and private system to make long-term care accessible to more individuals. Recommendations will be made regarding regulatory provisions for accessing existing and future long-term care insurance programs. The department and participating governmental agencies will operate within their existing budgetary resources for implementation. The task force will recommend options for a statewide long-term care insurance program in a report due by July 1, 2017. An actuarial report on the recommendations must be produced by July 1, 2018, to ensure a solvent program. The commissioner may seek private funds for implementation. The commissioner may seek private funds for implementing this section, which will be in effect until January 1, 2019, unless extended by a later statute enacted before that date."
