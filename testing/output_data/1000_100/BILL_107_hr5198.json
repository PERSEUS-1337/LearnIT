    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Premier Certified Lenders Program Improvement Act of 2002\". The Premier Certified Lenders Program (PCLP) has successfully helped small businesses expand. Increasing the number of premier certified lenders will provide more resources to small businesses as the Small Business Administration downsizes. Requiring premier certified lenders to maintain unnecessarily large loss reserve accounts limits their ability to serve additional small businesses. Premier certified lenders should be required to adjust their loss reserve account requirements. Premier certified lenders should maintain loss reserve accounts based on the risk of loss associated with PCLP loans to protect taxpayers and support small businesses in economic development. Premier certified lenders are required to maintain loss reserve accounts for PCLP loans to mitigate risk and support small businesses in economic development. Additionally, an alternative loss reserve is available for certain premier certified lenders. Premier certified lenders can elect an alternative loss reserve option instead of the standard requirements for contributions to their high loss reserve PCL. Premier certified lenders can choose an alternative loss reserve option, where they must make necessary contributions before the end of the quarter to ensure their loss reserve is at least $25,000 and sufficient to protect the Federal Government from the risk of loss. Premier certified lenders can opt for a qualified high loss reserve PCL to protect the government from the risk of loss associated with their PCLP loan portfolio. The company must have a loss reserve of at least $25,000 and a process for analyzing and grading the risk of loss for each PCLP loan. Premier certified lenders can choose a qualified high loss reserve PCL to safeguard the government from loan-related risks. The company must have a certified auditor confirm the adequacy of the loss reserve quarterly. The company's loss reserve must be certified as sufficient to protect the Federal Government from risks associated with PCLP loans. The term 'PCLP loan' refers to any loan guaranteed under this section, and the term 'calendar quarter' is defined as specific periods throughout the year. The Small Business Investment Act of 1958 is amended to specify periods for loan guarantees, and a conforming amendment is made to Section 508(b)(2)(D)."
