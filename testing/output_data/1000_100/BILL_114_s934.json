    "content": "The \"Phantom Fuel Reform Act\" may be cited as the short title. It includes a requirement for cellulosic biofuel. The \"Phantom Fuel Reform Act\" requires the provision of estimates for cellulosic biofuel production volumes under the Clean Air Act. The \"Phantom Fuel Reform Act\" mandates the provision of estimates for cellulosic biofuel production volumes by each facility producing cellulosic biofuel during the current calendar year. The \"Phantom Fuel Reform Act\" requires facilities to determine the average monthly volume of cellulosic biofuel produced based on actual production during a specific period. Based on the average monthly production volume, facilities determine the annualized cellulosic biofuel production for the current year. Facilities calculate annual cellulosic biofuel production based on monthly volumes, starting production after January 1 of the current year. The average monthly volume of cellulosic biofuel produced by a facility is determined based on the actual volume produced from the date of initial production until October 31. The average monthly volume of cellulosic biofuel produced by a facility is determined based on the actual volume produced from the date of initial production until October 31 of the current calendar year. The estimated annual volume of cellulosic biofuel production for a facility is determined based on the average monthly production volume up to October 31 of the current year. The estimated annual volume of cellulosic biofuel production for facilities is calculated based on monthly production up to October 31 of the current year. Total production estimates for the following year are the sum of projected volumes from all cellulosic biofuel production facilities. Amendments in the Clean Air Act reduce the applicable volume based on certain criteria. Amendments in the Clean Air Act modify the definition of cellulosic biofuel by specifying the use of exact volume and changing \"may\" to \"shall\" in certain instances. The term \"cellulosic biofuel\" excludes compressed natural gas, liquefied natural gas, or electricity from biogas used for electric vehicles. The Clean Air Act amendments redefine cellulosic biofuel to include biogas from specific sources like landfills, wastewater treatment facilities, and agricultural digesters. The EPA's final rule regulates existing and new cellulosic biofuel pathways. The EPA will reissue a rule to align with Clean Air Act amendments regarding cellulosic biofuel pathways. The mandate for cellulosic biofuel volume in 2014 is removed."
