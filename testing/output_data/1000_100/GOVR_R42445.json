    "content": "Surface transportation authorization acts fund federal highway and mass transit programs, safety, research, and some rail programs. The most recent authorization, SAFETEA-LU, expired in 2009, leading to a series of extension acts and resolutions due to budget constraints. The highway trust fund, funded by gasoline and diesel taxes, has seen declining revenues in recent years. The decline in Highway Trust Fund (HTF) revenue is attributed to the economy and improved vehicle fuel efficiency. The ongoing debate focuses on passing a multi-year bill without cutting infrastructure spending, raising the gas tax, or increasing the budget deficit. Other issues being discussed include alternative finance, tolling, public-private partnerships, project delivery acceleration, and performance management. The question of equity in federal spending distribution among states remains unresolved due to forecasted revenues. The Senate passed MAP-21 on March 14, 2012. The Senate passed MAP-21, a two-year bill reauthorizing surface transportation programs. H.R. 7, a five-year bill with a total authorization of $260 billion, includes provisions to increase oil and gas production for highway infrastructure funding. Controversially, it discontinues funding mass transit with HTF revenues. The House passed the Surface Transportation Extension Act of 2012, Part II (H.R. 4348) to extend surface transportation authorizations through the end of FY2012. The Senate later replaced the House language with MAP-21, leading to a conference between the two chambers. The House passed the Surface Transportation Extension Act of 2012, Part II (H.R. 4348) to extend surface transportation authorizations through the end of FY2012. The Senate replaced the House language with MAP-21, enabling the measure to go to conference. Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman John Mica will negotiate involving the entire substance of H.R. 7 and provisions of the extension bill. Surface transportation reauthorization is complex due to multiple committees' jurisdictions. The highway trust fund is financed by various sources, with 90% of revenue coming from excise taxes on motor fuels. The Highway Trust Fund (HTF) is primarily funded by excise taxes on motor fuels, with 90% of revenue coming from gasoline and diesel taxes. The fund is divided into highway and mass transit accounts, with the highway account receiving 15.44 cents per gallon of gasoline tax and the mass transit account receiving 2.86 cents. Due to stagnant fuel tax rates since 1993 and factors like economic downturns and improved fuel efficiency, revenues have fallen below projections, requiring transfers from the general fund to cover expenses. The Congressional Budget Office projects a shortfall in the Highway Trust Fund, with a gap of $8-9 billion per year through FY2022. The mass transit account is also expected to face a shortfall by the end of FY2014. Without an increase in fuel taxes, authorizers are challenged in moving reauthorization legislation. The Highway Program faces funding challenges due to a shortfall in the Highway Trust Fund. Policymakers must find new revenue sources for transportation or settle for a smaller program. State DOTs manage the program but must adhere to federal guidelines. The state DOTs oversee project development and construction for federally funded highway projects, which require a local matching share. The state/local match is typically 10% for Interstate System projects and 20% for other roads. FHWA manages the Highway Program with terms like distribution of funds, apportionment, allocation, and reimbursement. States receive federal funds notification for four years, and reimbursement occurs after project approval and costs are incurred. The reimbursable nature of the highway program helps prevent waste, fraud, and abuse. Contract authority allows for obligation without an appropriation, committing the federal government to reimburse the state for project costs. Limitation on obligations (ObLim) controls annual spending, setting a cap on contract authority. There are two categories of programs: formula and. The ObLim is similar to an appropriation and controls annual spending for highway programs. Formula programs allocate funds annually among states based on specific factors, while discretionary programs are smaller and allocated by FHWA or Congress. The majority of federal-aid highway money is apportioned to state DOTs through core formula programs like IM, NHS, STP, HBP, CMAQ. These programs receive about 80% of SAFETEA's contract authority and fund most federal-aid highway projects. The Highway Program funding includes various core programs like Bridge Program, Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program, Highway Safety Improvement Program, and Equity Bonus Program. Each program has its own formula to determine state apportionment. State DOTs can transfer funds between programs, reducing the importance of funding formulas. Some argue that the program structure limits flexibility in using federal highway funds. The Equity Bonus Program ensures each state receives a minimum share of funds from the largest highway program. It dilutes the policy rationales of core program formulas. Smaller discretionary highway programs are also part of the Federal-Aid Highway Program, earmarked by Congress during SAFETEA. These programs allocate funds to projects through competition. The Federal Transit Administration administers various federal transit programs with different funding amounts and distribution mechanisms. Four main programs in SAFETEA account for 85% of authorized transit funding, with two programs distributing funds by formula. The Urbanized Area Formula Program in SAFETEA provides funding for urbanized areas with populations of 50,000 or more, covering expenses like capital, planning, transit enhancements, and operations. Fixed Guideway Modernization Program funds are mainly for replacing and rehabilitating transit rail system assets. New Starts Program offers competitive funding for new fixed guideway systems and extensions, including projects for busways, bus rapid transit, ferries, and automated guideway. The Small Starts program in SAFETEA funds projects with a total cost of $250 million or less, with a federal share of $75 million or less. Bus Program funds are used to purchase buses and related equipment, as well as for building facilities like administrative and maintenance buildings, transfer facilities, bus shelters, and park-and-ride stations. Various smaller funding programs are also available, including the Rural Formula Program, Jobs Access and Reverse Commute (JARC) program, Elderly and Disabilities grants program, and the New Freedom program. Highway transportation is the leading cause of transportation-related fatalities and injuries in the United States. States have the primary responsibility for highway safety and Congress has established federal highway safety programs to assist them. Three DOT agencies administer these programs: NHTSA focuses on driver behavior and vehicle safety, FMCSA on commercial driver qualifications and vehicle safety, and FHWA through the Highway Safety Improvement Program. NHTSA, FMCSA, and FHWA are DOT agencies that administer federal highway safety programs. NHTSA provides grants to states for traffic safety efforts, regulates motor vehicle safety, and oversees federal grant funds. States must submit highway safety plans approved by NHTSA to receive funds. NHTSA also offers training and technical assistance to states through various grant programs. FMCSA administers safety grant programs for commercial motor vehicles, including truck and motor coach operations. It promotes safety through regulation, enforcement, and training to reduce traffic fatalities and injuries. The Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP) allocates federal funding to states based on road lane-miles, vehicle miles traveled, and traffic fatalities to improve roadway design and operation. States receive a minimum of 0.5% of the program's funding, with set-asides for railway-highway grade crossing hazard elimination and high-risk rural road improvements. SAFETEA extended funding protections through budget categories to prevent diversion of funds for other purposes. SAFETEA established \"fire walls\" to protect funds from being used elsewhere and guaranteed annual funding levels. The Budget Enforcement Act's firewalls ended in 2002, but SAFETEA's protections were honored. The House rules prevented setting lower funding levels until they were eliminated in the 112th Congress. RABA allows for adjustments to funding levels based on actual highway account receipts. Despite fluctuations in annual highway receipts, Congress has never reduced spending based on RABA calculations. Recent years have seen revenues below guarantee levels, but general fund transfers have supplemented the Highway Trust Fund. However, there may still be consideration for aligning spending with receipts in reauthorization. The Budget Control Act mandates sequestration if a joint committee fails to agree on spending cuts. The Budget Control Act's \"Super Committee\" failed to reach an agreement on spending reductions in November 2011. Exemptions to the sequester process mean that surface transportation spending beyond FY2012 would not be significantly reduced. Various surface transportation programs and activities are exempted from sequestration, but $739 million of annual contract authority may be subject to sequester. The obligation limitation and Federal Transit Administration's New Starts program are subject to sequester. SAFETEA expired in 2009, and surface transportation programs have been operating on extension legislation. The House-passed STEA-II extends the HTF and federal surface transportation programs until September 2012. The Senate replaced the House language with MAP-21, sending the measure to conference. The negotiation between the Senate and House involves the surface transportation bills MAP-21 and STEA-II. Chairman John Mica states that the entire substance of H.R. 7 will be part of the discussion. Provisions in conference proposals must align with the differences between the House and Senate versions. Any out-of-scope provisions in conference reports may face points of order in both chambers. The Senate rules allow for waiving points of order on conference reports with the support of 60 Senators. STEA-II includes provisions unrelated to surface transportation programs, such as the North American Energy Access Act and the transfer of permitting authority for the Keystone XL pipeline. The bill establishes the Gulf Coast Restoration Trust Fund, financed by 80% of Deepwater Horizon-related penalties under the Clean Water Act. Revenue distribution requires a future act of Congress, unlike the Senate-passed version. The Senate-passed version of H.R. 4348 includes language similar to S. 1400, requiring budgetary resources to equal receipts credited to the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund for harbor maintenance programs. Title V adds the Coal Residuals Reuse and Management Act to the bill, authorizing states to implement coal combustion residuals permit programs. Title VI includes provisions from H.R. 7 for accelerating transportation project delivery, with differences in years authorized and regulatory changes between the House and Senate bills. Both bills aim to expedite project delivery and reduce highway programs without earmarks. MAP-21 is a two-year reauthorization bill that aims to expedite project delivery and reduce highway programs by two-thirds. It includes a total Federal-Aid Highway Program authorization of $39.5 billion for FY2012 and $40.5 billion for FY2013, with $400 million allocated for research and education each fiscal year. The bill eliminates formula factors under individual programs and apportions funds to states based on their past allocations, guaranteeing a 95% return on each state's payments to the Highway Trust Fund. The MAP-21 reauthorization bill aims to expedite project delivery and reduce highway programs by two-thirds. It eliminates individual program formulas, ensuring a 95% return on each state's payments to the Highway Trust Fund. This change reduces federal and congressional influence on program direction and project selection, shifting focus to federal planning, performance management, and project eligibility requirements. Transferability between core programs is limited to 20% of each formula program's apportionment. The MAP-21 reauthorization bill aims to reduce highway programs by two-thirds, shifting program eligibility to core programs and eliminating many discretionary grant programs. The Transportation Enhancements Program is merged into the CMAQ program, with some changes to project eligibility. A National Freight Program is introduced to increase funding for freight projects, and the TIFIA program funding is significantly increased. The bill is mostly silent on tolling of federally funded roads. The House bill H.R. 7 is a five-year reauthorization bill with modest increases for federal-aid highways and funding for research and education. It consolidates programs, reduces the number of distinct programs by two-thirds, and includes the Equity Bonus program providing a 94% state rate of return. The House bill H.R. 7 includes the Equity Bonus program, renaming the Mass Transit Account to the Alternative Transportation Account, redirecting fuel taxes to the Highway Account, and changing NEPA requirements for federal highway and transit projects. TIFIA funding would also increase nearly ten-fold. MAP-21 provisions include $10.458 billion annually for FY2012-FY2013 for transit programs, with funding from the HTF and general fund. It creates the State of Good Repair program, eliminates the Bus and Bus Facilities program, and modifies the New Starts process. H.R. 7 authorizes $10.458 billion for FY2012 and $10.498 billion annually for FY2013 through FY2016. H.R. 7 provisions include renaming the Mass Transit Account to the Alternative Transportation Account (ATA), funding it with $40 billion from the general fund. It eliminates various programs and combines others into a single program. MAP-21 includes provisions for a national rail plan and a rolling stock equipment pool for corridor intercity passenger services. The bill includes provisions for funding corridor intercity passenger services, positive train control implementation, and amendments to the Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing Program for freight rail. It also addresses laws affecting rail freight enforced by the Surface Transportation Board and aims to close the gap between projected revenues and total authorizations. The Senate bill extends highway-related taxes and trust fund expenditure authority. The bill includes provisions to raise revenue for the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) through FY2013, totaling $13.872 billion over ten-and-a-half fiscal years. This includes transfers from various sources such as the Leaking Underground Storage Tank (LUST) trust fund, Gas Guzzler Tax, revocation of passports for tax delinquents, Medicare provider payments, future import tariffs on automotive products, and a change in tax treatment of securities. The bill includes provisions to raise revenue for the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) through various sources such as the Leaking Underground Storage Tank (LUST) trust fund, Gas Guzzler Tax, revocation of passports for tax delinquents, Medicare provider payments, future import tariffs on automotive products, and changes in tax treatment of securities, resulting in a total of $13.872 billion over ten-and-a-half fiscal years. Additionally, revenue is generated from other sources including the clarification that the Internal Revenue Service may levy a federal employee's Thrift Savings Account to satisfy tax liabilities, extension for transfers of excess pension assets to retiree health accounts, pension funding stabilization, and allowing federal agencies to offer phased retirement. The revenue provisions in the bill include measures such as raising funds from various sources like the LUST trust fund, Gas Guzzler Tax, revocation of passports for tax delinquents, and Medicare provider payments. Other revenue sources include changes in tax treatment of securities, allowing the IRS to levy a federal employee's Thrift Savings Account for tax liabilities, pension funding stabilization, and phased retirement offered by federal agencies. These provisions have raised concerns as they exceed the amount needed to offset the HTF revenue and MAP-21 spending levels, potentially allowing for deficit reduction or increased spending. The Finance Committee reported favorably on provisions costing money, including changes to the Small Issuer Exception, bonds not treated as tax preference, extension of employer-provided benefits exclusion, and exemption of private activity bonds for water facilities. The Senate bill also includes authorization for states to issue TRIP for transportation. The Senate bill includes provisions for TRIP bonds through state infrastructure banks and changes to the depreciation period for highway leases. It aims to make highway privatization less attractive to private investors by extending the amortization period for toll collection rights. The Senate bill proposes changes to highway privatization, including extending the amortization period for toll collection rights and utilizing the LUST trust fund as a new revenue source for the highway trust fund. The LUST trust fund was established in 1986 to address groundwater contamination from leaking underground storage tanks. It is funded by a 0.1 cent per gallon excise tax on gasoline and diesel fuels. The fund supports environmental contamination investigation, cleanup programs, and UST leak prevention. States use the fund for oversight, enforcement, and corrective actions. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 expanded its scope. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 expanded state and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency responsibilities and authorized the use of trust fund monies for UST leak prevention and cleanup programs. Out of 501,000 releases from leaking petroleum tanks, 85% have been addressed, leaving 88,000 releases requiring cleanup. The LUST trust fund had a balance of $3.392 billion in FY2012, with estimated interest and tax receipts. Congress has appropriated approximately $113 million annually from the trust fund, with states receiving 80% as grants. EPA uses the remainder for its responsibilities. The LUST trust fund, with a balance of $3.392 billion in FY2012, receives appropriations for UST leak prevention and cleanup programs. States receive 80% of the annual appropriation as grants, while the remainder is used by EPA. The Senate bill proposes transferring $3.0 billion from the LUST trust fund to the highway trust fund in FY2012, with future transfers estimated to provide $3.685 billion to the highway trust fund over ten years. The LUST trust fund expenditure authority is set to expire on March 31, 2012. The LUST trust fund expenditure authority is set to expire on March 31, 2012, but the Senate bill aims to extend it through September 30, 2013. H.R. 7 includes provisions to reauthorize HTF expenditure authority through FY2016 and extend existing highway taxes through FY2018. The bill also requires future transfers from the general fund to the HTF to be fully offset in both budget authority and outlays. The bill seeks to fill two gaps with revenue increases or offsets: the difference between highway account revenues and authorized levels, and $40 billion for the proposed alternative transportation account. H.R. 7 would extend the LUST trust fund until October 1, 2016, and direct federal revenues from energy leasing into the Highway Trust Fund. The House approved energy leasing and production provisions on February 16, 2012, under a rule specifying their incorporation into H.R. 7. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act governs offshore energy development, administered by the Department of the Interior. The program allows leasing for oil and gas development in federal ocean areas, generating significant federal receipts. The National Historic Preservation Fund receives a $150 million annual allocation, while the mass transit account of the HTF is renamed the alternative transportation account with a one-time appropriation of $40 billion. Additionally, federal receipts from certain submerged acreage are permanently appropriated to states, with Gulf Coast states receiving additional funds from specified leases. Title XVI, Federal Employee Retirement, provides offsetting revenues for the $40 billion in general fund revenues provided to the alternative transportation account over the life of the bill. MAP-21 proposes total authorizations of $80.8 billion over two years, under the Highway and Research titles of the bill. The bill guarantees a state share based on SAFETEA and a 95 cent return on each dollar paid to the highway account. It includes a provision to assure the solvency of the highway account of the HTF. The Treasury will estimate if the highway account balance will drop below $2 billion in FY2012 or $1 billion in FY2013. If so, the FY2012 ObLim will be reduced to prevent this and states' distribution adjusted accordingly. This provision aims to address the pending HTF shortfall under MAP-21 spending levels and ensure spending stays within HTF means. It may also increase pressure to find additional revenue sources. The ratchet mechanism in H.R. 7 could face resistance in Congress due to past negative RABA calculations. Despite a $4.4 billion downward adjustment in funding levels for the highway program in FY2003, Congress overrode the reductions by using the positive balance in the HTF. H.R. 7 proposes a $205 billion federal-aid highway program authorization over five years, with specific obligation limitations for each fiscal year. H.R. 7 proposes an Alternative Transportation Account with an additional obligation limitation of $2.7 billion annually for FY2013-FY2016. It includes a modified Equity Bonus Program ensuring each state receives at least 94% of the motor fuel taxes paid into the HTF. The bill also funds various highway programs such as CMAQ, Ferry Boats, Puerto Rico Highways, and Territorial Highway Program. The total program authorization is capped at $3.9 billion per year. The House bill, H.R. 7, proposes an Alternative Transportation Account with an additional obligation limitation of $2.7 billion annually for FY2013-FY2016. It allows expanded tolling of the Interstate system, with federal government participation in projects to add lanes and convert highways to toll facilities. H.R. 7 does not include earmarks and sets state apportionments for major programs according to a single methodology. MAP-21 does not set core programs' authorization levels individually, but determines state apportionments for all programs collectively. The MAP-21 bill determines state apportionments for major programs by multiplying the total amount available for apportionment by each state's share of total nationwide apportionments and allocations received for FY2005-FY2009. Adjustments are made to ensure each state's combined apportionments will not be less than 95% of estimated tax payments made by highway users. Additionally, funds are set aside for the new CMAQ program based on each state's CMAQ percentage of total apportionments for FY2009. The new CMAQ program determines state apportionments based on a state's apportionment under Title 23 Section 134 for FY2009. The remaining amount is divided among core programs: 58% for NHPP, 29.3% for TMP, 7% for HSIP, and 5.7% for NFP. Further adjustments are made based on privatized highway lane miles and vehicle miles traveled on privatized highways. The FHWA's new CMAQ program adjusts state apportionments based on privatized highway lane miles and vehicle miles traveled. This results in reduced apportionments for Illinois, Indiana, and Colorado, while increasing apportionments for all other states. The adjustments range from 0.045% to 4.375%, with a total increase of 0.115% for other states. Table 5 displays dollar amounts for programmatic split, addressing concerns about equitable federal highway spending. MAP-21 aims to resolve donor-donee issue upfront by determining initial state amounts based on funding share from FY2005-FY2009. While there is no explicit equity program, an adjustment mechanism ensures states receive at least a 95% return on payments to the HTF. The nationwide rate of return for FY2005-FY2009 was $1.23 on the dollar, likely lifting all donor states above the 95% level. The adjustment process to guarantee a 95% return on payments to the HTF may be necessary if Congress does not provide sufficient funding. Some states prefer using the state return on payments rather than the state share of total FY2005-FY2009 funding to determine the initial amount due to earmarking legacy issues. SAFETEA included a high number of earmarks valued at $24.3 billion, with 67% being \"below the line\" earmarks that did not bring additional money to receiving states. The SAFETEA legislation included a high number of earmarks valued at $24.3 billion, with most being \"below the line\" earmarks that did not increase funding for receiving states. However, states that did well in obtaining \"above the line\" earmarks benefited from higher base amounts under extensions. MAP-21 does not have project earmarks, but the apportionment calculation is based on the state's share of both apportioned and allocated funding for FY2005-FY2009, resulting in states with previous earmark success receiving higher apportionment shares. MAP-21 reduces funding programs and absorbs their eligibilities into core programs, leading to overlapping eligibility areas. The five core programs plus metropolitan transportation planning would be authorized at $39.143 billion for FY2012 and $39.806 billion for FY2013. The NHPP would receive $20.5 billion for FY2012 and $21 billion for FY2013 to improve the National Highway System. The NHPP program combines three SAFETEA core programs to improve the National Highway System, focusing on achieving national performance goals for infrastructure condition, safety, mobility, and freight movement. It includes projects for highway segments, bridges, tunnels, ferry facilities, bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure, traffic monitoring, intelligent transportation systems, and environmental restoration within NHS corridors. The NHPP program focuses on system maintenance and improving federal-aid highways and bridges on public roads. States must develop asset management plans with performance metrics. Funds may be transferred if bridge conditions fall below minimum standards. The program replaces SAFETEA's Surface Transportation Program, excluding the TE set-aside, shifting to the enhanced CMAQ program. The Transportation Enhancement (TE) program shifts to the enhanced CMAQ program, while also maintaining eligibility for Transportation Mobility Program (TMP) funds. TMP funds, totaling approximately $10.5 billion annually for FY2012 and FY2013, can be used for various transportation projects including transit, carpool programs, congestion pricing, recreational trails, and more. Additionally, TMP funds can be used for natural habitat and wetlands mitigation efforts related to transportation projects under Title 23 U.S.C. TMP funds can be used for maintenance and improvement of public roads near international borders with federally owned vehicle traffic. States may face penalties if deficient bridge deck area increases. Funds are sub-apportioned within states based on population distribution in different areas. The Appalachian Development Highway System program would be eliminated, but its routes and access roads remain eligible under TMP. Under MAP-21, the CMAQ program would be expanded to absorb discontinued programs like Transportation Enhancements, Safe Routes to Schools, and Recreational Trails. Funding for CMAQ would increase to roughly $3.3 billion annually, with eligibility expanded to include demand-shifting projects. HSIP would remain largely unchanged, supporting safety improvements for road infrastructure. The Hazardous Locations Improvement Program (HSIP) would receive roughly $2.5 billion annually for FY2012 and FY2013, focusing on dangerous intersections and road improvements. The High Risk Rural Roads Program and Rail-Highway Grade Crossing Program would be eliminated, with project eligibilities retained. The National Freight Program (NFP) would be a new initiative funded at approximately $2 billion annually for FY2012 and FY2013, aimed at enhancing the national freight network. MAP-21 would reduce the maximum percentage of funding that states can transfer between programs from 50% to 20%, with restrictions on certain transfers. H.R. 7 proposes changes to transportation funding programs, including consolidating or eliminating some programs. It retains core program structures but expands the National Highway System Program and Surface Transportation Program. The Interstate Maintenance program would be folded into the National Highway System Program, and the Highway Safety Improvement Program would be kept. The 10% set-aside for Transportation Enhancements is eliminated. Eligibilities of absorbed or eliminated programs continue under the new proposal. The bill, H.R. 7, proposes changes to transportation funding programs by consolidating or eliminating some programs. The core highway programs would receive $150.7 billion in funding from the Highway Trust Fund for FY2013 through FY2016. An additional $8 billion is allocated for the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program. H.R. 7 would expand the National Highway System Program to cover maintenance and repair of the Interstate Highway system and bridges on the NHS. Only facilities on the NHS would be eligible for funding. Under H.R. 7, the Surface Transportation Program (STP) would receive $42.4 billion for FY2013-FY2014. The program's purpose would be broadened to include the construction, inspection, rehabilitation, and replacement of bridges and tunnels of all classifications. The bill would eliminate the requirement for 10% of STP funds to be set aside for transportation enhancement purposes. Only facilities on the National Highway System would be eligible for funding. H.R. 7 would allocate $10.4 billion for FY2013-FY2014 for the Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP). States must have their own safety programs and plans to receive HSIP funds, consulting with stakeholders to set safety goals and identify projects. H.R. 7 would allocate $8 billion over FY2013-FY2014 for the proposed alternative transportation account for CMAQ, with a federal cost share of 90%. Each state would receive a minimum 94% return in core program apportionments on highway taxes. The total authorization is $15.6 billion over two years, with a limit of $3.9 billion per year for the guarantee. The SAFETEA program had an initial estimate of needing $40.9 billion in contract authority, with a guarantee of $3.9 billion per year. If the annual amount is insufficient to bring states up to 94%, the STP authorization would be decreased. The Senate bill clarifies eligibility criteria for ER funds, stating that roads already closed or scheduled for construction at the time of a disaster are not eligible. ER funds can only be used on federal-aid highways, with U.S. territories limited to $20 million per year. The $100 million ceiling on natural disasters or catastrophic failures in a state would be eliminated. Section 1506 adjusts the 180-day emergency period for federal repair cost coverage. The Secretary of Transportation may allow 100% federal share for repairs exceeding state apportionment. H.R. 7 defines \"comparable facility\" for maximum project costs. Debris removal reimbursement is limited to costs not covered by the Stafford Act. U.S. territories would not receive more than $20 million per year. The Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act limits U.S. territories to $20 million per fiscal year. Assistance requires a declaration of emergency, with states providing project lists and costs within two years. ER funding is extended to federal lands highways and tribal roads. The Senate bill proposes restructuring Federal Lands Highways Programs into the Federal Lands and Tribal Transportation Program, with funding set at $450 million for the Tribal Transportation Program and $550 million for other federal lands programs annually. The Tribal Transportation Program would receive $465 million annually, while the Federal Lands Transportation program would receive $535 million annually. The Senate bill combines the Puerto Rico and Territorial Highway programs, funding them at $180 million annually. The THP would receive a 25% set-aside each year, totaling $45 million annually for Guam, American Samoa, the Northern Marianas, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Puerto Rico would receive a 75% per year set-aside, amounting to $135 million annually. Puerto Rico's set-aside is limited to specific program eligibilities. H.R. 7 authorizes the Puerto Rico Highway Program at $150 million annually and the Territorial Highway Program at $50 million annually for FY2013-FY2016. The Senate bill incorporates the ADHS into the new Transportation Mobility Program and increases the federal share payable for highway construction costs. H.R. 7 proposes to increase the federal share for constructing highways on the Appalachian Development Highway System to 95% under certain conditions. The program would be authorized at $470 million per year for FY2013-FY2016, with funds available until expended. States can use toll credits for the local matching share. Funds would be apportioned based on cost estimates, with each state receiving between 1% and 25%. The Senate bill establishes a similar program with $1 billion budget authority for FY2013, requiring an appropriation before funds are available. The discretionary program aims to fund high-cost surface transportation projects with national and regional economic benefits. The Government Accountability Office will report on project selection within three years. H.R. 7 would repeal the SAFETEA PNRS provision, while the Senate bill would create a general fund program for Ferries and Ferry Terminal Facilities. States receiving funds are not designated under the new program. The proposed program would distribute funds based on various factors such as total passengers, vehicles carried per day, and route miles serviced by ferry systems. MAP-21 authorizes $67 million for each fiscal year FY2012 and FY2013, with funds requiring an appropriation. Ferry boats and facilities would be eligible for formula funds under the National Highway Performance Program. The House bill (H.R. 7, Section 1113) would modify the existing Ferry Boat and Ferry Terminal Facilities Program, funding it at $67 million for each year. The House bill H.R. 7 proposes a $67 million funding for the Facilities Program under 23 U.S.C. 147 for FY2013-FY2016. Funds would be distributed based on vehicles, passengers, and route miles serviced by ferry systems. Ferry boats and facilities on the National Highway System would also be eligible for formula funds. The Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) provides federal credit assistance for large transportation projects, with loans repaid through project-related user fees. MAP-21 proposes to increase TIFIA funding to $1 billion annually from the highway trust fund, with administrative costs capped at 1% and the remaining $990 million for loan subsidy costs. MAP-21 proposes significant changes to TIFIA, including increasing funding to $1 billion annually and allowing credit assistance for a program of projects secured by a common security pledge through a \"master credit agreement.\" This change is sought by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority to accelerate the financing of transit projects. The existing TIFIA threshold for eligible projects remains unchanged. MAP-21 proposes changes to TIFIA, including increasing funding to $1 billion annually and allowing credit assistance for projects. Rural infrastructure projects have a threshold of $25 million and receive loans at half the Treasury rate. 10% of TIFIA funds are reserved for rural projects, which are evaluated based on eligibility on a first-come, first-served basis. The MAP-21 and H.R. 7 bills propose changes to TIFIA, increasing funding to $1 billion annually. Projects would be evaluated based on eligibility on a first-come, first-served basis. Funding can be used for credit assistance or paid by project sponsors. Administrative costs are capped at $3.250 million in H.R. 7. H.R. 7 expands TIFIA assistance by introducing new thresholds for project eligibility, increasing federal assistance to 49%, and authorizing $750 million annually for state infrastructure banks. SAFETEA authorizes funding for freight programs within a larger surface transportation initiative. Most funding goes to states through regular highway programs, with limited funds dedicated to freight improvements. There is debate on whether a more focused federal effort towards funding freight is needed. The Senate bill (MAP-21) proposes a new dedicated funding program for freight transport, while the House bill (H.R. 7) does not include a similar program. The House bill (H.R. 7) does not include a dedicated funding program for freight transport, but it contains provisions that significantly impact freight transport. Both the Senate and House bills require the U.S. Department of Transportation to develop a national freight transport plan in consultation with stakeholders. Additionally, both bills aim to increase private-sector involvement in financing transportation improvements, which could enhance the roles of freight carriers and shippers in project planning and development. MAP-21 proposes a new core program to allocate funds to critical infrastructure segments for freight movement. The House bill (H.R. 7) does not have a dedicated funding program for freight transport but includes provisions impacting freight transport. It requires the U.S. Department of Transportation to develop a national freight transport plan in consultation with stakeholders. States would be guided to spend their freight program apportionment on the \"primary freight network\" (PFN) before other freight-related infrastructure. The Secretary of Transportation could designate additional roads to the PFN based on future importance to freight movement. States could designate \"critical rural freight corridors\" based on truck traffic density connecting to the PFN or Interstate System. The House bill (H.R. 7) requires states to prioritize spending their freight program funds on the \"primary freight network\" (PFN) before other infrastructure. The national freight network (NFM) includes critical rural freight corridors, portions of the Interstate System, and the PFN. States can also allocate funds for non-Interstate highways or transit projects that improve freight flows on nearby interstates. Additionally, states can use up to 10% of funds for freight rail or maritime projects if they provide significant improvements to freight flow and have a better return than highway projects on the PFN. The House bill (H.R. 7) prioritizes spending freight program funds on the \"primary freight network\" (PFN) over other infrastructure projects. This includes creating a specific funding program for freight movement and requiring states to develop performance measures. The PFN consists of about 30,000 miles of highway critical to freight movement. DOT estimates that congested segments, mostly at urban interchanges, cause trucks to travel below the speed limit or experience stop-and-go conditions during rush hours on certain highways. States may be reluctant to address costly bottlenecks that primarily benefit trucks. The House bill focuses on funding the \"primary freight network\" (PFN) and creating a specific funding program for freight movement. It does not alter truck size and weight limits but requires a study on possible changes. The bill also aims to rely more on tolling for highway construction, which is opposed by trucking organizations preferring fuel tax increases. Terminating the transfer of federal gas taxes to the mass transit trust fund in the House bill would free up funds for roadway maintenance and construction, potentially benefiting truck transportation. H.R. 7, a House bill, includes provisions for increasing truck weight limits and trailer lengths, as well as a pilot program for higher truck weights on certain highway segments. Trucking organizations oppose tolling for highway construction and prefer fuel tax increases. MAP-21 proposes substantial changes to transportation planning requirements at national, state, and local levels, including the use of performance management throughout the planning process. State and metropolitan planning would need to incorporate performance measures and targets, with a set of five national goals outlined in the bill. The committee report mentions coal transport in West Virginia and timber trucking in Minnesota participating in a pilot program for higher truck weights on certain highway segments. Additionally, a weight exemption for idle reduction equipment was increased from 400 pounds to 550 pounds. For freight provisions related to rail and maritime modes, refer to the \"Rail Provisions\" and \"Harbor Maintenance Expenditures\" sections of the report. MAP-21 introduces changes to transportation planning, emphasizing performance management. States and MPOs would set performance measures and targets, with consequences for not meeting them. A national freight strategic plan would establish performance measures for freight movement. States must set targets for funding, with required improvement plans for underperformance. The Surface Transportation and Freight Policy Act under MAP-21 includes provisions for a national surface transportation and freight policy and strategic plan, with some overlapping and conflicting details with other sections. For example, there are repetitive goals for reducing traffic fatalities and conflicting requirements for developing a national strategic freight plan. Section 1115 and Section 33003 of the Surface Transportation and Freight Policy Act under MAP-21 require the development of national strategic freight and surface transportation plans within specific timeframes. States must also create risk-based asset management plans with performance targets and investment strategies. The Secretary will establish minimum standards for pavement and bridge conditions, with states needing to take action if these standards are not met. Under MAP-21, states would need to redirect federal apportionments to improve transportation facilities. State planning requirements would remain similar, with the addition of incorporating metropolitan and nonmetropolitan transportation plans. A performance-based approach with coordinated performance measures and targets would be required in transportation planning. MAP-21 proposes creating two tiers of MPOs based on population size for metropolitan transportation planning. Tier I MPOs in areas with 1 million or more people and Tier II MPOs in areas with less than 1 million would have to meet specific technical requirements. Performance-based planning and targets would be required for Tier I MPOs, while Tier II MPOs would have more discretion. Regulations for minimum requirements would be established by the Secretary within a year of enactment. MAP-21 proposes creating two tiers of MPOs based on population size for metropolitan transportation planning. Tier I MPOs in areas with 1 million or more people would have to meet specific technical requirements, including performance-based planning and targets. Tier II MPOs in areas with less than 1 million people would have more discretion in their requirements, which may include performance measures and optional blueprint planning scenarios. The designation of MPOs would be required only in urbanized areas with a population of 200,000 or more, up from the current requirement of 50,000. MPOs in urbanized areas below 200,000 could be designated by agreement between the governor and local officials, but would still need to meet minimum technical requirements set by the Secretary for Tier II MPOs. The MAP-21 legislation proposes creating two tiers of MPOs based on population size for metropolitan transportation planning. Tier I MPOs in areas with 1 million or more people must meet specific technical requirements, while Tier II MPOs in areas with less than 1 million people have more discretion. The legislation also allows for the termination of existing MPOs in areas under 200,000 population, unless reaffirmed by the MPO and governor. Additionally, H.R. 7 includes provisions for national transportation planning, performance measurement, and the development of a national strategic transportation plan by the Department of Transportation. The national plan under H.R. 7 includes cost estimates and must be updated every two years. It also mandates the development of a national performance management system to track progress towards national performance goals for highways and public transportation. This system includes national and state performance measures, targets, and reporting requirements. States must report annually on their progress towards meeting performance targets, and the statewide transportation planning process must identify projects of national, regional, and statewide significance. H.R. 7 also addresses congestion issues at airports and freight rail corridors. H.R. 7 addresses congestion issues at airports, freight rail corridors, ports, and inland waterways. It adds requirements for planning to consider intercity buses' role in reducing congestion, pollution, and energy consumption. The bill also proposes increasing the urbanized population threshold for MPO designation to 100,000 and gives regional transportation planning organizations a role in project selection. H.R. 7 includes provisions to expedite project delivery by changing elements of the environmental review process for transportation projects. Both the House and Senate proposals aim to accelerate project delivery by allowing activities to begin during the planning stage and conclude during the preliminary engineering and design stage. The environmental review process for transportation projects involves preparing documentation to identify and address project-related impacts on the environment. Various environmental requirements may apply, such as obtaining permits or mitigating effects on historic sites. The environmental review process for transportation projects involves identifying and considering environmental impacts before proceeding with a proposed action. Approval of NEPA documentation by FHWA or FTA is required before final design activities or project construction can proceed. Compliance with all applicable environmental requirements must be reflected in the NEPA document. Recent legislative efforts under SAFETEA and TEA-21 aimed to expedite environmental reviews for major transportation projects by focusing on NEPA compliance. The House proposal in H.R. 7 and MAP-21 goes beyond NEPA requirements to make sweeping changes to the environmental review process, with the goal of expediting project delivery. The proposed changes in highway and transit project delivery aim to accelerate environmental reviews and project delivery, but may also introduce procedural changes that could potentially slow down the process. The environment-related provisions in MAP-21 focus on the environmental review phase of transportation project development, where compliance with state, tribal, and federal environmental requirements, including those under NEPA, is crucial. Compliance may involve coordination with various agencies before final design activities. Before project activities can proceed, FHWA or FTA must ensure the completion of the environmental review process, which includes preparing an environmental impact statement for projects with significant environmental effects. Projects with no significant impacts are categorically excluded from this requirement and are known as categorical exclusions (CEs). DOT's NEPA regulations outline two groups of actions that generally qualify as CEs. The environmental review process for highway projects involves categorically excluded projects that do not require additional DOT approval and those that may be processed as CEs when appropriately documented and approved by DOT. Approximately 90% of highway projects approved annually by FHWA are processed as CEs, while 6% require an EA. These projects, although deemed to have no significant environmental impact under NEPA, may still be subject to other environmental requirements under various laws. The most significant changes in the environmental review process in MAP-21 involve \"Accelerated Decisionmaking\" and \"Review of Federal Project and Program Delivery.\" Section 1313 of MAP-21 would amend existing environmental review procedures to establish new requirements for issue resolution. MAP-21 aims to establish criteria to ensure parties in the environmental review process meet project deadlines and resolve disputes. It includes financial transfer provisions for agencies failing to issue required approvals, with penalties of $10,000 or $20,000 per week for delays. Transfer is required 180 days after application completion or final project decision, unless the delay is not the agency's fault. The transfer of funds to expedite transportation project approvals under NEPA may be required if delays are not the agency's fault. Various agencies, such as EPA, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, or U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, issue permits for DOT projects. Under-staffing or lack of funds in these agencies can cause delays in permit issuance, and redirecting funds to expedite one project may slow down others. The MAP-21 legislation requires the Department of Transportation (DOT) to compare completion times of environmental assessments (EAs) and environmental impact statements (EISs) initiated before and after 2005. DOT must report this information to Congress within a year of enactment, but no specific funding is provided for these assessments. Determining completion times for NEPA documents may be challenging as start and end dates of EIS preparation may not accurately reflect the overall process. The MAP-21 legislation requires the Department of Transportation (DOT) to compare completion times of environmental assessments (EAs) and environmental impact statements (EISs) initiated before and after 2005. Little data is available for projects processed with EAs or CEs, and state DOTs do not track the time it takes to complete the NEPA process. Extracting accurate information about NEPA process times may be difficult, but Congress may require states to start tracking this information. This would be an addition to the existing environmental clearance process. The MAP-21 legislation requires the Department of Transportation (DOT) to compare completion times of environmental assessments (EAs) and environmental impact statements (EISs) initiated before and after 2005. Provisions in the legislation direct DOT to survey state agencies for suggested new Categorical Exclusions (CEs) and to promulgate regulations adding projects to the existing list of CEs. Other provisions specify DOT agency roles in meeting NEPA compliance requirements for multimodal projects and criteria for designating specific projects as categorical exclusions within existing highway right-of-ways. The legislation under MAP-21 requires the Department of Transportation to compare completion times of environmental assessments and impact statements. Provisions include allowing states to use transportation funds for attorneys' fees related to eligible activities and authorizing federal funds for dedicated staff to expedite transportation project planning. The Surface Transportation Project Delivery Program under \u00a71307 would be made permanent, allowing any state to participate in assuming federal responsibilities for environmental reviews. Additional environment-specific provisions in MAP-21 reinforce the importance of certain activities and clarify requirements for NEPA compliance. In the House bill, environmental review provisions are included under Title III, \"Environmental Streamlining.\" The House bill includes provisions under Title III, \"Environmental Streamlining,\" and Subtitle C, \"Project Development and Review,\" which would extensively change NEPA requirements for federal highway and transit projects. NEPA would no longer apply to projects costing less than $10 million or with federal funding below 15% of total costs. For projects still subject to NEPA, H.R. 7 would alter the compliance process significantly. The House bill includes provisions under Title III, \"Environmental Streamlining,\" and Subtitle C, \"Project Development and Review,\" which would extensively change NEPA requirements for federal highway and transit projects. It would establish specific timeframes for permits, a 270-day deadline for environmental review, and limits to judicial review. The Senate has agreed to substitute the language of MAP-21 for the House-passed language of H.R. 4348 and called for a conference with the House. The House bill includes provisions under Title III, \"Environmental Streamlining,\" and Subtitle C, \"Project Development and Review,\" which would change NEPA requirements for federal highway and transit projects. MAP-21 would add authority for state DOTs to enter into CM/GC contracts, a middle ground between design-bid-build and design-build methods, to speed up project delivery. The House bill includes provisions to streamline environmental requirements for federal highway and transit projects. MAP-21 allows state DOTs to enter into CM/GC contracts to accelerate project delivery. It also increases federal funding share by 5% for projects using innovative delivery methods. MAP-21 includes innovations like prefabricated bridge elements and digital modeling technologies. It also introduces a pilot program for advance payment of moving costs for those affected by highway projects. This program aims to expedite the relocation process, although it is a minor change compared to other property acquisition and relocation laws. State transportation officials have recommended allowing states to use their own property acquisition and relocation laws if they meet federal requirements. The Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program (CMAQ) under Section 1113 of MAP-21 would be revised to provide funds for projects reducing transportation-related pollutants exceeding air quality standards set by the EPA. The CMAQ program provides funds for projects in areas that do not meet air quality standards. Proposed amendments would change funding levels and distribution within states. Congress has authorized specific annual funding levels since the early 1990s. The CMAQ program provides funds for projects in areas with air quality issues. Congress has authorized specific annual funding levels since the early 1990s, with funds apportioned to each state based on population and pollution levels. MAP-21's CMAQ apportionment for FYs 2012 and 2013 would be tied to previous funding levels and distributed within each state based on new program guidelines. States would need to reserve a portion of the funds for specific projects. The CMAQ program allocates funds for projects in areas with air quality issues. 10% of STP funds can be used for transportation enhancements, recreational trails, and projects providing transportation choices. Half of the remaining CMAQ funds are suballocated for projects in nonattainment or maintenance areas, distributed based on a formula approved by DOT and weighted by population and pollution severity. The CMAQ program allocates funds for projects in areas with air quality issues. Half of the suballocated funds must be obligated based on population in nonattainment or maintenance areas for fine particulates. 30% of the suballocated funds are reserved for low-emissions construction equipment and vehicles. States in attainment for NAAQS can use their apportioned funds for CMAQ-eligible projects. Additional provisions in MAP-21 may change how the CMAQ program is implemented, including prioritizing projects to reduce pollutants in nonattainment areas. CMAQ fund distribution for projects reducing pollutants, including diesel retrofits. Proposed evaluation and assessment of projects to show cost-effectiveness. States and MPOs must consider this information in developing performance plans for CMAQ-funded projects. Optional programmatic eligibility for emissions reductions. MPOs required to prepare performance plans for CMAQ-funded projects. H.R. 7 includes provisions amending CMAQ program requirements. The House bill includes provisions to amend project eligibility requirements for alternative fuels and advanced technology vehicles. Incentives such as tax credits for plug-in vehicles and biofuels production are highlighted, along with non-tax incentives like credits under the Corporate Average Fuel Economy program. Highway programs also offer non-tax incentives, such as allowing low-emission vehicles in HOV lanes. H.R. 7 and MAP-21 propose extending the authority for vehicles to use HOV lanes, with limitations if lanes become degraded. They also support the expansion of electric vehicle infrastructure by allowing highway funds for new charging stations. MAP-21 would amend the Clean Fuels Grant Program to include funding for clean fuel buses and facilities, with a focus on zero emission buses. The Senate's public transit provisions in MAP-21 authorize $10.458 billion annually for federal transit programs for FY2012 and FY2013. The House surface transportation reauthorization bill, H.R. 7, proposes renaming the mass transit account of the highway trust fund to the alternative transportation account. It authorizes $10.458 billion for FY2012 and $10.498 billion annually for FY2013 through FY2016, with funding coming from the alternative transportation account and the general fund. The bill eliminates the use of motor fuel taxes for mass transit and transfers revenue from the mass transit account to the highway account. Additionally, $40 billion would be transferred from the general fund to the alternative transportation account. The FPTA in MAP-21 proposes significant restructuring of the federal transit program, replacing the Fixed Guideway Modernization Program with a State of Good Repair Grant Program. This new program includes a High Intensity Fixed Guideway SGR Formula Program for maintenance, repair, and replacement of fixed guideway public transit systems. Funding would come from the mass transit account of the highway trust fund and be distributed based on vehicle miles and route miles. Additionally, a Fixed Guideway SGR Grant Program would provide competitive grants for fixed guideway system upkeep. The FPTA in MAP-21 proposes restructuring the federal transit program, replacing the Fixed Guideway Modernization Program with a State of Good Repair Grant Program. This program includes a High Intensity Motorbus SGR formula program for maintenance of public transportation on facilities accessible to high-occupancy vehicles. Funding comes from the mass transit account and is distributed based on vehicle miles and route miles. The Bus and Bus Facilities SGR program would provide competitive grants for bus upkeep, funded by $75 million from the New Starts program. The heavily earmarked discretionary Bus and Bus-Related Facilities program would be eliminated. The FPTA in MAP-21 proposes restructuring the federal transit program, including combining certain formula programs and creating new programs. The Senate bill would shift the Jobs Access and Reverse Commute program to be part of the Urbanized and Non-Urbanized Area Formula programs, rename it as Access to Jobs, and require recipients to spend at least 3% of their Urbanized Area apportionments on projects for low-income individuals. Additionally, two new programs would be created. The Senate bill proposes creating two new programs, the Appalachian Development Public Transportation Assistance Program and the Public Transportation Emergency Relief Program, funded by the Non-Urbanized Area funds. The bill also doubles the amount set aside for transit on Indian reservations from $15 million to $30 million annually, with $20 million distributed by formula and $10 million competitively. Additionally, the bill authorizes funding for capital and operating costs in the event of a natural or man-made disaster. The House bill (H.R. 7) maintains the federal transit program structure but eliminates certain programs like the Clean Fuels Grant Program and combines others into a single program. It proposes distributing funding for the Bus and Bus-Related Facilities Program by formula, focusing on providers of bus transit in urbanized areas without heavy rail, commuter rail, or light rail. H.R. 7 proposes changes to the federal transit program, including incentives for contracting out bus services and allowing private intercity operators access to federally funded facilities. The Senate bill would make changes to the New Starts program, allowing funds for core capacity improvement projects and simplifying the process. The New Starts process is being simplified in H.R. 7 by reducing the stages from four to three. The new stages are project development, engineering, and construction. Applicants must apply in writing to the Secretary of Transportation to enter the project development phase and initiate the NEPA process. The bill eliminates the separate alternatives analysis currently required by law. Project sponsors must provide information for project justification and local financial commitment during project development. The Engineering Phase can begin after the NEPA process is completed with a Record of Decision. The Engineering Phase follows the NEPA process conclusion with a Record of Decision, Finding of No Significant Impact, or Categorical Exclusion. The project becomes the locally preferred alternative, adopted into the metropolitan plan, and justified on its merits. Successful projects are eligible for a full funding grant agreement with the Secretary for federal funding assistance and can move into the construction phase. The Senate bill aims to expedite projects with special warrants for those with federal shares of $100 million or less or 50% of the total project cost. However, it would eliminate the Small Starts program for projects requesting $75 million or less in federal assistance and costing $250 million or less. Additionally, the bill would create a pilot program for expedited project delivery for three projects. The House bill (H.R. 7) proposes a pilot program for expedited project delivery for three projects to test innovative methods. It maintains the distinction between New Starts and Small Starts projects, allocating $150 million for Small Starts. The bill eliminates the alternatives analysis but requires evaluation against a no-action alternative. It includes provisions for expediting projects, such as using special warrants for faster evaluation of certain projects. H.R. 7 proposes changes to project evaluation criteria, including adding private contributions and intermodal connectivity as factors. It also allows small bus transit systems in urbanized areas with 200,000 or more people to use up to 50% of their Urbanized Area apportionments for operating expenses. The House bill (H.R. 7) allows transit systems in urbanized areas with 200,000 or more people to use federal funding for operating expenses, with specific percentages based on the number of buses in peak service. The House bill (H.R. 7) allows transit systems with fewer than 76 buses in peak service to use federal funding for operating expenses. The cost share is 25% federal, 75% local for 76-100 buses, and 50% federal for 75 or fewer buses. H.R. 7 also increases the share of funds for ADA paratransit from 10% to 15% and calls for the development of a national rail plan. The House bill (H.R. 7) allows transit systems with fewer than 76 buses in peak service to use federal funding for operating expenses. It also increases the share of funds for ADA paratransit from 10% to 15% and calls for the development of a national rail plan. The bill requires DOT to develop regional rail plans, excluding the Amtrak-owned Northeast Corridor, and states may create state rail plans that refine the regional plan. Amendments are made to the NEC advisory commission, and Amtrak is required to submit a new plan for high-speed service in the corridor. The bill requires DOT to develop guidance on measuring train delays and conduct a data needs assessment for intercity passenger rail. It also mandates a survey on track access arrangements and the creation of an equipment pool for corridor intercity passenger services. The bill includes amendments for corridor passenger service, allowing Amtrak to be eligible for capital grants. The equipment pool aims for economies of scale but may hinder innovation in car design. Positive train control could impact domestic car design by potentially aligning FRA regulations with foreign standards. \"Buy America\" requirements are still in place. H.R. 7 aims to modify requirements for passenger car equipment to align with foreign standards, potentially creating a global market. It would repeal the congestion grant program and reduce funding for Amtrak's operating assistance grants. Additionally, it would amend laws regarding food and beverage service on Amtrak trains. H.R. 7 would repeal the self-supporting requirement for food and beverage service on Amtrak trains, require competitive bidding for the service, and allow subsidies only if a net loss is foreseen. It also includes amendments to a federal grant program for relocating railroad lines. The Senate bill proposes amendments to the Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing (RRIF) Program, expanding eligible uses of a RRIF loan and accepting state or local subsidies as collateral. It also suggests modest changes to laws governing the Surface Transportation Board (STB), including raising the ceiling on maximum total dollar value of freight charges that shippers can bring before the STB. The bill proposes changes to the Surface Transportation Board (STB), including increasing rate relief amounts and imposing shorter procedural deadlines. It also requires the STB to study incorporating railroad asset replacement costs, compile and report railroad service complaints, review staffing needs, repeal a capital grant program for smaller railroads, and facilitate access to the RRIF loan program. The Positive Train Control (PTC) technology was introduced in 2008 after accidents involving trains in Los Angeles and derailments with toxic chemicals. PTC uses radio signaling to prevent human errors in train control. Some argue that PTC is costly for rare accidents, and urban areas lack spectrum for radio signals. The Senate bill allows the Department of Transportation to extend the PTC deadline if deemed infeasible by railroads. The Senate bill allows the Department of Transportation to extend the PTC deadline if deemed infeasible by railroads. The House bill (H.R. 7) would extend the deadline for implementing PTC to 2021 for routes with passenger traffic and essentially eliminates the deadline for routes carrying certain toxic chemicals. Highway safety programs are the responsibility of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The Senate bill would retain most of the existing NHTSA grant programs and would create another: an incentive grant program to encourage states to make texting while driving, and the use of a cell phone by drivers under age 18, primary traffic offenses. The House bill, H.R. 7, proposes changes to highway safety programs, including consolidating grant programs into one general highway safety grant program with reduced funding. It also prohibits federal funding for measuring motorcycle helmet usage rates and creating motorcyclist checkpoints. The Senate bill authorizes higher highway safety grants for FY2012 and FY2013 and requires passenger vehicles to have event data recorders starting in 2015. Additionally, it increases the maximum civil penalty for vehicle safety defect violations. The House bill, H.R. 7, proposes changes to highway safety programs, including consolidating grant programs into one general highway safety grant program with reduced funding. The Senate bill authorizes significantly higher highway safety grants in FY2012 and FY2013 and includes measures to prevent drivers who have failed drug and alcohol tests from avoiding penalties. Both bills aim to strengthen DOT's ability to act against \"reincarnated carriers\" and provide similar levels of funding for truck safety grants to states in FY2013. Additionally, the Senate bill requires passenger vehicles to have event data recorders starting in 2015 and increases the maximum civil penalty for vehicle safety defect violations. The transit safety section in MAP-21 (\u00a720021) proposes DOT oversight of rail transit systems, establishing safety standards, certification programs, and financial independence for state safety oversight agencies. It authorizes grants of \"not less than $10 million\" for state programs. H.R. 7 does not include similar provisions. H.R. 7 authorizes grants for transit safety programs, allows DOT to require funds for safety projects, and certifies state safety oversight organizations. It also authorizes $4.6 million annually for state safety oversight and $440 million annually for transportation research and education. Both H.R. 7 and MAP-21 include a technology deployment program. MAP-21 and H.R. 7 both include provisions for competitive grant programs to accelerate transportation innovations and research. They also emphasize the importance of utilizing revenues from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund for infrastructure maintenance. House-passed H.R. 4348 includes language that would require the total level of budgetary resources provided for a fiscal year to equal the receipts credited to the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund, restricting the use of such amounts to harbor maintenance programs."
