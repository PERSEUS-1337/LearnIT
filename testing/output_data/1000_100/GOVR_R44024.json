    "content": "In 1976, President Gerald Ford signed the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) into law, authorizing the EPA to regulate toxic chemicals in U.S. commerce to prevent harm to human health or the environment. EPA evaluates risks throughout the chemical life-cycle and has various regulatory options. Congress has added titles and amendments to TSCA, but the core program remains unchanged. Bills have been introduced since 2005 to revise the chemical evaluation process. Since 2005, bills have been introduced to revise the chemical evaluation process under TSCA, but none have been enacted due to ongoing legislative debate. Proponents argue that the current regulatory framework is not sufficiently protective, as few chemicals have been evaluated and regulated. EPA's risk evaluation depends on available resources. EPA's risk evaluation depends on available resources, with states enacting statutes to address chemical concerns not covered by TSCA. Manufacturers argue that compliance with different state regulations for the same chemical is inefficient. Proponents of state regulations argue for alternative approaches to protect citizens, while non-governmental programs offer voluntary labeling as a regulatory alternative. This report tracks legislative bills in the 114th Congress that aim to amend chemical regulations. In the 114th Congress, bills were introduced to amend Title I of TSCA, including the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety Act (S. 697) and the Alan Reinstein and Trevor Schaefer Toxic Chemical Protection Act (S. 725). Senate EPW held hearings and marked up amendments for these bills. On April 28, 2015, Senate EPW marked up an amendment for S. 697, which was reported out of the committee for Senate floor consideration. On June 18, 2015, Senate EPW filed the report for S. 697. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce introduced a discussion draft called the TSCA Modernization Act of 2015, which was forwarded to the full committee for consideration on May 14, 2015. On May 26, 2015, H.R. 2576, also known as the TSCA Modernization Act of 2015, was introduced. On June 23, 2015, the House passed H.R. 2576, also known as the TSCA Modernization Act of 2015, on a 398-1 vote. The bill addresses various issues related to the federal regulation of chemical substances under Title I of TSCA, including the prioritization of existing chemical substances for risk evaluation and the criteria for EPA to restrict a chemical substance. The report compares approaches among S. 697, S. 725, and H.R. 2576 in amending Title I of TSCA to address regulatory options, authority of EPA, preemption of state laws, disclosure of information, and available resources for EPA administration. EPA's discretion in evaluating chemical risks under current TSCA is limited by finite resources, leading to challenges in selecting chemicals for evaluation. The EPA evaluates over 83,000 chemical substances for risks, prioritizing 90 for evaluation based on hazard and exposure criteria. Out of these, five have been assessed, with three found to present risks. EPA assesses chemical substances for risks, requiring manufacturers to submit a PMN 90 days before manufacturing. Over 36,000 PMNs and 13,000 exemptions have been received. Legislation would prioritize existing chemicals for risk evaluation. EPA has discretion to evaluate chemicals with potential risks. The legislation would give EPA discretion to evaluate chemicals with potential risks based on hazards and exposures under intended conditions of use. Senate bills differ in factors used to prioritize substances, including active and inactive substances. The process includes risk-based safety evaluations and regulatory actions based on evaluations. All bills address prioritization of persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic substances. Manufacturers would be involved in the evaluation process. S. 697 and H.R. 2576 propose a process for manufacturers to request EPA to prioritize substances for evaluation by paying a fee. EPA would evaluate risks for substances requested by manufacturers under H.R. 2576. S. 697 and S. 725 establish deadlines for evaluating and regulating chemical substances. EPA must designate at least 25 chemicals as high priority under S. 697. S. 697 and H.R. 2576 propose deadlines for evaluating and regulating chemical substances. EPA must designate at least 25 chemicals as high priority under S. 697, with safety assessments and determinations to be completed within specific timeframes. H.R. 2576 requires risk evaluations to be published within three years after a manufacturer's request or EPA finding of potential risk. EPA must initiate at least 10 risk evaluations under H.R. 2576. H.R. 2576 would require EPA to initiate at least 10 risk evaluations per year, not setting a limit on manufacturer requests. S. 697 and S. 725 would establish a process for EPA to review new chemical substances and significant new uses. EPA would need to make a determination for regulatory action within 90 days for new chemicals under the Senate bills. The Senate bills would require EPA to review new chemical substances within 90 days and determine if they meet safety standards. Once a new chemical is added to the TSCA Inventory, it would be subject to the same procedures as existing chemicals. The current TSCA regulates chemicals based on the risk of harm to human health or the environment. Some argue for changes in regulatory controls under TSCA regarding new and existing chemicals, specifically addressing the challenge of proving unreasonable risks. The current \"unreasonable risk\" standard lacks clarity, leading to debates on amending it to provide clearer criteria for regulatory control. The standard has been interpreted as a multi-factor balancing test by the circuit court, as seen in the influential 1991 Corrosion Proof Fittings v. EPA case. The Fifth Circuit in Proof Fittings v. EPA interpreted TSCA's \"unreasonable risk\" standard, emphasizing the need to consider costs and balance environmental, economic, and social impacts. The court criticized EPA for not adequately considering costs in an asbestos ban, deeming spending $200-$300 million to save seven lives over thirteen years as unreasonable under the standard. S. 697 would establish a statutory definition for the term \"safety standard\" that includes the regulatory threshold of \"unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment\" in current TSCA. It would also consider the \"conditions of use\" of a chemical substance and explicitly include \"potentially exposed or susceptible populations\" in risk evaluations. Additionally, S. 697 would prohibit the consideration of costs in determining safety standards. S. 697 and S. 725 would establish safety standards for evaluating chemical risks, with a focus on preventing harm to human health and the environment without considering costs. In contrast, H.R. 2576 does not define a safety standard and instead relies on the regulatory threshold of \"unreasonable risk.\" H.R. 2576 proposes requirements for EPA's risk evaluation process to determine risks, including assessing risks to potentially exposed populations and prohibiting consideration of costs or non-risk factors. This contrasts with S. 697 and S. 725, which establish safety standards for evaluating chemical risks without considering costs. Section 6 of TSCA directs EPA to promulgate regulations to protect against unreasonable risks from substances, considering factors like costs and alternatives. The regulatory requirements range from bans to notifications of risks. Some argue that EPA must conduct lengthy analyses to choose the least burdensome option. In Corrosion Proof Fittings v. EPA, the Fifth Circuit questioned EPA's total ban on most ongoing uses of asbestos as the least burdensome alternative. In practice, the \"least burdensome\" requirement imposes an additional standard on EPA beyond that imposed by the requirement that EPA conduct a cost-benefit analysis of the chosen alternative. The Fifth Circuit required EPA to show that each less burdensome requirement would not adequately protect against the unreasonable risk. S. 697, S. 725, and H.R. 2576 would eliminate the requirement that EPA choose the least burdensome regulatory option to restrict a chemical substance that warrants regulation. Instead, S. 697 and S. 725 would direct EPA to choose a regulatory option that is \"necessary\" for the chemical substance to meet the safety standard. The bills S. 697, S. 725, and H.R. 2576 propose changes to EPA regulations on chemical substances. They aim to eliminate the \"least burdensome\" requirement and instead focus on choosing regulatory options necessary to meet safety standards. The bills also address factors like costs, alternative regulations, and exemptions for certain uses under specific circumstances. H.R. 2576 proposes granting \"critical use exemptions\" for specific chemical uses if no safer alternative is available and if the requirement is not cost-effective. The exemptions would be in effect for up to five years and can be renewed if the criteria are still met. EPA would only grant exemptions to reduce risk to the greatest extent feasible. The EPA relies on scientific and technical information to evaluate risks of chemical substances and determine if any risks are unreasonable. Section 8 of TSCA authorizes EPA to require reporting and record-keeping of existing information on chemicals. If risks are insufficiently known, Section 4 mandates EPA to require manufacturers and processors to conduct testing if certain threshold findings are met. The EPA has required additional testing for over 200 chemical substances to assess risks. There are concerns about limits on EPA's authority under TSCA to require new information on health and environmental effects of chemicals. EPA faces challenges in determining unreasonable risks and the development of new information can be time-consuming and costly. The development of new information can be time-consuming and costly for those required to do so. S. 697 and S. 725 would give EPA discretion to require testing if deemed necessary, while H.R. 2576 would still require certain findings for testing under TSCA Section 4. All three bills authorize EPA to require new information through rulemaking, orders, or testing agreements. The scope of TSCA preemption has been a long-standing issue, with conflicting state laws yielding to Congress's powers. Current TSCA preemption gives EPA a primary role in managing chemicals but allows states some flexibility under certain circumstances. Specifically, Section 18 of TSCA generally preempts states from managing chemical risks. Section 18 of TSCA generally preempts states from managing chemical risks, allowing exceptions for identical state requirements to federal ones and state regulation of disposal and chemical use within the state. Advocates for broader federal preemption argue for a uniform national regulatory framework for chemical protection. Advocates for broader federal preemption argue that a uniform national regulatory framework for chemicals can provide sufficient protection from risks. Opponents believe states should be able to implement more stringent regulations to protect their citizens. S. 697 would modify TSCA preemption and the state-federal relationship in chemical management. States could act without preemption if EPA had not taken action on a chemical. S. 697 would modify EPA actions triggering preemption of states' chemical-specific requirements, scope of state laws preempted, and waiver provisions. States would be prohibited from restricting chemicals EPA found safe or restricted. States couldn't establish new restrictions on high priority chemicals for safety assessment if they fell within EPA's planned assessment scope. Preemption of new state restrictions would start upon EPA defining the safety assessment scope. S. 697 would modify preemption of states' chemical-specific requirements, retaining exceptions but removing states' ability to prohibit chemical use. States could not impose duplicative or more stringent penalties. New exceptions would allow states to enforce certain requirements under state environmental laws. S. 697 would modify preemption of states' chemical-specific requirements, retaining exceptions but removing states' ability to prohibit chemical use. States could not impose duplicative or more stringent penalties. New exceptions would allow states to enforce certain requirements under state environmental laws. Certain state actions taken before August 1, 2015, and past or future state actions under the authority of state laws that were in effect as of August 31, 2003 would not be subject to preemption. S. 697 would also add savings clauses clarifying that common law or statutory causes of action, private remedies, or evidentiary or other authorities of courts would not be affected. States could apply for waivers on the basis of concerns about a chemical based on peer-reviewed science, with EPA required to grant such waivers if the application met statutory requirements. H.R. 2576 would make smaller changes to TSCA preemption compared to Senate bills, allowing states to impose different regulations for chemicals. States could enforce requirements on chemicals if EPA had not taken action. The bill would preempt state laws protecting against exposure to chemicals deemed safe by EPA. It would maintain preemption of state requirements based on EPA risk management actions. H.R. 2576 would align preemption with the risk evaluation process under amended Section 6 of TSCA, allowing states to enforce their own regulations on chemicals if EPA had not acted. State prohibitions on chemical use would not be exempt from preemption, and certain past or future state actions would not be affected. The bill also includes savings clauses for common law causes of action. TSCA requires chemical manufacturers to submit information to EPA, including chemical structures and safety data. Balancing public access with protection of confidential information is a concern. Section 14 of TSCA prohibits disclosure of trade secrets and confidential information, with exceptions. Wrongful disclosure is a criminal act under TSCA. Confidential business information (CBI) protection under TSCA allows for the protection of certain data, including chemical identities, in health and safety studies. TSCA Section 14 outlines exceptions for disclosing CBI, such as when necessary to protect health or the environment. EPA must notify the information submitter before disclosing protected information. The submitter can obtain CBI protection by designating information as CBI without substantiation or EPA review. Protection lasts indefinitely unless EPA determines otherwise. EPA has increased review of confidentiality claims since 2010, especially for chemical identities in health and safety studies. The agency has initiatives to increase public access to non-confidential information. All three bills would maintain current TSCA's framework for protecting information under the FOIA trade secrets exemption. The three proposals would expand EPA's disclosure of CBI in certain circumstances, including requests from state, local, or tribal officials for enforcement purposes, environmental release responses, and healthcare professionals for patient diagnoses or treatments. The Senate bills propose more detailed procedural requirements and review processes for information submitters compared to H.R. 2576. They also outline categories of information presumed protected from disclosure, such as specific chemical identities before commercial distribution. In comparison, H.R. 2576 would protect the confidentiality of chemicals' identities in health and safety studies. All three bills would require submitters to substantiate, and resubstantiate after no more than 10 years, their confidentiality claims. H.R. 2576 would also require EPA to notify submitters before the expiration date of their confidentiality claims. Funding for EPA's implementation of TSCA is provided through annual appropriations or fees on chemical manufacturers, importers, or processors. The authorization for fees does not have a sunset date and is limited to $2,500 for certain actions required under the statute. S. 697 and S. 725 would repeal the expired authorization of appropriations under Section 29 of TSCA, which currently allows fees to be collected for evaluating testing data on chemical substances. Fees collected under TSCA are treated as miscellaneous receipts and deposited into the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury, with availability for EPA's use subject to annual appropriations. S. 697 and S. 725 would repeal the expired authorization of appropriations under Section 29 of TSCA, while H.R. 2576 would not amend Section 29. All three bills would revise the authority to collect fees under Section 26(b) of TSCA to varying degrees. S. 697 would authorize fee collection for submissions of information to EPA on chemicals for evaluation, with fees set to partially cover activity costs and capped at $18 million. H.R. 2576 would authorize EPA to collect fees from manufacturers for risk evaluations of chemical substances, without a limit on the amount collected per submission. The fees would be deposited into a dedicated fund and used to cover costs associated with administering TSCA. S. 725 authorizes EPA to collect fees from chemical manufacturers without fiscal year limitation, similar to S. 697 and H.R. 2576. Fees would be deposited into the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury and made available subject to discretionary appropriations. The Congressional Budget Office has provided cost estimates for S. 697 and H.R. 2576, detailing the potential budgetary impacts of the bills. The cost estimate for S. 697 is in S.Rept. 114-67, and for H.R. 2576 is in H.Rept. 114-176."
