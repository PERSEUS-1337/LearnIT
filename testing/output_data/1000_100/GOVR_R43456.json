    "content": "Airline passenger screening in the United States has evolved significantly since the 9/11 attacks, with new technologies and policy changes overseen by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) established under the Aviation Transportation and Security Act (ATSA). The TSA is responsible for comprehensive security screening of all passengers and property on airline flights, with the authority to implement trusted traveler programs and utilize advanced screening technologies. The TSA was directed by Congress to check all airline passengers against terrorist watchlists. Despite challenges, TSA has mostly used a uniform risk approach to airport checkpoint screening, which has proven problematic. The TSA has primarily focused on technology to improve airport screening, but limitations such as budget constraints and space restrictions have hindered progress. TSA personnel face challenges in efficiently screening passengers and property without causing long wait times. Airline passengers still experience cumbersome procedures like removing shoes and separating laptops for X-ray. The TSA has faced criticism for its inflexible security methods, leading to unpredictable wait times and deterring travelers. Former TSA Administrator Kip Hawley has criticized the agency for creating a security system that is rigid instead of adaptable. TSA has responded by shifting towards risk-based screening to focus on passengers with elevated security risks, a move that has sparked controversy. The controversy surrounding security initiatives stems from differing views on risk assessment and mitigation. Former Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff emphasized the impossibility of achieving perfect security in a free society. This highlights the challenge of focusing security efforts effectively, as advised by Frederick the Great to prioritize the main point and parry the worst blows to avoid greater harm. In the aviation security context, risk is a complex interaction of threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences. Specific strategies are needed to minimize risk, as perfect security is unattainable. Risk-based practices use categorical techniques to quantify security risk. A risk-based aviation security strategy aims to mitigate threats, vulnerabilities, and security risks through passenger screening and various security measures like reinforced cockpit doors and air marshals. Consequences are assessed for severity to determine risk valuation and cost-benefit analysis. The responsibility for mitigating consequences and managing risks in aviation security lies with airports, airlines, and emergency management agencies, not TSA. Establishing effective risk-based strategies involves defining the risk environment and setting acceptable risk levels. While TSA uses risk scoring for air cargo security, it is not a central part of their strategy for passenger aviation. The TSA primarily assesses airline passenger risk through categorical processes, including biographical data checks against databases and behavioral indicators. The validity of behavioral-based risk scores has been questioned, and there is disagreement on specific risks to mitigate. An example is the 2013 proposal to allow small knives onboard, citing diminished threats and reliance on other security layers. Critics argued that TSA's proposal to allow small knives, golf clubs, and baseball bats onboard was not adequately considering risks beyond hijacking and terrorism, such as unruly passengers. Legislation was introduced to prevent TSA from lifting the ban, leading TSA to announce that it would not proceed with the proposal. Former TSA administrator Hawley and Israeli expert Ron criticize the approach of focusing on prohibiting certain items on aircraft, arguing that it hinders security by relying on lists and detection technology. They highlight the risk of missing larger threats while focusing on minor items, citing the example of box cutters not being prohibited during the 9/11 attacks. Ron emphasizes that terrorists exploit detection technology's limitations, gaining insight into what to expect. Ron and Hawley criticize the TSA's focus on prohibiting items on aircraft, arguing that it hinders security by relying on lists and detection technology. They advocate for an approach that integrates detection capabilities with other measures to assess threats and minimize vulnerabilities, emphasizing flexibility and unpredictability. Israel's use of demographic profiling, intelligence databases, and security interviews is cited as a model for proactive, risk-based security measures. Israel utilizes demographic profiling, intelligence databases, and security interviews to identify high-risk passengers for enhanced screening measures. Despite no major terrorist attacks in over 40 years, the effectiveness of these methods in deterring threats is uncertain. Implementing a similar approach in the US is seen as legally and practically challenging. Research suggests a risk-based screening tailored to US aviation security would be more effective, politically feasible, socially acceptable, and legally defensible. Risk-based screening is part of a comprehensive aviation security framework, allowing TSA to focus resources on high-risk passengers. It informs security protocols and may impact the deployment of behavioral detection officers and air marshals. Risk-based approaches to airline passenger screening have been used since the early 1970s, allowing TSA to focus resources on high-risk passengers. Before 100% screening of all airline passengers went into effect in 1973, the FAA used rudimentary passenger profiles to determine screening. In the late 1970s, as security technology advanced, risk-based profiling techniques were largely abandoned but continued to be used to examine passenger name records for potential threats. In the late 1980s, FAA required airlines to ask passengers basic security questions to address the increased threat of aircraft bombings. The questions aimed to target elevated-risk checked baggage and raise passenger awareness of potential security threats. Despite criticism for their obvious intent, these measures reflected the real threat posed by bombers trying to deceive individuals into carrying devices aboard aircraft. Following the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, the Computer-Assisted Passenger Pre-Screening (CAPPS) system was developed by the FAA and airlines in the late 1990s. CAPPS uses flight reservation data to identify potential security threats, with indicators such as purchasing one-way tickets or paying with cash. Additionally, a \"no-fly\" list was created by the FAA and FBI to deny boarding to known terrorists. TSA eliminated the use of security questions in 2006, which some foreign airlines still use in more in-depth interviews. After the 9/11 attacks, the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA) directed TSA to establish trusted traveler programs and use technology to expedite screening for certain passengers. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 further mandated the use of CAPPS or similar systems to evaluate all passengers before boarding, focusing on risk-based screening. The Department of Transportation Airport Security Rapid Response Team recommended a nationwide program for vetting passengers to expedite processing and focus aviation security resources more effectively. This led to the development of CAPPS II, which aimed to integrate identity authentication, watch list checks, and expanded risk-based assessments of passengers. The development of CAPPS II aimed to categorize passengers based on threat assessments using government and commercial databases. Despite controversy over privacy issues, the 9/11 Commission recommended improving the \"no fly\" and \"automatic selectee\" lists and screening passengers against a larger set of watchlists maintained by the federal government. TSA was urged to perform the screening instead of air carriers. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 required TSA to take over passenger watchlist screening from airlines and implement the Secure Flight program, which screens passengers using the Terrorist Screening Database. TSA is prohibited from using algorithms to assign risk scores or commercial data for assessing passenger risk. Secure Flight has been operational since 2011. The Secure Flight program, fully operational since 2011, screens passenger biographic information against terrorist watchlists, including the TSDB. The TSDB contains fewer than 400,000 names, with about 50,000 in the \"no fly\" or \"selectee\" subsets. The TIDE repository, a source for foreign identities in the TSDB, has grown to include about 875,000 names. The TSDB has expanded to over 500,000 identities since 2012, with a focus on improving watchlist practices post-Flight 253 bombing attempt. Secure Flight compares passenger data against watchlists to determine access at airport checkpoints. Secure Flight compares passenger names to a CDC list for public health concerns. Records are destroyed within 7 days if no watchlist match is found. Potential matches are kept for 7 years, confirmed matches for up to 99 years. Known traveler lists are retained until updated. CBP collects passenger manifest data from airlines for international flights to the US, cross-checking it against various databases and terrorist watchlists using the Automated Targeting System-Passenger (ATS-P) for risk assessments. ATS-P helps CBP determine if an individual should be admitted to the US by comparing passenger data against security databases. The Automated Targeting System (ATS) collects and analyzes passenger data for security purposes, including checking against terrorist databases and identifying red flags like lost passports. Passenger name record data may be retained for up to 15 years, with depersonalization after six months. Travelers from Visa Waiver Program countries must submit biographical information through the Electronic System for Travel Authorization before boarding a US-bound flight. The CBP checks passenger information against various databases for potential threats before boarding a U.S.-bound flight. Secure Flight uses government and airline data for risk analysis. TSA's SPOT program observes passenger behavior at airports to identify potential threats, but faces controversy over its cost and effectiveness. The TSA's SPOT program uses behavior detection techniques to identify potential threats at airports. It is based on scientifically validated behaviors and differs from traditional law enforcement methods by focusing on large groups of individuals rather than specific crimes. The TSA's SPOT program uses behavior detection techniques to identify potential threats at airports, focusing on large groups of individuals. Unlike traditional law enforcement methods, the program heavily relies on non-invasive observation techniques and a formal scoring system to rate suspicion based on behavioral indicators. Non-verbal cues, such as facial expressions, are not central in establishing suspicion in a law enforcement setting. The TSA's SPOT program uses behavior detection techniques to identify potential threats at airports. Despite TSA's claims of effectiveness, the Government Accountability Office reported concerns about the program's validation and cost-benefit analysis. TSA conducted validation studies with DHS and the American Institutes for Research, showing behavior detection techniques were effective. Despite positive results, GAO and DHS Inspector General raised doubts about the program. TSA implemented recommendations to improve assessment methods and data collection. The GAO and DHS Office of Inspector General have raised doubts about behavior detection techniques in the SPOT program. GAO found that the metrics used by TSA to evaluate the program do not directly relate to its mission of deterring terrorism. Developing suitable metrics to assess the program's impact on mission objectives has been challenging due to the low occurrence of terrorist acts. The GAO and DHS Office of Inspector General raised concerns about the effectiveness of behavior detection techniques in the SPOT program. Issues included wide individual differences among BDOs in referrals to law enforcement, inadequate metrics to support SPOT's effectiveness, lapses in records-keeping, lack of consistent refresher training for behavior detection officers, and a need for performance evaluation and recurrent training for BDO instructors. The effectiveness of behavior detection techniques in the SPOT program has been questioned by the GAO and DHS Office of Inspector General. Concerns include individual differences among BDOs in referrals, inadequate metrics, lapses in records-keeping, and a lack of performance evaluation and recurrent training for BDO instructors. Despite criticism, TSA's Pre-Check program, aimed at expediting processing for low-risk passengers, has received more positive feedback. The TSA's Pre-Check program, launched in 2012, is expanding its availability to select frequent flyers and trusted traveler program members. Eligible travelers can join for a fee at enrollment centers. The program is similar to the former Registered Traveler program, which was discontinued in 2009. The TSA's Pre-Check program, launched in 2012, offers expedited screening for select frequent flyers and trusted traveler program members. It is similar to the discontinued Registered Traveler program, which included interoperable identity verification kiosks at airports. Initially, background checks were conducted, but later eliminated due to redundancy with terrorist watchlist checks. However, under Pre-Check, extensive biographic-based background checks have been reinstated, indicating a shift in TSA's approach to identifying threats to aviation security. The Pre-Check program, unlike Registered Traveler, does not issue biometric credentials but provides a known traveler number for expedited screening. Participants may still undergo random thorough screening to prevent abuse. TSA's reliance on boarding passes for authentication raises concerns due to delays and challenges in deploying authentication technologies. The Pre-Check program faces technical and managerial challenges, delaying the implementation of authentication systems for boarding pass information. TSA collects biographic and biometric data from applicants for security threat assessments using law enforcement databases. The TSA Pre-Check program conducts thorough background checks on applicants using intelligence databases, including FBI criminal history records. Eligible applicants must be U.S. citizens, nationals, or legal permanent residents. Those with certain criminal convictions or ties to terrorism may be deemed ineligible. Applicants pay an $85 processing fee and, once approved, receive a notification letter from TSA. Once approved for TSA Pre-Check, travelers receive a notification letter with a Known Traveler Number valid for five years. Applicants not qualified can appeal within 30 days by providing supporting records. The $85 processing fee is non-refundable, so individuals with concerns about disqualification may choose not to apply. The first enrollment center opened in Indianapolis in December 2013, with plans for 300 nationwide. TSA plans to have 300 enrollment centers nationwide and an online application process for Pre-Check. Early feedback from frequent travelers has been positive, with a high satisfaction rate compared to regular TSA screenings. The program has expanded rapidly to over 100 airports, aiming to provide expedited screening to half of all airline passengers by the end of FY2015. However, the rapid expansion may limit some benefits of Pre-Check. The Pre-Check program is expanding rapidly to provide expedited screening to half of all airline passengers by the end of FY2015. Wait times in Pre-Check lanes may increase as the program grows in popularity, but non-participating travelers may also benefit from shorter wait times. Managed inclusion allows for random selection of low-risk individuals for Pre-Check lanes, and new screening methods include passenger screening canine teams and behavioral detection officers. Behavioral detection officers screen individuals for potential threats and perform initial screening in the checkpoint queue. Passengers may be randomly selected for Pre-Check lanes, indicated by a lighted arrow at the travel document checker's kiosk. Military servicemembers, including active duty, reservists, and National Guard members, as well as cleared military personnel for official and personal travel, are allowed to use Pre-Check lanes. Family members under 12 years old may also pass through. Family members under 12 years old can use Pre-Check lanes when traveling with cleared military personnel. Those over 12 must go through standard screening or obtain Pre-Check eligibility. Civilian employees of the Department of Defense and Coast Guard can also participate in expedited screening without enrolling in Pre-Check. Pre-Check lanes are used for airline crewmembers participating in TSA's Known Crew Member initiative. Airlines' flight and cabin crew undergo TSA-managed background checks for expedited screening eligibility. The Known Crew Member database verifies their credentials. These individuals are considered lower risk by TSA due to their extensive background screenings, which may exceed those of Pre-Check applicants. The TSA uses random selection for screening certain individuals, including military servicemembers, defense personnel, and airline crews, to maintain a comprehensive risk-based approach to security. Various forms of identifying data are collected and retained for risk-based screening programs. The TSA collects and retains data on potential threats to the aviation system, with separate rules for data collection and retention. Records of individuals matching terrorist or criminal databases are kept for longer periods, while other records are deleted after travel completion. Data from Pre-Check applications is retained unless updated or corrected. Commercial databases may also be used for information. The TSA collects and retains data on potential threats to the aviation system, with separate rules for data collection and retention. Personal data collected under risk-based programs may be shared among DHS agencies for counterterrorism and homeland security missions. Data may also be shared with intelligence, law enforcement, and judicial agencies for investigating potential violations, with protections under the Privacy Act of 1974. The Privacy Act of 1974 and subsequent legislation require TSA and DHS to establish appeals procedures for individuals identified as security threats based on records in the TSDB. The Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 mandated DHS to establish an Office of Appeals and Redress for individuals wrongly identified as threats. DHS must maintain records of misidentified individuals and correct erroneous information through the DHS Traveler Redress Inquiry Program (DHS TRIP). The DHS Traveler Redress Inquiry Program (DHS TRIP) was established to address situations where individuals claim to have been wrongly singled out. Passengers can file complaints online or by mail, and DHS requests supporting information within 30 days. A control number is provided for tracking the inquiry status. If a traveler was delayed due to misidentification, DHS outlines steps to resolve the issue, such as presenting a response letter during check-in. If dissatisfied with the resolution, passengers can take further action. The TSA allows passengers to appeal decisions made by DHS, but TSA decisions based on Secure Flight program records are mostly exempt from judicial review. In 2013, TSA sought information to expand expedited screening by using third-party prescreening of passengers. Third parties can use legally available data services to assess the risk posed by individuals for aviation security. The announcement raises concerns about the future use of commercial databases for passenger risk assessments, citing issues of data accuracy and security. There are worries about privacy and the accuracy of data used for screening, with potential use of non-federal government and private databases already being speculated. The article raises concerns about the use of commercial data in risk assessments for TSA systems, including CBP's ATS, Secure Flight, Pre-Check applications, and TSA's Transportation Security Enforcement Records System. Congress previously restricted the use of commercial data in airline passenger prescreening, but there are worries about privacy and data accuracy in these assessments. Congressional oversight and legislative action related to TSA systems using commercial data for risk-based assessments are of interest as TSA's approaches to passenger prescreening evolve. Concerns include the use of commercial data, behavioral profiling, and broader issues for Congress. Oversight is crucial to review TSA's risk-based screening programs for effectiveness, efficiency, and data security. The TSA's risk-based programs are a concern for experts in aviation security as they need to fit into a comprehensive strategy. The effectiveness of these programs in adapting to new threats and incorporating new methods is also questioned. The evolution of screening processes, including the Pre-Check program, and the consolidation of terrorist watchlist information have been key issues for the intelligence community since the attempted bombing of Northwest Flight 253 in 2009. Specific changes made in response have not been publicly acknowledged, and details on the adaptation of behavioral detection methods by TSA have not been disclosed. Adaptation to shifting threat landscapes, changes in resources, and the introduction of new procedures and technologies remain undisclosed. The effectiveness of TSA's risk-based strategies is difficult to assess due to challenges in selecting appropriate metrics, especially with limited encounters with individuals tied to terrorism. Concerns have been raised over the choice of metrics for behavioral detection programs, with a focus on efficiency rather than security effectiveness. The limited number of terrorist encounters raises security concerns. Efforts to reduce false alarms in terrorist detection systems may lead to gaps in threat detection capabilities. High false alarm rates can misdirect screening resources and complicate the lives of individuals mistakenly targeted as threats. Initiatives have focused on improving the accuracy and thoroughness of terrorist databases and implementing a redress process for those wrongly identified. A redress process is in place for falsely targeted individuals in aviation passenger pre-screening, but its effectiveness in reducing false alarm rates has not been publicly disclosed. TSA anticipates risk-based security efficiencies will save $120 million and reduce staffing by 1,500 positions in FY2015. Congressional oversight will examine if these gains can be achieved without compromising security. Privacy and data protections are key concerns for Congress regarding DHS systems. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has established practices to protect personal data and comply with Privacy Act requirements. Questions remain about the implementation of privacy protections and data security measures by TSA in its risk-based approach to passenger screening. Concerns include the integration of various programs, adaptation to changes in threats and resources, and the effectiveness of risk-based programs. The TSA must identify and analyze metrics for risk-based programs to detect and mitigate threats to civil aviation while addressing false positives and ensuring privacy protections. Despite enhanced security measures post-9/11, the risk of large-scale aviation attacks persists. Balancing privacy with effective security strategies remains a key issue for aviation security policy and potential congressional oversight."
