The \"Access to Women's Health Care Act of 1997\" recognizes the importance of obstetrician-gynecologists in providing primary and preventive health care to women throughout their lifetime. Obstetrician-gynecologists play a crucial role in improving access to healthcare for women by offering comprehensive care and reducing the need for referrals to other physicians. Obstetrician-gynecologists are crucial in providing primary and preventive healthcare to women, managing their health beyond the reproductive system. Some states promote access to these providers, but others lack protection from access restrictions. SEC. 2. ASSURING ACCESS TO OBSTETRICAL AND GYNECOLOGICAL SERVICES UNDER GROUP HEALTH PLANS AND INSURANCE COVERAGE. This section introduces standards for access to obstetrical and gynecological services in group health plans and insurance coverage. Group health plans and health insurance issuers must allow female enrollees to designate an obstetrician-gynecologist as their primary care provider without requiring prior authorization for obstetric and gynecologic care. Group health plans and health insurance issuers must allow female enrollees to designate an obstetrician-gynecologist as their primary care provider without requiring prior authorization for gynecologic care ordered by the participating physician. This does not waive coverage requirements for medical necessity or appropriateness. Group health plans must not deny women eligibility based on gender, provide incentives to accept less coverage, or penalize providers for following the requirements. Plans must comply with notice requirements as per the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The section allows group health plans to negotiate reimbursement levels with providers for care provided under this section. State laws providing greater protections to enrollees than this section are not preempted. Section 2723 of the Act is amended to include section 2706(f) and sections 2704 and 2706. Amendments are made to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. Standards relating to access to obstetrical and gynecological services are addressed in Section 713. In connection with a group health plan, a female enrollee can designate an obstetrician-gynecologist as her primary care provider without prior authorization for obstetric and gynecologic care. A participating health care professional can provide gynecologic care in collaboration with an obstetrician-gynecologist, following State law. The ordering of gynecologic care by the participating physician is considered prior authorization from the primary care provider. Group health plans and health insurance issuers cannot deny eligibility to women for gynecologic care. The group health plan cannot deny women eligibility for coverage to avoid requirements, offer incentives to accept less protection, or penalize providers for following the plan's requirements. Imposing these requirements is considered a material modification in the plan's terms for notice purposes. The group health plan must provide a summary description of any modifications within 60 days of the first plan year they apply. Health plans can negotiate reimbursement levels with providers. State laws regarding health insurance are not preempted by this section. The text chunk discusses amendments to various sections of the Act related to group health insurance coverage, including greater protections for enrollees. The amendments include changes to sections 731, 732, and the table of contents. Amendments to the Act include new standards for access to obstetrical and gynecological services under individual health insurance. The provisions of section 2706 apply to health insurance coverage in the individual market. Health insurance issuers must comply with notice requirements similar to group health plans. State laws that are more protective regarding health insurance issuers are not preempted by this section. The amendments made to the Act apply to group health plans starting from January 1, 1998, and do not preempt state laws that offer greater protections to enrollees in connection with group health insurance coverage. The amendments apply to health insurance coverage in the individual market on or after a certain date. For group health plans under collective bargaining agreements, the amendments do not apply until the later of the termination of the agreements or January 1, 1998. Amendments to health insurance coverage in the individual market apply on a specific date. For group health plans under collective bargaining agreements, the amendments take effect after the termination of the agreements or January 1, 1998. A collective bargaining agreement amended to comply with new requirements is not considered terminated."
