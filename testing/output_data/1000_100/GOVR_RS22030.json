    "content": "The EU's response to the 9/11 attacks and the presence of Al Qaeda cells in Europe led to increased efforts to combat terrorism and enhance cooperation in police, judicial, and intelligence matters. The EU, a partnership of 28 member states, aims to promote peace and economic prosperity through European integration. Harmonizing policies in \"justice and home affairs\" is a key focus, including measures to enhance internal security, protect citizens' rights, and facilitate free movement within the EU. The EU's response to the 9/11 attacks led to increased efforts in combating terrorism and enhancing cooperation in police, judicial, and intelligence matters. JHA encompasses countering terrorism, police and judicial cooperation, migration and asylum issues, and border control policies. Member state concerns about national sovereignty and legal systems initially hindered common JHA policies. The 2001 attacks prompted EU leaders and member states to improve law enforcement cooperation, leading to numerous arrests in Belgium and France. The EU's response to the 9/11 attacks resulted in increased efforts to combat terrorism and improve cooperation in police, judicial, and intelligence matters. Close cooperation with U.S. authorities led to numerous arrests in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom. European leaders recognized that the EU's open borders and different legal systems allowed terrorists to move around easily and evade arrest. Many EU member states lacked anti-terrorist legislation, making it difficult to apprehend suspects who could easily flee to countries with different laws. Extradition requests often took months or years to process. The EU responded to the 9/11 attacks by enhancing efforts to combat terrorism and improve cooperation among member states. They established common definitions of terrorism, a list of terrorist groups, an EU arrest warrant, and tools to combat terrorist financing. Europol was also strengthened to handle criminal intelligence. EU bolstered Europol and Eurojust to handle criminal intelligence and improve prosecutorial coordination in cross-border crimes. Incidents like the 2004 Madrid bombings and 2005 London bombings prompted EU initiatives to enhance counterterrorism capabilities, including improving travel document security and intelligence sharing among member states. A Counterterrorism Coordinator was established to encourage the implementation of EU policies. The 2005 London attacks raised concerns about \"homegrown\" Islamist extremism in the UK and Europe. The EU adopted a plan in 2005 to combat radicalization and terrorism, focusing on disrupting terrorist networks, promoting mainstream opinions, and enhancing security measures. In 2008, the EU expanded its definition of terrorism to include new criminal offenses. In 2008, the EU expanded its definition of terrorism to include new criminal offenses such as terrorist recruitment, providing training, and public provocation. This decision aimed to facilitate prosecution of individuals involved in terrorist activities and counter the dissemination of terrorist propaganda, including online. Additionally, the EU established the Radicalisation Awareness Network (RAN) in 2011 to connect key groups involved in countering radicalization and violent extremism. Despite efforts to enhance cooperation against terrorism and cross-border crimes within the EU, challenges persist due to national sovereignty concerns and differing views among member states and EU institutions on sensitive issues like data privacy and intelligence sharing. This complicates harmonizing laws and forming EU-wide policies in the Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) field. National police and intelligence services are often hesitant to share information with each other or with EU bodies like Europol, hindering efforts to address threats from groups like the Islamic State and the \"foreign fighter phenomenon.\" EU policymakers are increasingly concerned about European citizens joining terrorist groups in the Middle East. EU authorities estimate that up to 5,000 European citizens have traveled to fight in conflict zones in the Middle East and North Africa since 2011. Security services are worried about the potential threat posed by trained militants returning to Europe, as well as individuals inspired by Islamist extremist propaganda to carry out attacks at home. Recent terrorist attacks in Europe have raised concerns about links to groups like the Islamic State. In Brussels, Belgium, a French Muslim with ties to Islamist fighters in Syria attacked the Jewish Museum. In Paris, France, French-born Muslims linked to Al Qaeda or ISIS killed 17 people in attacks on Charlie Hebdo, police officers, and a kosher supermarket. In Copenhagen, Denmark, a self-radicalized Danish citizen of Palestinian descent killed two people and wounded five police officers. An attempted attack on a train from Amsterdam to Paris was thwarted by passengers, including three Americans, with the suspect being a Moroccan man linked to known Islamist extremists. The November 13, 2015, coordinated attacks in Paris left 130 dead and over 350 injured. Authorities have confirmed the identities of seven assailants, all French or Belgian citizens, with at least six having fought with ISIS in Syria-Iraq. European governments struggle with monitoring potential attackers and lack sufficient information sharing among law enforcement and intelligence services. Some attackers exploited the Schengen system and migrant influxes in Europe. They traveled between countries before carrying out attacks. Perpetrators of the Paris attacks entered Europe through Greece with fake Syrian passports. Another suspect entered Belgium from France the day after the attacks. The suspect in the November Paris attacks entered Belgium from France the day after the attacks but remains at large. The EU faces challenges in implementing common policies to counter terrorism and foreign fighters due to issues related to sovereignty and balancing security with human rights. Despite skepticism, the EU has made progress in initiatives such as enhancing information sharing. EU efforts to counter terrorism include enhancing information sharing through common EU databases like the Schengen Information System and Europol's Focal Point Travellers database. In January 2016, Europol established the European Counter Terrorism Centre for operational cooperation among member states. Success of these initiatives relies on receiving information from national authorities. EU officials have increased alerts in SIS and Europol databases, but EU-wide terrorism information sharing still falls short. The proposal for an EU-wide Passenger Name Record system has been stalled since 2013 due to data privacy concerns. Pressure to adopt the system intensified after the 2015 Paris attacks to track foreign fighters and identify terrorist suspects. EU officials argued for the necessity of finalizing the EU Passenger Name Record (PNR) proposal to harmonize PNR collection practices across member states. A provisional agreement was reached in December 2015, obliging airlines to provide PNR data to national authorities for flights into and out of EU territory. Member states can also collect PNR data from intra-EU flights and non-carrier operators. Critics raise concerns about data privacy infringement. Critics argue that the proposed EU Passenger Name Record (PNR) system may violate data privacy rights. Some believe it does not go far enough in sharing PNR data effectively, as it lacks a centralized EU PNR database. EU governments will have two years to implement the agreement once formally adopted. EU officials urged increased security measures at external borders in response to the foreign fighter threat, but some resisted amending the Schengen Borders Code for more extensive checks. In mid-December 2015, the European Commission proposed targeted modifications to the Schengen Borders Code to introduce mandatory checks of EU citizens against law enforcement databases at the external borders. This was in response to the surge of migrants, refugees, and the attacks in Paris, putting pressure on the Schengen system. The proposal also included establishing a new European Border and Coast Guard to strengthen border security. The EU has established measures to strengthen external borders and prevent radicalization, including the creation of an Internet Referral Unit to monitor and remove terrorist content online. Additionally, an Internet Forum was launched to collaborate with technology companies in countering terrorist propaganda. Member states are urged to address societal factors contributing to radicalization. The EU is working on revising its Framework Decision on Combating Terrorism to criminalize traveling abroad for terrorist purposes and receiving terrorist training throughout the EU. Harmonizing criminal laws has faced challenges due to varying national policies and fears of infringing on national legal systems. Some EU governments were initially hesitant to amend the common terrorism definition, preferring to tighten laws against foreign fighters at the national level. The EU is updating its common terrorism definition to address gaps in compliance with U.N. Resolution 2178 on prosecuting foreign fighter-related offenses. The European Commission proposed revisions in December 2015, which will be reviewed by EU member states and the European Parliament. Cooperation with the U.S. in combating terrorism has been a priority for the EU since 9/11. The EU is updating its terrorism definition to comply with U.N. Resolution 2178 on prosecuting foreign fighter-related offenses. The U.S.-EU cooperation against terrorism aims to root out terrorist cells in Europe and beyond, fostering dialogue on law enforcement and homeland security issues. The evolving partnership is viewed positively by most U.S. policymakers and analysts, with a focus on counterterrorism, border controls, and transport security. President Obama's National Strategy for Counterterrorism emphasizes continued partnership with the EU for mutual security and protection. The EU is a key partner in global counterterrorism efforts, focusing on combating the foreign fighter phenomenon. Concerns have been raised about European foreign fighters traveling to Syria and Iraq. U.S.-EU cooperation aims to enhance international cooperation against terrorism and strengthen criminal justice capacities. In early July 2014, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder emphasized the need for shared strategies between the United States and EU countries to address the issue of U.S. and European-born violent extremists in Syria. The White House mentioned close collaboration between U.S. and EU officials on counter-radicalization, border security, aviation security, and information sharing to combat the foreign fighter threat. EU countries supported U.N. Security Council Resolution 2178 in September 2014 to address the global foreign fighter phenomenon. The EU and most member states support the U.S.-led coalition against the Islamic State. After the Paris attacks in January 2015, U.S. and European officials discussed terrorist threats and foreign fighters. Efforts are being made to enhance information exchanges within Europe and utilize existing databases like the SIS and Europol. U.S. officials also back the establishment of an EU PNR system. President Obama urged the EU to implement an EU PNR system to prevent foreign terrorist fighters from entering countries undetected. Close law enforcement ties with European allies and existing U.S.-EU information-sharing arrangements are crucial in combating terrorism. Challenges in the U.S.-EU counterterrorism relationship include data privacy and protection concerns, which have complicated negotiations on information-sharing agreements. The U.S. and EU have had information-sharing agreements for years, with renewed attention after unauthorized NSA surveillance disclosures in 2013. Other issues include detainee policies, terrorist designation lists, and balancing border security with transatlantic travel. Legislation in 2015 to strengthen the Visa Waiver Program raised concerns in the EU. Contacts between U.S. and EU officials on police, judicial, and border control matters have increased since 2001, playing a crucial role in closer ties. Contacts between U.S. and EU officials on police, judicial, and border control matters have increased since 2001, playing a crucial role in developing closer ties. The U.S. Departments of State, Justice, Homeland Security, and the Treasury are actively engaged in this process, with high-level meetings and working groups discussing cooperation against terrorism, terrorist financing, border and transport security, critical infrastructure protection, and preventing violent extremism. Europol and U.S. agencies have established reciprocal liaison relationships, with officers stationed in Washington, DC, and The Hague. They work together on counterterrorism, counterfeiting, and cybercrime cases, leading to operational successes. U.S. liaison also works at Eurojust headquarters in The Hague since 2006. The U.S. liaison has worked at Eurojust headquarters in The Hague as part of a U.S.-Eurojust agreement to enhance cooperation on terrorism and cross-border criminal cases. U.S.-EU efforts against terrorism have resulted in agreements to improve police and judicial cooperation, including sharing strategic and personal information. Negotiations on sharing personal information were challenging due to concerns about U.S. data protection standards conflicting with EU privacy regulations. In 2010, new U.S.-EU treaties on extradition and mutual legal assistance entered into force to harmonize bilateral accords, simplify extradition, and promote information-sharing and prosecutorial cooperation. Washington and Brussels aim to combat various threats through these agreements. The U.S. and EU have implemented new treaties on extradition and mutual legal assistance to combat terrorism and transnational crimes. The agreements address challenges such as the death penalty and extradition of EU nationals, while modernizing existing bilateral agreements and streamlining information exchange. The MLA treaty between the U.S. and EU allows access to European bank account information, speeds up request processing, permits evidence acquisition through video conferencing, and enables U.S. participation in joint EU investigations. Critics question the need for collaboration with EU bodies due to existing bilateral relations between U.S. agencies and national services in EU member states. Europol's lack of enforcement capabilities and dependence on national services for information are noted, while European officials criticize the U.S. for expecting intelligence without reciprocating. European officials criticize the United States for expecting intelligence without sharing its own. However, most U.S. and European officials are committed to enhancing cooperation with EU law enforcement entities like Europol. Recent agreements aim to improve U.S.-Europol cooperation against foreign fighters and illegal immigration, as well as efforts to track and suppress terrorist financing globally. The Financial Action Task Force works to suppress terrorist financing and improve international financial investigative tools. The US and EU benefit from an agreement allowing access to financial data through SWIFT for the Terrorist Finance Tracking Program. The program has generated leads for EU governments in preventing terrorist attacks, but faces controversy in Europe over data privacy concerns. The EU maintains two lists of terrorist organizations and individuals, one focusing on Al Qaeda and Taliban affiliates and the other on non-affiliated entities. The lists are important for symbolizing a united U.S.-EU front against terrorism and curbing terrorist financing. The EU's \"common terrorist list\" or \"blacklist\" includes over 80 individuals or entities, with specific law enforcement measures applied based on whether they are considered \"external\" or \"internal\" to the EU. All EU member states are legally obligated to freeze assets and restrict financial resources for \"external\" persons and groups. The EU's common terrorist list includes over 80 individuals or entities, with law enforcement measures applied based on whether they are \"external\" or \"internal\" to the EU. National governments seek to apply their own sanctions to stem financing for listed individuals and entities, with unanimous agreement required among all EU member states for additions or deletions. The United States and other countries have successfully lobbied the EU to add organizations like the PKK, FARC, Hamas, and Hezbollah. The EU's common terrorist list includes various groups like Hamas and Hezbollah, with the US also designating members of ETA. Harmonizing the US and EU lists has caused some tensions, especially regarding charities suspected of Hamas ties. EU members view these charities as separate entities engaged in political or social work, leading to differences in designation. EU member states have been divided on whether to include Hezbollah on the EU's common terrorist list, despite the US designating it as a foreign terrorist organization. Some countries, like the UK and the Netherlands, support adding Hezbollah to the list, while others, like France, oppose it due to concerns about managing relations with Lebanon. In 2012-2013, events like the Burgas airport bombing and Hezbollah's involvement in Syria prompted calls for the EU to add Hezbollah to its terrorist list. In late July 2013, the EU announced that its 28 member states had agreed to add Hezbollah's military wing to its common terrorist list, but not the entire Hezbollah organization. This decision was seen as a compromise to address concerns about destabilizing Lebanon and reducing the EU's influence in the region. The EU also emphasized that adding Hezbollah's military wing to the terrorist list would not hinder dialogue with political parties in Lebanon or the delivery of assistance to the country. The EU's decision to add Hezbollah's military wing to its common terrorist list was largely symbolic, sending a message that terrorist activities would endanger the organization's legitimacy. Some experts hoped this would lead to enhanced intelligence investigations in Europe. Critics argued that only listing the military wing was insufficient as Hezbollah could still fundraise in Europe. The US had long urged the EU to include Hezbollah on its terrorist list. The Obama Administration and Members of Congress urged Europe to take action against Hezbollah following Bulgaria's implicating the group in the Burgas bombing. The Senate and House passed resolutions calling for Hezbollah to be designated as a terrorist organization and for sanctions to be imposed. The EU's decision to list Hezbollah's military wing as a terrorist group was seen as a positive step by the US. The EU's recognition of Hezbollah's military wing as a terrorist group was praised by the US, but data privacy remains a key issue in US-EU relations. EU regulations prioritize privacy rights and restrict data transfers to countries without adequate legal protections, causing concerns about US guarantees for European citizens' personal data. Many MEPs and European civil liberty groups argue that U.S.-EU information-sharing agreements violate EU citizens' privacy rights. Unauthorized disclosures of NSA surveillance programs and allegations of U.S. collection activities in Europe have strained transatlantic trust. Concerns are rising about the future of these agreements, especially with the European Parliament's history of opposing or demanding changes to accords. The European Parliament has expressed serious concerns about U.S. surveillance programs and established a working group to investigate alleged collection activities. The Parliament's working group, chaired by Claude Moraes, criticized the NSA's mass surveillance programs and made recommendations on U.S.-EU security and economic issues. The \"Moraes report\" raised concerns about U.S.-EU information-sharing agreements, including the PNR accord and SWIFT agreement. It called for the timely conclusion of negotiations on the U.S.-EU Data Privacy and Protection Agreement and urged the U.S. to recognize the privacy rights of EU citizens. The European Parliament's resolution on the report is not binding but carries political weight. The European Parliament demanded stronger data protection reforms in response to alleged U.S. spying activities. New data protection rules were agreed upon in December 2015, with concerns raised by U.S. officials about potential impacts on law enforcement cooperation and U.S. companies. U.S. officials reassured EU leaders that surveillance activities comply with U.S. law and oversight mechanisms. Observers note the United States' efforts to address EU concerns and improve transparency to maintain European support for SWIFT and PNR accords. A high-level U.S.-EU working group was established to discuss NSA surveillance, including the PRISM program. The European Commission issued a report with recommendations to address European concerns about U.S.-EU data flows. U.S. and EU policymakers are exploring ways to implement the Commission's proposals. In June 2014, the Obama Administration announced plans to work with Congress on legislation to allow EU citizens to seek redress in U.S. courts for law enforcement data privacy violations. The Judicial Redress Act was passed in February 2016 to address this issue. Controversy over Europe's involvement in the U.S. Terrorist Finance Tracking Program dates back to 2006. In 2001, U.S. officials assured Europeans that SWIFT data was only used for counterterrorism purposes and obtained through administrative subpoena. In 2007, a deal was reached for continued U.S. access to SWIFT data, but concerns remained about EU rights and data protection standards. Changes to SWIFT's systems in 2009 led to a new U.S.-EU agreement for data sharing. In November 2009, the European Parliament rejected the new U.S.-EU SWIFT agreement due to concerns about data privacy and civil liberties. This led to negotiations for a revised agreement in May 2010. In May 2010, negotiations began for a revised U.S.-EU SWIFT agreement addressing concerns about data privacy and civil liberties. Key issues included guaranteeing judicial remedy for European citizens in the U.S. in case of data abuse and the use of \"bulk data\" transfers. Some MEPs called for more targeted transfers and greater supervision by an EU-appointed authority over U.S. access to SWIFT data. In June 2010, a new draft SWIFT agreement was concluded, providing for administrative and legal redress for EU citizens in the U.S. and giving Europol authority over U.S. Treasury Department requests. In order to address concerns about data privacy and civil liberties, negotiations began in May 2010 for a revised U.S.-EU SWIFT agreement. The new draft included provisions for judicial remedy for European citizens in the U.S. and gave Europol authority over U.S. Treasury Department requests for SWIFT data. Additional changes were made to the draft to ensure oversight of data extraction and to establish plans for a European equivalent to the U.S. TFTP within a year. The European Parliament approved the final iteration of the agreement. The European Parliament approved the final U.S.-EU SWIFT accord on July 8, 2010, for a five-year period. Some MEPs raised concerns about the EU's role in the U.S. TFTP and criticized Europol for approving vague U.S. requests for SWIFT data. The European Commission recommended measures to make the TFTP more transparent in a review released in March 2011. In December 2012, the Commission released the results of a second review of the TFTP agreement, concluding that it had provided concrete benefits in fighting terrorism. Unauthorized disclosures of U.S. surveillance activities in Europe since June 2013 have raised concerns in the European Parliament about the handling of EU citizens' personal data. The European Parliament passed a nonbinding resolution calling for the suspension of the U.S.-EU SWIFT accord, but actual suspension would require further action. Reviews show that SWIFT data has been valuable in combating terrorist threats in Europe. The US and EU reached an agreement allowing airlines to share passenger data with US authorities within 15 minutes of a flight's departure. The agreement was controversial in Europe due to privacy concerns, leading to the European Parliament challenging it in court. In 2006, the court annulled the agreement, citing improper legal basis. However, it did not find a violation of European privacy rights. In 2007, a new seven-year agreement was reached between the US and EU. In July 2007, the US and EU finalized a new seven-year agreement on the transfer of PNR data. The agreement allowed the US to share data with other agencies, store data for up to 15 years, access sensitive passenger information, and required airlines to send data 72 hours before a flight. The number of data fields collected was reduced from 34 to 19. The European Parliament had to approve the U.S.-EU PNR agreement for it to remain in force. Many MEPs objected to key elements of the 2007 agreement, such as the amount of data transferred and data retention period. Concerns were raised about potential data misuse by U.S. authorities. Despite these objections, rejecting the agreement would create legal uncertainties and practical difficulties for travelers and air carriers. In May 2010, the Parliament postponed its vote and called for a \"global external PNR strategy\" from the European Commission. In September 2010, the European Commission issued a \"global external PNR strategy\" calling for the renegotiation of EU PNR agreements with the United States, Australia, and Canada. The strategy emphasized using PNR data for combating terrorism and serious crimes, providing clear information to passengers, ensuring passenger rights to redress, and limiting the categories of PNR data exchanged. In November 2010, the European Parliament endorsed new PNR negotiations with the United States, emphasizing the need for data exchange to be \"necessary\" and \"proportional.\" The Parliament also called for exploring less intrusive alternatives and prohibited data mining or profiling. The Obama Administration agreed to discuss adjustments to the PNR accord, leading to U.S.-EU negotiations on a revised agreement in December 2010. U.S. officials maintained that the 2007 accord protected data and privacy rights adequately. In mid-May 2011, resolutions were introduced in the House (H.Res. 255) and passed in the Senate (S.Res. 174) essentially supporting the existing 2007 U.S.-EU PNR accord and urging DHS to reject any efforts by the EU to modify the agreement in a way that would degrade its usefulness in the fight against terrorism. In late May 2011, the United States and the European Commission concluded negotiations on a revised PNR agreement. The United States and the European Commission finalized a revised PNR agreement in May 2011, introducing new measures to enhance passenger data protection. The agreement included provisions for depersonalizing passenger records after six months, reducing data storage time, and limiting access to authorized personnel. It also clarified passenger rights to redress and ensured that boarding decisions would not be based solely on automated data processing. Additionally, it acknowledged the possibility of the EU developing its own PNR system in the future. Despite revisions to the U.S.-EU PNR agreement in May 2011, some MEPs were still unsatisfied. They noted that the accord allowed the U.S. to retain passenger data for up to 15 years, did not reduce data transfer amounts, and increased the time airlines had to transmit data to U.S. authorities. Additionally, concerns were raised about the broadened use of PNR data for criminal offenses. The Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence discussed intelligence-sharing and terrorist travel, focusing on the U.S.-EU PNR agreement. U.S. officials stated that the May 2011 draft of the PNR accord addressed EU concerns and was stronger than the 2007 version. In November 2011, a new draft PNR agreement was concluded with improvements, despite similarities to the May 2011 version. In November 2011, a new U.S.-EU PNR agreement was finalized with changes to meet EU demands, including limiting data use to serious crimes and varying retention time based on the type of crime. Despite concerns from some MEPs and abstentions from Germany and Austria, the agreement was approved by EU member states in December 2011. The new U.S.-EU PNR agreement was backed by MEPs for stronger data protection guarantees. Despite some misgivings, MEPs approved the agreement in April 2012 to provide legal certainty for airlines. The Parliament's endorsement reaffirmed the commitment to countering terrorism while protecting privacy rights. The U.S.-EU PNR accord was adopted by the EU in April 2012 and entered into force in August 2012 for a seven-year period, renewable unless notified otherwise. A joint review in November 2013 confirmed the agreement's efficiency in fighting terrorism and serious crimes, but concerns arose over U.S. data protection following surveillance allegations. The Parliament's resolution in March 2014 raised questions about the adequacy of U.S. laws in protecting PNR data stored in cloud systems on U.S. soil. U.S. and EU leaders view information-sharing agreements like SWIFT and PNR as crucial in combating terrorism. Washington has sought an umbrella agreement with the EU to streamline negotiations on data-sharing accords. In 2009, the European Parliament called for a U.S.-EU framework agreement to protect personal data in the fight against terrorism and crime. The European Commission proposed a draft mandate for negotiating such an accord in May 2010. The Commission aimed to bridge U.S.-EU differences in privacy rights and ensure high standards of data protection. However, the framework agreement would not provide the legal basis for data transfer, requiring specific agreements like SWIFT or PNR. EU member states approved the Commission's mandate in December 2010. In early December 2010, EU member states approved the Commission's mandate for negotiating a Data Privacy and Protection Agreement (DPPA) with the United States. The negotiations aimed to establish mutual recognition of data protection systems to protect citizens' privacy and civil liberties effectively. The DPPA was expected to build on common data protection principles adopted by both parties in October 2009. In June 2012, U.S. and EU officials made progress in negotiating a Data Privacy and Protection Agreement (DPPA), focusing on data security, transparency, and oversight. Controversial issues included purpose limitation and redress rights for EU citizens under the U.S. Privacy Act of 1974. EU officials pushed for judicial redress in the U.S., while U.S. Administrations argued that redress could be sought through other means. The DPPA negotiations between the U.S. and EU were stalled due to issues with judicial redress. However, revelations of U.S. surveillance activities in 2013 reignited discussions. The European Parliament called for the negotiations to resume promptly, emphasizing the need for judicial redress for EU citizens. Attorney General Holder announced support to conclude the DPPA in June 2014. Attorney General Holder announced the Obama Administration's commitment to seeking legislation to ensure EU citizens have the same judicial redress rights as U.S. citizens under the proposed DPPA. This decision aimed to spur final agreement on the DPPA and restore EU trust in U.S. data privacy commitments. U.S. and EU negotiators finalized the DPPA text on September 8, 2015, but the EU stated it would not be signed until U.S. judicial redress legislation was adopted. In March 2015, legislation known as the Judicial Redress Act was introduced to meet EU demands for U.S. judicial redress. The Act aimed to extend core provisions of the U.S. Privacy Act to citizens of covered countries or regional organizations like the EU. Congressional action on the Judicial Redress Act became significant following a ruling on October 6, 2015. The Judicial Redress Act gained importance after the CJEU invalidated the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Agreement due to inadequate data protection and lack of judicial remedies for EU citizens in the U.S. The Act aimed to address European concerns about data transfers and strengthen confidence in the new \"Privacy Shield.\" The new \"Privacy Shield,\" agreed upon by U.S. and EU negotiators on February 2, 2016, aims to replace Safe Harbor. The Judicial Redress Act, passed by the House on October 20, 2015, and approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee on January 28, 2016, includes provisions for judicial redress in a law enforcement context. It is uncertain how this Act will impact U.S. compliance with EU data protection standards. The Judicial Redress Act, signed into law on February 24, 2016, aims to facilitate data transfer for commercial purposes to the United States without impeding national security interests. Its adoption is seen as crucial for the formal signature of the U.S.-EU DPPA, with the EU welcoming its enactment as a historic achievement in restoring trust in transatlantic data flows. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security stated that the U.S.-EU Data Protection and Privacy Agreement (DPPA) must be approved by EU member states and the European Parliament after being signed. The agreement aims to enhance cooperation in border control, aviation, and maritime security, with a focus on information exchanges and biometric identifiers for travel document security. The U.S. and EU have emphasized cooperation in these areas over the past decade, culminating in a joint declaration in 2010 to strengthen aviation security measures. In October 2010, U.S.-EU collaboration led to an ICAO declaration on aviation security, supported by 190 countries. Both parties have also worked on improving cargo and global supply chain security. In June 2011, they reaffirmed their commitment to enhancing supply chain security and promoting global cooperation. Balancing border security with facilitating transatlantic travel remains a challenge for U.S. and EU officials post-9/11 attacks. Measures have been implemented to enhance aviation security since then. Several incidents in recent years have highlighted the ongoing terrorist threat to aviation security, including the 2009 underwear bomb attempt and the 2010 Yemen bomb plot. Tighter rules for carrying electronic devices on U.S.-bound flights were implemented in 2014 due to concerns about potential terrorist threats. The ongoing terrorist threat to aviation security has led to the implementation of various U.S. and EU rules and regulations since 2001. Both sides have worked together to address gaps in policies, such as armed air marshals on certain flights and coordinating air cargo security measures. This collaboration aims to ensure the security of all cargo on passenger flights between the U.S. and EU territories. The United States and the EU have agreed on an air cargo security partnership to mutually recognize each other's security regimes, reducing duplication and enhancing cargo security. This agreement aims to improve the efficiency of transatlantic shipments and save time and money for operators on both sides. The United States and the EU have agreed on an air cargo security partnership to exchange information on security regimes, aiming to meet U.S. requirements for cargo screening on passenger planes. Despite shared commitment, differences in perspective remain on the installation of body scanners at airports. In July 2011, the European Parliament approved the use of body scanners at EU airports with privacy and health safeguards. These safeguards included producing stick figure images, banning x-ray scans, and making the use of scanners voluntary with the option for a manual search. The European Commission adopted these conditions in November 2011 for setting common standards, but member states are not obligated to deploy the scanners. Some EU officials and European Parliamentarians have concerns about body scanners at U.S. airports due to privacy issues. However, in January 2013, the TSA announced the removal of full-body scanners that produce revealing images by June 2013. The remaining scanners will use millimeter wave technology and produce more generic body images, addressing privacy concerns raised by Members of Congress and European Parliament. The EU planned to eliminate restrictions on liquids in cabin baggage by April 2013, causing concerns about the effectiveness of current liquid-screening technology. The United States and the EU had previously worked to harmonize regulations on travel-sized liquids and gels in carry-on baggage to minimize inconvenience to travelers. The EU postponed the deadline for easing liquid and gel restrictions due to concerns about airline security and potential flight delays. In January 2014, they lifted prohibitions on \"duty-free\" liquids and gels in cabin baggage, with plans to end all restrictions by January 2016. In April 2004, the US and EU signed a customs cooperation accord, including extending the US Container Security Initiative throughout the EU. The U.S. Container Security Initiative (CSI) stations customs officers in foreign ports to pre-screen U.S.-bound cargo containers for dangerous substances. Ten EU member states participate in CSI. In May 2012, the U.S. and EU agreed to recognize each other's trusted shipper programs to improve supply chain security. This mutual recognition aims to simplify customs procedures for trusted traders designated by C-TPAT or AEO programs. Recently, U.S.-EU tensions have receded over a provision in the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 that set a five-year goal of scanning all containers bound for the United States for nuclear devices at foreign ports. EU officials found 100% container scanning unrealistic and argued it could disrupt trade and burden EU ports and businesses financially. U.S. policymakers shared concerns about the cost and effectiveness of 100% scanning, suggesting it could lead to lower profits and higher transportation costs for U.S. importers. In May 2012, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security extended the 100% scanning deadline by two years, with an additional two-year extension announced in June 2014. Proponents argue that manifest data used to determine container risk is inadequate. The U.S. Visa Waiver Program allows visa-free travel for citizens of 38 countries, causing periodic tensions with the EU over equal application to all member states. The EU members were eager to join the Visa Waiver Program (VWP), but faced exclusion for years due to not meeting requirements. Congress debated extending the VWP to new EU members, with some concerned about security risks post-9/11. In 2007, changes were made to the VWP under the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007. The 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-53) strengthened the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) by implementing security measures and allowing more EU members to qualify. This included meeting security and passport standards, signing information-sharing agreements, and submitting biographical information through ESTA. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security could waive admission requirements for new EU member states to join the VWP. Currently, 23 out of 28 EU member states are part of the VWP, with the EU urging the U.S. to admit the remaining five members. The EU has implemented a reciprocity mechanism to achieve full visa reciprocity with the US and other countries exempt from EU visa requirements. The European Commission may suspend visa-free travel for a third country's citizens if full reciprocity is not met. The VWP is crucial for US officials, with the next assessment due in April 2016. The VWP is a concern for U.S. officials due to Europeans fighting in Syria and Iraq. Enhanced security measures have been implemented for VWP travelers, including additional biographic information and new screening requirements. The Obama Administration supports the VWP for transatlantic commerce and tourism. The November 2015 attacks in Paris highlighted the importance of comprehensive screening for VWP visitors. In 2015, attacks in Paris raised concerns about the security of the Visa Waiver Program (VWP). The Obama Administration made changes to strengthen security controls, including capturing travel information to terrorist safe havens. Congress passed legislation to improve the VWP as part of the 2016 Consolidated Appropriations Act. The 2016 Consolidated Appropriations Act strengthened the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) by prohibiting individuals who have traveled to certain countries from entering the US under the VWP. All VWP participant countries must issue electronic passports and implement screening protocols. DHS expanded travel restrictions to individuals who have visited additional countries since March 1, 2011. EU officials are concerned about the new Visa Waiver Program restrictions, arguing they could create a de facto visa regime and discriminate against dual nationals. They question the effectiveness of the legislation, stating it may impact legitimate travelers more than detecting potential terrorists. US officials highlight exemptions for government and military personnel and the Secretary of DHS's authority to waive exclusions on a case-by-case basis. The DHS has the authority to waive exclusion from the VWP for individuals on a case-by-case basis, including journalists and humanitarian NGO workers. EU leaders warn of possible reciprocal measures, while some Members of Congress express concerns about discrimination based on ethnicity in the new VWP legislation. Bills have been introduced to eliminate VWP restrictions on dual nationals. The U.S. and EU aim to balance freedom and security without compromising civil liberties and human rights. Tensions have arisen over U.S. policies on terrorist detainees, including Guantanamo Bay, military commissions, and enhanced interrogation techniques. The practice of extraordinary rendition has also been criticized in Europe. The European media focused on the rendition of individuals and the presence of CIA detention facilities in Europe, leading to investigations by various European bodies. European leaders criticized U.S. detainee and interrogation policies as violating international and European law, undermining shared values on human rights, and hindering efforts to counter terrorism by winning Muslim \"hearts and minds.\" The Bush Administration defended its policies as necessary. The Bush Administration defended its detainee and rendition policies as crucial in the fight against terrorism, denying allegations of violating U.S. human rights commitments. They acknowledged European concerns about Guant\u00e1namo and sought agreements with foreign governments to accept some detainees deemed too dangerous to release. U.S.-EU tensions over detainee policies eased with the Obama Administration, which announced plans to close Guant\u00e1namo and banned torture. EU officials welcomed these initiatives. The U.S. State Department appointed a special envoy to close the detention facility at Guant\u00e1namo, persuading countries to accept detainees cleared for release. Some EU members accepted released detainees, while others declined. The Obama Administration faced challenges in closing Guant\u00e1namo due to congressional opposition and restrictions on transferring detainees to other countries. The Obama Administration has faced obstacles in closing Guant\u00e1namo, including concerns about released detainees engaging in terrorist activity. In March 2011, an executive order created a system of indefinite detention for dangerous detainees. European officials worry that Guant\u00e1namo serves as a recruiting tool for terrorist groups and have expressed concerns about the well-being of detainees. The Obama Administration has faced obstacles in closing Guant\u00e1namo due to concerns about released detainees engaging in terrorist activity. In response, a resolution was adopted expressing concern for hunger strikers at Guant\u00e1namo and urging the closure of the facility. President Obama renewed his commitment to closing Guant\u00e1namo in May 2013 and signed a bill in December 2013 easing restrictions on transferring low-risk detainees. Congress maintained restrictions on bringing Guant\u00e1namo detainees to the US in the FY2016 defense authorization bill. President Obama submitted a plan to Congress to close Guant\u00e1namo before the end of his term in office. As of February 2016, 91 detainees remain at Guant\u00e1namo, with 35 cleared for transfer. European concerns persist about the past role of European governments in U.S. terrorist detainee policies. The European Parliament has called for investigations into alleged CIA detention facilities in EU member states and CIA rendition flights. In 2015, a resolution was passed to resume investigations following a U.S. Senate report on CIA programs. The resolution also urged the U.S. to investigate and prosecute human rights violations related to the CIA programs. The European Parliament has called for investigations into alleged CIA detention facilities in EU member states and rendition flights. Some U.S. and European officials are concerned about allegations of U.S. wrongdoing and criminal proceedings against CIA officers in EU states, which could jeopardize U.S.-European intelligence cooperation against terrorism. Successive U.S. Administrations and many Members of Congress have supported efforts to enhance U.S.-EU cooperation against terrorism since the 2001 attacks on the United States. The political benefits of engaging the EU on police and judicial matters outweigh potential risks, as Europe is a key U.S. law enforcement partner. Improved U.S.-EU cooperation on border controls and transport security aims to track suspected terrorists and prevent their entry into the U.S. or Europe. However, U.S.-EU counterterrorism cooperation is complicated by differing competencies and policy preferences. The United States sometimes prefers bilateral negotiations on issues like the Visa Waiver Program. The United States and the EU prefer bilateral negotiations on certain issues like the Visa Waiver Program, which can lead to frictions in their relationship. Both are committed to closer cooperation in counterterrorism, law enforcement, border controls, and transport security. Cooperation against terrorism is crucial in combating threats from citizens fighting with Islamist groups. Aviation and cargo security, border control measures, and visa policy are key issues for Congress affecting future U.S.-EU cooperation. In the 113th and 114th Congresses, hearings focused on threats from Western foreign fighters in Syria and Iraq. Congress passed the Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015 to enhance security controls. Intelligence reforms and data privacy laws could impact U.S.-EU counterterrorism cooperation. EU officials support the U.S. Judicial Redress Act for data privacy and protection. The United States' positive steps towards concluding the U.S.-EU Data Privacy and Protection Agreement are seen as a goodwill gesture to rebuild trust in transatlantic data flows. Members of Congress may play a role in shaping the European Parliament's views on counterterrorism and data privacy rights. Representative Jim Sensenbrenner testified before the European Parliament on potential changes to U.S. surveillance legislation in November 2013. In late 2013, Senator Chris Murphy and Representative Mike Rogers led congressional delegations to Europe to discuss alleged U.S. intelligence activities with European officials and reaffirm close U.S.-European relations. Some Members of Congress maintain contacts with European Parliament counterparts, and the Transatlantic Legislators' Dialogue (TLD) facilitates discussions on foreign policy and economic issues. In recent years, Members of Congress and European Parliamentarians have shown interest in strengthening ties and cooperation on counterterrorism issues between the United States and the EU."
