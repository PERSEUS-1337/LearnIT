    "content": "The FCC prepared to auction 62 MHz of radio frequencies in the 700 MHz band to comply with the Deficit Reduction Act. They proposed creating a public-private partnership for a nationwide broadband network by pairing 10 MHz of public safety spectrum with 10 MHz of auctionable spectrum. The FCC decided to create a shared network of 20 MHz for a nationwide broadband network, aiming to meet public safety needs and benefit from collaboration with commercial users. This involved assigning a national license for 10 MHz to a not-for-profit corporation representing public safety interests. The FCC designated 10 MHz for public safety from frequencies intended for commercial use, creating a shared network. The D Block license, auctioned in 2008, attracted only one bidder, Qualcomm, Inc., who placed an opening bid of $472 million, falling short of the FCC's $1.3 billion reserve price. The FCC decided not to re-auction the D Block in 2008, opting to review rules for licensing and partnerships. New auction rules were established, maintaining a single nationwide license for public safety and offering the commercial license nationally or in smaller regions. The FCC decided not to re-auction the D Block in 2008, opting to review rules for licensing and partnerships. The commercial license will be offered as a national license or in smaller licenses covering 58 regions. Public safety associations and officials have requested that local public safety networks manage access to the public safety spectrum. The national licensee would ensure common standards and interoperability while allowing local networks to negotiate sharing arrangements. Congressional policy discussions focus on combining public and private spectrum ownership for national public safety communications support. The FCC and the Office of Emergency Communications at DHS are pursuing separate paths for developing this communications response. The FCC and the Office of Emergency Communications at DHS are pursuing separate paths for developing a communications response. Congress is considering funding solutions for the program, including levies on commercial partners or public sector funding. The federal government could temporarily act as the commercial partner to ensure the construction of the network and later sell the business to the private sector. The public safety sector aims to share spectrum and network facilities with the private sector for benefits like funding, economies of scale, and additional spectrum during emergencies. The report assumes three key needs: sufficient spectrum for a broadband network, a source of funds, and a governance structure. A source of funds is needed to cover costs for public safety associated with a national public safety license, including rebanding and spectrum license administration. The FCC outlines key elements for a public-private partnership, including a Public Safety Broadband Licensee and a Network Sharing Agreement. Commercial partners will use the shared network for consumer services, requiring incentives to meet higher standards. Incentives are needed to build a network meeting higher public safety standards, despite significant demand from businesses for secure and reliable mobile data access. The debate over the failed auction of the D Block license includes discussions on flaws in the auction structure and potential solutions for an interoperable public safety broadband network. The debate over the failed auction of the D Block license includes discussions on modifying auction rules to attract bidders for a public safety broadband network. Suggestions include eliminating FCC requirements, network sharing, and auctioning the license without public safety requirements. Federal funds could be used to build the network. The debate over the failed auction of the D Block license includes discussions on modifying auction rules to attract bidders for a public safety broadband network. Suggestions include using federal funds to build the network and choosing a different organizational structure for managing it. Congressional action is required to authorize expenditures for these solutions. The FCC seeks comments on various options and solutions for public safety interoperability. At a hearing on April 15, 2008, all five FCC commissioners affirmed their support for re-auctioning the D Block under rules that would produce a winning bidder and provide a commercial partner for public safety. The FCC intends to maintain and increase its oversight role in supervising the public-private partnership, with potential rule changes for the auction including modifications for the winning bidder or changes in the network sharing agreement. Another proposal is to re-auction the D Block without encumbrances. Some proposals suggest re-auctioning the D Block without encumbrances, including eliminating the network sharing agreement and offering it as a commercial license. There are recommendations to use surplus funds from auctions to build a public safety network, with FCC Chairman Kevin J. Martin mentioning the Public Safety Interoperability Implementation Act. The FCC Chairman and Commissioner prefer federal funding for a nationwide public safety network. Recommendations for using spectrum proceeds lack details on distribution. Some propose a shared network managed by multiple public safety partners. The public-private partnership aims to create an interoperable backbone at 700 MHz for public safety partners during emergencies. State and local agencies would be heavily involved in building and controlling access to their parts of the network. Commercial partners would lead in investment and technology decisions, working with numerous public safety collaborators. Licenses could be assigned to multiple commercial partners instead of a single D Block partner. Instead of a single D Block partner, licenses could be assigned to multiple commercial partners for local markets and rural coverage. The public safety partner would lead in designing the network and setting standards, with the FCC potentially playing a role in rule-making. Federal funds could be used to build parts of the interoperable backbone at 700 MHz. The federal government's role in structuring the agreement would be minimized in favor of greater support through funding. The federal government could ensure the economic viability of the public safety network by identifying federal programs as network customers. A federally chartered corporation or not-for-profit organization could hire professionals to operate the network, with funding coming from appropriations or other sources. The Public Safety Broadband License could remain with the current holder or be reassigned, with corporate laws and congressional oversight replacing FCC regulations. The FCC seeks to create a new public safety network at 700 MHz with Congress's help. Without additional authority, the FCC can only make changes to spectrum band plans, auction rules, service rules, and network sharing agreements. They are seeking input on various topics such as eligibility for using the Public Safety Broadband License and structuring the auction of the D Block. The FCC seeks input on various topics related to creating a new public safety network at 700 MHz, including the Network Sharing Agreement, auction of the D Block, relocation costs, service rules, and funding sources. The Public Safety Spectrum Trust would borrow $197 million for capital expenditures, with the FCC seeking opinions on funding for operating costs as well. The FCC is exploring funding options for the Public Safety Broadband Licensee, including the Universal Service Fund (USF) and the Telecommunications Development Fund (TDF). The USF supports rural telecommunications services through telephone bill assessments, while the TDF provides capital to small businesses in the telecom industry using interest from FCC-held deposits. Congressional amendments may be needed for the USF, and the TDF was established by the Telecommunications Act of 1996. The FCC establishes rules and provisions for spectrum auctions, including financial requirements for bidders and setting aside licenses. Service rules are also enforced, requiring licenses to be utilized within a specific timeframe and specifying technologies or users. For Auction 73, the FCC expanded service rules to include spectrum sharing mandates. The FCC expanded service rules for spectrum auctions to include spectrum sharing mandates between public safety and commercial licensees in preparation for the auction of licenses in the 700 MHz band. The regulatory framework for this public-private partnership sets binding requirements for organization, performance, and compliance. The FCC's regulatory framework mandates requirements for organization, performance, and compliance for three components: Public Safety Broadband Licensee, Commercial partner, and Network Sharing Agreement. All components must meet FCC guidelines, with contracts approved by the FCC and disputes resolved through litigation or FCC oversight. This overview highlights key issues for policy makers regarding public safety communications. The FCC allocated 24 MHz of spectrum in the 700 MHz band for public safety use during the transition to digital television. Planning for public safety use began in 1997 and concluded in 2003 with the submission of the final report by the Public Safety National Coordination Committee (NCC). The NCC, a Federal Advisory Committee to the FCC, developed technical and operational standards for the 700 MHz band and managed licenses through regional committees. The governance for these channels involves 55 Regional Planning Committees (RPCs) coordinated through the National Public Safety Telecommunications efforts. The FCC allocated 24 MHz of spectrum in the 700 MHz band for public safety use. The band plan has been revised to create two licensing approaches for narrowband and broadband applications. Channels have been reassigned to support narrowband operations in paired spectrum. RPCs with approved band plans must submit amended plans. Financing for networks on narrowband frequencies will follow existing procedures. The FCC allocated 24 MHz of spectrum in the 700 MHz band for public safety use, with financing for networks on narrowband frequencies following existing procedures. Spectrum will be allocated for broadband communications in 10 MHz of frequencies at 763 - 768 MHz and 793 - 798 MHz, with the Public Safety Broadband Licensee responsible for administering guard bands at 768 - 769 MHz and 798 - 799 MHz to prevent interference. Some public safety network operators may need to modify equipment for the new band plan, with costs potentially covered by the commercial D Block licensee. The FCC allocated 24 MHz of spectrum in the 700 MHz band for public safety use, with financing for networks on narrowband frequencies following existing procedures. Spectrum will be allocated for broadband communications in 10 MHz of frequencies at 763 - 768 MHz and 793 - 798 MHz, with the Public Safety Broadband Licensee responsible for administering guard bands at 768 - 769 MHz and 798 - 799 MHz to prevent interference. The public safety licensee would be obligated to meet requirements including forming a not-for-profit corporation, establishing standards, and participating in the Network Sharing Agreement. The cost of building the national network using the spectrum would be covered by its commercial partner. The FCC selected the Public Safety Broadband Licensee based on criteria such as not-for-profit status and broad representation of public safety entities. The Public Safety Spectrum Trust Corporation (PSST) was formed after receiving the public safety license, hiring Cyren Call Communications Corporation as its advisor. The PSST was awarded the nationwide Public Safety Broadband License, with a board of 13 members appointed by designated organizations and at-large members selected jointly by the FCC. The composition of the board was later changed by the FCC, adding three representatives from named organizations and increasing the number of at-large members to four. The FCC modified the composition of the PSST board, increasing the number of at-large members to four and eliminating NPSTC as a named member due to membership overlap. PSST, as the selected licensee, would need to submit quarterly financial reports to the FCC and meet specific criteria for its articles of incorporation and bylaws. The FCC would provide oversight as needed to ensure compliance. The FCC has reserved the right to re-assign the commercial license if necessary and revoke the license awarded to the Public Safety Broadband Licensee if it fails to meet its obligations. The public safety license would be valid for ten years unless revoked. The public safety license, valid for ten years from February 17, 2009, must end analog TV broadcasts on the 700 MHz band. Responsibilities include negotiating a Network Sharing Agreement with the commercial partner, administering network access for public safety users, representing their interests, and approving equipment specifications and applications. The licensee has the authority to approve equipment and applications for the network. State and local entities need approval before connecting to the broadband network. They also oversee the relocation of users due to rebanding and decide on allowing federal public safety agencies access. They review requests for wideband networks and facilitate negotiations for network sites on public land. The FCC ruled that eligible bidders for Block D in Auction 73 would receive a bidding credit based on their small business status. The D Block designates frequencies at 758 - 763 MHz and 788 - 793 MHz, totaling 10 MHz, and was offered as a single, nationwide license. The FCC set reserve prices for each block of licenses to be auctioned, suggesting a reserve price for the D Block. The FCC set a reserve price of $1.33 billion for the D Block license in Auction 73, which had a presumed value of $1.7 billion. The winning bidder would need to meet specific requirements, including a Network Sharing Agreement with the Public Safety Broadband Licensee. Negotiations for the agreement were to start after the bidder filed its long form application, with the agreement needing to be completed and approved by the FCC within six months. The FCC required a separate agreement for the D Block license, granting the Public Safety Broadband Licensee right of first refusal and the option to purchase network assets. The winning bidder must certify good faith negotiations within ten days and provide monthly reports after three months. FCC staff would observe negotiations. The FCC requires separate legal entities to hold the D Block license, own network assets, and operate the network. These entities must be \"bankruptcy remote\" and approved by the FCC. The commercial partner in the public-private partnership would be a corporate structure approved by the FCC. The public-private partnership for the D Block license involves a corporate structure with independent companies responsible for building the shared network. Failure to meet obligations could result in license revocation and penalties. The D Block license holder would pay a 10% penalty if successfully auctioned in Auction 73. The license would be valid for ten years, starting February 17, 2009. The licensee must comply with FCC rules to apply for renewal. A commercial corporation would build the public safety network, following FCC and Network Sharing Agreement requirements. Modifications may be allowed with approval from all parties, including the FCC. Population-based build-out benchmarks were established by the FCC. The FCC set population-based build-out benchmarks for the D Block license holder, requiring coverage of 75% of the population by 2013, 95% by 2016, and 99.3% by 2019. The licensee must provide a build-out schedule for major highways and communities over 3,000 people, with estimated costs. Failure to meet deadlines could result in license cancellation. The D Block licensee must meet population-based build-out benchmarks set by the FCC, with coverage requirements increasing over time. To enhance coverage in rural areas, they must offer a handset with integrated satellite solution for public safety use. The Network Sharing Agreement (NSA) outlines rules for service to public safety users and network performance, prohibiting service discontinuation without FCC approval. The FCC requires the D Block licensee to adhere to a Network Sharing Agreement (NSA) with the public safety licensee, outlining rules for service and network performance. The NSA must be approved by the FCC and include specifications for a platform providing broadband mobile voice, video, and data for public safety and commercial use. The FCC mandates that the D Block licensee must ensure communications interoperability, signal coverage meeting public safety standards, robustness for harsh conditions, sufficient capacity during emergencies, state-of-the-art security, and automatic prioritization of public safety communications over commercial uses in real time. Automatic prioritization of public safety communications over commercial uses in real time, with the highest priorities given to safety of life and property, and to homeland security. Public Safety Broadband Licensee has operational control of the network to ensure public safety requirements are met, including determining equipment specifications and purchasing subscriber equipment from any vendor. D Block Licensee must provide at least one integrated handset for public safety use on 700 MHz and satellite frequencies. Adoption of a common standard for interoperability. The FCC established guidelines for a Network Sharing Agreement between public safety and commercial licensees, including fee structures and duration of the agreement. Fees for normal network service and priority access during emergencies must be specified in the agreement. Negotiations should be conducted in good faith with financial incentives for the commercial licensee. The FCC established guidelines for a Network Sharing Agreement between public safety and commercial licensees, including fee structures and duration of the agreement. The fee structure would have financial incentives for the commercial licensee based on the number of subscribers from the public safety sector. Priority access fees would be structured to protect public safety participants from unforeseen payment obligations. The D Block licensee was expected to negotiate fees with its public safety partner in line with public safety goals. The NSA would be in effect for a term not to exceed ten years, beginning February 17, 2009. The NSA, in effect for up to ten years starting February 17, 2009, may be renewed with the D Block license. FCC approval is required for any modifications to the public-private partnership structure. The Public Safety Broadband Licensee can lease frequencies to the D Block licensee on a secondary basis. The D Block network commercial users have secondary access to transmit on public safety band frequencies when not in use by primary users. This access is part of a public-private partnership agreement where the D Block licensee leases spectrum from the Public Safety Broadband Licensee and builds a network for public safety use. The FCC requires a spectrum manager leasing arrangement for the ten-year license term, placing compliance responsibility on the D Block license holder. The D Block licensee must ensure public safety users are not affected by commercial operations in the public safety spectrum band. The network should prioritize first responders with immediate preemption or exclusion from commercial users. Public safety has the right to real-time emergency access to the spectrum licensed to the D Block. The definition of an emergency would be part of the Network Sharing Agreement. The FCC revised the band plan for public safety networks in the 700 MHz band to accommodate both narrowband and broadband networks. They also resolved spectrum management issues and made decisions to move networks in the preliminary stages of build out. The D Block licensee is required to pay for technical adjustments to equipment and software. The FCC revised the band plan for public safety networks in the 700 MHz band to accommodate both narrowband and broadband networks. The D Block licensee is required to pay for technical adjustments to equipment and software, capped at $10 million. Prohibit new operations of narrowband systems on 700 MHz public safety networks that will be relocated. Limit building and use of wideband networks. The FCC mandated the rebanding of 700 MHz capacity for broadband use by February 17, 2009. Motorola estimated the rebanding cost at $9.45 million, with a reimbursement cap of $10 million set by the FCC to control costs. The D Block licensee is responsible for covering the rebanding expenses. The FCC set a reimbursement cap of $10 million for rebanding costs, with a cut-off date of August 30, 2007. To control costs, only existing systems and radios were covered. The estimated cost was around $6 million, based on Motorola's assumptions. New operations on affected frequencies were prohibited after the cut-off date to further control expenses. Rules were established for calculating actual costs and reimbursements. The negotiation of the Network Sharing Agreement between the public safety licensee and the commercial D Block licensee must be approved by the FCC. They need to agree on a relocation plan and costs for rebanding within 30 days. Displaced public safety network operators must provide specific information for reimbursement, including details on mobile and portable handsets, base stations, and operational areas. The D Block licensee is responsible for certain obligations. The D Block licensee is responsible for reimbursing only the minimum cost for necessary changes to base stations, mobiles, and portables, not for unrelated improvements. The FCC does not require the D Block licensee to cover costs related to reassigning channels or changes to Regional Planning Committee plans. Some reimbursement may be possible for the Public Safety Broadband Licensee's costs related to the rebanding program, with a cap not exceeding $10 million. The D Block licensee and public safety licensee must agree on total costs for changes due to rebanding, to be included in the required relocation plan submitted to the FCC. The FCC requires agreement on negotiated prices between license holders and equipment vendors. Payments must be made into a trust account by the Public Safety Broadband Licensee before the Network Sharing Agreement is executed. The winning bidder for the D Block license is provisional until FCC requirements are met. Public safety network operators need a waiver to operate wideband systems. The FCC requires a waiver for public safety network operators to operate wideband systems within narrowband frequencies. The waiver request must include an application for authorization, confirmation from the Public Safety Broadband Licensee, agreed-upon conditions of operation, a transition plan to the broadband network, and certification of no reimbursement sought from the D Block licensee for future transition costs. Wideband devices must be interoperable with the broadband network, and licenses for wideband operations are valid for five years. The FCC assigned itself the role of champion and protector for public safety interests and nationwide emergency communications in the Second Report and Order. The FCC, under the Communications Act, monitors and regulates the Public Safety Broadband Licensee and D Block license holder. It oversees the network with an asset value in the tens of billions of dollars, controlled by the Public Safety Broadband Licensee's Board of Directors. Congressional oversight is within the jurisdiction of telecommunications committees. The FCC plans to enforce regulations for the public-private partnership, with four board members appointed by the FCC. Congress would provide guidance to FCC commissioners, with two bills introduced in the 110th Congress addressing specific issues. The Public Safety Broadband Authorization Act of 2008 would allocate $1 million for operating expenses. The Public Safety Broadband Authorization Act of 2008 would allocate funds for operating expenses of the Public Safety Broadband Licensee in the form of grants by the FCC. An additional $2 million would be authorized for promoting the establishment of a nationwide, interoperable broadband public safety communications network. The bill imposes limits on the activities of the public safety license-holder, including requirements such as not-for-profit status and no participation by a commercial entity in its management. The RESPONDER Act of 2008 would create a trust fund to provide grants for purchasing interoperable radios for the new public safety network. The RESPONDER Act of 2008 proposes placing proceeds from the D Block Auction into a Trust for funding interoperable radios for the public safety network. Additional funds would come from future auctions to ensure revenue generation."
