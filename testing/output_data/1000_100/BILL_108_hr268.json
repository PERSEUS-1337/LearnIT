The United States Weather Research Program, established under the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Authorization Act of 1992, focuses on hurricanes, floods, heavy precipitation, improving weather forecasts, quick progress in impactful areas, and collaborative scientific efforts. The United States Weather Research Program focuses on hurricanes, floods, heavy precipitation, improving weather forecasts, and collaborative scientific efforts through research grants to universities and research institutions. The United States Weather Research Program focuses on hurricanes, floods, heavy precipitation, improving weather forecasts, and collaborative scientific efforts through research grants to universities and research institutions. SEC. 3. PROGRAM RESEARCH PRIORITIES. The research priorities of the United States Weather Research Program focus on improving forecasts for hurricanes, heavy precipitation, floods, and two-to-fourteen day forecasting to enhance prediction accuracy and warning systems for high-impact weather events. The United States Weather Research Program focuses on improving forecasts for high-impact weather events through weather predictions, conducting research experiments to fill observational gaps, testing advanced data assimilation techniques, and assessing societal and economic impacts of adverse weather. The United States Weather Research Program aims to connect weather research with improving human conditions by testing research concepts at test bed centers for technology transfer to operational meteorologists. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration leads the United States Weather Research Program and collaborates with other federal agencies and entities to develop a five-year plan focusing on teaming with research institutions, identifying weather information needs, disseminating information, and transferring research results to forecasting operations. SEC. 5. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.\n\nThe Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration must provide an annual report to specific congressional committees, detailing the five-year plan, funding sources, any plan changes, and an assessment of plan objectives.\n\nSEC. 6. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. The Office of Atmospheric Research of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is authorized funding for fiscal years 2004, 2005, and 2006, totaling $15 million, $15.5 million, and $16 million respectively. At least 50 percent of the funding is designated for competitive grants, contracts, or agreements with higher education institutions.
