    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Consumer Assurance of Radiologic Excellence Act of 2003\". Congress finds that over 300 million medical imaging exams and radiation therapy treatments are conducted annually in the US, with 7 out of 10 Americans undergoing these procedures each year. The impact of these procedures on public health and safety, as well as interstate commerce, is significant. It is crucial to minimize unnecessary radiation exposure by ensuring that personnel performing these procedures have the appropriate education and credentials. The importance of having adequately educated and certified personnel for medical imaging and radiation therapy procedures is emphasized for public health and safety. Competence should be demonstrated through education, training, and experience, with responsibilities shared between State and Federal Governments. Facilities conducting medical imaging and radiation therapy impact interstate commerce as patients travel across state lines for services. Congress enacted the Consumer-Patient Radiation Health and Safety Act of 1981 to set federal standards for education programs and certification of personnel in this field. Twenty-two years after the Consumer-Patient Radiation Health and Safety Act of 1981, some States do not require licensure for medical imaging and radiation therapy personnel. States have varying regulations for radiographers, radiation therapists, nuclear medicine technologists, medical physicists, and medical dosimetrists. The Act aims to accredit education programs and license individuals who perform patient dose evaluations for medical imaging and radiation therapy. It also ensures the safety and accuracy of these treatments. The Public Health Service Act is amended to include a new section on the quality of medical imaging and radiation therapy. This ensures the safety and accuracy of treatments in these areas. The Secretary will establish standards for the safety and accuracy of medical imaging and radiation therapy, including licensure, certification, and accreditation. Exemptions apply to physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants. Individuals must pass a national examination approved by the Secretary before performing such imaging or therapy. The Secretary will certify private nonprofit organizations or State agencies as approved bodies for accrediting educational programs or administering examinations in medical imaging or radiation therapy. Minimum standards will be established for certification, including recordkeeping and approval of curricula and instructors. The Secretary will certify private nonprofit organizations or State agencies as approved bodies for accrediting educational programs or administering examinations in medical imaging or radiation therapy. Organizations must comply with standards, notify the Secretary of any changes, and provide required information to maintain certification. The Secretary has the authority to withdraw certification if necessary. The Secretary can withdraw certification of an approved body if it does not meet standards. Accreditation or completion of exams by the body remains valid for a reasonable period. Existing State standards for personnel licensure, program accreditation, and exam administration will be recognized. The Secretary will evaluate approved bodies periodically and include the results in a report to specific committees. Regulations for service delivery and payment must be established within 18 months of the section's enactment. The Secretary will promulgate regulations to ensure that medical imaging and radiation therapy programs under their authority meet established standards. Alternative standards may be developed for rural areas to ensure access to quality care. The Secretary will promulgate regulations within 18 months to implement standards for medical imaging and radiation therapy programs. An approved body is defined as a nonprofit organization or State agency certified to accredit individuals in medical imaging. The term 'perform' in medical imaging or radiation therapy refers to directly exposing a patient to radiation or a magnetic field for imaging or therapy purposes, as well as positioning the patient for exposure. The term 'plan' involves preparing for the procedure by evaluating site-specific information. Radiation therapy involves customizing procedures for patients based on radiation dose distribution data or direct measurement, aiming to cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent disease through radiation emission."
