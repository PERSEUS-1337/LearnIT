    "content": "The child nutrition programs, overseen by the USDA-FNS, include the NSLP, SBP, Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program, Special Milk Program, Child and Adult Care Food Program, and Summer Food Service Program. These programs provide meals and snacks to children in various institutional settings. The programs were last reauthorized by the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 expired in 2015, but child nutrition programs continued with funding from annual appropriations. In the 114th Congress, reauthorization legislation was introduced but did not pass, affecting statutes like the National School Lunch Act and Child Nutrition Act. The 114th Congress saw the end of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010, with no significant child nutrition reauthorization efforts in the 115th Congress. However, the 2018 farm bill included provisions related to child nutrition programs, raising issues for future reauthorization efforts or policymaking opportunities. These issues revolve around the nutritional quality and sourcing of foods in schools, access to meals, and implementation of programs like the Community Eligibility Provision. This report provides an overview of current issues in child nutrition programs, including topics such as on-site consumption in summer meals and the Community Eligibility Provision. Stakeholders involved in these issues include school food authorities, advocacy organizations, and food industry groups. The report does not cover every issue but highlights recent concerns raised by Congress and program stakeholders. References to more detailed information are provided for further reading. The child nutrition programs, including school meals, must meet specific requirements for federal reimbursement, such as nutritional standards. These standards were last updated under the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act (HHFKA), which also mandated new nutrition standards for competitive foods. USDA was required to issue proposed regulations for these standards. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act (HHFKA) mandated new nutrition standards for school meals and competitive foods. USDA had to issue proposed regulations within specific timeframes, with increased federal subsidies for compliant schools. The final rules were based on Dietary Guidelines for Americans and recommendations from the Institute of Medicine. The updated standards for school meals increased fruits, vegetables, and whole grains while limiting calories, sodium, and proteins. They also restricted milk to low-fat options and imposed requirements for senior high school students to choose fruits or vegetables with meals. Nutrition standards for competitive foods included limits on calories, sodium, and fat, applying only to non-meal items sold during the school day. The meal standards phased in during school years 2012-2013 and 2014-2015, with challenges reported in implementation such as difficulty obtaining whole grain and low-sodium products, student acceptance issues, reduced participation, increased costs, and food waste. The School Nutrition Association (SNA) and studies by the U.S. Government Accountability Office and USDA confirmed these issues in the first two years of implementation. SNA advocated for changes to the standards. In the first two years of implementation, challenges were reported in implementing meal standards, including difficulty obtaining whole grain and low-sodium products, student acceptance issues, reduced participation, increased costs, and food waste. The School Nutrition Association (SNA) advocated for changes to the standards, while other groups argued for maintaining them for children's health. USDA made changes to the standards over the years, including removing weekly limits on grains and protein, loosening milk, whole grain, and sodium requirements, and allowing flavored, low-fat milk in school meals starting in SY2019-2020. The nutrition standards for school meals have been modified over time, including changes to whole grain, milk, and sodium requirements. Exemptions are allowed for nonwhole grain-rich products, and sodium limits have been adjusted. Competitive food standards remain largely unchanged. Legislative proposals have been considered in relation to these standards. Legislative proposals in the 115th Congress aimed to revise nutrition standards for school meals and competitive foods. The House-passed version of the 2018 farm bill would have required USDA to review and update the standards, focusing on research for school-age children, cost considerations, and maintaining healthy meals for students. Similar proposals were also considered in the 114th Congress. The Senate committee's proposal aimed to revise school meal standards, including whole grain and sodium requirements. Negotiations resulted in reducing the whole grain-rich requirement to 80% and delaying the Target 2 sodium requirement. Fruit and vegetable snacks in FFVP must be fresh according to current law. According to USDA guidance, fresh fruits and vegetable snacks served in FFVP must be in their natural state without additives. A pilot project funded by the 2014 farm bill incorporated canned, dried, and frozen fruits and vegetables in FFVP in select states. Stakeholders have debated whether to include non-fresh products in the program. During a pilot project funded by the 2014 farm bill, schools introduced dried and canned fruits in the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program (FFVP), leading to decreased vegetable offerings and increased fruit offerings. However, there was no significant impact on students' vegetable consumption, while fruit consumption declined on FFVP snack days. Student satisfaction with FFVP slightly decreased, parents' responses were mixed, and school administrators generally favored the changes. Legislative proposals have been considered to allow non-fresh forms of fruits and vegetables in the FFVP. In the 114th Congress, child nutrition reauthorization legislation proposed allowing schools in the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program (FFVP) to serve \"all forms\" of fruits and vegetables, including tree nuts. The Senate committee's proposal included temporary exemptions for schools with limited resources to serve canned or dried fruits and vegetables in FFVP. Schools in the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and School Breakfast Program (SBP) must comply with federal requirements for sourcing foods domestically. The Buy American requirements for schools participating in the NSLP and/or SBP mandate purchasing domestic commodities or products to the maximum extent practicable. This means products must be produced and processed substantially in the United States, with over 51% domestically grown ingredients. USDA has issued guidance on implementing these requirements, with the most recent guidance from June 2017. The USDA-FNS guidance from June 2017 emphasizes Buy American requirements for school food service accounts, encouraging SFAs to integrate these requirements into their procurement processes. Exceptions can be made when U.S. products are not available in sufficient quantities or when their costs are significantly higher than non-domestic products. The 2018 farm bill requires USDA to enforce Buy American requirements for school food service accounts, ensuring full compliance and understanding of responsibilities within 180 days of enactment. USDA must also submit a report to Congress on actions taken and plans for compliance. Domestic products are defined as those processed in the U.S. The 2018 farm bill mandates USDA to enforce Buy American requirements for school food service accounts, defining domestic products as those processed in the U.S. Proponents advocate for stricter sourcing due to economic and food safety concerns, particularly regarding China. Some argue for maintaining schools' discretion in food procurement. Summer meals are typically provided in group settings for supervised children. The Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) and the National School Lunch Program's Summer Seamless Option (SSO) provide meals in group settings for supervised children. Policymakers have explored alternatives to congregate meals, especially in rural areas where onsite consumption is challenging. The 2010 Agriculture Appropriations Act allocated $85 million for demonstration projects to improve access to food for children during the summer, including the Summer Electronic Benefit Transfer for Children program. The Summer Electronic Benefit Transfer for Children (SEBTC or Summer EBT) project provides electronic food benefits to households with children eligible for free or reduced-price school meals. Participants receive $30 or $60 per month on an EBT card for WIC or SNAP. Participants in SNAP jurisdictions can redeem benefits for SNAP-eligible foods at any retailer, while WIC EBT participants are limited to WIC-eligible foods at WIC-authorized retailers. The Summer EBT project provides electronic food benefits to households with children eligible for free or reduced-price school meals. An evaluation from FY2011 to FY2013 showed a decrease in very low food security among participants and improved consumption of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Congress has provided funding for Summer EBT projects, with $28 million allocated in the FY2019 Consolidated Appropriations Act. Awardees for summer 2017 included Connecticut, Delaware, Michigan, Missouri, Nevada, Oregon, Virginia, and the Chickasaw and Cherokee nations. In FY2019, USDA prioritized new states for Summer EBT grants. There were proposals in Congress to expand the program, including using SFSP funding and discretionary funds. The Obama Administration recommended nationwide expansion over 10 years. The Obama Administration recommended nationwide expansion of the Enhanced Summer Food Service Program (eSFSP) over 10 years, with funding from the 2010 Agriculture Appropriations Act. The eSFSP included initiatives such as lengthening operations, adding recreational or educational activities, meal delivery for children in rural areas, and food backpacks. Evaluations showed increased summer meal participation rates and consistent rates of food insecurity for children in the meal delivery and backpack demonstrations. The 2010 Agriculture Appropriations Act funded the Enhanced Summer Food Service Program (eSFSP) initiatives, including meal delivery and backpack programs. Evaluations showed increased summer meal participation rates and consistent food insecurity rates. Another project provided exemptions from congregate feeding requirements for outdoor meal sites experiencing excessive heat since 2015. USDA offers exemptions for extreme weather conditions, but this demonstration has not been evaluated. Other proposals and hearings on congregate feeding in SFSP have been discussed in recent years. In recent years, there have been proposals and hearings related to congregate feeding in the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP). The 114th Congress considered child nutrition reauthorization proposals that would have allowed rural meal sites to provide SFSP meals for offsite consumption. The proposals also included provisions for congregate feeding sites to provide meals to be consumed offsite episodically under certain conditions. Additionally, the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act (HHFKA) created the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) to provide free meals to students in schools with high proportions of students in need. The Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) provides free meals to students in schools with high proportions of students in need. Participation has increased since its nationwide availability in SY2014-2015, with over 20,700 schools participating as of SY2016-2017. CEP has been supported for improving meal access, reducing stigma, and lowering administrative costs. Some have sought changes, such as restricting schools' eligibility in the 114th Congress. The Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) aims to target resources to students in need while ensuring eligible students receive assistance. However, CEP has caused data issues for other federal and state programs, like the Title I-A program, which use free and reduced-price lunch data for eligibility and funding. This has led to concerns about students owing money for meals. In recent years, schools have faced issues with students not paying for their meals, leading to practices like \"lunch shaming\" where students are given alternative meals or face other consequences until the debt is repaid. Instances of lunch shaming have been reported in various states, but national data on the prevalence of such practices is limited. Unpaid meal costs create challenges for many school districts. Many school districts struggle with unpaid meal costs, which create financial burdens on their meal programs. Student payments for meals are crucial for school food programs, and if these funds are not recovered, schools must cover the costs using nonfederal funding sources. Congress and USDA have taken actions since 2010 to address this issue, including examining states' and school districts' policies on unpaid meal charges. The USDA's report in June 2016 did not recommend national standards for meal charges but suggested updating policy guidance and distributing best practices to address unpaid meal charges. SFAs were required to implement a written meal charge policy by July 1, 2017, with instructions on handling situations where a child does not pay for a meal. USDA-FNS provided further clarification through webinars and memoranda. The USDA's report in June 2016 did not recommend national standards for meal charges but suggested updating policy guidance and distributing best practices to address unpaid meal charges. Findings from a study and a Request for Information (RFI) showed that meal charge policies were mainly determined at the school and district levels. Responses to the RFI indicated a preference for local control of meal charge policies by school and district officials, while national advocacy groups favored national standards. Lunch shaming and unpaid meal costs were also discussed in the 115th Congress. In the 115th Congress, discussions on lunch shaming and unpaid meal costs led to legislative proposals like the Anti-Lunch Shaming Act of 2017. States have also taken action, such as Illinois passing legislation in 2018 to address these issues. In 2018, Illinois passed legislation requiring schools to provide regular meals to students who do not pay and allowing districts to seek state assistance for debts over $500. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act (HHFKA) imposed new rules on pricing of paid lunches for National School Lunch Program (NSLP) participants to ensure full value of federal funds for free and reduced-price lunches. SFAs could raise prices or use nonfederal funds to meet the requirements. The study found that federal subsidies for free and reduced-price lunches were cross-subsidizing other aspects of the meals programs. Federal reimbursements for free, reduced-price, and paid lunches are all mixed into the same nonprofit school food service account. Schools must increase prices for paid lunches to match federal reimbursements, or exceed the difference. For example, in SY2018-2019, the federal reimbursement was $3.37 for free lunches and $0.37 for paid lunches. If schools were not charging at least $3.00 per paid lunch, they would be required to gradually increase the price based on a formula. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act required schools to gradually increase the price of paid lunches to close the gap in federal reimbursements. Revenue from competitive foods had to go to the school food service account, with costs equaling or exceeding revenue. USDA provided flexibility in implementing the requirements starting in SY2011-2012. USDA provided exemptions for schools with strong financial standing for SY2013-2014 to SY2017-2018. For SY2018-2019, only schools with negative NSFSA balances by January 31, 2018, may have to raise meal prices. Legislative proposals aimed to change paid lunch equity requirements, with the House proposing elimination and the Senate suggesting a non-federal revenue target.
