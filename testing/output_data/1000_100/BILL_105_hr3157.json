    "content": "The \"Teachers in the Classroom Act\" may be cited as the short title. The findings section is included in the Act. Congress finds that enrollment in elementary and secondary schools is at record levels, with an expected increase of over a million students in 1998. The increase in student enrollment will continue for the next decade, particularly affecting high poverty urban and rural areas and states with rapid population growth. Schools will need to expand to accommodate the growing number of students. Schools will need to hire 150,000 additional teachers in the next decade to address the increase in student enrollment. Research shows that students in smaller classes learn more in the early grades and continue to outperform their peers even after returning to normal-sized classrooms. It is crucial to adequately educate and prepare students for the future and global economy. Congress must provide resources to improve the learning environment for students, hire new teachers without increasing bureaucracy, and fund positions to keep pace with growing enrollment and reduce classroom sizes. The grant program is established to provide resources for improving the learning environment, hiring new teachers, and reducing classroom sizes. The Secretary of Education can award grants to Governors for hiring teachers to reduce overcrowded classes. Governors must apply to receive the grant, and local educational agencies must establish a trust fund for the funds received. The Act requires funds to be deposited in a trust fund account and used to hire new teachers within 2 years. The agency must follow accounting practices set by the Governor, allow access to records, and ensure a net gain in teachers. Personnel hired must be reviewed annually for qualifications. The agency must hire qualified personnel for a one-year period, repay any unspent funds to the State within 27 months, use funds to supplement, not supplant, non-Federal sources for student education, and apply for funding annually from the Governor.
