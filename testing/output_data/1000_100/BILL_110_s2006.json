    "content": "The \"Rate Payer Recovery Act of 2007\" may provide disaster assistance for power transmission and distribution facilities. The \"Rate Payer Recovery Act of 2007\" may provide disaster assistance for privately-owned or investor-owned power facilities that provide electric or natural gas service to retail customers under State or local jurisdiction, including leased facilities. Conditions for contributions under the Act are also amended. The \"Rate Payer Recovery Act of 2007\" may provide disaster assistance for privately-owned or investor-owned power facilities damaged by a major disaster for repair, restoration, reconstruction, or replacement, including associated expenses. Conditions for assistance to these facilities are outlined in the Act. The term \"previous major disaster\" refers to a disaster that occurred before the current one and was declared within the last 10 years. The President can provide assistance to private or investor-owned power facilities only if certain conditions are met. The President can provide assistance to private or investor-owned power facilities if the cost of repairing, restoring, or replacing the facilities exceeded $2,500 per retail customer, the total costs exceeded $500,000,000, and 25% or more of the facilities were affected by the previous major disaster declared within the last 10 years. Private or investor-owned power facilities may apply for Federal assistance if 25% or more of the population in the area had taxable income below the Federal poverty level in the year before the previous major disaster. Application for funds must be made within 30 days of a major disaster declaration. Private or investor-owned power facilities affected by a major disaster can receive Federal assistance once they contribute $10,000,000 towards repair or replacement costs. Federal aid is limited to expenses exceeding $10,000,000 directly incurred by the owner. The Federal government can provide assistance to private or investor-owned power facilities affected by a major disaster by aggregating costs of previous disasters and approving applications within 30 days. Additionally, the Federal share for repair or replacement costs includes private or investor-owned power facilities. The Federal government can provide assistance to private or investor-owned power facilities affected by a major disaster by offering in-lieu contributions equal to 75 percent of the Federal estimate for repair or replacement costs. The Federal government can provide assistance to private or investor-owned power facilities affected by a major disaster by offering funds for repair, restoration, expansion, construction of new facilities, or hazard mitigation measures. The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act is amended to include private or investor-owned power facilities as eligible for assistance in case of a major disaster. The Secretary of Homeland Security must create regulations within 180 days of this Act's enactment to implement the Act and its amendments. The Act and its amendments will take effect 60 days after enactment, with Section 3 taking effect immediately."
