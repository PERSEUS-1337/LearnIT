    "content": "The \"Iran Export Embargo Act\" is cited as the short title. The Iran Freedom and Counter-Proliferation Act of 2012 is amended to impose sanctions on the government of Iran. The Government of Iran is found to violate human rights and sponsor terrorism, including recent involvement in various terrorist activities worldwide. The Government of Iran violates UN Security Council Resolutions by refusing to suspend nuclear activities, developing ballistic missiles, transferring arms to terrorist groups in Lebanon and Gaza. The Government of Iran supports Syria in committing human rights abuses and crimes against humanity. The President will block transactions involving property of individuals involved and impose restrictions on foreign financial institutions facilitating such transactions. The President will impose sanctions on individuals who conduct significant transactions with Iran after a certain date. Sanctions will also be imposed on those who import, purchase, or transfer goods or services from Iran. The President may impose sanctions on individuals providing underwriting services or insurance to certain persons under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Sanctions may be avoided if due diligence is exercised in establishing policies to prevent such transactions. The President can impose sanctions on individuals providing insurance to entities related to the Government of Iran, including the Central Bank of Iran. Sanctions apply regardless of public listing in the Federal Register. The person's name can be published in the Federal Register or added to the list of specially designated nationals and blocked persons by the Office of Foreign Assets Control. Sanctions on crude oil exports from Iran will apply 180 days after the enactment of the Act."
