    "content": "Congress has been grappling with reauthorizing the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA) for over five years. The IHCIA authorizes various specific Indian Health Service (IHS) programs, including health professional recruitment, mental health services, urban Indian health services, and construction of health facilities. Despite the expiration of authorizations of appropriations for IHCIA programs in FY2001, Congress continues to fund these programs. Funds for Indian health programs have been a topic of debate in Congress for years. Proposed changes to the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA) have faced resistance from HHS and other agencies. Multiple reauthorization bills have been introduced in Congress, with the latest bills being S. 1057 and H.R. 5312. Additionally, a Senate Finance Committee bill, S. 3524, addressing Indian health provisions in Medicaid, Medicare, and SCHIP, was reported in July. The federal government faces a multi-billion-dollar problem with Indian trust funds, leading to financial claims of up to $176 billion by Indian individuals and tribes. This issue has resulted in the reorganization of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Office of Special Trustee for American Indians. Trust lands total about 56 million acres, with funds totaling $3.3 billion in asset value. The Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Office of Special Trustee for American Indians manage trust lands totaling 56 million acres and funds with an asset value of $3.3 billion. The Treasury Department oversees about 1,400 tribal accounts and more than 260,000 Individual Indian Money (IIM) accounts. The BIA has faced criticism for its management of trust lands and funds, leading to the enactment of the American Indian Trust Fund Management Reform Act of 1994. This act directed the Secretary of the Interior to account for trust fund balances and created the OST to oversee trust management reforms. The 1994 American Indian Trust Fund Management Reform Act led to a class action suit against U.S. officials for mismanagement of IIM accounts. This resulted in the reorganization of the BIA and OST, with congressional consideration of settling IIM and tribal claims. The district court found DOI and Treasury breached trust duties and ordered them to bring trust management up to current standards. The court ordered DOI and Treasury to update trust management to current standards. The lawsuit will determine the amount owed to IIM plaintiffs, with DOI proposing a limited historical accounting method while plaintiffs suggest a more comprehensive approach. DOI estimated losses in the tens of millions, while plaintiffs' methods show losses of over $100 billion. The district court has ordered a historical accounting of all IIM trust account transactions and assets since 1887. The DOI was ordered to perform a historical accounting of all IIM trust account transactions and assets since 1887, estimated to cost $12-13 billion. The U.S. Court of Appeals overturned the district court's order twice. Congress has addressed the Cobell suit through oversight hearings and provisions in Interior appropriation acts. No bills have been introduced to amend the 1994 Act. Congress has not introduced any bills to amend the 1994 Act regarding the historical accounting obligation in the Cobell lawsuit. Concerns exist about the costs impacting DOI trust reform, Indian programs, and funding challenges. Current expenses include ongoing litigation costs, with potential future costs ranging from $12-$13 billion for historical accounting to over $100 billion for IIM accounts. Funding sources may include discretionary appropriations and the Treasury Department's \"Judgment Fund.\" The Treasury Department's \"Judgment Fund\" may not be enough for a $12-$13 billion settlement. Congress has introduced two bills in the 109th Congress, S. 1439 and H.R. 4322, to establish an IIM accounting-claim settlement fund. Payments would be distributed to IIM claimants under a formula determined by the Treasury Secretary. Other provisions include creating a commission to review Indian trust asset management and combining BIA and OST under a new Under Secretary for Indian Affairs. The Senate Indian Affairs Committee held hearings on bills S. 1439 and H.R. 4322 in 2005 and 2006. H.R. 4322 is pending further committee action. An amended S. 1439 with an $8 billion settlement amount was scheduled for mark-up but withdrawn for more negotiations. The DOI, BIA, and OST are proposing organizational changes. The DOI, BIA, and OST have made administrative changes to implement trust management reform since the 1994 Act. A significant change was the 1996 transfer of trust fund management from BIA to OST. In 2003, a reorganization split BIA trust management operations from other services, creating OST field operations to oversee trust management. Tribal leaders and Cobell plaintiffs oppose the reorganization, citing lack of consultation and unclear new OST duties. The DOI responded that it consulted with tribes for a year before reorganizing trust management procedures. Attempts to stop the reorganization in Congress have failed, with bills proposing changes in trust management not progressing. S. 1439 and H.R. 4322 aim to reorganize DOI management of Indian trust assets. IGRA prohibits gaming on trust lands acquired after 1988, but allows exceptions for certain tribes, newly recognized tribes, restored tribes, and land-claim settlements. Critics argue that these exceptions lead to \"reservation shopping\" and undermine on-reservation economic development intended by Congress. Bills have been introduced to curb these exceptions. Two bills, S. 2078 and H.R. 4893, aim to limit exceptions to tribal petitions for federal acknowledgment. They remove the requirement for secretarial and gubernatorial agreement but allow applications filed before specific dates to proceed. H.R. 4893 adds a geographic limitation, while both bills retain exceptions for tribes without reservations in 1988, newly recognized tribes, and restored tribes with certain limitations. H.R. 4893 repeals the land claim exception and adds a new exception for tribes landless at the time of enactment. Opponents have raised objections. The bills S. 2078 and H.R. 4893 aim to limit exceptions to tribal petitions for federal acknowledgment. H.R. 4893 adds new burdens on newly recognized, restored, and landless tribes, with opponents objecting to the requirement for mitigation agreements as a subjection of tribal sovereignty to local governments. Native Hawaiians are not considered Indians under federal law but have federal programs authorized for their benefit. Supporters of Native Hawaiian recognition are concerned about the lack of a recognized political entity, which puts federal and state programs at risk. Three bills in the 109th Congress aim to establish a process for federal recognition of a Native Hawaiian political entity, requiring congressional action. The bills defer decisions on governmental powers and lands, and exclude the entity from BIA programs. Proponents argue that Congress has the power to recognize a Native Hawaiian political entity due to its constitutional authority over indigenous native peoples in the United States. They point to established Native Hawaiian programs, such as the Hawaiian homelands program, as evidence of this recognition. Certain public lands are reserved for lease only to Native Hawaiians, who argue that they have not given up their claims to sovereignty. Opponents dispute Congress's authority to recognize a Native Hawaiian political entity, citing concerns over constitutionality and special responsibilities of the United States. Opponents argue against the recognition of a Native Hawaiian political entity, claiming it would be based on race alone and could set a precedent for other non-Indian groups. The U.S. Civil Rights Commission also raised concerns about racial discrimination. Some opponents dispute claims of Native Hawaiian sovereignty, stating that it ended before 1893. Bills similar to S. 147 and H.R. 309, which address Native Hawaiian sovereignty, have been considered in previous Congresses. S. 147 was reported by the Senate Indian Affairs Committee in 2005 but failed to proceed in 2006. H.R. 309 has not been reported in the House. The House Judiciary Committee also held a hearing on constitutional issues related to H.R. 309."
