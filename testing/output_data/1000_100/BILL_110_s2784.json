    "content": "The Act may be cited as the Howard M. Metzenbaum \"Menu Education and Labeling Act\" or the \"MEAL Act\". Congress acknowledges the strong link between diet and health, with diet-related diseases starting early in life. Increased caloric intake is a key factor contributing to the rise in obesity rates in the United States. Obesity is associated with various health risks, including diabetes, heart disease, and cancer, costing the country billions annually. Over the past 2 decades, there has been a significant increase in meals prepared or eaten outside the home, with a third of calories and almost half of total food dollars spent on restaurant food. Excess saturated fat intake is a major risk factor for heart disease, the leading cause of death in the United States. Heart disease also leads to significant healthcare expenditures and lost productivity. Increased sodium intake is linked to high blood pressure, which can lead to cardiovascular disease, especially stroke. The Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 requires food manufacturers to provide nutrition information on packaged foods, but restaurant foods are exempt unless a nutrient content or health claim is made. About 75% of adults use food labels on packaged foods, leading to healthier diets, and half of people change their minds about buying a food product based on nutrition information. Consumers struggle to control calorie intake at restaurants due to limited nutrition information availability. Studies suggest providing nutrition information at the point of ordering can help consumers make informed choices. Surgeon General and Secretary of Health recommend increasing access to nutrition information to combat obesity. SEC. 3. NUTRITION LABELING OF STANDARD MENU ITEMS AT CHAIN RESTAURANTS. Section 403(q)(5) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to include regulations for restaurants and retail food establishments with 20 or more locations under the same trade name. The restaurant or establishment with 20 or more locations under the same trade name must disclose calorie, fat, and sodium content of standard food servings on menus or equivalent means as specified by the Secretary. The regulation requires restaurants with 20 or more locations to disclose calorie, fat, and sodium content on menus or signs for public understanding. The regulation mandates that restaurants with 20 or more locations must display calorie, fat, and sodium content on menus or signs for public awareness. Additionally, certain food items like condiments and daily specials are exempt from this requirement. Self-service facilities must have a sign listing calories per standard serving for each food offered. Regulations allow restaurants to voluntarily provide additional nutrition information that complies with labeling requirements. States can also require restaurants to provide extra nutrition information. Proposed regulations must be enacted within one year of the clause's enactment. The Secretary must promulgate proposed regulations within one year of the clause's enactment, allowing for variations in serving sizes and food preparation. Final regulations must be implemented within 2 years, failure to do so will result in consequences. The final regulations under item (III) must be implemented within 2 years of the clause's enactment. Proposed regulations for vending machines must allow for examination of food articles before purchase. The vending machine operator must display the calorie count of the article. Additional nutrition information can be voluntarily provided by the operator, as long as it complies with the requirements. State or local regulations regarding nutrition information for vending machines are not precluded. The Secretary must propose regulations within 1 year and finalize them within 2 years to implement the requirement for vending machine operators to provide nutrition information. State or local regulations on nutrition information for vending machines are allowed. If the Secretary fails to finalize regulations within 2 years, the proposed regulations will automatically become effective as final regulations, and the Secretary must publish a notice in the Federal Register."
