    "content": "CROP DISASTER ASSISTANCE. In this section, definitions are provided for terms like additional coverage, insurable commodity, and noninsurable commodity under the Federal Crop Insurance Act. Emergency financial assistance is also discussed, overriding a specific section of the Act. In accordance with the Federal Crop Insurance Act, the Secretary of Agriculture can provide emergency financial assistance to producers who have suffered crop losses due to weather conditions in 2003 or 2004. The assistance will be administered similarly to a previous Act, with specific loss thresholds for quantity and quality losses. Ineligibility for Assistance: Producers on a farm are not eligible for assistance under this section for losses to insurable or noninsurable commodities if they did not obtain insurance or file required paperwork and pay fees by the deadline. The Secretary has the authority to waive these requirements. The Secretary may waive requirements for producers on a farm to obtain insurance or file paperwork for insurable or noninsurable commodities for the next 2 crops. Violation of the contract may result in consequences for the producer. The producer must reimburse the Secretary for assistance received under this section. Payment limitations apply, with assistance not exceeding 95% of the crop's estimated value in the absence of losses. This includes crop insurance payments or other specified payments. The producer's assistance under the Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 is subject to reimbursement. The amount of assistance is limited to 95% of the crop's estimated value, excluding payments for losses received from Florida Disaster Programs. SEC. 2. Livestock Assistance Program. The Secretary of Agriculture will use funds from the Commodity Credit Corporation to provide emergency financial assistance for livestock losses in counties designated as emergencies after January 1, 2003. The assistance will be administered similarly to the American Indian livestock program. In the Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2001, the Secretary will not penalize producers who take actions to reduce livestock numbers due to disaster conditions when determining eligibility for livestock assistance payments. The Tree Assistance Program is outlined in Section 3. The Secretary of Agriculture will use funds from the Commodity Credit Corporation to provide emergency assistance to producers who suffered tree losses between December 1, 2003, and December 31, 2004. Additionally, $15,000,000 will be used to reimburse eligible forest landowners for tree losses during the same period. The Secretary of Agriculture will allocate $50,000,000 from the Commodity Credit Corporation for the Emergency Conservation Program, providing assistance to participants with the maximum cost share percentage. The Commodity Credit Corporation will be utilized to implement this Act, and regulations will be established accordingly. The Secretary of Agriculture may issue regulations to implement the Act without following certain procedures. Congressional review of agency rulemaking will be conducted under section 808 of title 5, United States Code. SEC. 7. OFFSET. Amends Section 1241(a)(3) of the Food Security Act of 1985 to allocate $6,037,000,000 for fiscal years 2005 through 2014."
