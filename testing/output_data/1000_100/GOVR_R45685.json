    "content": "Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 provides legal relief for victims of sexual abuse and harassment at educational institutions, holding them accountable for a deliberately indifferent response to such incidents. Title IX enforces antidiscrimination mandates through private actions against schools and federal agencies that provide funding to educational programs. Compliance with Title IX is required for receiving federal funding in all levels of education, including public school districts and institutions of higher education participating in federal student aid programs. Title IX mandates antidiscrimination in educational programs receiving federal funds, covering all operations of recipients. While the text and regulations do not explicitly mention sexual harassment, the Department of Education issues guidance on schools' responsibilities under Title IX for addressing such allegations. Educational institutions have developed procedures to investigate and respond to sexual harassment and assault claims. Recently, the Department of Education issued a notice of proposed rulemaking after revoking previous guidance to schools. The Department of Education issued a notice of proposed rulemaking in 2017, revoking previous guidance to schools. The proposed Title IX regulations would significantly change educational institutions' responsibilities for responding to sexual harassment allegations. The report provides background on how federal courts and agencies have understood and enforced Title IX, as well as constitutional challenges brought by students against public universities. The report examines the Department of Education's proposed regulations on Title IX, focusing on how they would change schools' responsibilities in addressing sexual harassment allegations. Title IX prohibits sex discrimination in educational programs receiving federal funding, but does not explicitly allow victims to sue for discrimination. Title IX does not provide a private right of action for victims of sex discrimination, nor does it explicitly prohibit sexual harassment or define unlawful sexual abuse. Federal courts have established the remedial scheme for victims seeking relief under Title IX through a private right of action. The Supreme Court has interpreted Title IX to allow for a judicially implied private right of action against federally-funded educational institutions for sexual harassment. The Court has set a high standard for establishing liability under Title IX for sexual abuse or harassment by teachers or students, based on the \"deliberate indifference\" standard. Educational institutions are not strictly liable for such actions, and the fact that they occurred does not automatically make them liable under Title IX for damages. The Supreme Court's Title IX liability is based on the recipient's response to actual knowledge of harassment or abuse, requiring a showing of \"deliberate indifference.\" A private right of action allows victims to seek specific relief or damages, while administrative enforcement focuses on institutional policies. Two Supreme Court decisions outline the requirements for establishing liability for educational funding recipients. The Supreme Court's liability standard under Title IX for sexual abuse or harassment is based on \"deliberate indifference\" in responding to knowledge of the conduct. Institutions are not strictly liable for a teacher's harassment, but liability only applies if a plaintiff can prove deliberate indifference. The Supreme Court's liability standard under Title IX is based on \"deliberate indifference\" in responding to sexual abuse or harassment. Liability only applies if a plaintiff can prove that the funding recipient failed to act adequately in response to known misconduct, not the misconduct itself. The Court created this standard in Gebser by inferring how Congress would have addressed the issue. The Court relied on the statute's administrative enforcement provision to infer legislative intent regarding Title IX liability. Agencies can suspend funds for violations only after providing notice and opportunity for voluntary compliance. Liability for damages in a private right of action under Title IX requires actual notice to an appropriate person. The Court concluded that liability under Title IX only applies if a school official responds to actual notice with deliberate indifference, drawing a parallel to case law under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Without Congress directly addressing the issue, the Court held that a school district cannot be held liable for damages under Title IX for a teacher's sexual harassment of a student without actual notice and deliberate indifference. The \"deliberate indifference\" standard under Title IX does not require funding recipients to remedy harassment, but their response must be clearly unreasonable in light of the known circumstances. A plaintiff must show that the recipient was clearly unreasonable in its response to sexual abuse or harassment to establish liability. Under Title IX, a funding recipient can be held liable for sexual abuse or harassment if their response is deemed \"not clearly unreasonable.\" To succeed in a Title IX suit for damages, a plaintiff must prove \"deliberate indifference\" and establish that an appropriate person at the recipient had actual knowledge of discrimination. Failure to show this may result in the dismissal of the claim. Under Title IX, a funding recipient can be held liable for damages for sexual harassment or abuse. An \"appropriate person\" is defined as an official with the authority to address discrimination and take corrective measures. The Supreme Court's liability standard for student-to-student harassment requires showing substantial control over the harasser, severe and pervasive harassment, and denial of educational access. The definition of \"appropriate person\" and what constitutes \"actual\" notice have caused disagreements among circuits. Davis limits a school's liability for damages under Title IX to circumstances where the funding recipient had \"substantial control\" over the harasser and the harassment occurred in a context subject to the recipient's control. The recipient may be liable for deliberate indifference to harassment if the harasser is under the school's disciplinary authority. The harassment must be severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive to deny equal access to education. The Court in Davis stated that harassment under Title IX must be severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive to deny equal access to education. It depends on various factors, including the ages of the harasser and victim, number of individuals involved, and evidence of a decline in grades. Harassment is actionable only when it has a systemic effect on the victim's access to education. The Supreme Court's Gebser and Davis decisions establish that a school will be liable under Title IX for damages for sexual abuse or harassment only if it acted with \"deliberate indifference\" in its response to known discrimination. Lower federal courts have varied in their formulations of the evidence required to prove a Title IX claim, with some adopting a \"hostile environment\" analysis. The Gebser and Davis decisions interpret a \"hostile environment\" analysis for Title IX claims of teacher-to-student harassment. Courts also require proof of \"actual\" notice, \"appropriate person\" response, and \"deliberate indifference\" by the funding recipient. For student-to-student harassment claims, additional elements include severity, denial of equal access, and substantial control by the recipient. Federal courts of appeals vary in their interpretation of the evidence required to satisfy elements for a Title IX claim, including \"actual\" notice of discrimination. The Gebser standard necessitates proof that the funding recipient had actual knowledge of the misconduct, not just a reasonable expectation of it. This raises questions about what type of allegations constitute \"actual\" notice, such as knowledge of a substantial risk of abuse or specific allegations of harassment. Federal courts differ on the question of actual notice in Title IX claims, particularly regarding knowledge of severe misconduct. In a case involving complaints about a teacher, the Eleventh Circuit considered whether the complaints were sufficient to alert the principal to potential issues. The standard applied to determine actual notice is crucial, as it can impact the outcome of the claim. The Eleventh Circuit considered if complaints about a teacher were sufficient to alert the principal to potential issues of sexual assault. The court emphasized the similarity between the reports, which alleged multiple instances of sexual misconduct. This raised a triable issue of the principal having actual notice of a pattern of harassment. In contrast, the Fourth Circuit ruled in Baynard v. Malone that a school principal had no actual notice of a teacher sexually abusing a student, despite prior reports of molestation. The principal received multiple reports of sexual misconduct by a teacher before the plaintiff started sixth grade at the school. Reports included warnings from former students, allegations from another teacher, and an incident witnessed by the school librarian. Despite these warnings, the principal failed to take appropriate action. The court found the principal had been \"inappropriate\" but lacked evidence of actual awareness of student abuse. Courts vary on defining \"actual\" notice for Title IX liability. Liability standard requires actual notice to an appropriate person with authority to address the allegations. Federal appellate case law indicates that courts determine an \"appropriate person\" based on their ability to address discrimination and institute corrective measures. The Court's opinions in Gebser and Davis have led to varying interpretations, especially in the school context, regarding who qualifies as an appropriate person, such as a principal, teacher, or guidance counselor. Some federal courts of appeals have differing views on whether a public school principal can be considered an \"appropriate person\" to address discrimination and take corrective action. The Third Circuit ruled in Warren ex rel. Good v. Reading School District that a principal could be appropriate in cases of teacher misconduct, while the Fourth Circuit disagreed in Baynard v. Malone, stating that a principal may not always qualify as an \"appropriate person.\" Some federal courts have differing views on whether a public school principal can be considered an \"appropriate person\" to address discrimination and take corrective action. The court emphasized that the principal lacked the authority to hire, fire, transfer, or suspend teachers. Meanwhile, a federal court of appeals held that a principal who engages in sexual abuse may not be considered an \"appropriate person.\" In Salazar v. South San Antonio Independent School District, it was ruled that a school official who sexually abuses a student cannot be considered an \"appropriate person.\" This case involved allegations of a vice principal sexually abusing a student over several years. The Fifth Circuit reasoned that a school official who molested a student would not likely take corrective measures or report their own behavior, thus not providing actual notice to the funding recipient. The court rejected the argument that the principal's abuse should be treated as an official action of the school district for Title IX liability purposes. The court concluded that allowing damage awards in such circumstances would not accomplish the goals and purpose of Title IX. In the higher education context, federal courts have analyzed whether university employees constitute an \"appropriate person\" for Title IX purposes. In Title IX cases, courts analyze if university employees are considered \"appropriate persons\" for receiving reports of harassment and taking corrective action. In Ross v. University of Tulsa, campus security officers were not deemed appropriate persons despite mandatory reporting of sexual assaults, as it was seen as a clerical act rather than corrective action. In Title IX cases, courts determine if university employees are \"appropriate persons\" for receiving reports of harassment and taking corrective action. The court rejected the argument that officers participating in investigations of campus violence are automatically \"appropriate persons.\" The determination of who qualifies as an \"appropriate person\" will depend on specific characteristics and evidence related to the individual's responsibilities within the institution. In Title IX cases, courts analyze if the funding recipient showed deliberate indifference in responding to sexual harassment or abuse allegations. This requires more than just negligence or failure to act reasonably. Courts consider the recipient's knowledge of the allegations and their response to determine if it was clearly unreasonable. In Title IX cases, courts analyze if the funding recipient showed deliberate indifference in responding to sexual harassment or abuse allegations. This requires more than negligence or failure to act reasonably. Courts consider the recipient's knowledge of the allegations and their response to determine if it was clearly unreasonable, such as a failure to investigate serious allegations or take disciplinary actions despite repeated reports of sexual harassment. Federal case law sets a high bar for proving deliberate indifference, with divergent analyses on what constitutes a deficient response. The court found that the response to allegations of sexual abuse by a third-grade teacher did not show deliberate indifference, despite evidence of a deficient response. The principal's actions, including not reporting the allegation to Child Protective Services and not monitoring the teacher, were deemed insufficient to prove deliberate indifference. The court found that the response to allegations of teacher sexual misconduct was inadequate, as the principal failed to take appropriate action despite receiving complaints from multiple students. The Eleventh Circuit determined that the district court had erred in ruling that the response was not deliberately indifferent, highlighting serious deficiencies in the school's handling of the situation. The principal failed to notify the school board's investigative unit about a complaint concerning the same teacher previously under investigation. The court found this response to be inadequate and potentially constituting deliberate indifference towards the teacher's sexual harassment of students. Some courts have addressed allegations of deliberate indifference not directly covered in previous decisions. In Simpson v. University of Colorado, Boulder, the Tenth Circuit addressed allegations of deliberate indifference by the university's football program in failing to prevent sexual assaults during recruitment visits. The court highlighted evidence of prior knowledge of such incidents by the coaching staff. The Tenth Circuit addressed allegations of deliberate indifference by the University of Colorado's football program in failing to prevent sexual assaults during recruitment visits. Evidence showed prior knowledge of such incidents by the coaching staff, including a rape of a female student by a football player. The head coach resisted recruiting reforms, players lacked guidance on their responsibilities as \"player-hosts,\" and the handbook provided did not address appropriate behavior. The court emphasized the coach's knowledge of sexual assaults during recruiting visits before the plaintiffs were assaulted. The Tenth Circuit found evidence of deliberate indifference by the University of Colorado's football program in failing to prevent sexual assaults during recruitment visits. The court held that the university maintained an unsupervised player-host program despite prior knowledge of such incidents. Title IX is enforced by federal agencies that provide funding to educational programs, making nondiscrimination based on sex a condition for receiving federal financial assistance. In the context of administrative enforcement, schools violating Title IX face termination or suspension of federal funds as the ultimate sanction, rather than legal judgments for damages. Federal agencies issue regulations and orders to enforce the statute and monitor compliance. The Secretary of Education is specifically tasked with regulating sex discrimination in federally funded education programs. The Department of Education (ED) enforces Title IX against educational institutions that receive federal assistance. The Attorney General coordinates implementation and enforcement of Title IX across the executive branch. The Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division and OCR collaborate in enforcing Title IX, with OCR having primary responsibility for enforcing the statute directly against recipients of financial assistance from ED. ED has regulations implementing Title IX for educational institutions at all levels that receive federal assistance. Educational institutions receiving federal assistance must comply with Title IX regulations, which prohibit sex-based discrimination. They must designate a Title IX Coordinator and establish grievance procedures for resolving complaints promptly and equitably. The Office for Civil Rights (OCR) enforces Title IX by conducting reviews and investigations to ensure compliance with federal requirements. Individuals can also file complaints with OCR. The Office for Civil Rights (OCR) enforces Title IX regulations by investigating complaints of violations, seeking informal resolutions through agreements, and taking formal enforcement measures if necessary. Title IX does not directly address sexual harassment, but OCR's guidance documents interpret it to prohibit such behavior and outline responsibilities for educational institutions. The Office for Civil Rights (OCR) enforces Title IX regulations by investigating complaints of violations and seeking resolutions. ED has different standards for assessing a school's Title IX liability for harassment compared to Supreme Court case law on private rights of action for damages. ED requires constructive notice for a school's response, while the Supreme Court requires \"actual notice\" to \"an appropriate person.\" ED has baseline standards for school responses, while the Supreme Court only holds schools liable for \"clearly unreasonable\" responses. Additionally, ED holds schools responsible for sexual harassment under Title IX if a teacher commits misconduct in the scope of their employment. In 1997, OCR released guidance stating that sexual harassment of students by school employees, other students, or third parties is prohibited by Title IX. It defined two types of sexual harassment: quid pro quo harassment and hostile environment harassment. The 1997 Guidance explained that schools can be liable for quid pro quo harassment by an employee in a position of authority, and for hostile environment harassment by employees if they act with apparent authority. Schools can also be liable for harassment by other students or third parties if a hostile environment exists, the school knows about it, and fails to take immediate corrective action. The 1997 Guidance clarified that schools are accountable for their own discrimination in failing to address harassment once they are aware of it. The Supreme Court set a different liability standard in private suits against schools for damages in cases of harassment by a teacher. In Gebser (1998), the Court ruled that a school district is liable when it has actual knowledge of allegations by an appropriate person and responds with deliberate indifference. In Davis, the Court added that a plaintiff must show actual knowledge and deliberate indifference to sue for damages for sexual harassment. The Court in Gebser set a liability standard for schools in cases of harassment by a student, requiring proof of severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive conduct that denies equal access to educational opportunities. The Court also distinguished between actions that could result in Title IX liability for damages and administrative requirements imposed by federal agencies. Agencies have the authority to enforce Title IX requirements, even if they do not represent a definition of discrimination under the statute. The Supreme Court set a liability standard for schools in cases of harassment by a student under Title IX, requiring proof of severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive conduct. The Department of Education (ED) issued guidance reaffirming a school's responsibilities under Title IX regarding sexual harassment allegations, stating that liability standards for damages differ from administrative enforcement standards. In 2001, OCR issued a Revised Sexual Harassment Guidance document reaffirming the standards of the agency's 1997 Guidance for educational institutions receiving federal funds. It outlines compliance standards for enforcing Title IX and requires schools to adopt grievance procedures for resolving complaints promptly and equitably. Failure to do so results in a violation of Title IX. When sexual harassment occurs in educational institutions, prompt and effective action must be taken to end the harassment, prevent its recurrence, and remedy its effects. The 1997 and 2001 guidance documents from the Department of Education emphasize the importance of addressing sexual harassment promptly. The 2001 Guidance defines \"unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature\" as sexual harassment and requires schools to take appropriate action in response. The 2001 Guidance on sexual harassment in educational institutions focuses on determining if the harassment denies or limits a student's ability to participate in school programs based on sex. It outlines quid pro quo harassment and hostile environment harassment as key types of harassment triggering a school's responsibilities under Title IX. The 2001 Guidance on sexual harassment in educational institutions explains that hostile environment harassment involves conduct serious enough to limit a student's participation in school programs based on sex. It distinguishes between hostile environment harassment and quid pro quo harassment, noting that fellow students and school employees can create a hostile environment. The guidance emphasizes that all relevant circumstances, including the welcome nature of the conduct, are considered in evaluating harassment situations. The 2001 Guidance clarifies that a school's responsibility to address harassment by teachers or employees depends on whether it occurs within the context of their job responsibilities. If harassment limits a student's participation in school programs, the school must stop the behavior, prevent its recurrence, and remedy the effects for the victim, regardless of whether they had prior notice. Sexual harassment within an employee's job responsibilities can vary. Harassment within an employee's job responsibilities can vary depending on the type of harassment. For quid pro quo harassment, it clearly falls within the scope of job responsibilities. In cases of hostile environment harassment, factors are evaluated to determine if it occurred within job responsibilities. Sometimes, even if harassment is not within job responsibilities, it can still create a hostile environment. Schools have a duty to stop and prevent harassment once they are aware of it. Additionally, schools are responsible for addressing student-on-student harassment that creates a hostile environment. Title IX requires schools to take prompt and effective action to end and prevent harassment, even without notice in certain situations. Responsible employees must address sexually hostile environments by taking action or reporting incidents. Title IX mandates schools to address and rectify harassment promptly, even without prior notice. It is the duty of individuals with authority to report any misconduct by students or employees. Schools must take immediate and effective action upon becoming aware of a hostile environment to comply with Title IX regulations. Title IX requires schools to promptly address and rectify harassment to eliminate a hostile environment and prevent future occurrences. Schools must investigate reports of harassment by students, parents, or observed by staff, and take appropriate steps to resolve the situation. Informal mechanisms may be used if agreed upon, but certain procedures like mediation may not be suitable in some cases. The 2011 OCR Dear Colleague Letter supplemented the 2001 Guidance on Title IX obligations for schools regarding peer-to-peer harassment, defining sexual harassment as unwelcome sexual conduct including advances, requests, and violence. Sexual harassment, including sexual violence, creates a hostile environment that interferes with a student's participation in school programs. Schools must take immediate action to address and prevent harassment, even if it occurs off school grounds. If a student files a complaint, the school must process it accordingly. The school must process complaints of sexual harassment in accordance with established procedures, considering off-campus conduct's effects on campus. Criminal investigations do not relieve schools of their duty to conduct Title IX investigations. Schools should not wait for criminal investigations to begin their own Title IX investigations and should take immediate steps to protect students. The 2011 Dear Colleague Letter emphasized the importance of schools promptly resuming and completing Title IX investigations after criminal fact-finding by police. It highlighted the need for schools to use a preponderance of the evidence standard in their grievance procedures for sexual harassment complaints. This standard contrasted with the prior practice of some schools using a \"clear and convincing\" standard. The 2011 Dear Colleague Letter emphasized using a preponderance of the evidence standard for Title IX investigations, contrasting with the higher clear and convincing standard. It discouraged personal cross-examination in hearings and required equal appeal rights for both parties. In response to schools' requests for clarification, a 2014 Q&A document provided more specific instructions on handling student-on-student sexual violence allegations under Title IX. The 2014 Q&A clarified that schools must promptly investigate possible sexual violence under Title IX, take effective steps to end it, and protect complainants. Title IX requires schools to protect complainants and ensure their safety through interim steps before completing an investigation. It specifies the responsibilities of a school's Title IX Coordinator, the elements of written grievance procedures for sexual violence complaints, and who qualifies as responsible employees to report allegations. The document also outlines requirements for schools conducting investigations into sexual violence. The 2014 Q&A emphasized the importance of imposing sanctions against perpetrators of sexual violence to eliminate a hostile environment. It clarified that Title IX investigations do not require the same procedural protections as criminal proceedings. Schools must conduct their own Title IX investigations even if a criminal investigation is ongoing. Additionally, schools were not mandated to hold hearings for sexual violence allegations, and OCR discouraged requiring complainants to attend. In response to guidance from ED and increased OCR oversight between 2011 and 2016, schools developed procedures to ensure compliance with Title IX regarding allegations of sexual assault. Procedures for investigating sexual harassment allegations vary widely among educational institutions, with some discretion given to ED for administrative enforcement. Title IX allows ED to enforce sex-based discrimination rules for schools receiving federal funds, but due process limits this for state actors like public universities. Students facing disciplinary actions have challenged Title IX procedures in courts, claiming violations of Due Process Clause. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires states to observe certain procedures when depriving individuals of life, liberty, or property. It protects against the deprivation of \"property interests\" without due process, which must originate from an independent source like state or federal law. States must afford due process when depriving individuals of liberty. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires states to provide due process to individuals when their liberty is at stake. Courts consider factors such as the private interest affected, the risk of erroneous deprivation, and the government's interest when determining the procedures required. Individuals with a protected interest are entitled to notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard before any action is taken. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires states to provide individuals with a protected interest notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard before any action is taken. The severity of the deprivation is a key factor in determining the procedures constitutionally required, with the stronger the private interest at risk, the more formal procedures will be needed. Goss v. Lopez is the only Supreme Court case focusing on procedural due process in student discipline outside of academia. The Supreme Court ruled that public school students have a right to due process before being suspended, with notice and a hearing required. Public universities must adhere to constitutional standards when disciplining students, while private universities are not bound by the same requirements. Students of public universities have a constitutionally protectable property right in their enrollment. Federal courts have ruled that students have liberty and/or property interests in their education, requiring due process including notice of charges, evidence, and the ability to present their side to an unbiased decisionmaker. The procedures to satisfy due process will vary depending on the circumstances of each case. Recent judicial rulings have addressed the constitutionality of disciplinary proceedings in cases of sexual misconduct at public universities. Courts have considered claims such as inadequate notice of charges and denial of the right to confront and challenge witnesses. Recent judicial rulings have addressed the constitutionality of disciplinary proceedings in cases of sexual misconduct at public universities. Accused students have challenged the credibility of witnesses, alleged biased decision-makers, and criticized unfair review processes. One common legal challenge is the lack of adequate notice of charges, but courts have generally found no due process violation if timely notice of charges and a meaningful opportunity to respond are provided. Accused students have challenged disciplinary proceedings at public universities, citing lack of notice of charges. In one case, a student was suspended without being properly informed of sexual misconduct allegations, leading to a due process violation claim. In another case, a student alleged inadequate notice of charges, highlighting the importance of providing meaningful opportunities for preparation in disciplinary hearings. The school failed to properly inform a student of sexual misconduct allegations, leading to a due process violation claim. The court ruled that the limited scope of focus prejudiced the student's defense, depriving him of a fair process. Another case involved a student suspended for suspected sexual assault, where the university did not provide the evidence used in its decision, leading to a due process violation claim. The university's Title IX investigator compiled an investigatory report used by the school's disciplinary hearing panel to adjudicate a student's case. However, the investigator failed to provide the report to the defendant, leading to a due process violation claim. Courts have been more willing to entertain claims of denial of due process in disciplinary proceedings when students were not afforded the opportunity to cross-examine witnesses. Courts have been more willing to entertain claims of denial of due process in disciplinary proceedings when students were not afforded the opportunity to cross-examine witnesses, especially in cases involving disputed and critical facts. Cross-examination has not been considered a necessary feature of due process in civil contexts, and the Due Process Clause does not guarantee the right to cross-examination in school disciplinary proceedings. This principle has been applied in recent cases involving allegations of due process violations in the context of sexual harassment. The reviewing district court rejected a due process challenge to disciplinary proceedings in a sexual assault case where accused students could submit written questions to a panel chair. The Sixth Circuit also denied a due process challenge in a university's disciplinary hearing for sexual assault, where students were not allowed to directly cross-examine their accuser but could submit written questions to the panel. The Fifth Circuit similarly rejected a due process challenge. The Fifth and Sixth Circuits have rejected due process challenges in university disciplinary proceedings for sexual assault cases. The courts ruled against challenges where credibility determinations were not critical, but ruled in favor of challenges where decisions rested solely on hearsay evidence without the opportunity for cross-examination. The court emphasized the importance of allowing the adjudicative body to assess the demeanor of both the accused and the accuser in disciplinary hearings. It was noted that a live hearing may be necessary for due process, as seen in a case where a university was ordered to provide one for an accused student facing expulsion. The court found that a university violated an accused student's right to due process by conducting private questioning through an investigator without allowing the student to know the questions asked or the responses given. The Sixth Circuit ruled that in cases where credibility is at issue, the accused student must have the opportunity to cross-examine the accuser and witnesses in the presence of a neutral fact-finder. The university's appeals board reversed the investigator's conclusion on sexual misconduct due to the alleged victim's and adverse witnesses' more persuasive accounts. The accused student was denied a live hearing or cross-examination opportunity. The Sixth Circuit ruled that due process required the chance to cross-examine accusers and witnesses. Some students claim they were denied presenting exculpatory evidence. Courts review such claims on a case-by-case basis. A student alleged being denied the opportunity to present exculpatory evidence at a sexual assault disciplinary hearing, raising concerns of due process. Challenges have been made regarding biased decisionmakers in disciplinary proceedings at higher education institutions. Courts generally presume impartiality but bias can be alleged with evidence like decisionmakers' statements or patterns. The Fifth Circuit rejected a due process claim alleging bias in a university disciplinary hearing for sexual assault. The court found that the integrity of the proceedings was not undermined, as the investigator relied on photo and video evidence, and a separate university attorney advised the panel to draw their own conclusions from the evidence. Evidence of bias in decisionmakers' behavior or statements may indicate partiality. The Sixth Circuit recently ruled that a student's due process claim was valid after alleging bias in a university disciplinary hearing for sexual assault. The hearing panel member acted as investigator, prosecutor, and judge, making biased remarks that undermined the student's credibility. This case highlights the importance of impartiality in such proceedings. A district court rejected a due process claim alleging bias in university staff members due to sexual assault training. The court emphasized the importance of raising awareness of sexual assault but found no evidence to support the claim of bias. Another district court, however, allowed a due process claim brought by an expelled student alleging bias in the investigation and training materials provided to the panel. The court found potential bias in the investigation and training materials provided to the panel in the case of an expelled student, raising concerns about a due process violation. This highlights issues with unfair review processes in university disciplinary proceedings. The university ordered a new hearing for a student accused of sexual assault, as they were unable to prove their case in the first hearing. The district court deemed this unfair and allowed the allegations to proceed. In another case, a student was initially found not responsible for sexual misconduct but was later found guilty without proper notice or opportunity to respond to new evidence. The appeals board reversed a student's initial not responsible verdict for sexual misconduct without explanation or a fair hearing. Another student was expelled for sexual assault despite being found not responsible initially, due to off-the-record meetings with the accuser during the appeal process. The reviewing court found procedural inadequacies in the expulsion of an accused student for sexual assault, including pre-judgment and lack of notice of allegations. In response, OCR withdrew previous guidance on Title IX and began the rulemaking process. The Department of Education issued a notice proposing new rules for addressing sexual misconduct in schools under Title IX, including defining sexual harassment more narrowly, requiring actual notice of harassment, and changing how schools respond to allegations. The proposed regulations for addressing sexual misconduct in schools under Title IX would define sexual harassment more narrowly, require actual notice of harassment, and change how schools respond to allegations. The regulations aim to establish a higher threshold for showing a Title IX violation based on hostile environment sexual harassment. The proposal aims to establish a higher threshold for proving a Title IX violation based on hostile environment harassment, adopting a standard from the Supreme Court's 1999 Davis decision. This standard defines harassment as \"unwelcome conduct on the basis of sex that is severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive, effectively denying equal access to education.\" The proposed regulations aim to define a hostile environment as severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive harassment that denies equal access to education. Schools would only be required to respond to allegations of sexual harassment when they have \"actual knowledge\" of the incident. The proposed regulations reject imputing knowledge to a school based on respondeat superior or constructive notice. The ability or obligation to report by a school employee does not qualify them as one with authority to institute corrective measures. Schools are compelled to respond only to sexual harassment within their \"education program or activity.\" The proposed regulations shift responsibility for responding to sexual harassment occurring outside a school's education program or activity. Schools are now only required to respond in a manner that is not \"deliberately indifferent,\" a departure from previous standards. This change aligns with the Court's decision in Davis and aims to hold schools accountable while allowing flexibility in disciplinary decisions. The proposal outlines three situations where schools are provided a safe harbor from being found deliberately indifferent under Title IX: when a formal complaint is made, when there is actual knowledge of harassment from multiple complainants, and in situations without a formal complaint in higher education. Compliance with outlined grievance procedures would negate any inference of deliberate indifference. The proposed regulations outline situations where schools are not considered deliberately indifferent under Title IX, such as offering supportive measures to complainants and notifying them of the right to file a formal complaint. Schools must respond to sexual harassment cases in a non-indifferent manner and can remove accused individuals on an emergency basis after a risk analysis. The proposed regulations allow schools to remove individuals on an emergency basis after a risk and safety analysis, provide notice and opportunity to challenge the decision, and ensure due process protections for accused students during investigations of sexual harassment complaints. If the alleged conduct would not constitute sexual harassment or did not occur within a school's program or activity, the complaint must be dismissed. Upon receipt of a formal Title IX complaint, schools must provide written notice of the allegations to relevant parties. The proposed regulations require schools to provide written notice of allegations, including grievance procedures and details of potential violations, to both complainants and respondents. Schools must treat both parties equitably, offering remedies for complainants and due process protections for respondents. Discrimination based on sex in the treatment of either party is prohibited under Title IX. Procedures must include an objective evaluation of evidence and ensure fairness for all parties involved. The proposed regulations for Title IX require schools to conduct objective evaluations of evidence, ensure unbiased decision-making, provide due process for all parties, presume respondents are not guilty until proven otherwise, outline possible sanctions and remedies, specify the standard of evidence, allow for appeals, and offer supportive measures. Schools must place the burden of proof on themselves, allow equal opportunity for both parties to present evidence, and not restrict the gathering or discussion of relevant evidence in harassment investigations. The proposed regulations for Title IX require schools to conduct objective evaluations of evidence, ensure unbiased decision-making, provide due process for all parties, and allow both parties an equal opportunity to present evidence. The regulations also specify the standard of evidence, allow for appeals, and offer supportive measures. Schools must not restrict the gathering or discussion of relevant evidence in harassment investigations. The proposed regulations for Title IX require schools to conduct live hearings where both parties can question each other through their advisors. Decision-making must be done by a neutral party, not the investigator or Title IX Coordinator, to ensure fairness and unbiased outcomes. This departs from past guidance and aims to provide due process and equal opportunities for all parties involved. The new regulations for Title IX allow universities to use a single investigator for allegations and decisions on culpability. Schools can choose between preponderance of evidence or clear and convincing standard. The same standard must be applied for complaints against students, employees, and faculty. Schools may allow appeals with consent from both parties and facilitate informal resolutions with written consent. The antidiscrimination mandate of Title IX prohibits sex discrimination in educational programs but does not specifically address sexual abuse, harassment, or assault. Federal courts have determined relief for victims based on the statute's silence, with the Supreme Court inferring how Congress would have addressed the issue. \"Congress has substantial discretion to modify Title IX to clarify standards for private suits and administrative enforcement. Amendments could define specific conduct violations, address liability for harassment in different educational settings, and distinguish between teacher and student harassment.\" Congress has the authority to modify Title IX to clarify standards for private suits and administrative enforcement, including defining conduct violations, addressing liability in different educational settings, and distinguishing between teacher and student harassment. Additionally, Congress could direct federal agencies to change their enforcement of the statute, such as by promulgating regulations that differentiate between types of sexual harassment or treat harassment differently based on the context."
