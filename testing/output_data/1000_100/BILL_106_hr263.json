    "content": "The \"Structured Settlement Protection Act\" imposes an excise tax on individuals acquiring structured settlement payments in factoring transactions, as outlined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. This new chapter addresses structured settlement factoring transactions. The \"Structured Settlement Protection Act\" imposes a 50 percent tax on individuals acquiring structured settlement payment rights in factoring transactions, with exceptions for court-approved hardships. The term 'structured settlement' refers to an arrangement for periodic payments of damages or compensation that are excludable from the recipient's gross income under specific sections of the law. Structured settlement payment rights refer to the rights to receive payments under a structured settlement. A structured settlement factoring transaction involves the transfer of these payment rights for consideration through sale, assignment, pledge, or other means. The term 'factoring discount' refers to the excess amount of structured settlement payments acquired in a factoring transaction over the total amount paid by the acquirer. 'Relevant court or administrative authority' is defined as the jurisdiction that oversaw the underlying action resolved by the structured settlement. The structured settlement can be approved by the relevant court or administrative authority with jurisdiction over the claim. The occurrence of a structured settlement factoring transaction will not affect the application of certain provisions if the requirements of sections 72, 130, and 461(h) were satisfied at the time of entering into the structured settlement. The structured settlement factoring transaction will not affect the application of certain provisions to the parties involved, including an assignee under a qualified assignment under section 130, in any taxable year. The Secretary is authorized to prescribe regulations to clarify the treatment of amounts received by the structured settlement recipient in such transactions. Additionally, a new section on information reporting is added to the relevant part of the tax code. \"SEC. 6050T. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS REGARDING STRUCTURED SETTLEMENT FACTORING TRANSACTIONS.\" \"In structured settlement factoring transactions, the person making the payments must provide a written statement to the acquirer of the payment rights as required by section 6041, or if subject to tax under section 5891, at the specified time.\" The section outlines reporting obligations for structured settlement factoring transactions, specifying the time and manner of payment rights transfer. It clarifies that these provisions supersede other reporting requirements and exempts withholding rules for the payer. The definition of 'acquirer of the structured settlement payment rights' is also provided. The section introduces reporting requirements for structured settlement factoring transactions, with amendments to the Internal Revenue Code. These requirements apply to transactions occurring after the enactment of the Act."
