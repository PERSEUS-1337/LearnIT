    "content": "The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act allocated $7.2 billion for broadband programs, split between the NTIA/DOC and RUS/USDA. NTIA received $4.35 billion for a competitive grant program called BTOP, while RUS received $2.5 billion for broadband grants and loans, with a focus on rural areas. The RUS Broadband Initiatives Program (BIP) focuses on funding projects in rural areas. P.L. 111-226 rescinded $302 million of unobligated BTOP money. There were two rounds of ARRA broadband funding, with all funds awarded by September 30, 2010. As of October 1, 2010, all ARRA broadband funds have been awarded, focusing on the distribution of funding for broadband projects. The first funding round was announced on July 1, 2009, with grants and loans available for last mile, middle mile, and public computer center projects. The ARRA broadband funds were awarded for last mile, middle mile, and public computer center projects. Over 2,200 applications requested nearly $28 billion in funding for projects reaching all 50 states, five territories, and the District of Columbia. In the second round of ARRA broadband funding, $4.8 billion was made available, with $2.6 billion for BTOP and $2.2 billion for BIP. The application process was streamlined based on feedback from the first round, with separate NOFAs for each agency. Applicants could choose which agency to apply to. In the second round of ARRA broadband funding, $4.8 billion was available, with $2.6 billion for BTOP and $2.2 billion for BIP. NTIA/BTOP focused on middle mile projects, while RUS/BIP focused on last mile projects. BTOP shifted towards Comprehensive Community Infrastructure grants for middle mile projects serving anchor institutions. BIP offered a standard grant/loan combination for all projects, with the requirement that projects cover at least 75% rural areas without High Speed Access broadband service. In the second round of ARRA broadband funding, NTIA/BTOP and RUS/BIP focused on different types of projects. BTOP prioritized middle mile projects for Comprehensive Community Infrastructure grants, while BIP focused on last mile projects in rural areas lacking High Speed Access broadband service. BIP introduced new grant programs like Satellite Projects and Rural Library Broadband. NTIA received 867 applications for second round funding, totaling $11 billion in requested federal funding. In the second round of ARRA broadband funding, NTIA and RUS received a total of 1643 applications requesting $22.2 billion in federal funds. RUS received 30 middle mile applications totaling $845.88 million. Additionally, RUS received 27 applications for Satellite Projects, 51 applications for Technical Assistance, and 2 applications for Rural Library Broadband. All BTOP and BIP award announcements were completed by October 1, 2010. As of October 1, 2010, all BTOP and BIP award announcements were finished, totaling $7.5 billion in federal funding for 553 projects. This included $3.9 billion for 233 BTOP projects and $3.6 billion for 320 BIP projects, with $6.2 billion in grant funding and $1.3 billion in loan funding. Awards data breakdown by project category, broadband technology deployed, and state-by-state distribution of funding is available. About half of the broadband infrastructure funding (51%) went to middle mile projects. Middle mile projects received 51% of broadband infrastructure funding, while last mile projects received 49%. Last mile projects predominantly used BIP funding, with 93% of loan funding allocated to them. Fiber projects accounted for 56% of all infrastructure projects funded, with two-thirds involving a deployment of both fiber and wireless technologies. Of last mile project technologies, 47% are fiber and 23% are DSL. The funding for broadband infrastructure projects is broken down by technology types, with fiber being the most common at 47%, followed by DSL at 23%. State-by-state breakdowns of funding are provided in tables, with projects needing to be completed within two to three years. NTIA and RUS will oversee the progress of funded projects. The Administration requested $23.7 million for NTIA's grant management office. The Continuing Appropriations Act includes $20 million for BTOP oversight. NTIA awarded a $5 million contract to ASR Analytics to measure BTOP grant impact. The 112th Congress will provide oversight on NTIA and RUS efforts. The FCC's National Broadband Plan recommends expanding federal funding for broadband deployment in unserved areas. The funding patterns and trends from previous broadband grant and loan programs could provide insights for Congress on whether to continue, modify, reduce, expand, or eliminate such programs within a national broadband policy context."
