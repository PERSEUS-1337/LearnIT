    "content": "Bankruptcy filings peaked in 1987 for businesses, while consumer filings continued to rise until 2005, surpassing 2 million before the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005. Filings dropped sharply in 2006 due to the new law, but rose steadily until 2010. The impact of BAPCPA on long-term filings remains uncertain. Household debt figures are shown in Table 2. Household debt is mainly comprised of mortgage debt and consumer credit, with consumer credit including revolving credit (credit card debt) and non-revolving debt (auto and college loans). Mortgage debt is secured by real estate, with home equity lending as a subcategory. Federal Reserve estimates show the debt service burden as a percentage of household disposable income, which rose steadily until the 2007 recession. The debt burden has fluctuated within a narrow range since 2007, with a gradual increase not explaining the rise in personal bankruptcy filings. Despite declining interest rates, the ratio of debt to income has been rising, as shown in Table 2. The increase in disposable personal income between 1990 and 2007 rose more than twice as fast as the debt burden, indicating potential future bankruptcy filings if interest rates rise suddenly. Declining interest rates since 1980 have allowed households to take on more debt without a significant increase in interest payments. Table 3 shows the percentages of families at various income levels devoting more than 40% of their income to debt service from 1995 to 2007, revealing disparities in debt management among families. The data from Table 3 highlights the high distress rate among lower-income families filing for bankruptcy, with no clear rising trend in personal bankruptcy filings. In 2007, there was little change in the percentage of distressed families compared to 1998, but there was a notable increase in upper-income families, possibly due to increased mortgage debt during the housing boom. The question remains why many families with median or below income levels end up in bankruptcy despite taking on high levels of debt. Vulnerable populations like the sick, uninsured, divorced, or residents in states without mandatory insurance may be particularly affected. In 2005, bankruptcy reform was enacted to address debtor-friendly bankruptcy codes and rising consumer bankruptcy filings. Supporters argued that it discouraged borrowing beyond repayment ability, while opponents blamed credit card issuers for financial distress. The lack of consensus on the reasons for bankruptcy filings indicates ongoing controversy. The U.S. economy entered a recession in December 2007, leading to a decline in household debt levels for 11 quarters before a slight increase in 2011. In the second quarter of 2011, debt outstanding slightly rose but fell again in the third quarter. Home equity and credit card debt led the decline on a percentage basis, while mortgage debt accounted for most of the drop in dollar terms. Factors contributing to the decrease include households paying down debt, borrowing less, increased uncollectible debt write-offs by lenders, and tighter credit standards. Mortgage balances have fallen due to modifications, negotiations reducing principal, and foreclosed homes being sold for less than the old mortgage amount. Causes and implications of deleveraging are discussed in CRS Report R41623, U.S. Household Debt Reduction."
