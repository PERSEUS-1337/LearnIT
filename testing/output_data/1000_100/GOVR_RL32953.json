    "content": "The United States ratified the UNFCCC in 1992, calling for reducing greenhouse gases. Despite various actions, carbon dioxide emissions have increased. President George W. Bush rejected the Kyoto Protocol and mandatory emissions reductions in 2001. The US focused on voluntary initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the 2002 Climate Action Report. Only six out of over 50 programs were regulatory, aimed at achieving energy or environmental goals with concomitant emissions reductions. Congressional proposals to reduce greenhouse gases have been introduced in the 109th Congress. In the 109th Congress, proposals to reduce greenhouse gases were introduced, focusing on improving monitoring, enacting market-oriented programs, and implementing energy-related initiatives to reduce emissions. This report compares two major proposals discussed during the Senate's debate on the Energy Policy Act. In the 109th Congress, proposals to reduce greenhouse gases were introduced, focusing on market-based mechanisms to reduce emissions. Senators McCain and Lieberman introduced S. 1151, an expanded version of S.342, to encourage innovation in carbon-intensive technologies and mitigate climate change effects. The bill was defeated in a 38-60 vote during the Energy Policy Act debate. S. 1151, defeated on a 38-60 vote, would require economy-wide emission reductions through market-based strategies, allowing participation in international trading systems and carbon sequestration programs. The bill excludes residential and agricultural sources of greenhouse gases and entities emitting less than 10,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents annually. Senator Bingaman's draft amendment is based on the National Commission on Energy Policy's recommendation for a mandatory, tradeable permit program to limit greenhouse gases. The draft amendment mandates an accelerated reduction in the country's greenhouse gas intensity, with a 2.4% annual reduction in emissions per dollar of GDP from 2010 to 2019, increasing to 2.8% annually after 2019. Implementation is through a market-oriented allowance trading program, with a cost-limiting safety valve allowing entities to make payments to DOE instead of reducing emissions at a price of $7 a ton in 2010. The draft amendment proposes a reduction in greenhouse gas intensity through a market-oriented allowance trading program with a cost-limiting \"safety valve\" at $7 a ton in 2010. This differs from S. 1151 which caps emissions from covered entities, potentially leading to overall U.S. emissions growth. The draft amendment proposes a cost-limiting \"safety valve\" for tradeable allowances, while S. 1151 does not have a price limit. The two proposals also differ in covered entities, agency responsibility, and allowance proceeds utilization. Emission reduction estimates have uncertainty for both options. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) analyzed S. 1151 in 2004, estimating a 6.7% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2010. CRS estimated a 2.5% reduction with the draft amendment. Long-term reductions were not estimated due to uncertainty, but it was noted that emissions would likely continue to increase, albeit at a slower rate than business-as-usual. The draft amendment and S. 1151 would both lead to a slower increase in greenhouse gas emissions compared to business-as-usual. However, the draft amendment may result in emissions potentially rising faster in the long term due to economic growth and cost factors. The initial reduction in emissions achieved in 2010 could be slowly eroded over time under both options. The 2010 projections for the U.S. submission to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change show uncertainties in emission reductions under the draft amendment compared to S. 1151. The estimates are based on projected GDP and carbon intensity improvements, but do not consider carbon sequestration potential. The draft amendment has uncertainties in emission reductions compared to S. 1151. It calculates a future baseline based on GDP growth and carbon intensity improvement, which are uncertain variables. The draft amendment calculates emission reductions based on uncertain variables of GDP growth and carbon intensity improvement. Projections show a range of economic growth scenarios, with carbon intensity targets set by the President's Climate Change Initiative. The draft amendment aims to reduce emissions, but there are uncertainties regarding coverage and the safety valve triggering mechanism. The carbon intensity estimate is higher than projected, and there are concerns about entities not covered. The safety valve could be triggered immediately or around 2015, adding uncertainty to emission reductions achieved in the longer term. The projected cost under S. 1151 is uncertain due to future growth in greenhouse gas emissions by covered entities. Economic growth could lead to more emissions that need to be offset, resulting in higher costs for emission reductions. Cost estimates for S. 1151 are also affected by uncertainties, with potential permit prices in 2010 ranging from $9 to $15 per ton. The potential permit price in 2010 for S. 1151 ranges from $9 to $15 per ton, with differing estimates based on assumptions about cost-effective energy efficiency improvements, non-CO2 greenhouse gas reductions, carbon sequestration, and natural gas supply. The sensitivity and uncertainty surrounding the potential costs of S. 1151 are illustrated by the range between the two studies. The draft amendment's cost estimates are less sensitive to these factors and require fewer emission reductions than S. 1151. The draft amendment requires fewer emission reductions than S. 1151 and incorporates economic growth into its emissions limitation target. This allows for some increase in future emissions if projected economic growth exceeds the mandated improvement in greenhouse gas intensity, resulting in lower costs. The draft amendment's cost projections are influenced by the availability of cost-effective control measures, but it does not include international credits like S. 1151, eliminating uncertainty and potential lower costs associated with international trading. The draft amendment proposes a permit price of $5 a ton in 2010, with a safety valve limiting the upside risk to $7 a ton. Converting to 2001 dollars, the projected permit price would be $4.8 - $5.9 a ton. The safety valve aims to bound costs of any climate change control program while focusing on acceptable emissions levels or compliance costs. Market-based mechanisms for reducing CO2 emissions emphasize either emissions levels or compliance costs. Market-based mechanisms for reducing CO2 emissions, such as tradeable permit programs or carbon taxes, aim to set limits on emissions while allowing the marketplace to determine costs. The preference for a specific system depends on views regarding cost uncertainty and benefits. If concerned about potential high control costs, a tradeable permit program may be suitable for reducing CO2 emissions efficiently. Alternatively, including a safety valve can cap control costs but may result in less certainty in achieving a specific CO2 reduction level. The safety valve on the draft amendment could be seen as a contingent carbon tax, raising a major policy question about economic costs and emission reduction uncertainty. S. 1151 leans towards total emissions control, while the draft amendment leans towards cost control. The proposals S. 1151 and the draft amendment aim to limit greenhouse gas emissions through market-based systems. S. 1151 sets an absolute cap on emissions with trading allowed, while the draft amendment limits emissions intensity with a cost-limiting safety valve. S. 1151 is expected to achieve larger and more certain emissions reductions, while the draft amendment is likely to have lower and more predictable costs. Both proposals would result in lower short-term U.S. emissions compared to business as usual, but total U.S. emissions would still increase, albeit at a slower rate."
