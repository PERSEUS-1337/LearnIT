    "content": "The President signed H.R. 4899, P.L. 111-212 on July 29, 2010, with $59.2 billion in spending for various purposes including war costs, disaster assistance, Haiti relief, and benefits for Vietnam veterans. The bill was passed by both the House and Senate, with the House receding from an amended version. The final version of the bill provides $58.8 billion in new budget authority after rescissions. The House version of H.R. 4899 included $22.1 billion more in domestic spending, offset by $12.2 billion in rescissions and $4.5 billion in mandatory savings over 10 years. Rescissions cancel unobligated budget authority, while mandatory savings reduce new direct spending. The House also debated a resolution to withdraw U.S. troops from Pakistan, which was defeated by a vote of 38 to 372. The House passed H.Res. 1566 setting up a debate on H.Con.Res. 301 under the War Powers Act. The Senate disagreed with the House version of the bill, leading to the House adopting the Senate version due to concerns raised by the Defense Department. The House adopted the Senate version of H.R. 4899, which includes $59.2 billion for war funding, Haiti relief, foreign aid, and new benefits for Vietnam veterans. Debate revolved around whether additional domestic spending proposals were emergencies that did not require offsets, and the exclusion of funds for the Pigford II and Cobell court cases requested by the Administration. In introducing the Senate version of H.R. 4899 for House consideration on July 27, 2010, Representative David Obey added funds to FEMA disaster funding in the FY2010 Supplemental for war funding and other emergencies like teacher job losses and Pell fund shortfalls. He opposed the bill due to war funding. Representative Obey opposed the war funding in the bill due to Afghanistan and Pakistan not supporting the war effort. Despite this, he believed the process needed to move forward. Representative Lewis praised the Senate for rejecting nonemergency spending and urged support for the bill to assist troops and disaster-stricken areas. Other members supported DOD's war funding and additional disability benefits. The House debated on parts of the bill, including DOD's war funding and additional disability benefits for Vietnam veterans exposed to Agent Orange. Representative Skelton supported the bill, while Representative McGovern raised concerns about corruption in the Afghan Government and Pakistani intelligence services. Concerns were also raised about funding for the war running out in August. The House voted on a resolution invoking the War Powers Act to withdraw U.S. troops from Pakistan within 30 days. The House debated on invoking the War Powers Act to withdraw U.S. troops from Pakistan within 30 days, but the resolution was defeated. The Senate also failed to adopt cloture on the bill, indicating disagreement between the two chambers. The final version of H.R. 4899 appropriates $59.2 billion in spending, $5.0 billion below the request. Funding matches or is close to the Administration's request for various areas including FEMA's Disaster Assistance Fund, Vietnam veterans affected by Agent Orange, Department of Defense war-related funding, and Haiti. Differences in funding include less for war-related foreign aid and nothing allocated for settling court cases. The final version of H.R. 4899 appropriated $59.2 billion in spending, $5.0 billion below the request. Funding matched or was close to the Administration's request for various areas, but there were differences in funding for war-related foreign aid and no allocation for settling court cases. The final version of H.R. 4899, passed on May 27, 2010, did not include $600 million for border security and $129 million to reduce patent backlogs in the Commerce Department. Separate bills were passed on July 28, 2010, for this funding. The FY2010 Supplemental, P.L. 111-212, allocated $34.2 billion for the Defense Department and State Department for the Afghan and Iraq wars. The FY2010 supplemental funding for the Afghan and Iraq wars totaled $169.9 billion, including $104.4 billion for Afghanistan and $65.5 billion for Iraq. Congress addressed the Administration's $64.3 billion request for supplemental spending between March 24, 2010, and July 27, 2010. The House passed H.R. 4899 on March 24, 2010 with $5.1 billion for FEMA and $600 million for summer jobs. The Senate passed it on May 27, 2010 with $59.2 billion for various purposes. The House adopted the Senate's version and added funds for education and youth employment. The House passed H.R. 4899 on March 24, 2010 with funds for FEMA and summer jobs. The Senate passed it on May 27, 2010 with additional funding for education and youth employment. On July 29, 2010, the President signed the bill into law, providing a total of $81.8 billion in spending. The FY2010 supplemental requests included $5.1 billion for Disaster Relief Fund, $33.0 billion for Defense Department, $4.5 billion for foreign assistance, $2.8 billion for Haiti reconstruction, $13.4 billion for veterans exposed to Agent Orange, $243 million for Deepwater Horizon oil spill, $600 million for border security, and $3.4 billion to settle land trust claims of American Indians. The House and Senate considered H.R. 4899, which included $3.4 billion to settle land trust claims of American Indians and $1.2 billion to settle discrimination claims of black farmers. Different versions of the bill had varying amounts of rescissions and mandatory savings to offset spending. In the third version of the bill, H.R. 4899 included $12.2 billion in rescissions and $4.5 billion in mandatory savings to offset the $81.8 billion in proposed spending. Congressional rules require spending to fit within totals set for discretionary and mandatory spending in the annual budget resolution, unless designated as emergencies. Almost all discretionary spending in the final version of H.R. 4899 was designated as emergency, not counting against budget caps. If caps are exceeded, spending could be subject to a point of order. The President's supplemental request includes $64.4 billion in spending, with $46.3 billion as discretionary and $18.1 billion as mandatory. The requests were submitted to Congress as part of the FY2011 budget amendments. Emergency supplemental appropriations are seen as bypassing budgetary discipline as they are not subject to annual caps on discretionary spending. In dealing with supplemental appropriations, Congress debates increasing spending above appropriated levels, impacting the deficit. Emergency designations bypass budgetary discipline and may not receive as much scrutiny as regular appropriations. Members are concerned about the deficit impact of additional spending. Congress must decide if additional spending is necessary and if it warrants increasing the budget deficit or cutting elsewhere to offset it. Congress considers all spending or revenue legislation, including supplemental appropriations bills, within rules and procedures intended to address policy options. The FY2010 supplemental appropriations request was considered within budget constraints and rules, such as congressional pay-as-you-go rules and the Statutory PAYGO Act of 2010. Congress could have exempted spending from constraints by designating it as an emergency or overseas deployment. Points of order could have been waived under congressional rules. During consideration of the supplemental appropriation measure, points of order could have been waived. An emergency designation would exempt spending from budget rules, but could still be subject to a point of order. Waivers could be granted in both the House and Senate. Various agencies and plaintiffs cited deadlines for supplemental funding during the consideration of H.R. 4899 from late March to late July 2010. Supplemental funding was requested due to insufficient funds in the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund for response activities related to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Admiral Thad Allen and Secretary Janet Napolitano urged Congress to raise the funding cap to sustain Federal response operations. The Coast Guard was projected to reach the $150 million annual cap by June 18, 2010. In response to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, Congress passed S. 3473, P.L. 111-191, raising the annual cap on funds from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund to $1 billion specifically for the spill. The Department of Defense received $129.6 billion in bridge funds for FY2010 war funding, almost double the previous year. Additional funding of $33 billion was requested by Secretary of Defense Gates. In early May, Secretary of Defense Gates reiterated the need for an additional $33 billion for 30,000 troops deploying to Afghanistan by Memorial Day. The Army, Navy, and USMC could cover regular base activities and war operations through August 2010 based on current funding. Secretary Gates expressed concern about the lack of progress on the supplemental funding. Gates expressed concern about the lack of progress on supplemental funding, warning that the Navy and Marine Corps could run out of money in July, leading to disruptions in programs. The Army could face funding shortages in August, potentially resulting in furloughs for civilians and unpaid military personnel. Army Under Secretary Westphal confirmed sufficient funds but DOD spokesman Morrell warned of possible funding shortages for the Army and Marine Corps in August. The Army had sufficient funds through mid-August and could last through the recess if reprogramming requests were approved. Each service had funds available in their War Bridge Operation and Maintenance accounts, with the Army having $15.3 billion. The Army and Marine Corps could rely on already appropriated war bridge funds through August, assuming monthly spending increased by 20%. Services have tapped funding from their base budget since 2004 to fund war spending. The services used base budget funding to temporarily finance war funding while awaiting passage of supplementals. The Disaster Relief Fund was extended by limiting fund releases and delaying reimbursements. FEMA estimated insolvency by the end of June with average monthly spending of $350 million. As of June 7, 2010, FEMA had a balance of $952 million in the Disaster Relief Fund, which could last another three months if spending continued at the normal rate of $350 million per month. However, there was a backlog of $1.4 billion in projects awaiting payment that did not meet the immediate needs criteria. The State Department needed funding by June 1, 2010 to respond to humanitarian crises, but Congress did not approve the $1.15 billion appropriation for the Pigford II court case. The settlement deadline for the Cobell suit is August 6, 2010, with uncertainty about further extensions. The FY2010 supplemental budget raised issues on setting timelines for evaluating spending on the Afghan War, preventing corruption in foreign aid for Afghanistan and Iraq, monitoring corruption in Haiti relief, and determining if domestic spending should be considered emergency or offset to prevent deficit increase. FEMA requested $5.1 billion for the Disaster Relief Fund due to anticipated fund depletion. FEMA anticipated depletion of funds for disaster needs and arbitration claims. DRF spending averages $350 million monthly with a balance of $600 million. FEMA projected fund depletion in May or June 2010. To address the shortage, FEMA limited payments and delayed certain projects. Representative Oberstar mentioned FEMA's actions to stretch available funds. Congress raised questions about FEMA's delayed request for disaster relief funds and higher spending levels in recent years, questioning FEMA's budgeting practices. The Obama Administration criticized previous administrations for unrealistic budgeting in its first budget blueprint. In FY2010, the Administration requested $2.0 billion for the Disaster Relief Fund. In FY2010, the Administration requested $2.0 billion for the Disaster Relief Fund, but Congress provided $1.6 billion. The Obama Administration is now requesting $1.9 billion for FY2011, citing the need for additional funding due to a high number of disasters in recent years. Recovery from Gulf Coast hurricanes in 2005 and 2008 may require continued higher funding levels. In 2005 and 2008, Congress might consider funding the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) at a higher level to avoid the need for supplemental funding. Some argue that disasters are unpredictable emergencies, while others suggest maintaining the status quo. FEMA's request lacks sufficient information to justify DRF replenishment, with only one example provided - a $475 million arbitration ruling for Charity Hospital in New Orleans post-Hurricane Katrina. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 provides $5.1 billion for FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) and additional funding for various disaster relief efforts. The Senate Appropriations Committee expressed dissatisfaction with the timeliness of information provided by OMB about disaster relief. The Senate Appropriations Committee (SAC) criticized OMB for delayed information on disaster relief funding, noting a $1-2 billion shortfall for previous disasters. H.R. 4899 allocated $5.1 billion for FEMA's DRF and additional funds for HUD and Army Corps of Engineers for long-term recovery and infrastructure repair. The final version of H.R. 4899 allocated funds for recovery projects involving the Mississippi River and tributaries, drought relief, economic development assistance, emergency forest restoration, and federal cost share for flood damages in Rhode Island and Tennessee. It also directed FEMA to create an interagency taskforce to address community concerns related to flood maps updates. Additionally, funding was provided for deploying additional troops to Afghanistan and economic assistance to support military operations. The Obama Administration requested a $33 billion supplemental appropriation for FY2010 to deploy 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan. The troops aim to reverse the security situation, target the insurgency, secure population centers, and train Afghan forces to transfer responsibility to them by July 2011. As of June 1, almost 94,000 troops were in Afghanistan. As of June 1, almost 94,000 troops were in Afghanistan, with a scheduled increase of 30,000 troops expected to arrive by September 2010. This would bring the total number of deployed U.S. troops to 98,000, tripling the number from October 2008. Troop levels increased under both the Bush and Obama administrations in response to security concerns in Afghanistan. The second Obama troop increase will bring the U.S. total to 98,000 by fall. NATO allies have increased troop levels to 48,000. Total foreign troops in Afghanistan will be about 148,000. Afghan security forces are planned to total 243,000. The Defense Department's budget includes $33 billion for additional troops in Afghanistan and training Iraq Security Forces. Total DOD war spending in FY2010 rises to $160 billion, with $99 billion for Afghanistan. The FY2010 Supplemental budget for the Afghan and Iraq wars totals $160 billion, with $99 billion allocated for Afghanistan and $61 billion for Iraq. The total budget is $12 billion more than FY2009 and almost the same as the FY2011 request. The total DOD appropriations for the Afghan War amount to $314.1 billion with the FY2010 Supplemental, and could rise to $427.7 billion with the FY2011 request. The enacted total for Iraq is $706.2 billion with the FY2010 Supplemental, and could reach $752 billion if the FY2011 request is approved. War funding for State/USAID and VA Medical is not included in these figures. President Obama's new strategy for Afghanistan includes a timeline for beginning the transfer of forces out of the country in July 2011, following a review in December 2010. However, Secretary of Defense Gates and Admiral Mullen have cautioned that the July 2011 date is for transitioning, not leaving, and the process could take several years. General Petraeus has characterized the initiative as a long-term effort. In March 2010, General Petraeus described the Afghanistan initiative as an 18-month campaign to be evaluated in September 2011. Concerns were raised in Congress about the timing and length of the campaign, with three debated amendments in July 2010. Amendment No. 3 proposed cutting off all funding for Afghanistan, Amendment No. 4 suggested limiting DOD funding to troop withdrawal, and Amendment No. 5 required a new National Intelligence Estimate by April 2010. The Congress required a new National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) by April 4, 2010, with a timetable for troop redeployment from Afghanistan. Concerns arose after the operation in Marjah, with mixed reports on Taliban presence. The next focus was on the campaign for Kandahar, delayed from its planned summer date. The campaign for Kandahar was delayed from its planned summer date, with $30 billion allocated for Afghanistan in the DOD's supplemental request. This funding included money for military operations, force protection, training Afghan security forces, fuel costs, equipment reconstitution, military intelligence, national intelligence, military construction, and defeating Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs). Some policymakers have suggested the cost for deploying 30,000 more troops. Some policymakers suggest that deploying 30,000 more troops would cost $1 million per troop. The DOD's request for Afghanistan includes funding for various activities like military personnel, operations, and Coalition Support Funds for Pakistan. Funding for different categories increases at different rates, with Operations expected to increase with troop levels. DOD estimates vary. DOD estimates for deploying 30,000 troops to Afghanistan show a per troop cost of $875,000, higher than CBO's estimate of $467,000. Both DOD and CBO assume the same monthly troop strength, with DOD attributing high costs to new troop deployments. The DOD's supplemental request for new troops deploying to southern Afghanistan is high due to the need for setting up more facilities. Concerns about accurately budgeting for military operations led to transferring funds to the Overseas Contingency Operations Transfer Fund. This raises questions about the accuracy of DOD's estimates for FY2010. The DOD's FY2010 supplemental request for operational costs is 22% of the total amount requested. Monthly spending needs to double to use all funds, indicating DOD estimates may be high. An additional $2.6 billion was approved for the Afghan Security Forces Fund to accelerate training. Concerns exist about the need for all requested funds in FY2010 given current spending rates. The DOD's FY2010 supplemental request aims to meet current plans for Afghan Security forces growth. Concerns exist about the achievability of the plan and oversight due to training problems and contracting disputes. NATO partners endorsed the increases, but it is unclear if the requested funds are necessary or entail forward-financing. The DOD is requesting an additional $2.6 billion to sustain the growth of the Afghan Army, pay soldiers more, and provide infrastructure and equipment. Congress has already appropriated $25.5 billion for Afghan Security Forces. General McChrystal proposed doubling the Afghan Army and Police to 400,000, but General Mullen sees this as an aspirational goal. The ultimate cost and duration of U.S. support for Afghan Security forces have not been estimated. The goal of training Afghan security forces is 243,000 to 400,000, but General Mullen views this as an aspirational goal not endorsed by the Obama Administration. The training is managed jointly by DOD and the State Department, with U.S. military personnel, NATO teams, and private contractors involved. Problems include high attrition rates, leadership deficiencies, logistical limitations, and insurgent attacks on police recruits. Hearings in 2010 highlighted issues with Afghan police training, including coordination problems between DOD, State Department, and NATO, reliance on problematic private contractors, shortages of personnel, and inadequate contract oversight. Despite efforts to increase trainers, shortages persist, raising concerns about reliance on contractors. Senator Levin expressed worries about trainer shortages for Afghan security forces. The DOD's April 1, 2010, Afghan Section 1230 Metrics report acknowledged a shortfall in trainers for the Afghan army and police, with only 44% of the required 4,083 trainers currently assigned. Questions arise about the number of trainers needed, how the requirement will be met, and the potential impact on DOD's funding if personnel are not available as anticipated. Shortfalls in trainers could hamper the ramp-up of training for Afghan security forces. The Afghan police training contract faced delays due to bid protests, but Congress allowed the Secretary of State to use a previously awarded contract. DOD still has almost $3.6 billion in funding available from FY2009 and FY2010. DOD planned for a full competition, which could delay training and reduce funding in FY2010. Some Members question the need for emergency war supplementals as DOD had funding available for FY2010. DOD's original request was enacted in the FY2010 DOD Appropriations Act. The emergency designation for the supplemental request is debated, with Congress having the prerogative to decide. Some of DOD's request, including $1 billion for training in the Iraqi Security Forces Fund (ISFF), $2 billion to offset fuel increases, and $1.7 billion for reset or replacement of war-worn equipment, may not be clearly related to new deployments and could be part of DOD's regular FY2011 appropriation request. The emergency designation for these funds could be challenged. Some argue that the $2 billion for higher fuel costs in DOD's budget could be covered internally. DOD typically uses Working Capital Funds or transfers funds for unexpected costs. The $1.7 billion for equipment reset may not be directly tied to troop increase. Arguments exist on the gradual impact of combat operations on equipment in Afghanistan. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 provided DOD with $32.9 billion, $148 million less than the DOD request. This includes adjustments in particular accounts for funding in excess of requirements, fuel pricing changes, and combat losses. The Senate version of H.R. 4899 included adjustments such as a $400 million cut in military construction funding, a rejection of a DOD proposal for Army force protection programs, and a $512 million increase in procurement accounts for combat losses. The final version also required assessments of threats from Guantanamo detainees to be provided to congressional intelligence committees. The Administration requested $529 million for military construction in its supplemental request, with $521 million for Afghanistan and $8 million for Air Force family housing. Questions arise about whether DOD is building temporary facilities or permanent bases in Afghanistan. Congress allowed for a \"long-term presence\" but not \"permanent stationing\" of troops. It is unclear how urgently the funds are needed given current spending rates. The $521 million DOD request for military construction in Afghanistan aims to create infrastructure to support 30,000 additional U.S. troops. Projects include roads, runways, and quarters in southern provinces like Helmand and Kandahar, as well as in Balkh and Kunduz provinces in the north. Air Force construction is planned for Nimruz and Balkh provinces. Air Force and Army construction projects in Afghanistan include infrastructure for airlift and special operations forces in various provinces. This includes waste management systems, fuel storage facilities, gravel roads, and command headquarters. Additionally, there are plans for perimeter security facilities and helicopter aprons in different regions of the country. The U.S. military has construction projects in Afghanistan for airlift and special operations forces, including infrastructure like waste management systems, fuel storage facilities, and command headquarters. Congress has debated whether construction spending indicates a long-term troop commitment, with measures in place to prevent the establishment of permanent bases in Afghanistan. The FY2009 Supplemental Appropriation prohibited the establishment of permanent military bases in Afghanistan, but allowed for the use of Operation & Maintenance funds for projects supporting a \"long-term presence.\" Congress has debated the significance of construction projects in Afghanistan in relation to troop commitment. The FY2009 Supplemental Appropriation prohibited permanent military bases in Afghanistan but allowed for projects supporting a long-term presence. Congress has debated the significance of construction projects in Afghanistan related to troop commitment. The line between funding for permanent troop stationing and long-term presence is unclear, with some projects potentially serving both purposes. Congress has denied funds for projects signaling a permanent presence without a comprehensive plan. DOD requested additional flexibility in response to changing military situations in Iraq and Afghanistan. In response to changing military situations in Iraq and Afghanistan, DOD requested and received additional flexibility to use O&M funds for urgent military operational requirements. Congress capped the amount between $100 million and $200 million and prohibited funds from being used for construction at military installations with a long-term presence. In 2009, Congress permitted DOD to use $200 million for projects in U.S. Central Command and an additional $300 million for construction in Afghanistan to meet urgent military requirements. In response to changing military situations in Iraq and Afghanistan, DOD received flexibility to use O&M funds for urgent military requirements. Congress allowed $300 million for construction in Afghanistan to meet urgent military needs, exempting installations from the ban on using O&M funds for long-term presence support. This increased the total spent on military construction significantly, with $409 million added in FY2009 to the $900 million appropriated, totaling $1.4 billion. DOD significantly increased its construction investment in Afghanistan in FY2003 and FY2008, with plans to double it again in FY2010. A new legislative proposal aims to use O&M funds for minor construction until 2012, potentially increasing total funding. Key bases like Bagram Air Base and Kandahar Air Base have received substantial investments. The DOD has requested $1.6 billion for various military construction projects in Afghanistan, including $767 million for Kandahar Air Base and $595 million for Forward Operating Base Tombstone/Bastion. A new proposal would allow DOD to use O&M funds for unspecified minor construction projects up to $3 million each in support of contingency operations until September 30, 2012. The DOD proposed increasing the per project cap for minor construction projects in Afghanistan to $3 million, citing rising construction costs. This would allow unlimited O&M funds for military construction in support of contingency operations worldwide. Quarterly reporting to congressional defense committees would be after-the-fact, rather than the current pre-notification requirement. Questions have been raised about the urgency of the $521 million supplemental request given DOD's existing $2.1 billion budget authority for military construction projects in Afghanistan. DOD currently has $2.1 billion in budget authority available from previous appropriation acts that has not yet been obligated. In FY2009, DOD obligated about $607 million for military construction projects in Afghanistan. The average monthly obligation fell to $26 million in the first five months of FY2010. To obligate all $2.1 billion by the end of the fiscal year, DOD would need to increase its monthly average obligations six-fold to $300 million. $700 million must be obligated by September 30, 2010, and another $1.4 billion by September 30, 2011. To fully utilize FY2009 monies before expiration, DOD would need to increase monthly obligations from $26 million to $100 million. For FY2010 projects, monthly obligations would need to rise to $116 million. Additional supplemental funds would require monthly obligations to triple to $150 million. The FY2010 supplemental request could be considered part of DOD's FY2011 war request. Total funding for military construction/family housing in H.R. 4899 was $657 million, including $649 million for war-related construction. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 allocated $657 million for military construction, with $649 million for war-related projects in Afghanistan and $8 million for non war-related Air Force expenses. The final funding exceeded the request by $127.5 million to accelerate Air Force projects planned for FY2011. The Senate emphasized the need for including contingency construction requirements in the budget request. The military construction funds allocated in H.R. 4899 were available for two years until September 30, 2011, instead of the requested four years. The bill did not include $16.5 million for a new Soldier Readiness Processing Center at Fort Hood, TX. The FY2010 Supplemental request addressed foreign economic assistance for Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan, reflecting the shift of responsibilities from military to civilian personnel in Iraq and an increase in both military and civilian responsibilities in Afghanistan. The Pakistan request in the FY2010 Supplemental addressed the Administration's desire to show support and strengthen the government's presence in insurgent areas. The total international affairs budget request for war-related programs was $4.46 billion, with $1.8 billion for State Department personnel and infrastructure. The Foreign Operations segment, totaling $2.6 billion, aimed to support U.S. security, economic growth, social services, and democratization. Funding was requested in discrete sub-accounts for specific needs, excluding P.L.480 food aid and Global Health/Child Survival. The FY2010 supplemental budget request for international affairs included funding for war-related programs in Pakistan, Afghanistan, and other countries. The total budget for these programs was $4.46 billion, with a focus on supporting governance, economic growth, and social services in conjunction with military efforts. The enacted version of the budget allocated $9.2 billion, a 55% increase over the previous year, with $3.7 billion specifically for war-related foreign aid and diplomatic operations. The U.S. military efforts in Afghanistan are supported by a strategy that aims to increase stability and reduce insurgency through job creation and social service provision by the Afghan government. Concerns remain about the government's capacity to lead and support these efforts. The Afghan government is prepared to provide leadership and support to local communities in the conflict, with concerns about high levels of corruption impeding effective service delivery. The U.S. government is increasing aid and personnel to monitor accountability and address corruption in aid programs. The Afghanistan supplemental request aims to boost U.S. international affairs funding levels for the country. The U.S. government is increasing aid and personnel to monitor accountability and address corruption in aid programs in Afghanistan. The total FY2010 State Department diplomatic operations account would rise by nearly 90% above the previous year's level. The enacted version of the legislation raises total FY2010 aid levels by 55% over the previous year. The FY2010 budget request includes $200 million in International Narcotics and Law Enforcement funding, $211 million in Diplomatic and Consular Programs funds, and $760 million for good governance in Afghanistan. The FY2010 budget request includes funding for various sectors in Afghanistan, such as Trust Fund, Health, Education, Macroeconomic growth, Trade and investment, Financial sector, Agriculture, Private sector development, and Economic opportunity. The funding aims to support Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Agriculture, Central Bank, and credit union services. The FY2010 budget request includes $8.6 million to expand credit union services, including Islamic-compliant financing. Three quarters of the $200 million request is aimed at supporting the justice sector, with a focus on rule of law activities in the provinces and counter-narcotics programs. The request includes funding for expanding the corrections program, model prisons, increasing the number of judges, prosecutors, and criminal investigators, as well as support for women's justice activities, counternarcotics police, drug treatment facilities, and legal aid. The FY2010 State Department Diplomatic and Consular Programs (D&CP) request of $211 million aimed to increase civilian personnel for international affairs assistance programs. The proposal included a 457 position increase, with 212 U.S. direct hires for district-level work and funding for 245 staff to work with Kabul ministries and Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs). The hiring plan involved federal employees from various agencies to provide specialized expertise, along with the hiring of around 200 locally employed staff (LES). The Department proposed hiring 200 locally employed staff to support American personnel in Kabul. A report praised embassy management but expressed concerns about staff being overworked due to a tripling in numbers. The rapid expansion poses challenges in managing staff, providing housing, and addressing security needs. Additional funding was requested for SIGAR and the State Department Inspector. The final enacted version of H.R. 4899 provides $1.7 billion for Afghanistan foreign aid and diplomatic operations, cutting the ESF request by $267 million compared to the $2.0 billion request. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended specific funding levels for various program sectors within the ESF account, including slashing proposed good governance activities by $160 million and alternative development by $35 million. The Senate report expresses concerns about providing aid directly to the government of Afghanistan and recommends assessments of aid effectiveness. It limits direct government budget support to $100 million and cuts the INCLE account by $31 million due to concerns about the justice system. The enacted version also addresses oversight issues by rejecting the request for SIGAR and rescinding $7.2 million to extend funding availability until the end of FY2011. The enacted legislation for Afghanistan aid imposes conditions such as consulting with local and national government representatives, civil society, and communities for project design and implementation. Aid is contingent on Afghanistan's cooperation in reform efforts, respect for women's rights, and efforts to combat corruption. Funding for the Electoral Commission is subject to certain conditions as well. The Electoral Commission may only receive aid if no members or employees were involved in fraud in the 2009 elections. Aid for reconciliation with former Taliban combatants is dependent on Afghan women's participation in government and protection of their rights. H.R. 4899 allows up to $300 million for DC&P and Embassy Construction in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan. The FY2010 supplemental request for Iraq reflects the new strategic environment. The FY2010 supplemental for Iraq included a significant increase in U.S. assistance and State Department operations, with total economic aid programs rising by 89% over the previous year. The State operations account alone saw a 79% increase. The most significant element was the request for $517.4 million in INCLE funds for the transition of responsibility. The State Department requested $517.4 million in INCLE funds for the transition of responsibility for police training from the Department of Defense to the Department of State in Iraq. This transition includes advising the Ministry of Interior, police, and border forces, with a smooth transition requiring a successor program by the end of FY2010. The INCLE request also included deploying 350 advisors and funding infrastructure construction and security staff to support expert personnel. The FY2010 supplemental request for INCLE funds included $1.57 billion for State Department operational costs in Iraq to maintain civilian outreach following the military drawdown. The program is expected to employ up to 2,000 U.S. government and contractor personnel, with funding for aircraft and expanded aviation facilities for efficient staff travel. Currently, over 1,200 direct-hire American employees from 14 civilian agencies are stationed in Iraq at various locations. During the 2007 surge, embedded PRTs (ePRTs) were established to allow civilian presence in locations protected by combat battalions. These civilian federal employees conduct various missions including diplomatic work, economic assistance, rule of law programs, and training with Iraqi government personnel. As combat battalions withdraw, embedded PRTs are being phased out, and regular PRTs are expected to be terminated by 2011. The State Department planned to establish two consulates and three temporary Provincial Diplomatic Teams (PDTs) to replace phased out regular PRTs by 2011. Two U.S. Forces-Iraq managed PRTs would remain through 2011. The State Department will assume responsibility for infrastructure costs previously borne by the military. ($307.8 million) The State Department is allocating funds for consulate facilities development, security requirements, and contract employees to take over responsibilities from the Department of Defense. Concerns have been raised about the Department's ability to manage and oversee these contracts effectively. The State Department is allocating funds for consulate facilities development and contract employees to take over responsibilities from the Department of Defense in Iraq. The final enacted version of H.R. 4899 provides $1.7 billion for Iraq, $407 million less than the request, with cuts to diplomatic operations and site development for permanent consulates in Basrah and northern Iraq. Senate appropriators suggested prioritizing these facilities within available funds. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 increases the Administration's request for INCLE by $133 million, reconfiguring the funds for police training in Iraq. The Pakistan supplemental request shows no significant change in U.S. policy, with only a modest shift in funding from year to year. The Administration's FY2010 supplemental request for Pakistan aimed at specific infrastructure needs to show continued U.S. support and help the government meet population needs in insurgency-prone areas. The request included $244 million in ESF for cash payments, water and sanitation, agriculture irrigation, and energy solutions. The FY2010 supplemental request for Pakistan included $40 million in INCLE funds for police training and related infrastructure, $60 million in Foreign Military Financing for utility helicopters, and $26 million for State Department operations to increase staffing at U.S. diplomatic facilities in Pakistan. The increased staffing in Pakistan was intended to better manage military and economic assistance, provide more contracting officers, enhance logistical support, strengthen outreach at provincial and local levels, and meet FY2011 staffing requirements earlier. The original version of H.R. 4899 did not include funds for Pakistan assistance, but the House-amended version adopted funding levels for Pakistan approved. The final enacted version of H.R. 4899 provides $375 million for Pakistan aid and diplomatic operations, $5 million more than the request. This includes $10 million less than the request for FMF and $15 million more than the request for ESF, with $15 million specifically directed to human rights and assisting families affected by military operations. The legislation also includes $1.5 million in ESF for leasing aircraft to monitor programs in the country. The FY2010 supplemental funding was allocated for relief and reconstruction support in Haiti after the devastating earthquake in Port-au-Prince. The funds were considered emergency requirements for urgent needs, with a breakdown of 55% for relief activities, 40% for recovery and reconstruction, and 6% for diplomatic operations. An Inter-American Development Bank study described the earthquake as one of the most catastrophic disasters in history. The earthquake in Haiti was a devastating catastrophe, affecting approximately 3 million people with over 2 million displaced. The government reported 230,000 deaths and 300,600 injured. Haiti was already designated as one of the 50 least developed countries by the United Nations. Protecting the displaced population is a critical issue, with an estimated 1.69 million displaced in Port-au-Prince and 597,000 in areas outside the capital. In Haiti, aid workers are providing basic necessities to areas with Internally Displaced Populations (IDPs) due to the earthquake. Emergency shelter is scarce as the rainy season approaches, making shelter and sanitation urgent priorities. The total recovery and reconstruction needs are estimated at $11.5 billion. At an international donors conference in March 2010, $10 billion was pledged for Haiti's reconstruction efforts, with the U.S. pledging $1.2 billion. Improved accountability of donor assistance is emphasized to reduce corruption. Haiti has made progress in reducing corruption and increasing transparency, qualifying for debt relief. The U.S. Agency for International Development has helped establish online transparency measures. The U.S. Agency for International Development has assisted Haiti in establishing an online system to monitor donor pledges and spending. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 includes $2.93 billion for Haiti, $129 million more than requested. This funding includes $1.642 billion for relief activities, $1.140 billion for recovery and reconstruction, and $147 million for diplomatic operations. The Administration requested $1.5 billion for relief and disaster assistance funding for Haiti. The $1.5 billion humanitarian relief funding request for Haiti included funds for ongoing relief activities, emergency food assistance, peacekeeping activities, defense and coast guard relief activities, grants for Haitian evacuees, and immigration fees. President Obama also announced an additional $100 million in humanitarian assistance. As of June 11, 2010, the United States had provided over $1.1 billion in humanitarian funding for Haiti. USAID reported that the United States has provided more than $1.1 billion in humanitarian funding for Haiti, including $350.7 million for International Disaster Assistance. This funding covered various relief activities such as Search and Rescue agreements, Disaster Assistance Response Team Program Support, and Relief Commodities. The remaining balance of the funding request went towards ongoing humanitarian assistance activities. The United States collaborated closely with the Government of Haiti, the United Nations, and other donor nations. In Haiti, relief activities were organized into twelve clusters led by various agencies, with funding targeting humanitarian coordination, logistics, shelter, health, water, sanitation, child protection, and emergency food assistance. The United States collaborated closely with the Government of Haiti, the United Nations, and other donor nations through the U.N. cluster system. The international community has provided significant humanitarian assistance in response to natural disasters in Haiti, including the recent earthquake. Relief operations will continue in Haiti through 2010, with a focus on food assistance for up to two million people. As recovery and reconstruction progress, food activities will target the most vulnerable and include food-for-work programs. There is typically an overlap in relief and reconstruction activities in the aftermath of natural disasters. The international community, led by the United Nations and the United States, has been actively involved in providing humanitarian assistance in response to natural disasters in Haiti. Disaster risks in Haiti are significant, and efforts are focused on overcoming the cycle of disaster and developing a disaster response capacity. The United States is a major contributor to relief efforts in humanitarian disasters, with bipartisan congressional support for humanitarian assistance. In times of immediate emergency relief, the Administration may use disaster accounts intended for worldwide use throughout the fiscal year. The State Department reported that disaster accounts are being drawn down to provide relief to Haiti, with resources needing replenishment by June 1, 2010 to maintain U.S. capacity for future emergencies. The relief funding in the current request would reimburse funding already provided for the earthquake disaster in Haiti, which has received global attention. The United Nations issued a Revised Humanitarian Appeal for Haiti totaling $1.44 billion, with commitments of $874 million received by June 4, 2010. It is unclear if donor amounts represent pledges or specific obligations. The international community's response to the Haiti disaster has faced criticism for slow delivery of humanitarian assistance. It remains uncertain how the actual costs will be shared among donors, with concerns about sustaining donor interest and honoring pledges. Maintaining funding priorities for other disaster areas worldwide adds to the challenge. The international aid effort in Haiti faced criticism for delays due to government capacity, damaged infrastructure, and logistical challenges. Evaluations of the relief response continue, with concerns about bureaucratic red tape, the Haitian government's capacity, and coordination issues among international actors. Managing expectations in such a daunting disaster is crucial. The DOD and U.S. Coast Guard requested $700 million for humanitarian relief efforts in Haiti. The funds covered soldier support, relief supplies, and projects. The response to the earthquake was rapid and extensive, involving over 20,000 U.S. personnel. The Haitian earthquake response involved over 20,000 U.S. military personnel providing emergency relief, evacuations, security, repairs, and recovery operations. The mission ended on June 1, 2010, with a commitment to continue assistance through the \"New Horizons\" exercise. The \"New Horizons\" exercise in Haiti involves 500 National Guard and Reserve soldiers in engineering projects like building schools and clinics. The U.S.S. Iwo Jima provides medical assistance and surgeries. Concerns exist about the premature withdrawal of U.S. forces and the capabilities of U.N. security personnel. The Administration requested $96.5 million for the mission. The Administration requested $96.5 million for the State Department's Contributions to International Peacekeeping Activities (CIPA) account to fund U.S. assessed contributions to the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) after the earthquake. The U.N. Security Council increased MINUSTAH levels by 3,500 military personnel and 680 police officers. This funding also includes aid for Haitian evacuees and migrants to the United States. The President's request includes $256.2 million for activities of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) related to providing benefits and waiving fees for processing immigration requests. $220.0 million would go directly to HHS for various activities, with an additional $36.2 million provided to USAID. The funding would cover costs for Medicaid, CHIP, medical evacuations, assistance for evacuees, and public health activities in Haiti. The request for supplemental funds includes payment of state share of Medicaid and CHIP costs for eligible medical and non-medical evacuees, particularly Haitians with humanitarian parole status. States have the option to continue providing Medicaid after seven years. The request did not specify the proposed duration of this assistance to states. The requested funds would be used to reimburse the HHS National Disaster Medical System for costs associated with medical evacuation of seriously injured earthquake victims to the United States and their subsequent care in U.S. hospitals. Additionally, funds would be used to provide cash and medical assistance to Haitian humanitarian parolees and cover repatriation costs as needed. The requested funds would support public health activities in Haiti, including disease surveillance, laboratory capacity reestablishment, and environmental health activities, totaling $36.2 million. The $36.2 million requested for USAID reimbursements to HHS would pay for medical, surgical, and mortuary assistance teams deployed to Haiti, including personnel and supplies for a 250-bed hospital. U.S. disaster assistance to other nations does not typically involve accepting large numbers of disaster victims into the United States. NDMS was used to airlift victims of foreign disasters into the United States for medical care, requiring rapid development of policies regarding patient selection. The President's supplemental request included $15 million for USCIS to cover immigration-related costs for Haitian migrants affected by the 2010 earthquake. USCIS funds processing and adjudication through fees, with a budget authority of $2.727 billion for FY2010. The Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act 2010 provided $224 million in direct appropriations to USCIS, including $50 million for processing refugee applications and asylum claims. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 includes $1.6 billion in humanitarian assistance, $110 million above the request, and an additional $110 million for Haiti IDA relief activities. The enacted version of the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act 2010 includes $110 million for Haiti IDA relief activities, bringing the total to $460 million. Additionally, $150 million is allocated for P.L. 480-Title II assistance for food needs in Haiti. The final version approves $655 million for the Department of Defense, with $255 million transferred from the OHDACA account. $5 million is added to the Coast Guard's budget for operations in Haiti. $96.5 million is endorsed for Contributions to International Peacekeeping Activities in Haiti, and $220 million is approved for HHS to provide services to Haitian evacuees and migrants. The enacted version of the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act 2010 includes $10.6 million for USCIS costs associated with Haitian migrants, below the requested amount due to lower application requests. The total request for Recovery and Reconstruction funding was $1.1 billion, primarily for new activities. The 111th Congress expressed bipartisan support for providing substantial assistance to Haiti in response to the crisis generated by the January earthquake, emphasizing the need for a coordinated international effort for both immediate humanitarian needs and long-term development. Strategies moving forward must aim to create a more sustainable Haiti and increase Haitian capacity. The U.S. programs in Haiti focus on urgent infrastructure repairs, critical health care, governance, and security. Some observers are concerned that other crucial areas like improving the educational system are being neglected. Critics question the limited approach to aid, while advocates argue it avoids duplication among donors. The revised Haitian development strategy aims to catalyze economic growth and provide services. The Haitian government and donors aim to correct the urban-rural imbalance by decentralizing services and opportunities outside of Port-au-Prince. The supplemental request addresses short- and long-term elements, including meeting immediate needs of displaced populations and developing new growth poles. Scientists assist in selecting less vulnerable areas for development. Officials support the strategy of decentralizing services in Haiti to address urban-rural imbalance, but note the high cost of developing neglected areas. There are concerns about forcibly relocating populations and the need for targeted poverty reduction programs. Aid should focus on building Haitians' capacity for self-reliance, but there is tension between efficiency and the time required for capacity building. Aid organizations face pressure for measurable outcomes and operate on short-term contracts. The supplemental proposal requested $749 million in Economic Support Funds (ESF) for International Assistance programs in Haiti, focusing on infrastructure rehabilitation, technical assistance, reconstruction projects, and finance projects. Up to $120 million of the ESF was requested to be transferred to a multi-donor trust fund for Haiti. The proposal includes transferring ESF funds to a multi-donor trust fund for Haiti and USAID's Operating Expenses account. Experts suggest investing in small-scale clean energy projects locally. Concerns were raised about insufficient funding for children's needs and psychological support for the traumatized population. No additional funding was allocated for Global Health. The State Department would receive about $144 million for International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement activities in Haiti to strengthen law enforcement and support the Haiti National Police by restoring training capacity, providing equipment, supplies, and infrastructure. Other programs would enhance criminal justice sector support and rebuild prisons destroyed by the earthquake. The supplemental funding requested for Haiti includes $1.5 million for the Office of the Inspector General of USAID to improve accountability and oversight, $690,000 for a Treasury Department attach\u00e9 to oversee technical advisors, and $7.1 million for advisors to restore basic treasury processes, reduce corruption, and enhance economic management skills. This funding aims to support the Haitian Coast Guard, combat human trafficking, and rebuild government infrastructure after the earthquake. The earthquake in Haiti killed government officials, destroyed government buildings and financial records, setting back financial management progress. The Administration requested $120 million in Economic Support Funds for a Multi-Donor Trust Fund to coordinate foreign assistance. Haitian President and Prime Minister acknowledged limited capacities post-earthquake. A development authority is being set up for long-term development. The Administration proposed $252 million in U.S. contributions to cancel Haiti's debts. The Administration proposed U.S. contributions of $252 million to help cancel Haiti's debts of $781 million to three international organizations. Congressional authorization is required for the reallocation of $40 million from the Treasury Department's Debt Restructuring Account. The final version of H.R. 4899 approves $1.140 billion for all FY2010 recovery and reconstruction activities for Haiti. The final version of the act imposes restrictions and reporting requirements on recovery and reconstruction funding for Haiti. Direct budget support to the Haitian government requires clear goals and mechanisms to prevent fund misuse. Funding may be suspended if conditions are not met, and involvement of Haitian government levels in program design and execution is necessary before disbursement of funds. The final version of the act imposes restrictions and reporting requirements on recovery and reconstruction funding for Haiti. Funding for ESF and INCLE to the Haitian government is contingent on government reform, including removing corrupt officials. Funding for \"justice programs\" is prohibited until an investigation into alleged extrajudicial killings is conducted. The Haitian judiciary's ability to carry out investigations is weak. The act approves $770 million for ESF, with $10 million allocated for children's education programs. The final version of the act approves $148 million for INCLE funding, with additional funds for correction facilities, combatting human trafficking, and oversight. It also directs collaboration with Haiti on renewable energy and governance programs, family-based care for orphans, and reforestation. The enacted version authorizes funding for Haiti, including $120 million for a multi-donor trust fund and up to $252 million for multilateral debt relief. The Secretary of State is required to submit progress reports on U.S. contributions towards Haitian development goals and donor coordination. The Administration requested $155 million for diplomatic and broadcasting operations in Haiti, with $149.5 million for the State Department. This includes funds for logistical support, staff housing repair, and repatriation loans for American citizens. The request also aims to prevent shortages in other countries for diplomatic and consular programs. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 includes $147 million for State Department operations and broadcasting in diplomatic operations in Haiti, $8 million less than the Administration requested. Additionally, $5 million is allocated for the Broadcasting Board of Governors' Creole Language Service to support broadcasts in Haiti. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 includes additional funding for various countries and aid accounts. Mexico receives funds for security support and judicial reform, Jordan gets aid for Iraqi refugees and security needs, El Salvador receives relief funds for Hurricane Ida, and the Democratic Republic of Congo is provided assistance for civilians. The Democratic Republic of Congo receives $15 million to assist civilians, particularly victims of violence. USAID's Global Health and Child Survival account gets $45 million for pandemic influenza. The State Department's Migration and Refugee Assistance account receives $165 million to aid refugees and Internally Displaced Persons. Vietnam is recommended to receive $12 million for dioxin contamination remediation. An additional $600 million is requested for border security. The House's amended version of the bill included additional funding for Capitol Police, but funds for preventing layoffs of teachers, law enforcement officers, and firefighters, as well as for farmers, energy loans, Pell Grants, and mine safety, were not included in the final version of the bill. Funding for these proposals may be included in other bills. On August 6, the Senate passed an amendment to H.R. 1586, providing $10 billion for the Education Jobs Fund and increasing federal Medicaid reimbursements. The House plans to return from recess to consider the bill. President Obama and Secretary of Education Arne Duncan emphasized the need for federal funds to prevent teacher layoffs, but no budget request was made. The final version of H.R. 4899 did not include funds to prevent layoffs. The final version of H.R. 4899 did not include funds to prevent teacher layoffs as it was not included in the Senate version passed by the House. The House initially included $10 billion for the Education Jobs Fund but withdrew support and adopted the Senate version. Proposed offsets included cuts to Race to the Top grants, Teacher Incentive Fund, and Charter School Program, triggering a veto threat from the Administration. According to the American Association of School Administrators, 275,000 teachers and school staff could be laid off in the 2010-2011 school year without additional funding. The proposed Education Jobs Fund aimed to prevent these layoffs by distributing funds to state governors based on a population-based formula. However, there is mixed evidence on the impact of lower class sizes on student academic achievement. The ARRA did not target preventing teacher layoffs, but funds were used for this purpose. The HAC majority draft bill would require the U.S. Department of Education to distribute funds to states within 45 days of enactment. States would need to meet maintenance of effort requirements to receive funds. The final version of H.R. 4899 did not include supplemental funding for hiring programs under the COPS Office. The House-amended version of H.R. 4899 dropped funding for a hiring program that would have helped law enforcement agencies facing budget shortfalls. The proposed $1.179 billion may not be sufficient to meet the demand for hiring funds, as seen with over 7,200 applications requesting $8.3 billion for 40,000 positions. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 did not include funds for firefighter hiring and retention. The House-amended version of H.R. 4899 did not provide funding for the Department of Homeland Security's SAFER program, which aims to maintain firefighter staffing levels. Proponents argue for an additional $500 million to prevent layoffs and ensure community safety, while opponents believe the current funding is sufficient given the need to reduce federal spending. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 did not include most of the funding for various programs, including the Department of Agriculture, which received $32 million to address credit shortages in the farm loan and rural housing programs due to high demand for government loans since 2008. Banks are making credit less available, depleting regular appropriations for the rural housing program by May 2010. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 addresses funding shortages in farm loan and rural housing programs by offsetting $50 million from a bioenergy program. It increases fees for Section 502 rural housing loans and adds $697 million in loan guarantee authority. The Agriculture Department is requesting $75 million for direct loans under Section 502 in FY2011, along with a new fee structure for $12 billion in loan guarantees. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 provides $12 billion in loan guarantees for farm loans, with $32 million allocated to support $950 million of loans. The Agriculture Department is also requesting $151 million for FY2011 to support $4.7 billion of farm loans. Additionally, $50 million was dropped for The Emergency Food Assistance Program, along with other rescissions totaling $979 million from various Agriculture Department accounts. The FY2010 supplemental included no funding for the Department of Energy's Loan Guarantee Program. The Administration's FY2011 request for $500 million for credit subsidy costs is pending. The House included $180 million for the DOE Loan Guarantee Program to support energy technology projects, with $90 million for advanced nuclear power facilities. The DOE requested $180 million for energy technology projects, split between advanced nuclear power facilities and renewable energy/efficiency projects. This funding could potentially support up to $18 billion in loan guarantee authority. The American Reinvestment and Recovery Act in FY2009 provided $6 billion for commercial renewable energy projects, with $2 billion allocated in July 2009. The DOE requested $180 million for energy technology projects, split between advanced nuclear power facilities and renewable energy/efficiency projects. In July 2009, $2 billion was re-programmed to support the Cash-for-Clunkers program. The Speaker of the House promised to try to restore that $2 billion to LGP. The enacted version of H.R. 4899, P.L. 111-212 does not include the $4.95 billion in additional funds for the Federal Pell Grant Program. The House Appropriations Committee FY2011 subcommittee allocations include an additional $5.7 billion for funding gaps. The FY2011 subcommittee allocations include an additional $5.7 billion for the Federal Pell Grant Program, funded through discretionary appropriations. The program provides need-based grant aid to approximately 8.3 million undergraduate students. The Administration also requested $600 million for border security along the Southwest Border of the United States. The Administration requested $600 million for border security along the Southwest border of the United States. This funding includes $399 million for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and $201 million for the Department of Justice (DOJ). Within the DHS total, $297 million would be used to hire 1,000 new Border Patrol agents, $37 million for two new unmanned aerial detection systems, $53 million for 160 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, $6.5 million for 30 new Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) officers, and $6 million for 20 new CBP canine teams to improve border enforcement operations. The DOJ funding would increase the presence of Federal law enforcement in the Southwest. $201 million of DOJ funding would increase Federal law enforcement presence in Southwest border districts by adding ATF Gunrunner Teams, FBI Hybrid Task Forces, DEA agents, equipment, operational support, attorneys, immigration judges, and support for detention and incarceration costs for criminal aliens. Funding would also support Mexican law enforcement operations with ballistic and DNA analysis, information sharing, technical capabilities, and assistance. The House passed H.R. 5875 with $701 million for border security on July 28, 2010. The House passed H.R. 5875 on July 28, 2010, including $201 million for DOJ border security efforts. The Administration requested $118 million for Deepwater Horizon oil spill response, with a mandatory funding provision for the U.S. Coast Guard enacted separately in P.L. 111-191. The Administration requested funding for various programs in response to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, including $50 million for an Oil Spill Relief Employment Assistance program, $29 million for additional inspections by the Department of the Interior, and $13 million for NOAA to mitigate economic impact on fishermen and fishery-related businesses. The Administration requested funding for various programs in response to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, including $10 million for the Department of Justice for enforcement actions, $7 million for NOAA for research support, $5 million for economic assistance, $2 million for EPA for long-term impact studies, and $2 million for FDA for seafood inspection technologies. The final version of H.R. 4899 approves $94 million for oil-spill related programs, including funding for NOAA for fisheries disaster relief, stock assessment, and ecosystem study in the Gulf. It also provides for a National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 authorizes the Army Corps of Engineers to use discretionary funds for dredging to mitigate oil spill impacts. The bill includes additional mandatory spending for veterans, Indian land trusts, discrimination claims of black farmers, Coast Guard funding, and a new unemployment benefit program for spill-affected individuals. The Secretary of the Department of Veterans' Affairs has authority to determine if exposure to hazardous substances like Agent Orange warrants a presumption of service-connected health problems. Spending for VA benefits based on current authority is not counted as new federal spending for budget enforcement. Additional mandatory funding for the Deepwater Horizon oil spill is proposed as emergency funding exempt from PAYGO rules. Court settlements require new legislative authority and funds, counting as new spending for budget enforcement. The Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs has the authority to establish presumptions of service connection for conditions related to Agent Orange exposure. The estimated cost for new presumptions of service connection for certain conditions is $13.4 billion in FY2010. The VA estimates that approximately 86,000 veterans may receive retroactive benefits for new presumptive conditions, with a total cost of $13.4 billion in FY2010. Disability compensation payments related to these presumptions will begin once final regulations are published. The Secretary of the VA already has the authority to compensate veterans for these conditions. The CBO estimated that $5 billion, not $13.4 billion, would be needed in FY2010 for additional veterans benefits related to Agent Orange. The differences in estimates are due to uncertainty about when final regulations will be issued and the time needed to process disability claims. H.R. 4899 includes the $13.4 billion requested by the Administration, with a provision prohibiting the VA from paying claims related to Agent Orange until after a Congressional review period. The Administration requested $4.6 billion to settle two longstanding cases against the government: $1.15 billion for the Pigford Black Farmers Discrimination Case; and $3.4 billion for the Cobell Indian Trust Litigation Settlement. Claimants argue that settlements could be voided if funds are not appropriated before a certain date, but deadlines have been extended. The FY2010 budget supplemental requested $1.15 billion for the Pigford II discrimination case brought by 70,000 black farmers. The Pigford II discrimination case settlement, involving 70,000 black farmers against the USDA, was announced on February 18, 2010. The $1.15 billion appropriation requested by the Administration was not made by the March 31, 2010 deadline, but the settlement remains final and non-appealable. Despite the possibility of voiding the settlement if funds were not appropriated, plaintiffs are unlikely to do so in the near term. The Administration requested $3.4 billion in FY2010 supplemental appropriations to settle litigation over mismanagement of individual Indian trust fund accounts in the Cobell v. Salazar case. $1.4 billion would be distributed to plaintiffs, $2 billion for land interests consolidation, and $60 million for education scholarships. The settlement requires legislative authorization by August 6, 2010, with the deadline extended multiple times. The lawsuit stemmed from Interior's inability to accurately account for payments into and from Individual Indian Monies trust accounts. The Interior managed Individual Indian Monies (IIM) trust accounts set up in the 19th century for income from individuals' trust lands. There are 384,000 IIM accounts with a total asset value over $460 million. The Cobell settlement aims to end 14 years of litigation over mismanagement, with mixed support from Indian organizations and plaintiffs. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 does not include the requested $4.6 billion appropriation for the settlements. The House version of the Pigford II court settlements included language for direct spending authority from the Judgment Fund, but it was dropped from the final version. Senator Reid's office may propose passing these provisions in a separate bill. The final version of H.R. 4899 did not include provisions from the earlier House July amended version that identified $4.68 billion in mandatory savings over ten years. These provisions aimed to reduce government medical care expenditures by increasing rebates states receive from drug manufacturers and giving the FTC more authority to limit deals between brand name and generic drug makers. The final version of H.R. 4899 did not include provisions from the earlier House July amended version that aimed to increase rebates states receive from drug manufacturers and give the FTC more authority to limit deals between brand name and generic drug makers. The July 1 amended House version of the supplemental appropriations act would have amended Medicaid law to include injected, infused, and inhaled dosage forms of outpatient drugs in determining AMP, a benchmark price used to calculate rebates for prescription drugs purchased by states on behalf of Medicaid beneficiaries. The House July 1 amended version of H.R. 4899 proposed changes to include injected, infused, and inhaled forms of outpatient drugs in the AMP calculation for Medicaid drug rebates. This amendment was estimated to reduce federal Medicaid expenditures by $2.1 billion over 10 years, but the Senate did not accept these provisions. The House July amended version of H.R. 4899 includes the Preserve Access to Affordable Generics Act, aimed at stopping pay-to-delay arrangements in the pharmaceutical industry. This provision was not included in the enacted health reform bills despite being proposed in earlier versions. The House amended version of H.R. 4899 includes the Preserve Access to Affordable Generics Act, which aims to prevent pay-to-delay agreements in the pharmaceutical industry. This provision was not included in the enacted health reform bills. The FDA can approve generic drugs after the patent period ends, reducing costs for consumers and the government. Delaying generic drug availability increases costs, and the new provisions would make any agreement involving compensation for delaying research and development unlawful. The FTC Act prohibits agreements involving compensation for delaying generic drug research, development, marketing, manufacturing, or sales. This provision aims to reduce federal budget deficits by $2.68 billion over the 2010-2020 period. The Senate did not accept these provisions, and the enacted version did not include funds for initiatives to reduce waste, fraud, and abuse in federal programs. The House July amended version included $538 million in funding for various federal agencies to conduct activities to reduce improper payments and prevent illegal activity. This funding was allocated to the Department of Health and Human Services, Internal Revenue Service, Department of Labor, and Social Security Administration for enhanced tax enforcement and healthcare fraud control. The House amended version included $538 million in funding for federal agencies to conduct activities to reduce improper payments and prevent illegal activity. The funds would support Medicare Advantage, Medicare drug benefits, Medicaid, and the State Children's Health Insurance Program. A portion of the funds would go to the HHS Office of the Inspector General, Department of Justice for fraud investigations, SSA for disability reviews, and DOL for reemployment reviews and unemployment insurance reviews. The funding was not designated as emergency funding and would be available until September 2011 for some agencies and September 30, 2012 for others. The CBO estimated that additional PI funding would increase the federal deficit by $538 million in 2010, with no estimated savings. The Administration proposed expanding Coast Guard funds from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund and setting up a new unemployment assistance program. The Trust Fund allows the Coast Guard to withdraw up to $150 million annually for response activities, supported by an excise tax on domestic petroleum. The Administration proposed an excise tax on domestic and imported petroleum to replenish the trust fund and increase the tax per barrel of oil. They also suggested a new unemployment benefit program for those affected by the spill, with costs to be reimbursed by responsible parties under the Oil Pollution Act. Mandatory appropriations would be made as advances from the trust fund, with later withdrawals not requiring appropriations and recoupment from liable parties. The Administration's proposal under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 includes $125 million in mandatory appropriations, with $150 million in spending offset by $25 million recovered from responsible parties. The Coast Guard would be authorized to make advances of $100 million from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund for the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, with a proposed cap increase from $1 billion to $1.5 billion for total expenditure on individual incidents. The Office of Management and Budget estimated $1.575 billion in the trust fund for the Deepwater Horizon oil spill response. The proposed increase in annual advances from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund would enhance federal emergency response capabilities for this specific spill. The Coast Guard would need to notify Congress within 7 days for advanced funds for the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, while other spills would still require 30 days notice. The final version of H.R. 4899 included provisions for the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund similar to legislation passed separately in response to concerns raised. The legislation (P.L. 111-191) raised the cap to $1 billion for the Deepwater Horizon spill and allows $100 million withdrawals with 7-day notifications to Congress. CBO estimated $50 million in FY2010 offset by reimbursements in FY2012. The amount available to the Coast Guard would depend on the number of advances drawn from the trust fund, up to the $1 billion cap. Reimbursements would depend on liability enforcement under the Oil Pollution Act. The final version of H.R. 4899 did not include the Administration's proposed new mandatory unemployment compensation program. Congress addressed the Administration's $64.3 billion request for supplemental spending for FY2010 multiple times between March 24, 2010, and July 27, 2010. Congressional action included passing H.R. 4899 with spending for the Disaster Relief Fund, Federal Emergency Management Agency, Department of Labor's summer jobs program, and new Budget Authority. The Senate passed H.R. 4899 with $59.3 billion in spending for various purposes including disaster relief, war funding, and Haiti reconstruction. The House adopted the Senate version with additional funds for education and court cases, totaling $81.8 billion in spending. The Senate failed to pass the amended House version, leading to disagreement between the two chambers. The House receded from its support of the July 1, 2010 version of H.R. 4899 and adopted the Senate's May 25 version by a vote of 308-114 on July 27, 2010. The President signed the bill into law on July 29, 2010. The House bill focused on disaster relief and totaled $5.7 billion in spending, while the Senate version addressed most elements in the Administration request except for funding for certain court settlements. The Senate version of H.R. 4212 included funding for various purposes such as FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund, war-related activities, Haiti relief, Deepwater Horizon oil spill response, benefits for Vietnam veterans exposed to Agent Orange, and other disaster relief and foreign aid programs. The total spending was $59.3 billion, offset by $300 million in rescissions, for a total of $58.9 billion, which was $4.1 billion below the Administration's request. The Senate debated H.R. 4899, focusing on amendments for border security, Gulf oil spill response, supplemental spending, disaster funding, and Afghanistan withdrawal. A proposal by Senator Reid set strict time limits for amendments and a cloture motion, which was rejected. Administration supported the Senate version, $4.1 billion below their request. The Senate rejected six amendments, including proposals for additional funding for National Guard personnel and measures to respond to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Senators also proposed cutting $59 billion in federal funding to finance deficit spending. The Senate rejected six amendments proposing additional funding for National Guard personnel and measures to address the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Senators also suggested cutting $59 billion in federal funding to finance deficit spending. Senator Inouye questioned the realism of proposals to rescind unobligated balances, cap federal salaries, and other measures. The Senate rejected several proposed amendments, including one to provide funds for deploying National Guards on the border, another requiring a timetable for troop redeployment from Afghanistan, and one cutting $59 billion in federal funding over 10 years. The Senate passed H.R. 4899 with $45 billion in rescinded funds and invoked cloture on May 27, 2010. The House later added $22.5 billion for domestic programs and $16.3 billion in rescissions on July 1, 2010. The House adopted a rule on July 1, 2010, setting procedures for H.R. 4899 and funding settlement costs for court cases. The House adopted a rule on July 1, 2010, setting procedures for H.R. 4899 and funding settlement costs for court cases. The rule included mandatory funding levels in the House through a \"deeming\" resolution and changed transportation grant formulas and tax eligibility rules for biofuel producers. The House passed House Amendment No. 2, adding funding for domestic programs not in the Senate bill. Republican members argued for confining spending to FEMA disaster assistance, war funding, new VA benefits, and settling court cases, while Democrats justified additional domestic spending to prevent layoffs and provide credit for farmers, energy projects, and students. The House amended the bill on July 1, 2010, to include additional funding for various purposes: $10.0 billion for Education Job Funds, $5.0 billion for Pell Grants, $701 million for border security, $538 million for Program Integrity initiatives, $180 million for energy loans, and $159 million for oil spill recovery. Debate focused on war-related amendments and the Administration's policy in Afghanistan, including troop withdrawal plans. The House amended the bill on July 1, 2010, to include additional funding for various purposes, such as education job funds, Pell Grants, border security, program integrity initiatives, energy loans, and oil spill recovery. The House version also included increased funding for non-defense DOD spending, base closure transportation improvements, and a Soldier Readiness Center at Fort Hood. Additionally, the House version had larger offsets from rescissions and savings in mandatory programs compared to the Senate version. The House version of the bill included $12.2 billion in rescissions, with $3.2 billion in DOD funding set to expire by September 30, 2010. Rescissions of unobligated authority can offset new spending, with budget authority available for obligation from one to five years depending on the type of authority. If budget authority remains unobligated at the end of its useful life, the funds expire and reduce the deficit. Some rescissions are controversial, while others are not, especially when the budget authority is unlikely to be obligated before the end of its fiscal life. The House version of the bill included $12.2 billion in rescissions, with $3.2 billion in DOD funding set to expire by September 30, 2010. Other rescissions included $500 million in DOD's Military construction funding, $2.2 billion in unused highway contract authority, $2 billion in pandemic flu funds, $1.3 billion in American Recovery Act funding, $800 million in unobligated Education Department funding, $748 million in disaster assistance funding, $220 million in State Department funding, and $1.8 billion from other programs. The Administration threatened to veto any version of the bill that undermined the President's abilities as Commander-in-Chief or included $800 million in rescissions to the education initiative. The House rejected three amendments related to war funding in Afghanistan on July 1, 2010. The first two amendments failed by wide margins, while the third required funds to align with the President's policy for troop withdrawal by July 1, 2011, unless Congress explicitly approved a change. The House rejected an amendment on war funding in Afghanistan that required the President to submit a withdrawal plan by April 4, 2011, conduct a new intelligence estimate, and report on oversight of contractors. The amendment failed by a vote of 162 to 260."
