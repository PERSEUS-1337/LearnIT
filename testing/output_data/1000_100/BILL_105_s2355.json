    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Truancy Prevention and Juvenile Crime Reduction Act of 1998\". Congress finds that truancy is a significant issue, with links to dropping out of school, criminal behavior, high rates of burglary and vandalism, and violent juvenile crime during school hours. Truancy among children aged 13-16 is a significant issue, with up to 75% of those arrested for crimes being truants. Some cities report 70% of daily student absences are unexcused, reaching 4,000 absences per day. The social and economic costs of truancy are high, with only 34% of inmates completing high school and truants costing the nation $240 billion in lost earnings and foregone taxes. In many cases, parents are unaware of their child's truancy. Effective truancy prevention programs can reduce crime rates and improve school attendance. However, there is a lack of targeted funding for these programs in current law. \"Grants are provided for effective truancy prevention programs to improve school attendance and reduce crime rates.\" The section defines terms like eligible partnership, local educational agency, and qualified unit of local government for grant applications related to truancy prevention programs. The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 allows for grants to eligible partnerships to reduce truancy and juvenile crime. Grants are awarded on a competitive basis, with a maximum amount of $100,000 per fiscal year. At least 25 percent of each grant must be allocated to the partnership. The grant awarded to eligible partnerships can be used by local educational agencies to address truancy. Grants can be renewed for up to 2 fiscal years. Funds can be used for parental involvement, sanctions for habitually truant students, and parental accountability, including fines. In addressing truancy, strategies may include parental accountability through fines, teacher-aid duty, and community service, in-school prevention programs, involvement of various community entities, technology utilization, and eliminating incentives for truancy. The Attorney General may prioritize funding for model programs. The Attorney General may prioritize funding for programs that replicate model truancy intervention programs in various cities across the United States. The Attorney General may prioritize funding for model truancy intervention programs in different cities, including initiatives in Oklahoma City, Norfolk, Virginia, Marion, Ohio, Bakersfield, California, Farmington, New Mexico, and other programs deemed appropriate. $25,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 1999 to 2001 for this purpose."
