FINDINGS.\" Congress finds that nearly 2 million transportation workers have applied for and received a TWIC, required for access to secure areas of MTSA-regulated vessels and facilities. Applicants must pay $132.50 and make multiple trips to an enrollment center for the TWIC. The Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC) is valid for up to five years, requiring cardholders to request a new card and make multiple trips to an enrollment center, costing $132.50 each time. Workers often face the burden of traveling long distances to the nearest enrollment center, as the process is not mandated by law but driven by DHS policy. The TWIC aligns with PIV standards in FIPS-201 but may deviate when necessary. Unlike other credentials, TWIC is a work permit for a mobile private sector workforce. Possession does not grant unescorted access to secure areas without authorization. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has the authority to create a more efficient process for TWIC enrollment that doesn't require multiple trips to an enrollment center. Government-issued identity documents, like passports, can be sent to applicants by mail. Despite Congress's mandate, a final rule on TWIC biometric readers has not been issued as of August 2010. Congress urges reform of the TWIC application process by the end of 2012 to avoid burdens on workers and businesses. The deployment of TWIC readers should be required promptly for security. Port Security Grant funds for TWIC projects should not expire before the final TWIC reader rule is issued. The Secretary of Homeland Security is required to reform the TWIC application process within 90 days of the enactment of the Act, limiting in-person visits to one except in special circumstances. This was passed by the House of Representatives on June 28, 2012."
