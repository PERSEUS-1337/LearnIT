The findings section highlights the prevalence of breast implants among American women, with estimates ranging from 1,000,000 to 2,000,000 recipients over 35 years. The FDA received numerous adverse reaction reports for silicone and saline-filled implants from 1985 to January 2000. Women are emphasized to need complete and accurate information about breast implants. Silicone breast implants were never FDA approved; saline implants were approved in 2000 despite high complication rates. 43% of augmentation patients and 73% of reconstruction patients experienced local complications after three years. 40% of reconstruction patients needed additional surgery due to complications and device failure. FDA opened a criminal investigation in 1998 following allegations. The FDA opened a criminal investigation in 1998 after allegations of research data manipulation by a breast implant manufacturer. Despite high complication rates, saline implants were approved in 2000. Studies showed that 1 in 4 women needed additional surgery within 5 years of receiving implants, and almost 70% had at least one ruptured implant after 10 to 15 years. A 1993 study found silicone migrating from breast implants in 21% of women, with unknown health implications. Another study concluded that silicone implants can lead to the development of antibodies and should not be considered benign. The Institute of Medicine's 1999 study highlighted local complications as the primary safety concern with silicone breast implants. Information on these complications is crucial for women considering breast implant surgery. Concerns persist about potential connective tissue or autoimmune diseases from silicone exposure. Additionally, a 2001 National Cancer Institute study found higher rates of lung and brain cancer among breast implant recipients. Silicone migration from ruptured breast implants can cause severe inflammation and complications in women. Once silicone gel escapes the implant, it can trigger pathological responses. Breast implants can hinder accurate mammograms, potentially masking up to 40% of breast tissue and delaying breast cancer detection. According to a 2000 FDA publication, breast implants may impact breastfeeding as silicone from the implant shell could potentially pass into breast milk, with unknown effects on the nursing infant. The purpose of the Act is to promote research on the health effects of breast implants, ensure women receive accurate information, and address allegations of wrongdoing by manufacturers. The Act does not affect existing regulations under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act regarding silicone breast implants for specific medical purposes. The National Institutes of Health will provide a report on existing research on silicone breast implants within 90 days. An amendment to the Public Health Service Act will include a new section on breast implant research. The Director of NIH appoints a coordinator for breast implant research, who will oversee participation from various Institutes including the Office of Research on Women's Health, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and National Cancer Institute. Study sections will be established for this purpose. The Director of NIH will establish study sections to review research grant applications on breast implants and ensure research quality. Research will be conducted to understand health implications of saline and silicone breast implants, including a clinical study of women with implants for at least eight years. A study will differentiate between women receiving breast implants for various reasons and focus on local complications and atypical symptoms. The Director of NIH will submit an annual report on the study's results to Congress. The Food and Drug Administration will intensify postmarket research on saline breast implants based on recommendations from their panel. The Commissioner of Food and Drugs will report to Congress on the implementation status of these recommendations at regular intervals. Additionally, activities regarding silicone breast implants will be expanded and intensified at the FDA. To ensure accurate information on silicone breast implants, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs will expedite investigations into wrongdoing by manufacturers, update consumer information materials, and provide timely data on reported issues. The FDA will require manufacturers of silicone breast implants to update package inserts and informed consent documents regularly, provide accurate information on complications and ruptures, and ensure that clinical study patients receive the FDA's breast implant booklet and informed consent documents. The FDA mandates manufacturers of silicone breast implants to update informed consent documents, provide accurate complication information, and establish a patient information panel for annual review of breast implant details and advertisements. The FDA reviews breast implant information and ads to ensure accuracy. Membership includes saline and silicone breast implant recipients, bioethicists, rheumatologists, and oncologists with experience in clinical care and research."
