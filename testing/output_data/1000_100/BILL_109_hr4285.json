The Congress recognizes the importance of detection canines in homeland security for detecting explosives, narcotics, concealed humans, and cadavers in various locations where technology may not be effective. There is a shortage of detection canines available to support law enforcement at all levels. The Congress has authorized 2,000 new Border Patrol agents annually for 5 years without increasing the number of detection canines deployed with them. Canines are needed in mass transit systems and urban search and rescue operations. Detection canines were effective during Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in the Gulf Coast region. The Bureau of United States Customs and Border Protection, the United States Secret Service, the Coast Guard, and the Federal Protective Service use detection canines for security purposes. The Subcommittee on Management, Integration, and Oversight of the Committee on Homeland Security discussed the shortage of trained detection canines in a hearing on September 28, 2005. Increasing the number of trained detection canines is a priority for security agencies like the Bureau of United States Customs and Border Protection, the United States Secret Service, the Coast Guard, and the Federal Protective Service. In fiscal years 2007 through 2011, the Secretary of Homeland Security must increase the number of trained detection canines by 25% at ports of entry, airports, mass transit systems, Coast Guard stations, Secret Service operations, and Federal Protective Service. The Secretary of Homeland Security must increase the number of trained detection canines by 25% at various locations, including ports of entry, airports, mass transit systems, Coast Guard stations, Secret Service operations, and Federal Protective Service, to ensure availability in emergencies. SEC. 4. COORDINATION AND ENHANCEMENT OF CANINE TRAINING PROGRAMS. The Secretary of Homeland Security is required to coordinate canine training programs for various security missions, utilize existing resources efficiently, and explore partnerships to increase the number of trained detection canines available to law enforcement agencies. The Secretary of Homeland Security must report to congressional committees within 120 days on the Department's plan to coordinate and consolidate its canine training programs, including increasing coordination with other federal agencies like the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The Secretary of Homeland Security is required to prioritize increasing the use of domestically bred canines for counter-terrorism purposes, consult with other federal agencies to encourage domestic breeding, and consolidate canine procurement to reduce costs across the Federal Government."
