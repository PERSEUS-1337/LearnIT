    "title": "AB 2133",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Improving occupational health and safety for family child care providers is a priority for California, as it will also protect the children under their care. Family child care providers face occupational health and safety hazards such as toxic chemicals, illness, stress, and physical strain. They have musculoskeletal injury rates similar to industrial workers. Since they are not covered by workers' compensation insurance, it is crucial for them to be trained to prevent injuries and illnesses on the job. California is prioritizing improving occupational health and safety for family child care providers to protect both them and the children under their care. The director must annually publish a list of licensed child day care facilities, excluding small family day care homes, detailing their services and licensed capacity. The department will protect the privacy of small family day care homes by not including their names and addresses on the lists. The information of small family day care homes is protected by not including their names and addresses on published lists, except for specific purposes like licensing programs and child placement. Names and addresses may be shared with certain agencies and programs for educational and funding purposes. The entity selected to provide trainings required by Section 1596.864 includes family day care organizations and specialized health care service plans licensed under the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975. They offer employee assistance program services, including child care referral services. Parents seeking local day care services can request names and telephone numbers of local small family day care providers. The department, in consultation with the Child Development Division, will adopt regulations on confidentiality of information for small family day care homes. Violators may be denied access to information and reported to appropriate departments. Section 1596.864 defines \"family child care provider\" and includes training requirements. A family child care provider is either a licensed family day care home provider or a person who provides child care under a publicly funded program and is exempt from licensing, excluding relatives of the children in care. A family child care provider under a publicly funded program must attend a two-hour training on occupational health and safety risks specific to the child care profession. The State Department of Social Services may establish a schedule for family child care providers to complete training within four years or three months of becoming a provider. The training includes discussions on risks like chemical hazards, infectious diseases, and physical hazards, as well as opportunities to learn from child care professionals. The Department of Industrial Relations will select an entity to provide occupational health and safety training for family child care providers based on experience and competitive process. This training includes opportunities for providers to learn from professionals, give feedback on received training, and engage in improving the child care system. Organizations fostering collective engagement will also present relevant information on health and safety for providers and children. The State Department of Social Services will select an entity to train family child care providers on health and safety matters. The curriculum for the training sessions will be developed with input from providers and approved by the Division of Occupational Safety and Health. The training will be coordinated with other preservice training requirements to reduce the burden on providers. The department will provide lists of family child care providers who have attended training and those who still need to attend, along with their contact information, to the training entity. The entity will use this information to update providers on health and safety issues. Providers can request to have their home address and telephone number removed from the lists before they are released. The department and the training entity must comply with the Dymally-Alatorre Bilingual Services Act, providing training materials in non-English languages. This section will be effective on July 1, 2017. Section 1 of the act, effective July 1, 2017, aims to codify the rights of child care providers in alternative payment programs to file complaints with the State Department of Education for violations of laws or regulations. Section 8221.6 of the Education Code allows licensed or license-exempt child care providers in alternative payment programs to file complaints if the program has not complied with laws or regulations. The programs covered include the California Alternative Payment Program, CalWORKs Stage 2 Program, CalWORKs Stage 3 Program, and Migrant Alternative Payment Program. The enactment of an appropriation for this purpose is required for the operation of this section."
