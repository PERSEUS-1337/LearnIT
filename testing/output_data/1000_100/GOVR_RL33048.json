    "content": "Since September 11, 2001, Congress has focused on federal regulations and programs for hazardous chemicals security to prevent terrorist attacks. The goal is to maintain the availability of these chemicals for commercial use while reducing the risk of exploitation. Hazardous chemicals are present in commercial facilities, marine, rail, and highway transportation. Congressional attention has mainly been on securing chemicals transported by rail or tanker trucks and stored near populated areas. Congress is now reviewing federal policies related to marine transportation. Congress is reviewing federal policies related to marine transportation of hazardous chemical cargo, with a focus on increasing penalties for criminal or terrorist activities. The report provides an overview of hazardous chemicals marine transportation in the United States, discussing risks in the homeland security context and federal statistics on hazardous chemical marine shipments. The report summarizes federal statistics on hazardous chemical marine shipments in U.S. waters, including shipment volumes and port locations. It discusses relevant U.S. maritime security regulations, raises security policy issues, and emphasizes the importance of marine chemicals security in the nation's overall chemical security strategy. The focus is on acutely hazardous chemical cargoes that could pose a catastrophic hazard if released, excluding other maritime security hazards like petroleum products or biological agents. The report highlights the threat posed by hazardous chemical marine shipments, which are potential targets for terrorist attacks due to their toxicity and combustibility. These shipments are considered critical infrastructures by the Bush Administration, emphasizing the need for their protection. The protection of hazardous chemical shipments passing through U.S. waterways and ports is crucial for homeland security. While no marine vessel carrying hazardous chemicals has been used in a terrorist attack, accidents involving these shipments have shown their potential impact on nearby communities. Intelligence suggests terrorists may have the interest and capability to execute such attacks in the United States. Serious incidents involving chemical marine shipments have caused casualties and forced evacuations of coastal populations. Examples include the 1917 explosion of the Mont-Blanc in Halifax and the 1947 Texas City disaster. Despite improved safety measures, incidents like the 1985 fire aboard the Ariadne in Somalia continue to pose risks. In 1987, the Cason ship carrying 1,200 tons of dangerous chemicals had an accident near Cape Finisterre, Spain. In 1999, the Multitank Ascania caught fire off the coast of Scotland while carrying vinyl acetate. Although no serious casualties occurred in these incidents, emergency responders were concerned about public safety and conducted evacuations. Terrorists have attempted to release chemicals from land-based facilities, but there have been no chemical attacks using marine cargo vessels on the general public. In the late 1990s, criminals attempted to release chemicals from facilities in the US, including a propane storage facility in California and a gas refinery in Texas. Terrorists have targeted marine vessels, such as the oil tanker Limburg off the Yemeni coast in 2002. Concerns have been raised about terrorist groups commandeering hazardous chemical vessels and crashing them into ports. The Department of Homeland Security is concerned about the security of chemical tanker ships, including the risk of terrorist attacks on ships carrying hazardous cargoes. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) tankers have been identified as potential terrorist targets due to the real risks associated with their shipments. The risks associated with LNG shipments are real and can never be entirely eliminated. A 2004 report by Sandia National Laboratories identified potential terrorist attacks on LNG tankers as credible and possible, highlighting vulnerabilities such as ramming, explosives, insider takeover, hijacking, and external terrorist actions. Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 focuses on terrorist attacks that could cause catastrophic health effects or mass casualties comparable to those from a weapon of mass destruction. Hazardous chemical cargo on commercial marine vessels poses a catastrophic hazard if accidentally released or combusted. The Department of Transportation (DOT) regulates hazardous materials transportation under the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act of 1975. Hazardous chemicals pose various risks such as poisoning, asphyxiation, chemical burns, and thermal burns. The DOT classifies thousands of materials as hazardous based on potential risks to health, safety, and property during transportation. The DOT regulates hazardous materials transportation under 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 172.101, grouping materials by type of hazard. Highly hazardous cargo, as defined by the DOT, includes radioactive materials, explosives, poisonous inhalation materials, bulk hazardous liquids or gases, and bulk hazardous materials. Security plans are required for shippers of highly hazardous cargo under 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 172.8. The Coast Guard regulates hazardous materials on marine vessels, including bulk hazardous liquids or gases, bulk hazardous solids, and packaged hazardous materials. They enforce federal laws for hazardous materials in U.S. waters, with specific regulations under the Port and Waterways Safety Act of 1972. Certain dangerous cargoes are defined in 33 C.F.R. \u00a7 160.204, referencing the DOT list of highly hazardous materials. The Coast Guard prescribes special requirements for vessels carrying hazardous materials, including bulk solid, liquid, liquefied gas, and compressed gas cargoes. Incompatible chemicals are also regulated for safe transport on marine vessels. Hazardous marine cargoes are identified through regulations for waterfront facilities handling these materials. Hundreds of different hazardous materials are included on the Coast Guard's lists. The EPA regulates stationary facilities handling hazardous substances under the Clean Air Act. Risk management plans are required for facilities with specified threshold quantities of certain hazardous substances. Plans must include off-site consequence analysis for worst-case accidents and measures to prevent releases and mitigate damage. The Clean Air Act Amendments expanded the definition of hazardous substances to include 14 listed substances and additional chemicals designated by the EPA. The EPA designated chemicals posing the greatest risks based on severity of potential adverse health effects, likelihood of accidental releases, and potential human exposure. The list included acutely toxic substances, flammable gases, and volatile flammable liquids. High explosives were removed in 1998, and flammable substances used as fuel were excluded in 2000. The current EPA/RMP list is in Appendix 2. The EPA/RMP list identifies hazardous chemicals with potential consequences to the general public, including those that may pose risks if transported on water. These chemicals are among the most hazardous on land and are also found in the DOT and Coast Guard hazardous materials lists. The findings in this report using EPA/RMP chemicals can be applicable to the DOT or Coast Guard lists as well. The EPA/RMP list identifies hazardous chemicals with potential consequences to the general public, including those that may pose risks if transported on water. The report cross-references EPA/RMP chemicals to DOT categories. Two notable classes of hazardous material identified by DOT not on the EPA/RMP list are radioactive materials and explosives. Excluding these two classes is unlikely to affect the policy conclusions in this report. EPA/RMP chemicals are broadly classified as acutely toxic or flammable. Specific chemicals within the list vary in toxicity or flammability. Example chemicals include Ammonia, which is acutely toxic and potentially explosive. Ammonia is a toxic and potentially explosive gas used in fertilizer production and other applications. It can quickly reach harmful levels in the air, causing skin and respiratory irritation. Methane, on the other hand, is not inherently toxic but can cause asphyxiation in high concentrations. It is flammable and may freeze body parts upon contact. Methyloxirane is a toxic and flammable liquid used in manufacturing polyurethane foam, solvents, and other industrial products. It can irritate the eyes, skin, and respiratory tract. Methyloxirane vapor is highly flammable and reacts explosively with certain substances. An uncontrolled release of chemicals on the EPA/RMP list can have varying effects on exposed populations. The EPA considers all RMP chemicals above threshold quantities hazardous and warrant special regulatory treatment. Chemical properties may affect health hazards differently over water. Some chemicals dissolve or sink in water, reducing public hazard in marine incidents, while others evaporate quickly or float and evaporate. The Army Corps of Engineers maintains statistics on marine commerce in U.S. waters, which can be used to estimate the shipping volumes of EPA/RMP chemicals. Some chemicals pose a larger hazard zone more quickly in a marine release compared to a land release due to their characteristics. Further research is needed to understand the relative marine hazards of specific chemicals. Table 1 summarizes the 2003 U.S. waterborne shipments of hazardous EPA/RMP chemicals, totaling over 48 million tons, accounting for 2% of total U.S. waterborne cargo tonnage. These chemicals are included on the list due to their hazardous properties, which could pose a catastrophic threat to the public if present in large volumes. Consideration of both size and number of shipments is important in analyzing marine cargo terrorism hazards. In 2003, over 100,000 marine shipments of EPA/RMP hazardous cargo passed through U.S. waterways, with consideration for the overall volume and number of shipments being crucial in assessing the potential public impact of a terrorist attack. The data on shipments and average cargo tons per shipment are shown in Figure 1, highlighting the variability in cargo tonnage carried aboard vessels. The logarithmic scale in Figure 1 illustrates the distribution of hazardous chemicals in marine shipments. In 2003, marine shipments of EPA/RMP hazardous chemicals varied in volume, with data plotted on a logarithmic scale for clarity. The EPA regulations set minimum threshold quantities for risk planning between 500 and 20,000 pounds. The average shipment volume exceeded the 20,000 pound threshold, requiring off-site consequence plans. Each category of chemicals was typically shipped in significant quantities. In 2003, hazardous cargoes were shipped between several hundred and several thousand times. Different types of vessels transport these cargoes, each with distinct characteristics based on the cargoes they carry. Tankers and liquid chemical barges accounted for over 67% of hazardous marine cargo shipments, while non-self-propelled liquid chemical barges carried an additional 29%. Other vessels like container ships and dry cargo barges carried the remaining 4%. Liquefied gas tankers are oceangoing ships designed to carry various types of liquefied gas cargo such as butane, propane, LNG, butadiene, and more. These tankers have large onboard tanks that are pressurized, refrigerated, and insulated to meet different cargo requirements. International shipping codes enforce strict standards for their construction and operation. Liquefied gas tankers must adhere to international shipping codes for construction and operation. Their cargo tanks are robust, double-hulled, and designed to withstand high pressures or low temperatures. This structural integrity makes them highly resistant to grounding and collision damage. LNG tankers carry only LNG, while other tankers may carry a combination of different cargoes, creating unique multi-chemical hazards. Liquefied gas carriers vary in capacity, with LNG tankers having capacities ranging from 25,000 m3 to 147,000 m3, and plans for new construction of 200,000 m3 capacity. Chemical parcel tankers are versatile vessels designed to carry various liquid and chemical cargoes, including hazardous chemicals. Chemical parcel tankers are versatile vessels designed to carry various liquid and chemical cargoes, including hazardous chemicals. They typically have 10 to 60 separate cargo tanks with capacities ranging from 3,000 to 50,000 tons. These tankers are constructed according to international standards and may have cargo tanks lined with stainless steel or specialized coatings to ensure compatibility with different chemicals. Liquid chemical barges are shallow draft vessels designed to carry bulk liquid chemicals in coastal regions and inland waterways. They range in size from 700 to 3,500 tons of total cargo capacity and may contain multiple separate cargo tanks lined with special coatings. Larger barges transporting hazardous chemicals are typically double-hulled and self-propelled, while smaller ones may rely on tugboats for movement. Unpowered chemical barges on inland waterways are approximately 52 to 54 feet wide and up to 300 feet long. Inland barges are typically 52 to 54 feet wide and up to 300 feet long, traveling in groups of two to eight per towboat. They can carry refrigerated cargo tanks with a capacity of 1,250 to 1,500 tons of chemicals. Pressurized cargo tanks are also available for liquid cargoes. Hazardous chemicals may be transported on conventional container ships in multi-modal tank containers or drums. Hazardous chemicals can be transported on various vessels like container ships, roll-on/roll-off vessels, and general cargo ships. Large quantities of these chemicals may be present on container ships at any time. The public hazards associated with these chemicals are proportional to the volume being transported. Comparing volumes of hazardous chemicals on marine vessels, rail tank cars, and highway tanker trucks for EPA/RMP hazardous cargo. Rail tank cars can carry 50 to 90 tons, containerized tank cars on flatbed railcars up to 70 tons. Highway tanker trucks transport hazardous cargoes like anhydrous ammonia, chlorine, and LPG. Cargo tank capacity for EPA/RMP transport modes varies from 15 to 30 tons for tanker trucks carrying hazardous chemicals such as anhydrous ammonia, chlorine, and LPG. Marine tankers generally have a much larger capacity compared to rail or highway tanker trucks. Multiple tanks are common on liquefied gas tankers, chemical parcel tankers, and liquid cargo barges. Comparing actual volumes shipped across different modes is challenging due to partial cargoes and multiple shipments involved. Comparing marine shipment volumes of EPA/RMP hazardous material with rail and highway tank capacities shows that marine shipments are often larger. The EPA database tracks on-site chemical storage volumes for facilities under the Clean Air Act, Section 112(r). These filings help estimate the maximum and average quantity of EPA/RMP chemicals across facilities required to file risk management plans. These facilities have the highest on-site quantities of EPA/RMP chemicals in a single storage location. The EPA database tracks on-site chemical storage volumes for facilities under the Clean Air Act, Section 112(r), estimating the maximum and average quantity of EPA/RMP chemicals. A comparison of marine shipping volumes and land storage volumes for nine EPA/RMP chemicals showed that marine shipments were generally larger for chemicals shipped in higher volumes. The average marine shipments of EPA/RMP hazardous chemicals are generally larger than volumes stored at chemical plants, consistent with shipping higher volume cargo in larger vessels. Marine shipments either originate or terminate in U.S. ports, where facilities may serve as transportation hubs or industrial plants for hazardous cargo. Some port facilities produce hazardous cargo directly for industrial processes like petrochemical refining and water treatment. The total marine shipments of EPA/RMP chemicals vary across ports, with some ports handling more hazardous cargo than others. In 2003, 113 out of 360 commercial ports in the United States shipped EPA/RMP hazardous chemicals, with the top 30 ports handling 95% of the cargo tonnage. These 30 ports are crucial for policy discussions regarding hazardous marine shipments. In 2003, 22 EPA/RMP chemicals were shipped through the port of Baton Rouge in quantities exceeding 2,500 tons. The top 30 hazardous chemical ports are located in 15 states, with over half in the Gulf of Mexico. An attack on a hazardous cargo vessel in any port could have serious public consequences. In 2003, the top 30 ports handling EPA/RMP hazardous cargo included ports in Louisiana, Alabama, Florida, and Mississippi. The most frequently shipped hazardous chemicals were LPG and ammonia. Great Lakes ports were not on the list. The ports are classified as coastal except for Huntington, WV, which is on the Ohio River. The terrorism risk in U.S. ports is influenced by various factors including hazardous cargo volumes, DOT shipments, non-chemical cargo hazards, passenger traffic, proximity to populations, port configuration, and threat intelligence. The Department of Homeland Security considers these factors in its Port Security Grant Program, which identifies ports eligible for security enhancement grants. For the FY2005 program, 66 ports were eligible out of the 129 largest U.S. ports evaluated. Table 4 highlights that 24 of the top 30 hazardous material ports are included. The Coast Guard is responsible for promoting U.S. maritime security, including vessel and port security. They oversee the safety of vessels, waterways, and shore facilities in each port. Special attention is given to ships carrying hazardous cargo, with regulations in place for their construction, operation, and response to accidents. Since 9/11, the Coast Guard has expanded maritime security regulations to address terrorism threats. They now distinguish between safety measures for accidents and security measures for sabotage. Area maritime security committees assess port vulnerabilities and create plans to address them. The Coast Guard assesses port vulnerabilities and creates plans to address them, focusing on marine targets' susceptibility to terrorist attacks. These plans involve deploying federal, state, and local resources to prevent attacks and enhancing security measures for key marine assets. They also contribute to the development of maritime security standards under the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 and the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code. The ISPS Code, established by the International Maritime Organization, requires ships and port facilities worldwide to create security plans approved by their national government. These plans must include security measures for different threat levels and designate a security officer. Ships and ports must also deploy security equipment, monitor access, and ensure security communications. The Coast Guard reviewed and approved over 9,000 security plans by July 1, 2004. The Coast Guard reviewed and approved security plans for over 9,000 vessels by July 1, 2004, under the MTSA and ISPS Code. They also conducted on-site inspections to ensure plan implementation. Additionally, the Coast Guard assessed the security of 55 strategic ports and took specific measures to prevent terrorist attacks on hazardous chemical vessels. They evaluated tanker vulnerability to various types of attacks and are assessing inland barges carrying dangerous cargoes. The Coast Guard is conducting a special assessment of inland barges carrying dangerous cargoes to evaluate vulnerabilities and potential blast consequences. They require information from vessels carrying hazardous chemicals four days before arrival or departure to determine security risks. Coast Guard may board vessels, post armed sea-marshals, and escort ships carrying hazardous cargo to ensure secure transit. The Coast Guard enforces security measures in harbors and terminals for vessels carrying hazardous cargo, including roving patrols and potential bans on non-commercial traffic. They aim to improve maritime domain awareness by requiring AIS transponders on cargo and passenger vessels visiting U.S. ports. The Coast Guard is enhancing maritime security by tracking vessel movement with AIS receivers at port areas and developing joint harbor operations centers. These centers will monitor vessel traffic using various equipment and coordinate responses with federal security agencies and local law enforcement. Additionally, the Coast Guard's \"Waterways Watch\" program involves the public in identifying and reporting suspicious activity. The Coast Guard is collaborating with the Transportation Security Administration to improve merchant mariner credentials and develop credentialing cards for landside workers. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration maintains hazardous material emergency response capabilities, including the CAMEO program for first responders. The CAMEO program, developed by NOAA and EPA, provides response recommendations for over 6,000 chemicals and predicts the movement of chemical gases. NOAA has linked its air dispersion models to support emergency planners and first responders. NOAA partnered with the Coast Guard and Office of Naval Intelligence for risk assessments on hazardous chemicals. NOAA and DHS coordinate federal chemicals emergency response through the Interagency Modeling and Atmospheric Assessment Center. The Interagency Modeling and Atmospheric Assessment Center provides custom products for all-hazards dispersion modeling predictions. Industry groups, including the Chemical Transportation Advisory Committee, promote security for hazardous marine cargo. The American Waterways Operators consult on industry security awareness and consequence management. The American Waterways Operators, in collaboration with the Coast Guard and Army Corps of Engineers, developed a vessel security plan to prevent terrorist attacks on the inland waterway system. The plan includes a list of high consequence cargoes. The Chemical Distribution Institute inspects and issues audit reports on chemical and LPG tankers, tank storage terminals, and container ships carrying hazardous cargo. The American Chemistry Council has also issued transportation security guidelines for the chemical industry in the U.S. homeland security policy. Maritime security of chemical cargo in U.S. waterways and ports is a priority, with policy issues such as risk uncertainty, resource availability, and security effectiveness needing Congressional attention. Terrorism risk related to hazardous marine cargo involves uncertainties in threat, vulnerability, and consequence factors, with debates on the potential threat posed by terrorists targeting ships in U.S. waters since 9/11. Some believe public concern about specific threats to hazardous chemical shipping is overstated and should not impede maritime trade, while others assert that terrorists have the desire and capability to attack such shipping. The uncertainty of threat intelligence and shifting goals of attackers make it difficult to estimate the probability of a terrorist attack on marine chemical hazards. The Coast Guard has approved mandatory security vulnerability assessments and plans for thousands of vessels. NOAA has partnered with the Coast Guard to conduct hazardous chemical risk assessments at U.S. ports. Analysts suggest that understanding the vulnerabilities and consequences of a terrorist attack on marine cargo vessels is lacking. Public controversy over terrorist risks to LNG shipping stems from conflicting studies by government and private sector groups. The security sensitivity of these assessments and plans hinders evaluation efforts due to limited public information on vessel vulnerabilities to terrorist attacks. Vulnerabilities in marine cargo vessels to terrorist attacks are a concern, with limited research on intentional hazardous chemical releases. Assessments and security plans may be ineffective without a full understanding of the risks, making it difficult for federal officials to determine precise attack risks. Reducing uncertainty in risk assessment could help prioritize maritime security efforts, such as focusing on timely port security measures by the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard can enhance port security by receiving timely intelligence from federal agencies. Security experts should analyze vessel vulnerabilities and chemical attack consequences using standard models. A federal role is crucial for consistent security analysis across chemicals, vessel types, and locations. Concerns include the costs of hazardous marine cargo security and potential diversion of resources from other activities. President Bush requested $8.1 billion for the Coast Guard in FY2006, with $2.2 billion allocated for port, waterway, and coastal security, representing a 6% increase over the previous year. Security activities have significantly increased post-9/11, with hazardous marine cargo security being a key focus area. The Coast Guard's resources dedicated to securing marine shipments of hazardous cargo could potentially be used for other missions such as boating safety, search and rescue, and drug interdiction. The Coast Guard's FY2006 budget includes additional funding for general maritime security, new response boats, vessel monitoring systems, and increased surveillance of vessels by aircraft. State and local agencies are also seeking more funding to offset the costs of hazardous marine cargo security, particularly for LNG tankers which may cost up to $80,000 to secure per shipment. Federal officials recommend that new LNG terminal operators cover additional maritime security costs, as required by the Energy Policy Act of 2005. However, ambiguity in accounting for security costs and reliance on uncertain federal funding sources like DHS port security grants continue to raise concerns among government officials. Some LNG companies resist paying more for public security, arguing that their federal, state, and local taxes should cover these expenses. Some individuals believe that federal, state, and local taxes should cover public law enforcement and emergency services, while others are willing to pay for additional security beyond what is typically provided. The costs associated with securing hazardous marine cargo from terrorist attacks are significant, and there is a need to review cost-sharing mechanisms. The effectiveness of current security measures for hazardous chemicals shipping by the Coast Guard is still uncertain. The effectiveness of Coast Guard security measures for hazardous marine cargo is still uncertain. Questions remain about the efficiency of resource deployment and evaluation of security activities. The lack of performance measures hinders the ability to assess progress in enhancing national security. Concerns also exist regarding whether Coast Guard activities adequately address terrorism risks within and across ports. The Coast Guard's security measures for hazardous marine cargo are questioned for their effectiveness in addressing terrorism risks within and across ports. Concerns arise regarding resource deployment, evaluation of security activities, and the varying levels of protection for chemical shipments posing similar terrorism hazards in different ports. The effectiveness of the Coast Guard's security measures for hazardous marine cargo in addressing terrorism risks across ports is questioned. Concerns also exist regarding emergency response to marine chemical attacks, with varying casualty predictions for potential terrorist incidents. A terrorist attack involving toxic chemicals could overwhelm emergency agencies and medical facilities, complicating response efforts. Salvaging a vessel damaged in such an attack poses challenges due to chemical hazards. It is prudent for authorities near waterways to develop specific measures for dealing with chemical cargo releases. Assistance from federal or private sectors may be needed for communities lacking capabilities in this area. The DOT and DHS offer funding for emergency response plans for marine chemicals. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 provides a model for coastal LNG terminals. Marine shipments of hazardous chemicals are comparable to those stored at chemical plants and pass through populated areas along U.S. waterways. Marine shipments of hazardous chemicals pass through populated areas along U.S. waterways and ports, making them potential terrorist targets. The Coast Guard has authority over maritime security for hazardous cargo, with ongoing efforts to enhance security measures. Congressional policymakers may question terrorism risk uncertainty and evaluate the effectiveness of federal and private sector efforts in assessing and mitigating this risk. Congressional policymakers may assess the resources and security measures for hazardous chemical cargo, including evaluating emergency response capabilities of coastal communities. They may also review how U.S. hazardous chemicals marine security aligns with the overall strategy to protect the public from chemical hazards in various transportation sectors. Balancing the nation's chemical security resources across different sectors poses a policy challenge due to varying homeland security authorities and regulations. Limited vulnerability and consequence information, especially for marine transportation, complicates the comparison of terrorism risks across sectors. Without a comprehensive perspective on hazardous chemical risks, security analysts may struggle to identify which chemical assets to protect and how to allocate limited security resources effectively. Diverting resources from safety to enhance security in marine transportation may reduce terror risk but increase overall risk if safety programs become less effective as a result. The Army Corps of Engineers collects detailed marine commerce statistics through its Waterborne Commerce Statistics Center for planning and managing projects. Separate databases track domestic and foreign vessel trips and tonnages, including dry cargo ships, tankers, and barges. The ACE waterborne commerce databases collect data on various vessel types and tonnages, including dry cargo ships, tankers, barges, fishing vessels, towboats, tugboats, crew boats, and supply boats. Vessel operators are required to report domestic waterborne commercial movements to the ACE. The databases may be used for chemical-specific analysis with limitations. The ACE provided estimates of EPA/RMP cargo statistics for this report. The ACE databases use standardized commodity codes to identify cargos, but inconsistencies may exist with hazardous chemicals listed in the EPA/RMP due to aggregation or definition differences. CRS has tried to address these issues by comparing codes and consulting experts. For example, LNG and LPG are classified under the same 5-digit code in the WCSC system. The ACE databases contain millions of records with potential errors in data classification and entry. Cargo vessels may load or unload partial cargoes at multiple locations during a single shipment, making it difficult to report the total tonnage carried aboard a vessel at any time. Data quality issues arise from inconsistencies in hazardous chemical classification codes, such as LNG and LPG being classified under the same code in the WCSC system. The ACE databases contain detailed commercial information about private companies, with potential errors in data classification and entry. CRS identified inconsistencies in the ACE estimates, which were corrected. However, there may still be data quality-related errors that have gone unnoticed. The report includes summary estimates of chemicals shipping data, without specific associations to named vessels or operating companies. Individual shipment, vessel, or operator data is considered privileged information not for public access. Individual shipment, vessel, or operator data is considered privileged information not for public release under 18 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7 93.905. CRS products are not prepared for general public distribution."
