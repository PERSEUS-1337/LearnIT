    "content": "The \"Farms for the Future Act Amendments of 1995\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. The purpose and findings are outlined in Section 2. The \"Farms for the Future Act Amendments of 1995\" aims to provide financially competitive options for agricultural producers to maintain prime, unique, and strategic farmland in cooperation with States and local governments. Congress finds that the conversion of such farmland to nonagricultural uses is due to the lack of competitive options for landowners, despite insufficient incentives from States and local governments. Federal assistance is necessary to protect prime, unique, and strategic farmlands in agricultural production. Federal assistance is needed to protect prime, unique, and strategic farmlands in agricultural production through federal cost sharing for acquisition of farmland protection easements. Qualifying farmland is land crucial for agricultural, economic, or environmental reasons and at risk of being converted to incompatible uses. Farmland protection easement restricts land use to support continued agricultural production. The term 'eligible State' refers to a state with an approved program to acquire farmland protection easements. The Secretary may provide matching grants to eligible States for acquiring easements to protect farmland from incompatible uses or for similar programs. Matching grants under subsection (c) are provided on a 50-50 basis, but the Secretary can offer grants for up to 90 percent of the cost of acquiring farmland protection easements for eligible States actively working on farmland protection programs. An eligible State cannot receive more than 10 percent of the total grants available for a fiscal year, with adjustments made if fewer than 10 states participate. The Secretary must ensure specific conditions are met when providing assistance under this section. The Secretary ensures funds are used to protect farmland, prioritizing lands important to the State's agriculture industry. Purchase price of easements acquired should not exceed fair market value. Authorization of appropriations is provided for each fiscal year."
