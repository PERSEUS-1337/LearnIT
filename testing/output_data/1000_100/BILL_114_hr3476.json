    "content": "The text chunk \"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\" is a concise summary of the section's title and its purpose. The \"Prevent a Government Shutdown Act of 2015\" set tight spending caps and required deficit reduction through negotiations or sequestration. Despite unsuccessful negotiations, a sequester took place in fiscal year 2013. Lawmakers negotiated a two-year agreement in 2014 that set higher levels of defense and non-defense discretionary spending. A similar agreement is needed to avoid deep budget cuts in fiscal year 2015. Senator John McCain and Representative Mac Thornberry criticized the level of defense spending under sequestration, stating that it undermines the capabilities of the armed forces. The impact of cuts on non-defense discretionary spending is evident, affecting economic recovery, business growth, public health, education, oversight, scientific research, infrastructure, and emergency response. This is highlighted in bills proposed by the House Committee on Appropriations for fiscal year 2016. The proposed bills would cut the Department of Education by $2.8 billion, remove housing vouchers from families, and allocate $1.4 billion less than requested for the Department of Veterans Affairs. Eliminating the sequester would boost GDP by 0.4% in 2016 and 0.2% in 2017, with an increase in employment by 500,000 next year and 300,000 in 2017. Relief from the sequester would enable Congress to address appropriations legislation. To prevent another Government shutdown and allow appropriations bills for fiscal year 2016 to fund vital services, Congress must act before the fiscal year starts. The 2013 shutdown cost the economy 120,000 private-sector jobs, shrunk GDP growth by 0.2% to 0.6%, led to 6.6 million days' worth of work lost, $500 million in visitor spending at national parks, delayed $4 billion in tax refunds, impacted Head Start access for nearly 6,300 children, and delayed hundreds of food safety inspections. Immediate negotiations are needed for a budget agreement to allow appropriations for fiscal year 2016. The negotiations should focus on raising discretionary spending caps for defense and non-defense, eliminating the non-defense sequester, and reducing the defense sequester. It is preferred to offset the cost of sequester relief with deficit reduction from closing tax loopholes, but sequester relief should occur regardless of this agreement. Bipartisan, bicameral agreement reached on sequester relief. A bipartisan measure will be negotiated to increase discretionary spending limits for fiscal years 2016 and 2017, with provisions to reduce the deficit. Members will be appointed to negotiate the measure. A bipartisan measure will be negotiated to increase discretionary spending limits for fiscal years 2016 and 2017, with provisions to reduce the deficit. The Speaker, Minority Leader of the House, Majority Leader of the Senate, and Minority Leader of the Senate will each appoint individuals to approve the measure, which will be considered under specific procedures. SEC. 3. ALTERNATIVE ADJUSTMENT TO DISCRETIONARY SPENDING LIMITS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2016 AND 2017. If the measure described under section 2(a) is not enacted into law before October 1, 2015, the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 will be amended to adjust the discretionary spending limits for fiscal years 2016 and 2017. This includes changes to dollar amounts in various paragraphs. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 will be amended to adjust discretionary spending limits for fiscal years 2016 and 2017 by adding 2016 and 2017 to the existing years. Adjustments made before the enactment of this Act by the Office of Management and Budget will be null if the measure in section 2(a) is not enacted by October 1, 2015."
