    "content": "Operation Ranch Hand was a U.S. military program during the Vietnam War that sprayed millions of gallons of herbicides, including Agent Orange, over southern Vietnam. The herbicides contained TCDD, a toxic and carcinogenic compound. Dioxin \"hot spots\" have been identified in Vietnam, with airbases like Bien Hoa, Danang, and Phu Cat showing high levels of contamination. The A Luoi Valley was also a significant area along the Ho Chi Minh Trail used by North Vietnamese forces. The A Luoi Valley, a key segment of the Ho Chi Minh Trail, was heavily sprayed during the Vietnam War. The former U.S. military base in the valley is now identified as a \"hot spot\" for Agent Orange contamination. Recent U.S. efforts to address the environmental damage and health issues caused by Agent Orange in Vietnam have helped improve bilateral relations. President Obama pledged continued support in addressing the legacy of war, including removing unexploded landmines and bombs, and assisting in the cleanup of dioxin at Bien Hoa Air Base. The joint statement between Vietnam and the United States highlighted cooperation in dioxin remediation at Danang International Airport and Bien Hoa Air Base. The Trump Administration continued its commitment to assisting Vietnam with the Agent Orange/dioxin issue. President Trump and Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc pledged to work together on war legacy issues, including dioxin remediation at Bien Hoa Airport. The United States and Vietnam discussed collaboration at Bien Hoa Airport and the removal of unexploded ordnances. Under Secretary of State Thomas Shannon and Senior Lieutenant General Nguyen Phuong Nam celebrated the completion of environmental remediation at Danang Airport. A Memorandum of Intent was signed to start dioxin decontamination at Bien Hoa. Congress has allocated $254.8 million for Agent Orange/dioxin environmental remediation and health programs in Vietnam. The 115th Congress authorized the transfer of funds for the Bien Hoa dioxin cleanup in Vietnam from the Department of Defense to USAID. The allocated funds for environmental remediation are generally under the State Department's Economic Support Fund account. The State Department's Economic Support Fund account (ESF) has allocated funds for environmental remediation, while health and disability programs have funds allocated under the Development Assistance account (DA). The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is responsible for administering the funds. The focus has been on cleaning up the Danang airport and supporting disability programs in Vietnam. Cleanup at Danang airport is complete, with plans for joint dioxin removal at Bien Hoa airbase. Discussions are ongoing between U.S. and Vietnamese officials for further actions. The U.S. State Department and USAID are working with the Vietnamese government to address health and disability issues related to dioxin exposure. Vietnam's Office 33 oversees government policy on Agent Orange and dioxin, with representatives from various ministries. The U.S. State Department and USAID are collaborating with Vietnam to address health and disability issues from dioxin exposure. Congressional interest focuses on allocating funds for environmental remediation of dioxin \"hot spots\" and overseeing fund usage by State Department and USAID. Funds were first allocated in May 2007 by the 110th Congress to address the Agent Orange/dioxin issue in Vietnam. The U.S. Congress allocated funds for dioxin cleanup in Vietnam and health services in response to the Agent Orange issue. The State Department designated USAID to handle the $3 million appropriation, setting a precedent for future assistance. Subsequent legislation provided a total of $18 million for dioxin remediation and health care in Vietnam, including $3 million for the Danang \"hot spot\" in March 2009. In response to the Agent Orange issue, the U.S. Congress allocated funds for dioxin cleanup and health services in Vietnam. Legislation in 2009 and 2010 provided a total of $18 million for remediation efforts, including $12 million for the Danang Airport. Additionally, the State Department and USAID allocated $1.9 million for environmental remediation at the airport in FY2010. The U.S. Congress allocated funds for Agent Orange-related activities in Vietnam, with appropriations continuing in subsequent years for environmental remediation and health services. Legislation directed USAID to develop a comprehensive plan within 180 days. Appropriations for FY2013 and FY2014 were renewed, with specific amounts allocated for environmental remediation. The U.S. Congress allocated funds for environmental remediation and health/disability programs in Vietnam, including areas contaminated by Agent Orange or dioxin. Funds were appropriated under different headings for these purposes in the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015. In the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015, funds were allocated for environmental remediation and health/disability programs in Vietnam, specifically for areas contaminated by Agent Orange or dioxin. The 114th Congress appropriated funds for these purposes under different headings, with $15.0 million designated for economic support for environmental remediation of dioxin and not less than $25 million for environmental remediation and $7 million for health/disability programs in areas affected by Agent Orange or dioxin. The Committee intends that health/disability funds be implemented by Vietnamese organizations to minimize costs and maximize impact. Funding for FY2017 includes $20 million for dioxin remediation and health/disability programs in Vietnam. The Act appropriates funds for health and disability programs in areas contaminated with dioxin, specifically targeting individuals with mobility impairment and cognitive disabilities. This marks the first time the US is providing assistance to Vietnam for dioxin remediation. In 2018, $20 million was allocated for remediation activities in Vietnam. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 allocated funds for health and disability programs in dioxin-contaminated areas in Vietnam, including assistance for individuals with mobility and cognitive disabilities. The Act also provided funds for remediation activities in Vietnam, with a specific focus on dioxin-contaminated sites. The State Department has designated USAID as the responsible agency for the obligation of funds for disability programs in areas contaminated with Agent Orange and dioxin in Vietnam. USAID has obligated a significant portion of the appropriated funds for environmental remediation and health- and disability-related services from FY2007 to FY2017. Since FY2007, USAID has obligated $20.3 million for health and disability services near Agent Orange/dioxin-contaminated areas in Vietnam, drawing congressional attention for slower utilization compared to environmental remediation funds. The funding provided by USAID for health and disability services near Agent Orange/dioxin-contaminated areas in Vietnam has drawn congressional attention for slower utilization compared to environmental remediation funds. The allocated funds were specified for programs in Danang, but it is unclear if the State Department and USAID have consistently followed this guidance. For FY2010 to FY2013, USAID allocated health and disability funds to Development Alternatives, Inc. (DAI) for a program benefiting persons with disabilities in Vietnam. The program did not specifically target Agent Orange/dioxin \"hot spots\" and ended in January 2016. From FY2014 onwards, USAID shifted to directly funding smaller health- and disability-related services and increased collaboration with Vietnamese nongovernmental organizations. This change is reflected in Table 1. The environmental remediation project at Danang Airport, funded by congressional appropriations, experienced delays, increased material for decontamination, and rising costs. The project, initially planned for completion by October 2013, was finished in August 2017, with the decontamination volume increasing from 61,700 m3 to 90,000 m3, costing over $110 million. The estimated cost of the project at Danang Airport increased from $33.7 million to over $110 million. Soil samples at the airbase showed high levels of \"TCDD toxic equivalents\" (TEQ). Work on the environmental remediation project began in December 2009, with USAID and Office 33 as implementing agencies. The MOU covered $6.0 million in funds for environmental engineering at Danang airport. USAID recommended thermal desorption for decontamination, estimating a cost of $33.7 million. A Memorandum of Intent was signed with Vietnam's Ministry of National Defence to start the project in 2011 and complete it by 2013. The Prime Minister and MND approved the remediation project at Danang airport in 2011. USAID awarded contracts to CDM Smith and Tetra Tech for environmental remediation. A ceremony was held in August 2012 to launch the project, with onsite work starting later that month. An internal audit in November 2014 revealed six contracts awarded for the project. Six contracts awarded for environmental assessment and remediation project at Danang airport and Bien Hoa airbase. Thermal desorption of contaminated soil done in two phases, with Phase 1 starting in April 2014 and Phase 2 excavation beginning in January 2015. Progress on the decontamination of Danang airport was delayed due to various factors, including weather conditions, increased soil and sediment requiring decontamination, and technical issues with the treatment facility. USAID's Office of Inspector General conducted an internal audit in November 2014, highlighting potential risks that could further delay the project. The completion of the Danang Airport environmental remediation project in 2018 faced delays and cost overruns due to various factors, including inclement weather and soil cooling issues. An audit in 2014 identified risks and recommended a formal risk management plan, citing inaccurate performance data from CDM and a lack of training for Vietnamese officials. The project took twice as long and cost three times more than initially projected by USAID. The completion of the Danang Airport environmental remediation project in 2018 faced delays and cost overruns due to underestimating contamination, with 162,500 cubic meters of soil affected instead of 72,900. Dioxin had percolated three meters deeper than expected. USAID utilized funds for health/disability activities in areas contaminated with dioxin, providing over $60 million since 1989. Financed by the Leahy War Victims Fund, the U.S. government has provided over $60 million in assistance to disabled Vietnamese, regardless of the cause of the disability. This includes funds for health services near Agent Orange/dioxin-contaminated sites. State Department and USAID utilized funds for grants to improve the quality of life for persons with disabilities in Danang. USAID approved a three-year nationwide Persons with Disability Support Program in 2012. The Persons with Disability Support Program (PDSP) was a project funded by the Leahy War Victims Fund and implemented with DAI and VNAH in Danang, Vietnam. The program aimed to build on previous USAID assistance to people with disabilities and included public health activities. The project focused on Danang and other high-need areas with dioxin hot spots. Funding for PDSP was initially set at $9 million, with DAI awarding grants to local partners for disability assistance. The Persons with Disability Support Program (PDSP) funded by the Leahy War Victims Fund and implemented in Danang, Vietnam aimed to provide assistance to persons with disabilities through health services, rehabilitation therapy, vocational training, and community awareness. USAID extended the program to additional provinces heavily affected by Agent Orange during the Vietnam War. Grants totaling nearly US$900,000 were awarded to local partners and organizations. In June 2014, USAID adopted a new approach to providing assistance to persons with disabilities in Vietnam. The key objective is to improve health, independence, and participation in economic and social life for vulnerable populations. USAID will finance therapies and training in high-poverty areas for persons with disabilities. Prevalence and poverty rates are high in identified provinces like Binh Dinh, Binh Phuoc, Dong Nai, Quang Nam, Tay Ninh, Thai Binh, and Thua Thien-Hue. USAID will directly administer a new approach in consultation with Vietnamese agencies. Environmental cleanup at Danang airport is completed, and joint efforts are underway to clean up the dioxin \"hot spot\" at Bien Hoa airbase, heavily sprayed during the war. Soil samples from Bien Hoa airbase show high TEQ concentration exceeding international limits. The Vietnamese government has taken steps to mitigate dioxin contamination at Bien Hoa airbase, with a passive landfill containing contaminated soil. However, other dioxin \"hot spots\" remain unaddressed, spreading contamination into nearby water bodies. The United Nations Development Programme is working on a master plan for dioxin remediation at the airbase. The USAID contracted CDM International Inc. to assess dioxin contamination at Bien Hoa airbase, estimating 408,500 to 495,300 m3 of contaminated soil. Five treatment methods were considered, with costs ranging from $137 million. The estimated costs for environmental remediation at Bien Hoa Airbase ranged from $137 million to $794 million for different methods. USAID has allocated over $3.7 million for assessment, and Vietnam's Ministry of National Defence has started infrastructure construction for decontamination with a budget of $11.8 million. USAID and Vietnam's Ministry of National Defence signed a memorandum of intent in January 2018 to begin decontamination efforts. The United States and Vietnam signed a memorandum of intent to decontaminate Bien Hoa airport, committing to a remediation program. A $183 million aid agreement was signed for the project, estimated to take 10 years at a cost of $390 million. Approximately 500,000 cubic meters of soil are to be decontaminated. The Ministry of National Defence signed a memorandum with Shimizu Corporation to build a decontamination factory at Bien Hoa airport. The factory will use a filtered sponge technique to decontaminate soil at a lower cost than thermal desorption. U.S. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis visited the site, expressing America's commitment to remediate past issues with Agent Orange. Congressional interest in Agent Orange/dioxin in Vietnam remains high. Congressional interest in Agent Orange/dioxin in Vietnam has focused on providing assistance for environmental remediation and health effects, oversight of State Department and USAID utilization of funds, and funding for decontamination of dioxin \"hot spots.\" Both the Obama and Trump Administrations have supported projects in Vietnam related to Agent Orange. The State Department and USAID have used funds for health and disability services in areas affected by Agent Orange and dioxin. President Obama's budget did not specifically request funds for these programs, but the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 continues to allocate funds for such services. The Victims of Agent Orange Relief Act of 2019 allocates funds for health and disability programs in areas affected by Agent Orange and dioxin, providing assistance to individuals with severe mobility impairment or cognitive disabilities. The Act directs the Secretary of State to provide medical and chronic care services, nursing services, vocational training, and medical equipment to affected individuals. The Victims of Agent Orange Relief Act of 2019 defines \"covered individuals\" as Vietnamese residents affected by exposure to Agent Orange between 1961 and 1975 or their descendants. The Act requires assistance for repairing homes, supporting research on health issues, providing healthcare in Vietnam, and remediating areas with high levels of Agent Orange. The Victims of Agent Orange Relief Act of 2019 focuses on providing assistance to Vietnamese residents affected by exposure to Agent Orange between 1961 and 1975 or their descendants. The Act prioritizes heavily sprayed areas and military bases for environmental remediation and health services. Additionally, it mandates quarterly reports to Congress on the implementation of the Act by relevant government agencies. Congress has overseen the utilization of funds for health services and environmental remediation in Agent Orange/dioxin-contaminated locations in Vietnam. Oversight has focused on the rising cost of cleanup at Danang airport and potential implications for funding at Bien Hoa. USAID's provision of health services has faced scrutiny for slow fund obligation and changes in administration. The estimated cost of Danang airport's environmental remediation rose significantly. Members are concerned about cost overruns at Danang airport impacting future projects at Bien Hoa airport. USAID's cleanup efforts at Hoa airport are facing challenges with contaminated soil. While the Danang airport cleanup had cost overruns and delays, USAID managed to keep the project on track. However, there are concerns about the slow utilization of funds for health services in contaminated areas. Only 63.5% of funds allocated from FY2011 to FY2017 have been used effectively. Observers question the effectiveness of USAID's approach in administering health services funds. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 and H.R. 326 allocate funds for health and disability assistance in Vietnam due to congressional dissatisfaction with State Department and USAID management. Specific funding amounts are usually detailed in accompanying reports or statements."
