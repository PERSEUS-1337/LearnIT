    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Mobile Workforce State Income Tax Fairness and Simplification Act\" and limits state withholding and taxation of employee income. The \"Mobile Workforce State Income Tax Fairness and Simplification Act\" limits state income tax to the employee's residence state and the state where they work for more than 30 days in a calendar year. Wages are only subject to state income tax withholding and reporting if the employee meets the criteria outlined in the Act. The Act allows employers to rely on an employee's estimate of time spent working in different states for tax purposes, as long as there is no fraud or collusion. Maintaining records of employee locations for business purposes does not override this reliance. Employers can also choose to use a time and attendance system for tracking employee locations. The Act allows employers to use a time and attendance system to track employee locations, overriding the employee's own determination. If an employee performs duties in multiple states in one day, they will be considered to have worked in the state where the majority of their duties were performed. The term \"employee\" is defined by the state where duties are performed, excluding professional athletes, entertainers, and certain public figures. Professional athletes are individuals who receive payment for services in athletic events. Professional athletes, professional entertainers, and certain public figures are individuals who receive payment for services in their respective fields on a per-event basis. The remuneration is paid for their services provided at discrete events. The curr_chunk discusses the definitions of terms related to employment, such as \"employer,\" \"State,\" and \"time and attendance system.\" It also defines \"wages or other remuneration.\" The term \"wages or other remuneration\" is defined by the State where the employment duties are performed. The Act will be effective on January 1, 2011."
