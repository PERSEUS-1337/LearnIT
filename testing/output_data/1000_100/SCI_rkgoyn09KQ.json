    "content": "In this work, a neural autoregressive topic model is combined with a LSTM based language model to address challenges in probabilistic topic modelling. The LSTM-LM considers word order in local collocation patterns, while the TM learns a latent representation from the entire document. The LSTM-LM captures language characteristics like syntax and semantics, while the TM uncovers thematic structure in a collection of documents. The two models complement each other in the probabilistic framework. Incorporating external knowledge into neural autoregressive topic models via a language modelling approach to address challenges in settings with limited context and smaller training corpus of documents. The proposed extension named ctx-DocNADEe aims to improve word-topic mapping on smaller and/or short-text corpus. The novel neural autoregressive topic model variants with neural language models and embeddings priors outperform state-of-the-art generative topic models in generalization, interpretability, and applicability over long-text. The curr_chunk discusses the use of probabilistic topic models like LDA, RSM, and DocNADE variants to extract topics from text collections. These models learn latent document representations for NLP tasks but ignore word order and semantic information. The motivation is to extend these models to incorporate word order and language structure for better analysis. The curr_chunk discusses how traditional topic models like LDA and RSM do not consider language structure and word order, leading to limitations in topic analysis. It highlights the importance of incorporating syntax and semantics for better understanding of topics in text collections. Recent studies have integrated latent topics and neural language models to improve semantics in language models. LSTM-LMs capture language concepts in a layer-wise fashion but do not capture semantics at a document level. Other models like Topic-RNN and TCNLM focus on global dependencies using latent topics. The text discusses the limitations of topic models and n-gram based topic learning in capturing long term dependencies and language concepts. It introduces a LSTM-LM to incorporate language structure into neural autoregressive topic models, allowing for accurate prediction of words based on global and local semantics. The proposed neural topic model, ctx-DocNADE, combines global and local semantics using DocNADE and LSTM-LM. It captures complementary topic and word semantics, such as the usage of \"fall\" in stock market trading. However, learning from contextual information remains challenging in settings with short texts and few documents due to limited word co-occurrences. Distributional word representations like word embeddings have shown to capture semantic and syntactic relatedness in words, even in short texts with limited word co-occurrences. Traditional topic models struggle with short texts due to lack of context, but word embeddings can infer relatedness between words like \"falls\" and \"drops\". Incorporating distributed compositional priors in DocNADE by using pre-trained word embeddings via LSTM-LM to enhance topic learning on smaller corpus or short texts. This approach considers word ordering and syntax, improving topic model performance compared to traditional models like LDA and RSM. By integrating complementary information through LSTM-LM, the ctx-DocNADEe framework combines topic and language models with pre-trained word embeddings to improve textual representations. This approach outperforms state-of-the-art generative topic models, showing gains in topic coherence and precision at retrieval fraction. Our proposed modeling approaches, named textTOvec, show improvements in topic coherence, precision at retrieval fraction, and F1 for text classification across various datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/pgcool/textTOvec. Generative models like RBM and its variants are used to model word counts, but estimating complex probability distributions is challenging. NADE decomposes joint distributions to address this issue. NADE BID13 decomposes joint distribution of binary observations into autoregressive conditional distributions using feed-forward network. DocNADE BID12 models collections of documents as bags of words, learning word representations reflecting document topics only. DocNADE BID15 computes autoregressive conditionals for word observations using preceding words in a neural network. The DocNADE model uses a feed-forward network to model document collections as bags of words, with word representations reflecting document topics. It computes autoregressive conditionals for word observations using preceding words in a neural network. The model includes weight matrices, bias vectors, and word representation matrices to estimate the log-likelihood of a document. Two extensions of the model are proposed: ctx-DocNADE introduces language structure. The proposed extensions of the DocNADE model are ctx-DocNADE, which incorporates language structure via LSTM-LM, and ctx-DocNADEe, which includes external knowledge through pre-trained word embeddings. These extensions aim to model short and long texts by considering word ordering, syntactical and semantic structures, long and short term dependencies, and external knowledge. Unlike DocNADE, ctx-DocNADE models each document as a sequence of multinomial observations, with conditional probabilities of words being a function of two hidden vectors. The ctx-DocNADE model incorporates language structure via LSTM-LM and extends DocNADE by accounting for word ordering and language concepts. It utilizes hidden vectors in the weight matrix to encode topic information and word semantics. The embedding layer in the LSTM component is randomly initialized to represent column vectors, allowing for global and local influences in the unified network. The second version extends ctx-DocNADE with distributional priors, initializing the LSTM embedding layer with a pre-trained matrix E and weight matrix W. The computational complexity in ctx-DocNADE or ctx-DocNADEe is O(HD + N), where N is the total number of edges in the LSTM network. Trained models can be used to extract a textTOvec representation. The LSTM network BID10 BID27 can be extended to a deep architecture for improved performance. The conditional probability is computed using the last hidden layer. State-of-the-art comparison is done for IR and classification F1 for short texts. We apply modeling approaches to short-text and long-text datasets for topic modeling evaluation. Four quantitative measures are used: generalization, topic coherence, text retrieval, and categorization. Baselines are compared for performance with our proposed models ctx-DocNADE and ctx-DocNADEe. Data statistics are shown in TAB1, with 20NS representing 20NewsGroups and R21578 representing Reuters21578. The experimental setup involves comparing different word and document representation models, including DocNADE and NTM, along with pre-trained word embeddings like Gauss-LDA and glove-DMM. DocNADE is trained on both reduced vocabulary (RV) and full vocabulary (FV) settings for evaluation tasks. The study compares different word and document representation models like DocNADE and NTM using glove embeddings. Pre-training is done for ctx-DocNADEs, and experiments are conducted over 200 topics. Ablation over \u03bb is performed on the validation set, and BID14 is used for evaluation in the spare data setting. Generative performance of topic models is evaluated through log-probabilities on the test data. The study evaluates the generative performance of topic models by estimating log-probabilities for test documents and computing average held-out perplexity per word. DocNADE's log-probability is computed without the mixture coefficient to determine the exact log-likelihood in ctx-DocNADE versions. Optimal \u03bb is determined based on the validation set. Results show that complementary learning with \u03bb = 0.01 in ctx-DocNADE achieves lower perplexity than baseline DocNADE for short and long texts. Topic coherence is assessed using BID measures. The coherence of topics in ctx-DocNADE is higher compared to DocNADE, as indicated by the coherence measure proposed by BID25. Gensim module is used to estimate coherence for 200 topics, with ctx-DocNADE showing a 4.6% gain in topic coherence over 11 datasets. The models also outperform baseline methods glove-DMM and glove-LDA. An example topic from the 20NSshort text dataset for DocNADE is illustrated in Table 8. The study compares different models for improving topic coherence in textual representations by incorporating language concepts and word embeddings through neural language models. The focus is on enhancing topic models for short-text or long-text documents. The performance of the proposed models (ctx-DocNADE and ctx-DocNADEe) is quantitatively evaluated in terms of topic coherence. The study evaluates the performance of models (ctx-DocNADE and ctx-DocNADEe) in terms of topic coherence on the BNC dataset. Different hyper-parameters, such as sliding window size and mixture weight of the LM component, are analyzed. Results show that including word embeddings leads to more coherent topics compared to the baseline model. The study evaluates the performance of models (ctx-DocNADE and ctx-DocNADEe) in terms of topic coherence on the BNC dataset. ctx-DocNADEe does not show improvements in topic coherence over ctx-DocNADE. Text retrieval task is performed using short-text and long-text documents with label information. The study evaluates the performance of models in terms of topic coherence on the BNC dataset. Retrieval precision scores for short-text and long-text datasets are compared at different fractions. The introduction of pre-trained embeddings and language/contextual information improves performance on the IR task, especially for short texts. The study explores topic modeling without pre-processing, finding that using FV setting with DocNADE(FV) or glove(FV) improves IR precision. The proposed extensions, ctx-DocNADEe and ctx-DeepDNEe, show significant gains in precision on various datasets. These models outperform previous methods like TDLM and ProdLDA, showcasing their effectiveness in text categorization. In text categorization, logistic regression classifier with L2 regularization is used with ctx-DocNADEe and ctx-DeepDNEe models. The ctx-DocNADEe outperforms DocNADE in classification performance on short texts TAB10, showing a gain of 4.8% in F1 score. Overall, ctx-DocNADEe reports a gain of 4.4% in classification accuracy. On the 20NS dataset, ctxDocNADE achieves a higher accuracy of 0.744 compared to DocNADE's 0.734. The classification accuracy scores on the 20NS dataset are as follows: DocNADE (0.734), ctxDocNADE (0.744), ctx-DocNADEe (0.751), NTM (0.72), and SCHOLAR (0.71). The proposed models, ctx-DocNADE and ctx-DocNADEe, outperform NTM and SCHOLAR. DocNADE serves as a strong neural topic model baseline. Meaningful semantics are analyzed through topic extraction, with a topic resembling computers identified. ctx-DocNADEe extracts a more coherent topic due to embedding priors. The contribution of word embeddings and textTOvec representations in topic models is qualitatively inspected using DocNADE and ctxDoocNADEe models. Table 9 shows the top 3 text retrievals for an input query from the TMNtitle dataset using DocNADE and ctxDoocNADEe models. The ctx-DocNADEe model retrieves texts with no unigram overlap with the query. The query \"emerging economies move ahead nuclear plans\" matches with various retrieval results. The nuclear regulator backs power plans in Iran, which defiantly plans a significant increase in nuclear capabilities. Japan banks billions for a nuclear operator. Quality of representations learned at different fractions of training data is quantified, showing improvements with proposed models like ctx-DocNADE and ctx-DocNADEe over DocNADE. Gains are significant for smaller fractions of datasets, with precision and F1 scores showing improvements. The study demonstrates improvements in topic models using word embeddings, particularly in sparse data settings. By incorporating language concepts like word ordering and semantic information, a neural autoregressive topic model combined with a neural language model enhances the estimation of word probabilities in context. This approach allows for learning latent representations from entire documents while considering local collocation patterns. The results show increased precision and F1 scores at different fractions of the training set. The study demonstrates improvements in topic models by incorporating word embeddings and neural autoregressive models. Experimental results show superior performance in generative topic modeling compared to state-of-the-art models on 15 datasets.

The experimental results suggest that DocNADE outperforms SCHOLAR in generating representations for tasks like information retrieval and classification. SCHOLAR BID3 generates more coherent topics but performs worse in perplexity and text classification compared to DocNADE. Additionally, it is implied that SCHOLAR's performance on information retrieval tasks is inferior to the proposed models. DocNADE outperforms SCHOLAR in generating representations for tasks like information retrieval and classification, but falls behind in interpretability. This opens up an interesting direction for future research."
