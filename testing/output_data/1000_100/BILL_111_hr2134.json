    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Western Hemisphere Drug Policy Commission Act of 2009\". Congress finds that in 2008, there were millions of users of marijuana, cocaine, methamphetamine, and heroin in the United States. The majority of cocaine and heroin in the US originates from Andean countries and Colombia and Mexico, respectively, leading to violence and corruption in those regions. Additionally, drug trafficking in transit countries like Central America and the Caribbean contributes to instability. Drug trafficking is a significant issue in countries like Venezuela, Ecuador, Haiti, and the Caribbean, posing threats to law enforcement, political institutions, and citizen security. In Mexico, drug-related violence is increasing, with a significant number of deaths reported in 2008. Organized criminal networks in Mexico also traffic women and girls into the United States for sexual exploitation. Extremist groups in the Western Hemisphere are also a concern. Extremist groups in the Western Hemisphere, such as FARC and Hezbollah, use drug trafficking to fund terrorist activities. US counternarcotics assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean from 1980-2008 totaled $11.3 billion. The Western Hemisphere Drug Policy Commission is established to review and evaluate US policy on illicit drug supply reduction and interdiction, focusing on international drug policies in the Western Hemisphere. The Commission will identify options to improve existing counternarcotics policies. The Western Hemisphere Drug Policy Commission will review US policies on illicit drug supply reduction, interdiction, and demand reduction. It will assess international drug control policies, drug interdiction efforts, crop eradication programs, and economic development alternatives. The impact of various initiatives in curbing drug production and trafficking will be evaluated. The Western Hemisphere Drug Policy Commission will assess technology deployment against drug cartels, curb chemical precursor trafficking, evaluate US drug certification process, analyze population's demand for drugs, review prevention and treatment programs, and study factors driving drug consumption in the US. The Western Hemisphere Drug Policy Commission will evaluate US policies on illicit drugs, assess international support for drug control, and review indicators of success in drug control policy.
