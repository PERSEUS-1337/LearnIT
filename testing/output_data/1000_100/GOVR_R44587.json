    "content": "The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) was established in 1967 as part of the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) to investigate civil aviation accidents and other transportation incidents. In 1974, the Independent Safety Board Act made the NTSB independent of DOT, allowing unbiased investigations and safety recommendations. The NTSB's main functions include determining accident causes, recommending safety improvements, and providing assistance to victims' families in major disasters. The NTSB serves as a board of appeals for transportation regulatory actions and provides recommendations but has no authority to enforce them. It consists of a five-member board and approximately 420 staff, with regional offices and a training center. The NTSB Reauthorization Act of 2006 requires the agency to maintain at least one full-time employee. The NTSB Reauthorization Act of 2006 mandates the NTSB to have at least one full-time employee in states over 1,000 miles from a regional office. This impacts Hawaii, where the NTSB does not have a field office. Currently, there is one aviation safety investigator in Hawaii. The NTSB has regional staff in 25 states, and the five Safety Board members serve five-year terms, with a limit of three members from the same political party. The NTSB is organized by transportation mode, with separate offices for investigative and support staff. It also serves as a court of appeals for airmen and mariners facing administrative actions. The Office of Safety Recommendations and Communications coordinates communication with stakeholders and tracks responses to safety recommendations. The NTSB investigates transportation accidents involving civil aircraft, public aircraft, highway and railroad grade crossing accidents, pipeline accidents, marine casualties, and other catastrophic accidents related to transportation safety. The NTSB relies on manufacturers, transportation providers, and regulatory agencies to assist in investigations through the \"party process.\" Safeguards are in place to prevent external influence on NTSB findings, with conclusions based solely on NTSB staff analysis and recommendations. The NTSB has formal procedures for parties to petition for reconsideration of investigative findings. Parties can be sanctioned for not fulfilling duties. The Safety Board must meet publicly on most accident investigation matters. Board members must provide financial disclosures and cannot have certain financial interests in transportation companies. Despite safeguards, outside parties can still influence the NTSB process. The NTSB faces challenges in maintaining impartiality during investigations, balancing unique data from involved parties while preventing influence. Evaluating competing perspectives can prolong investigations. The NTSB follows international standards for aviation accident investigations involving U.S.-manufactured aircraft. The NTSB may assist in foreign aviation accident investigations and be reimbursed for costs by foreign entities. This provision was included in P.L. 109-443, allowing such receipts to be used until expended. Previously, only reimbursements related to NTSB Academy activities were credited as offsetting collections. The NTSB assists in foreign aviation accident investigations and can be reimbursed for costs. It issues safety recommendations to improve transportation safety regulations and practices. Since 1967, over 14,300 safety recommendations have been issued to more than 2,300 recipients. Since 1967, the NTSB has issued over 14,300 safety recommendations to 2,300 recipients in various transportation modes. About 82% of these recommendations have led to safety improvements. DOT agencies must respond to each recommendation within 90 days, but there is no requirement to adopt them. The NTSB advocates for implementation of its recommendations, which may face delays due to rulemaking processes and feasibility concerns. The NTSB issues safety recommendations to improve transportation safety, but delays can occur due to rulemaking processes, feasibility concerns, and costs. The agency does not consider cost-benefit analysis when making recommendations. The \"Most Wanted\" list highlights key safety improvements, including reducing fatigue-related accidents, improving rail transit safety oversight, and promoting collision avoidance technologies in vehicles. The NTSB issues safety recommendations to improve transportation safety, influencing regulatory agenda and congressional decision-making. These recommendations encompass specific actions from DOT and states, often requiring statutory and regulatory changes. NTSB's advocacy programs have led to legislation and regulations such as positive train control systems, reduced airline pilot fatigue, distracted driving laws, and improved safety standards for various modes of transportation. The FAA Extension, Safety, and Security Act of 2016 draws on NTSB investigations and recommendations to implement industrywide airline pilot records database, modify pilot training for monitoring automated systems, and assess pilot fitness recommendations. Section 2103 of the FAA Extension, Safety, and Security Act directs the FAA to assess recommendations from the Pilot Fitness Aviation Rulemaking Committee on mental health screening for pilots. The act also includes language requiring the FAA to evaluate and update standards for crash-resistant helicopter fuel systems. This provision addresses a 2015 NTSB safety recommendation for all newly manufactured helicopters to meet crash-resistance standards. The Pipeline Safety Act of 2011 included provisions to enhance pipeline safety, such as increasing federal inspectors and requiring automatic shutoff valves. The Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 mandated positive train control on railroads with high-volume freight traffic. Positive train control is a communication and signaling system identified by the NTSB to prevent incidents caused by operator or dispatcher error, reducing incidents due to excessive speed, conflicting movements, and failure to obey signals. The NTSB also prioritizes minimizing operator distractions to improve safety, with Congress establishing a distracted driving grant program to discourage texting and cell-phone use while driving. States had to enforce these rules as primary violations to qualify for the grant. In December 2015, a provision in the FAST Act deleted the requirement for increased fines for repeat offenders in traffic violations, allowing more states to qualify for grants. This change may impact NTSB reauthorization proceedings and funding allocation. The NTSB's emergency fund of $2 million can be increased to $4 million for unforeseen accident costs. The agency has not needed to use the fund or seek additional appropriations in over a decade. The Government Accountability Office evaluates the NTSB's operations and activities. The NTSB has been responsive to GAO findings and fully implemented recommendations from 2006 to 2008. In 2012, all recommendations were effectively implemented. However, in 2013, GAO found areas for improvement in training center utilization, safety recommendation close-out processes, interagency communications, financial management, and workforce diversity management. GAO recommended developing a specific strategy for maximizing the utility of the NTSB's cost accounting system. Issues related to NTSB's cost accounting system, staffing resources, management of NTSB Academy, safety concerns regarding vehicle recorders, privacy of data, potential use of recorder data, and legislation on railroad safety funding and resources. NTSB requested a 22% staff increase in FY2008 to fulfill its mission effectively. In FY2008, NTSB requested a 22% staff increase to carry out its mission effectively. Staffing has increased by 12% since FY2007. Despite increased staffing, limited resources have led to delays in accident investigations, including some pipeline and railroad accidents. Congress may debate the NTSB's statutory requirement to investigate railroad accidents. The NTSB faces staffing challenges in investigating fatal railroad accidents, with concerns about retirements and skill gaps. Congress may need to address staffing shortages and consider options to recruit and retain field investigators and specialists. The NTSB has specific concerns about staffing in its Office of Railroad, Pipeline, and Hazardous Materials. The NTSB Training Center, established under P.L. 106-424, operates at a deficit despite efforts to achieve financial self-sufficiency. It provides training for NTSB staff and transportation industry personnel involved in accident investigation and victim assistance. The NTSB Training Center, established under P.L. 106-424, operates at a deficit despite efforts to achieve financial self-sufficiency. Revenues from training and safety-related meetings are insufficient to cover costs, leading to reliance on leases and rentals for additional income. A 2006 GAO study raised concerns about the center's financial sustainability. The NTSB negotiated an operating lease for the Academy facility without budget authority for the full term. GAO suggests remedies like renegotiating the lease, obtaining a deficiency appropriation, or vacating the space. Congressional oversight is needed to weigh the costs and benefits of maintaining the training center. The NTSB has improved utilization of its training center, increasing classroom usage and leasing unutilized space to improve cost recovery. Despite operating deficits decreasing, the facility still does not recoup all costs. Congressional oversight may be limited in making significant changes before the lease agreement expires. Data and voice recorders are crucial investigative tools in aviation. Data recorders are essential investigative tools in aviation, with challenges in prompt recovery after accidents and concerns about privacy. Recent incidents like Air France flight 447 and EgyptAir flight 804 highlight the difficulties in retrieving recorders from submerged locations. Malaysia Airlines flight 370 remains missing, underscoring the ongoing challenges in recovering crucial data from recorders. Malaysia Airlines flight 370 disappeared during a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8, 2014. The NTSB issued safety recommendations urging for improved technology to transmit data and locate aircraft in case of accidents. The Safe Aviation and Flight Emergency Tracking Act of 2015 would require FAA to implement these measures. The Safe Aviation and Flight Emergency Tracking Act of 2015 (H.R. 753) proposes regulations for large passenger aircraft to have continuous tracking technology like automatic deployable flight recorders. The sinking of the U.S.-flag cargo vessel El Faro in 2015 highlighted challenges in recovering maritime voyage data recorders. The International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) governs safety measures for passenger and cargo vessels. The SOLAS regulations require certain passenger and cargo vessels to carry voyage data recorders, which can be fixed-mount or float-free units. New regulations mandate new ships to have both types of recorders with enhanced data capture capabilities. Concerns over data recovery from vessels lost at sea may lead to potential options for assisting investigators. The Driver Privacy Act of 2015 (S. 766) aims to restrict access to data from event data recorders in passenger vehicles to only the owner or lessee, unless authorized by a court or for specific purposes like diagnostics or repair. This raises concerns about privacy and the use of data outside of investigative proceedings. The bill aims to restrict access to event data recorder information in vehicles for privacy reasons, allowing access only for specific purposes like diagnostics, repair, investigations, emergency response, and traffic safety research. It also mandates a study on the appropriate duration for capturing vehicle-related data for crash investigations. Increased interest in railroad accident investigations and safety recommendations due to derailments of freight trains carrying flammable fuels. NTSB lacks resources for required investigations, but legislation proposes funding of $6.3-$6.6 million for railroad accident investigations and addresses safety recommendations, including plans for positive train control systems and grants for implementation. The legislation proposes funding for railroad accident investigations and safety recommendations, including plans for positive train control systems and grants for implementation. Additionally, it directs the Department of Transportation to study the effectiveness of these technologies in reducing highway-rail grade crossing accidents."
