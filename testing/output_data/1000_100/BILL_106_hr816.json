Unpaid child support payments are included in income.

The Internal Revenue Code mandates eligible taxpayers to notify individuals who have not paid child support to include the amount in their gross income for the previous taxable year. If the address is unknown, the Secretary will send the notice if the address is available. If there is no known address, no income needs to be included for any taxable year before the year preceding the year in which the notice can be sent. The amendments made by this section require subsequent child support payments to be included in gross income and then allowed as a deduction in the year of payment. Definitions for 'applicable child support payments' and 'eligible taxpayer' are provided in section 166(f). These changes apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 1999. SEC. 4.
