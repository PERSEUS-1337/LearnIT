    "content": "Congress passed the FY2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act on March 23, 2018 (H.R. 1625), which included Agriculture appropriations. The final appropriation of $23.3 billion for Agriculture was facilitated by new budget caps in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-123). The enacted Agriculture appropriation for FY2018 is $23.3 billion, a $2.1 billion increase from FY2017. The total includes mandatory spending, bringing the overall total to $146 billion. The Trump Administration's budget proposal was $15.8 billion, while the House and Senate bills were $20 billion and $20.53 billion respectively. The Agriculture appropriations bill funds USDA, excluding the U.S. Forest Service. The Agriculture Appropriations Act funds USDA, excluding the U.S. Forest Service, and the FDA. It includes mandatory and discretionary spending, with discretionary amounts being the primary focus. Discretionary spending is controlled by annual appropriations acts and receives most attention during the appropriations process. The annual budget resolution process sets spending limits for discretionary appropriations, while mandatory spending is controlled by budget rules during the authorization process. In FY2018 Agriculture appropriations, discretionary appropriations were 16% of the total, with mandatory spending comprising 84%. About $99 billion of the mandatory amount could be attributed to programs in the 2014 farm bill. The largest discretionary spending items in the Agriculture Committees' budget include WIC, rural development, agricultural research, FDA, foreign food aid, farm assistance, food safety inspection, conservation, and animal and plant health programs. Mandatory spending items consist of SNAP, child nutrition programs, crop insurance, and farm commodity programs. SNAP requires an annual appropriation, while the CCC operates on a line of credit. The annual appropriation for Agriculture reimburse the Treasury for using a line of credit. Changes in the Agriculture appropriations bill have generally mirrored changes in the bill's total discretionary limit. Agriculture appropriations peaked in FY2010, declined through FY2013, and have since increased. Comparisons to historical benchmarks may require adjustments for inflation and other factors. The stacked bars in Figure 3 show discretionary spending authorized for each appropriations title since FY2008. The total of positive stacked bars exceeded the official discretionary spending allocation for the subcommittee due to budgetary offsets from negative amounts in Title VII. The Trump Administration's FY2018 budget request was released later than usual in 2017, proposing a 21% reduction for USDA and FDA. The budget outline included cuts to programs and overlapped with Congress finishing FY2017 appropriations. The explanatory statement for the FY2017 appropriation addressed the new request for FY2018, reminding the Administration of Congress's authority in determining funding. The USDA and FDA should respect Congress's authority in setting final funding levels for fiscal year 2018 and not make assumptions about program funding outcomes. The Trump Administration requested $15.82 billion for Agriculture appropriations, $5.3 billion less than in FY2017. Congressional appropriations committees evaluated the request and began considering their own bills. The House appropriations committees evaluated the FY2018 budget request and allocated nearly $20 billion to the Agriculture Subcommittee. The Subcommittee marked up its bill in June 2017, and the full Appropriations Committee passed an amended bill in July 2017. In September 2017, the House passed a consolidated appropriation bill with Agriculture as Division B. The House passed a consolidated appropriation bill (H.R. 3354) in September 2017, reducing funding for Agriculture programs compared to FY2017. Key reductions included rural development, nutrition assistance, farm and conservation programs, department administration, and research. The Senate Appropriations Committee also made allocations to its subcommittees in July 2017. The Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee marked up its FY2018 bill on July 18, 2017, with a discretionary total of $20.53 billion, $352 million less than FY2017. The Senate-reported bill would have made fewer reductions compared to the House-passed bill, with reductions in rural development and agricultural research. The Senate-reported bill for FY2018 would have reduced rural development by $119 million and agricultural research by $57 million, while increasing foreign food aid by $140 million. It also included $220 million more in reductions compared to the House-passed bill. FY2018 began without an enacted appropriation, leading to the passage of continuing resolutions (CRs) to fund the government. The first CR lasted until December 8, 2017, continuing FY2017 funding. The first continuing resolution for FY2018 (Division D of P.L. 115-56) lasted until December 8, 2017, maintaining FY2017 funding levels with exceptions and anomalies for agriculture appropriations. Key provisions included a 0.6791% across-the-board reduction, sufficient funding for mandatory programs like nutrition, an increase in funding for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program, and a technical correction for Section 32 funds. The USDA had discretion over disaster payments (Section 117). Multiple continuing resolutions (CRs) extended funding provisions until March 23, 2018, to avoid government shutdowns. The CRs also waived PAYGO rules for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to prevent sequestration of mandatory spending. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 raised discretionary spending caps for FY2018 and FY2019, provided disaster assistance for agriculture, amended farm bill provisions, and extended sequestration effects. It also included a six-week CR through March 23, 2018, and revised agriculture programs with long-term policy implications. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 raised discretionary spending caps for FY2018 and provided $3.6 billion in disaster assistance for agriculture. It also added $1.4 billion in mandatory funding for the successor to the farm bill, including allocations for dairy programs, permanent disaster assistance, and cotton. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 raised discretionary spending caps for FY2018, providing $3.6 billion in disaster assistance for agriculture and $1.4 billion in mandatory funding for farm commodity programs. This included reallocating base acres and crop insurance, with offsets from extending sequestration on mandatory accounts under the BCA for FY2026 and FY2027. The budget caps were raised for nondefense discretionary and defense spending for FY2018 and FY2019. The FY2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R. 1625) raised discretionary spending caps, with the Agriculture portion receiving $23.3 billion, an increase of $2.1 billion from FY2017. The total enacted FY2018 Agriculture appropriation is about $146 billion, with additional spending primarily in General Provisions. The Consolidated Appropriations Act increases spending through additional funding in General Provisions for various programs, including rural water, broadband expansion, foreign food aid, and opioid enforcement. Agricultural research spending is also increased by $138 million across four agencies. The FY2018 Agriculture appropriation increases funding for various programs, including Agricultural Research Service and Food for Peace. Unlike previous years, there are fewer changes to mandatory program spending. The absence of usual CHIMPS costs about $740 million against the discretionary limit of the bill compared to FY2017. The FY2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act shows the amounts by agency and programs compared to previous years. The FY2018 appropriation compares to prior years FY2015-FY2017 and discusses budget sequestration as a mechanism to reduce spending. Sequestration is authorized through FY2021 for discretionary spending and FY2027 for mandatory spending. Bipartisan Budget Acts in 2013, 2015, and 2018 have raised discretionary budget caps to avoid sequestration. The Bipartisan Budget Acts raised discretionary budget caps to allow for larger appropriations, but sequestration still applies to certain mandatory spending accounts. The sunset on sequestration of mandatory accounts has been extended multiple times, including extensions until FY2023, FY2024, and FY2025. Congress extended sequestration on nonexempt mandatory accounts until FY2027 as an offset in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. Some farm bill mandatory programs are exempt from sequestration, while crop insurance and farm commodity programs may be exempt as determined by OMB. Generally, OMB has ruled that most crop insurance is exempt, while farm commodity programs, disaster assistance, and conservation programs have been subject to sequestration. Sequestration on nonexempt mandatory accounts in agriculture continues in FY2018, with a 6.6% reduction resulting in about $1.3 billion less authorized from mandatory agriculture accounts.
