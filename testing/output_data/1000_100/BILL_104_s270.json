    "content": "The \"Alien Terrorist Removal Act of 1995\" allows for the removal of alien terrorists under the Immigration and Nationality Act. Sec. 242C defines key terms such as 'alien terrorist', 'classified information', 'national security', 'special court', and 'special removal hearing'. The provisions of this section apply when the Attorney General certifies to the special court under seal. The Attorney General certifies to a special court that an alien terrorist is in the US, and deportation proceedings would risk national security by disclosing classified information. The Chief Justice designates up to seven judges to hear cases under this section. The Chief Justice may designate judges for cases under section 103(a) of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. When the Attorney General applies, a single judge of the special court reviews the application in camera and ex parte, invoking procedures if probable cause exists regarding the identified alien and national security risks in deportation proceedings. The special removal hearing authorized by a showing of probable cause shall be open to the public. The alien has the right to be present and represented by counsel, with counsel appointed if the alien is financially unable to obtain one. The special removal hearing allows the alien to introduce evidence, cross-examine witnesses, and request subpoenas. The judge can authorize the introduction of evidence in camera if it poses a risk to national security. The alien may receive a substitution for classified evidence with a statement admitting relevant facts. The special removal hearing allows the alien to introduce evidence, cross-examine witnesses, and request subpoenas. The judge can authorize the introduction of evidence in camera if it poses a risk to national security. The alien may receive a substitution for classified evidence with a statement admitting relevant facts, or a summary if disclosure would pose a risk of harm. If evidence in paragraph (5)(A) poses a substantial risk of death or serious harm, deportation may be determined under subsection (f). The judge will order deportation if the Attorney General proves, by clear and convincing evidence, that the alien is subject to deportation as described in section 241(a)(4)(B). The alien may appeal a deportation determination to the court of appeals for the Federal Circuit within twenty days. The Attorney General can also appeal a determination to the court of appeals within the same timeframe. The appeal process for a deportation determination involves transmitting the record to the court of appeals under seal for consideration in camera and ex parte."
