    "content": "In October 2017, the EPA proposed to repeal the controversial Clean Power Plan (CPP) aimed at limiting CO2 emissions from fossil-fuel-fired power plants. The CPP has faced legal challenges and has not been implemented since a stay was issued by the Supreme Court in 2016. Disagreements revolve around the rule's legal basis, design, and cost-benefit analysis. EPA set national CO2 emission rates for existing power plants under the Clean Air Act Section 111(d), allowing states two compliance options. The EPA proposed to repeal the Clean Power Plan (CPP) in 2017, offering states two compliance options to reduce CO2 emissions from power plants. The plan allowed flexibility in achieving emission goals through a \"rate-based\" or \"mass-based\" approach. EPA projected a 32% reduction in CO2 emissions nationwide by 2030 under the CPP. The EPA proposed to repeal the Clean Power Plan (CPP) in 2017 due to a change in interpretation of its legal authority under the Clean Air Act. The agency determined that the CPP exceeded its authority by setting CO2 emission goals that could only be achieved using measures outside the power plants' \"fence line.\" The proposed repeal was estimated to have significant economic impacts. The EPA's proposed repeal of the Clean Power Plan in 2017 was based on a new legal interpretation, not considering the benefits and costs. However, the benefit-cost analysis of the repeal revealed methodological changes from the 2015 analysis, which could impact future regulations. Members of Congress, including a group of 19 Senators, requested more information on the changes in EPA's 2017 analysis compared to the 2015 analysis for the CPP rule. The EPA's 2017 analysis of the Clean Power Plan repeal may influence how federal agencies consider climate and human health benefits in regulating greenhouse gases and pollutants. The report compares the economic analysis of the 2017 repeal with the 2015 final rule, highlighting changes in estimating climate benefits and human health considerations. The EPA's 2017 analysis of the Clean Power Plan repeal focuses on estimating climate benefits, human health co-benefits, and energy savings impact. This analysis is conducted in accordance with Executive Order 12866 and OMB Circular A-4, outlining the principles and requirements for federal regulations. For more details on the proposed repeal, refer to CRS Report R44992 and CRS Legal Sidebar LSB10016. The development and review of federal regulations outlined in E.O. 12866 require federal agencies to assess the benefits and costs of significant regulatory actions. These actions are defined as rules with an annual economic impact of $100 million or more, creating inconsistencies with other agency actions, altering budget impacts, or raising novel legal or policy issues. Economically significant rules necessitate a detailed regulatory analysis. OMB Circular A-4 elaborates on regulatory analysis principles, emphasizing the need to assess benefits and costs of proposed actions. It aims to standardize measurement and reporting practices across federal agencies, informing whether benefits justify costs. Monetized benefits do not necessarily have to outweigh costs. When the EPA promulgated the CPP in 2015, it prepared a regulatory analysis in accordance with E.O. 12866, OMB Circular A-4, and the agency's Guidelines for Preparing Economic Analyses. EPA calculated state-specific emission rate goals for the rate-based scenario and state-specific emission goals for the. EPA prepared illustrative scenarios for the CPP, estimating emission reductions and compliance costs using the Integrated Planning Model. Compliance costs were based on capital investment changes in new generating sources and improvements at coal-fired units. EPA emphasized the scenarios were not definitive but represented their best assessment of likely impacts. The EPA estimated compliance costs for the Clean Power Plan, including capital investment changes in new generating sources and improvements at coal-fired units. The estimates also factored in ongoing operating costs of pollution controls, fuel shifts, energy efficiency measures, and monitoring expenses. The plan aimed to reduce CO2 and non-GHG emissions, with the EPA using the IPM model to calculate CO2 reductions and the social cost of carbon to assess the economic value of climate benefits. The EPA estimated human health benefits from reductions in non-GHG emissions, such as SO2 and NOx, as a result of the Clean Power Plan. These benefits were referred to as \"co-benefits\" and were monetized using a \"benefit-per-ton\" approach for PM and ozone reduction in different regions. The EPA estimated health co-benefits from reductions in non-GHG emissions like SO2 and NOx in the Western United States and California. PM health effects accounted for most of the monetized benefits, with SO2 reductions contributing significantly. Ozone health effects made up a smaller portion of the estimated benefits for the year 2030. The EPA proposed to repeal the CPP in 2030, following a change in legal interpretation of the Clean Air Act. The agency revisited the regulatory analysis for the CPP repeal, focusing on data and methodology requirements. The repeal was considered an economically significant regulatory action, leading to a new regulatory analysis in compliance with E.O. 12866 and OMB Circular A-4. The EPA prepared a regulatory analysis for the proposed CPP repeal, defining benefits as avoided compliance costs and costs as forgone emissions reductions and associated climate and health benefits. The analysis did not include new power sector modeling but used existing projections to estimate the benefits and costs of the repeal. The EPA plans to update modeling using IPM for the proposed repeal of the CPP. Benefit-cost estimates were based on power sector modeling from 2015 and more recent projections from the EIA's AEO 2017. The EPA used compliance costs and emission reductions under the CPP to monetize avoided costs and forgone benefits of the proposed repeal. Changes in accounting treatment of energy efficiency savings were made, shifting them from costs to benefits. The 2015 analysis favored the CPP, while the 2017 analysis showed less favorable benefit-cost comparisons. The 2015 and 2017 analyses compared the net impact of the proposed repeal of the CPP. In 2015, all estimates showed net benefits, ranging from $25 billion to $45 billion in 2030. In contrast, the 2017 estimates ranged from net costs to net benefits, with figures ranging from $28.3 billion in net costs to $14 billion in net benefits in 2030. The 2017 analysis did not explicitly state whether the benefits of the repeal are likely to outweigh the costs. Table 1 shows the highest and lowest net impacts reported for the proposed repeal of the CPP in 2015 and 2017 analyses. Benefit-cost estimates from AEO 2017 projections varied, with half showing net benefits and half showing net costs. AEO-based estimates for the proposed repeal in 2030 ranged from $30.6 billion in net costs to $14.0 billion in net benefits. The impact of updated power sector projections on benefit-cost estimates remains unclear. EPA noted that 2015 power sector modeling did not reflect recent changes. The 2015 power sector modeling did not reflect recent changes in the power sector, including shifts to lower-emitting sources and greater SO2 reductions under the CPP. EPA plans to update its modeling before finalizing the proposed repeal. The AEO 2017 projections showed higher human health co-benefits and greater reduction in coal emissions under the CPP compared to EPA's 2015 estimates. A study by Resources for the Future highlighted uncertainties in the differences between models used in the 2015 RIA projections and the 2017 AEO projections. EPA revised its analysis of the CPP's benefits and costs by excluding international impacts of U.S. emissions and more strongly discounting the future. The EPA made three key changes in their analysis of the CPP's benefits and costs: excluding international impacts of U.S. emissions, more strongly discounting future CO2 reduction benefits, and counting energy efficiency savings as benefits. These changes led to differences in conclusions between the 2015 and 2017 analyses. The Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) is used to value climate benefits of CO2 reductions, representing the monetary value of impacts from changes in CO2 emissions. The Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) values are used to estimate the monetary value of climate benefits from changes in CO2 emissions. In 2015, the EPA estimated the climate benefits of the CPP using SCC values ranging from $17 to $160 per metric ton of CO2 emissions in 2030. These values were based on discount rates of 5%, 3%, and 2.5%. The Trump Administration withdrew the IWG's SCC estimates in 2017 as part of E.O. 13783, directing agencies to use discount rates of 3% and 7% in regulatory analysis. EPA developed new SCC values in response. EPA developed new interim SCC values based on E.O. 13783, using models and assumptions similar to the IWG but with adjustments for domestic scope. The domestic SCC estimates from three models are $7 and $1 per metric ton of CO2 emissions in 2030 at discount rates of 3% and 7%. EPA approximated domestic SCC as 10% of global SCC for the DICE 2010 model. The United States emits CO2 and other GHGs, contributing to global GHG concentrations and affecting the global climate. Stakeholders debate using domestic or global SCC values, with the IWG recommending global values due to the global nature of the problem. EPA agreed with this rationale in 2015. Some stakeholders supported the use of global social cost of carbon (SCC) estimates in 2015, citing spillover effects in national security, international trade, and public health. They argued that a domestic SCC would underestimate benefits to the United States. Those recommending global values emphasized the interconnected global economy and the lack of a clear distinction between domestic and global climate change impacts. Other stakeholders disagreed, advocating for the use of domestic SCC values by federal agencies. In 2015, stakeholders disagreed on using global SCC estimates for U.S. climate regulations, arguing that domestic SCC values should be prioritized. Some criticized the comparison of global benefits to domestic costs, stating that it overstates the benefits of a country-specific rulemaking. The EPA's focus on domestic SCC estimates in the 2017 analysis of the proposed repeal was explained by direction in E.O. 13873 and OMB Circular A-4, although A-4 does not prohibit consideration of global values. EPA presented global estimates in a sensitivity analysis in the 2017 regulatory analysis, acknowledging challenges in developing accurate domestic SCC estimates. The difficulty lies in capturing relevant regional interactions and how climate change impacts in other regions could affect the United States. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NAS) highlighted that current models for estimating the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) do not fully consider regional interactions. OMB Circular A-4 discusses discount rate selection for benefit-cost analysis, recommending rates of 3% and 7% based on scenarios affecting consumer spending or private capital. The 3% rate, known as the \"consumption rate,\" reflects the average saver's discount rate for future consumption. The Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) calculation involves discounting future consumption using a real rate of return on long-term government debt, typically around 3%. The 7% rate is based on the opportunity cost of capital and corresponds to the growth rate of federal spending. Discounting allows for comparisons of economic impacts at different times and is a standard practice in benefit-cost analysis. The selection of a discount rate is particularly challenging for SCC calculations due to the intergenerational aspect of climate change. The current generation must choose a discount rate for future generations without their input, raising questions about accounting for future preferences. Different discount rates impact present values and Social Cost of Carbon estimates. OMB Circular A-4 acknowledges ethical implications in comparing benefits and costs across generations. OMB Circular A-4 recommends sensitivity analysis with lower discount rates for intergenerational benefits and costs. The Council of Economic Advisers suggested reducing the 3% rate to 2% and lowering the 7% rate. Stakeholders have differing views on discount rate selection for the Social Cost of Carbon, with environmental groups advocating for lower rates. The federal government and industry groups recommend different discount rates for the Social Cost of Carbon. The literature shows lower rates are often used in climate change studies, with the majority citing rates of no more than 5%. The Interagency Working Group (IWG) did not apply the 7% rate, instead using rates of 2.5%, 3%, and 5%. The EPA agreed with these rates in the 2015 analysis, stating they were consistent with economic literature and guidance. The NAS recommended a new approach to calculate discount rates for the Social Cost of Carbon, emphasizing the need to capture uncertainty over long periods of time. They criticized the OMB Circular A-4 guidance for not addressing long-term discounting and uncertainty issues. EPA's 2017 analysis produced lower benefit estimates compared to their 2015 analysis for the same CO2 emissions tonnage. EPA's 2017 analysis valued CO2 emissions lower than in 2015, resulting in reduced estimates of climate benefits under the CPP. The agency acknowledged limitations in the interim SCC estimates and conducted a sensitivity analysis using global values and a 2.5% discount rate. The 2017 analysis also excluded a direct comparison of sensitivity analysis estimates to avoided compliance costs. The EPA's 2017 analysis diverged from the 2015 analysis by excluding forgone human health co-benefits in some benefit-cost comparisons. Different comparisons either counted all, partially counted, or completely excluded health co-benefits. This approach was seen as inconsistent with OMB's Circular A-4 guidance. EPA focused on benefits from reductions in CO2 emissions relative to costs, excluding health co-benefits entirely in one comparison. EPA requested public comment on the effectiveness of alternative regulatory designs in achieving cost-effective reductions in targeted pollutants. Stakeholders raised concerns about the inclusion of co-benefits in regulatory analysis, questioning the attribution of benefits to specific regulations. EPA's 2015 analysis stated that human health co-benefits of the CPP were incremental to existing regulations of PM and emissions. OMB Circular A-4 directs agencies to quantify and monetize co-benefits and adverse impacts not already considered in direct cost estimates. EPA's economic analysis includes intended effects, costs, and ancillary benefits. The OMB's recent reports to Congress on federal regulations highlight the monetization of co-benefits in EPA's Clean Air Act analyses. The estimated benefits of EPA rules are mainly due to the reduction in public exposure to fine particulate matter, following standard accounting practices. EPA applied a threshold to forgone health co-benefits in benefit-cost comparisons, counting only those exceeding a defined threshold for ambient PM levels. EPA used thresholds to calculate PM mortality impacts in benefit-cost comparisons, assuming no deaths below certain levels. One threshold was based on the federal air quality standard for PM (12 \u03bcg/m3), while the second was based on the lowest measured level from two long-term studies (5.8 \u03bcg/m3 and 8 \u03bcg/m3). The PM air quality standard was higher than the lowest measured level. The PM air quality standard threshold lowered the co-benefit estimates more than the LML threshold. Benefit-cost comparisons of the proposed repeal were mostly favorable using the PM air quality standard threshold. EPA used these thresholds to enhance transparency and provide insight into uncertainty in estimating PM benefits at lower levels. EPA referenced the agency's 2012 analysis of the rule updating the federal air quality standard for PM, which found greater uncertainty in estimating PM-related health risks below the federal standard. EPA justified using the LML threshold to examine uncertainty in PM-related mortality benefits, citing scientific evidence that a no-threshold model best portrays the PM-mortality concentration-response relationship. EPA's 2015 analysis acknowledged lower confidence in benefits from reductions at lower PM concentrations. EPA's 2015 analysis acknowledged lower confidence in benefits from reductions at lower concentrations of PM but did not apply a threshold. EPA stated that federal air quality standards are not \"risk-free,\" indicating some risk of adverse health effects from pollution meeting the standard. EPA plans to evaluate the uncertainty of the benefit-per-ton approach for PM impacts. EPA changed the accounting treatment of demand-side energy efficiency savings in their analysis, treating them as benefits rather than negative costs. This adjustment increased both the estimated costs and benefits by the same amount. In the proposed repeal analysis, EPA removed energy savings as a negative value from the total. EPA's accounting change in the proposed repeal analysis shifted energy savings from cost savings to benefits, resulting in higher estimates of both costs and benefits. This adjustment did not alter the net impact of the repeal but had significance in the cost analysis conducted under E.O. 13771. EPA presented these results separately in the 2017 regulatory analysis. The EPA's E.O. 13771 analysis in the 2017 regulatory analysis focused on cost savings of the proposed repeal but excluded the forgone benefits. Compliance costs analyzed under E.O. 13771 exceeded those considered in the 2015 benefit-cost analysis, as demand-side energy efficiency savings were viewed as benefits in the 2017 analysis. E.O. 13771 analysis in 2017 focused on cost savings of proposed repeal, exceeding compliance costs in 2015 benefit-cost analysis. Benefit-cost analysis informs policy decisions but doesn't solely drive regulatory proposals. Decisionmakers consider qualitative impacts, legal, technical, statutory, and ethical factors in finalizing regulations. EPA based proposed CPP repeal on agency changes. The EPA's proposed repeal of the Clean Power Plan (CPP) is based on a change in legal interpretation and adherence to rulemaking procedures. Quantifying the benefits and costs of regulations involves complex tasks drawing upon scientific data and policy decisions. Changes in policy priorities and technical information can influence the estimation of benefits and costs, as seen in the differences between the 2015 CPP analysis and the 2017 repeal analysis. EPA's 2017 benefit-cost analysis reached different conclusions due to changes in how economic impacts were estimated. The EPA's proposed repeal of the Clean Power Plan (CPP) is influenced by changes in economic impact estimation, including new SCC estimates and thresholds affecting climate and human health benefits. Congress has varying views on EPA regulatory policy, with potential impacts on major industries and citizen welfare. Differences in policy priorities between the Trump and Obama Administrations are reflected in the changes to the CPP's benefits and costs assessment. The EPA's 2017 analysis used interim SCC estimates that differed from the Obama Administration's IWG SCC estimates, impacting the estimated climate benefits of the proposed repeal of the Clean Power Plan. The withdrawal of IWG SCC estimates may lead to differences in GHG-related regulations across federal agencies. EPA's analysis provided limited details on next steps for the SCC. The EPA's 2017 analysis used interim SCC estimates for regulatory analyses without providing a timeline for updates. Other agencies like the U.S. Bureau of Land Management have followed a similar approach, while the Department of Energy continued to use IWG SCC estimates in one rulemaking. Congress may consider the implications of EPA's changes to health co-benefits analysis. The EPA's 2017 analysis of health co-benefits in air pollution rulemakings differed from the 2015 analysis, using a threshold to calculate PM mortality impacts and excluding health co-benefits from one benefit-cost comparison. This departure from previous analyses may set a precedent for future rulemakings."
