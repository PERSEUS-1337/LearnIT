    "content": "Legislation to rewrite and reauthorize the Export Administration Act of 1979 (EAA) may be considered in the 111th Congress. Several pieces of legislation in the 110th Congress addressed penalties, enforcement, diversion of goods, and integration of export control data. The EAA controls sensitive dual-use goods and technologies with civilian and military applications, including those that can contribute to proliferation of nuclear, biological, and chemical weaponry. The EAA has been periodically reauthorized since its original expiration in 1989, with the last extension expiring in August 2001. The Export Administration Act (EAA) authorizes the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) under the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) to regulate exports of dual-use items. The EAA focuses on controlling civilian goods with military applications, based on national security threats and international business practices. The EAA has been periodically reauthorized since its expiration in 1989. The Export Administration Act (EAA) authorizes regulations to control exports of dual-use items, focusing on civilian goods with military applications. There is a debate on the need to liberalize U.S. export regulations for high-technology goods, with concerns about national security threats and the maintenance of export controls. The report discusses the evolution of the EAA, its major features, including the Commerce Control List and export licensing procedures, and highlights controlled commodities. The Export Control Act of 1949 formalized the need for an extensive peacetime export control system, focusing on the Soviet-Bloc countries during the Cold War. It identified key themes in the export control debate, such as technology controllability, multilateral control regimes, and the impact on the U.S. economy and business. The 1949 Export Control Act established three reasons for imposing export controls: short-supply controls to prevent the export of scarce goods, foreign policy controls to promote U.S. foreign policy, and national security controls to restrict goods that could enhance military capability of threatening countries. This regime coincided with the establishment of a multilateral export control system. The establishment of the post-war U.S. export control regime led to the creation of a multilateral control system with NATO allies through CoCom in 1949. The Export Control Act was renewed multiple times with high restrictions until the late 1960s when a reexamination and revision occurred due to the U.S.-Soviet era of \"detente\". The Export Administration Act of 1969 replaced the Export Control Act of 1949, leading to a shift towards less restrictive export controls. The act was rewritten in 1979 and amended in 1985, with further liberalization in subsequent years. The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989 marked a significant change in the external threat faced by the United States, prompting a reduction in the scope of the export control system starting with the George H.W. Bush Administration. The Export Administration Act of 1969 replaced the Export Control Act of 1949, leading to less restrictive export controls. The George H.W. Bush Administration reduced and streamlined the export control system, but the basic structure of the law remains intact. There is a need to revamp the act to enhance exports, focus on current national security threats, or increase penalties for violations. The dissolution of CoCom in 1994 and its replacement by the Wassenaar Arrangement in 1997 significantly changed the export control environment. The new multilateral arrangement is more loosely structured, raising questions about the effectiveness of U.S. export controls in achieving national security objectives and the fairness of unilateral controls to American industry. Congress has not been able to agree on measures to reform the Export Administration. Legislation passed in 2000 extended the Export Administration Act of 1979 until August 20, 2001, temporarily removing the need to operate the export control system. Operating under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) has been a point of contention for those seeking to reform the act. Legislation passed in 2000 extended the Export Administration Act of 1979 until August 20, 2001, temporarily removing the need to operate the export control system. Export control authority has since been operating under IEEPA provisions pursuant to Executive Order 13222 issued on August 17, 2001. Legislation to rewrite the Export Administration Act has been introduced in several Congresses, with bills being passed in the House but not progressing further in the Senate. In the 106th Congress, the Export Administration Act of 1999 (S. 1712) was introduced by Senator Michael P. Enzi, but no action was taken. In the 107th Congress, Senator Enzi introduced the Export Administration Act of 2001 (S. 149), which passed the Senate with amendments by a vote of 85-14 after hearings and favorable reports. The Export Administration Act, similar to S. 1712, passed with three amendments by a vote of 85-14. The House version, H.R. 2581, introduced by Representative Benjamin Gilman, was passed with 35 amendments by the House International Relations Committee. HASC further amended H.R. 2581 on March 6, 2002, and reported out the legislation by a vote of 44-6. HPSCI also held hearings on the legislation. In the 108th Congress, Representative Dreier introduced EAA legislation (H.R. 55), identical to S. 149, but no action was taken on it. The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) has been used to attempt to amend the export control regime, with the House version of NDAA 2005 (H.R. 4200) containing provisions affecting dual-use export controls. One provision would have required a license for dual-use goods controlled under the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) for technology and items on the Militarily Critical Technology List (MCTL). The Department of Defense compiled a list called MCTL in response to a 2004 study. The House NDAA report expressed concern about potential military embargoes on China being repealed, leading to the transfer of U.S. goods or technology. However, certain provisions regarding export controls were not included in the final conference report. In response to concerns about potential military embargoes on China, a bill to revise the Export Administration Act was introduced in the 109th Congress. The bill addressed penalties, enforcement, and U.S. relations with multilateral control regimes. It aimed for targeted changes that all sides could support, but ultimately did not pass. No comprehensive legislation to rewrite or reauthorize the EAA was introduced in the 110th Congress. Comprehensive legislation was introduced in the 110th Congress to amend the Export Administration Act. Various bills aimed to amend enforcement, penalties, integrate export control information, and target countries of diversion concern. Only one bill, S. 3445/H.R. 7112, was acted upon but did not receive floor consideration. H.R. 7112 was introduced and passed in the House under suspension of the rules on September 26, 2008. Representative Sherman introduced the Export Control Improvements Act (H.R. 3515) on July 31, 2009, which includes provisions on export controls enforcement, integration of export control data in the AES, and diversion control. The legislation grants additional enforcement authority for the Export Administration Regulations during the lapse of the EAA under the IEEPA. The draft legislation, H.R. 3515, grants investigative authority to departments and agencies under the EAR for conducting investigations in the US and abroad. It allows for search, detention, and seizure of goods by Commerce domestically and at US ports of entry or exit. The bill also includes provisions for publishing best practices guidelines, confidentiality provisions, and new language governing the use of funds for undercover investigations. Title 1 of H.R. 3515 aims to streamline licensing requirements and data collection rules for exporters into the Automated Export System. It focuses on integrating export control data into the system to prevent improper shipments. The issue of evading U.S. export controls through transhipment hubs is a concern for Congress, highlighted by instances of sensitive goods being diverted to unauthorized destinations. The UAE was initially under scrutiny for bomb detonators used in Iraq, leading to proposed stricter licensing requirements for countries of diversion concern. H.R. 3515 would legislate the concept of 'Category C' for diversion to Iran, requiring the identification of countries of concern within 180 days. The bill aims to address transhipment, reexportation, or diversion of items subject to the EAR to Iran by designating countries as possible diversion concerns or diversion concerns. If a country does not cooperate within 12 months, it will be designated as a Destination of Diversion Concern. Countries of diversion concern will face additional licensing requirements and increased scrutiny. An annual report on transfers will also be mandated. The legislation includes provisions for an annual report on transfers of significant dual-use U.S. technology to countries of concern. President Obama initiated a review of the export control system, with Defense Secretary Gates proposing a 4-pronged approach for reform. This approach aims to streamline the current complex system into a single export control licensing agency. The administration's plan aims to streamline export controls by creating a unified control list, integrated IT system, and enforcement agency in three phases, with the final phase requiring legislative action. Phase I involves harmonizing control lists and licensing processes, while Phase II implements a harmonized licensing system with two tiered control lists. The White House plan aims to implement a harmonized licensing system with two tiered control lists, leading to a significant reduction in license requirements. It includes moving items from the munitions list to the dual-use list, examining unilateral controls, and consulting with multilateral partners. The new export control system will debut in Phase III, with a single licensing agency, merged control lists, a Primary Enforcement Coordination Agency, and a unified IT system for licensing and enforcement. The 3-phase plan for a new export control system, outlined by Secretary Gates, is set to unfold over the next year. However, many questions remain unanswered, including the need for legislative action for certain proposals and potential changes to the structure of control lists. Multilateral consultations would be required for changes to the CCL and USML, which are derived from the Wassenaar Dual-Use List and Munitions List. Additionally, changes in agency structure may necessitate legislation. The proposed licensing agency's placement within existing Departments like Commerce, State, Defense, or Homeland Security, or as an independent entity, is undecided. Common principles in export control efforts include types of controls, licensing procedures, review process, and enforcement. Dual-use export controls have been in place since the 1949 Act, restricting items based on national security, foreign policy, or domestic economic impact. The Commerce Control List (CCL) and Export Administration Regulations control items for national security and foreign policy reasons. The 1979 Act restricted exports that could enhance military capabilities of other countries. National security control items require licenses reviewed case-by-case for civilian use. Country Group D-1 is the list of controlled countries for national security purposes. The Export Administration Regulations control items for national security and foreign policy reasons. The Secretary of Defense maintains the Military Critical Technology List (MCTL) for this purpose. U.S. national security controls do not cover items under nuclear, chemical, biological, or missile proliferation regimes. Items and destinations covered by anti-terrorism controls are controlled for foreign policy purposes. Under the Export Administration Regulations, items are controlled for national security and foreign policy reasons. Foreign availability determinations are made to assess if controlled items are readily available from sources outside the United States. The Secretary, in collaboration with the Secretary of Defense, regularly evaluates items for foreign availability status. If an item is deemed to have foreign availability, it must be decontrolled, unless the President decides otherwise. The President can overturn decisions on decontrolling items if it affects national security. The Office of Foreign Availability gathers data for foreign availability determinations. The Office of Technology Evaluation now handles these determinations. The ETRAC committee involves university experts in determining technologies for control lists. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) conducted a review of the Commerce Control List (CCL) in 2007-8 and plans to review 1/3 of the list each year. On May 22, 2009, BIS issued a final rule lifting certain licensing requirements on uncooled thermal imaging cameras to 36 U.S. allied countries. The rule decontrolled low to mid-market night vision cameras, tightened export controls on higher-end thermal imaging cameras, unembedded camera cores, and thermal imaging cameras embedded in a military commodity. Exporters must report the. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) lifted licensing requirements on thermal imaging cameras for U.S. allied countries. Some concerns remain about the time taken to resolve issues. Mass market status was proposed in EAA legislation but is not currently included in regulations. The EAA legislation introduced criteria for determining mass market status, which was controversial and a stumbling block in negotiations. The EAA authorizes the President to control exports for foreign policy objectives, including anti-terrorism, regional stability, crime control, UN sanctions, embargoes, and non-proliferation. The EAA legislation imposes limitations on foreign policy controls, requiring annual renewal and clear objectives. It mandates negotiations to remove foreign availability of controlled items and compliance with international obligations. Export licenses are needed for certain items to countries supporting terrorism, with exceptions for medicine and humanitarian aid. Controls on sales of medicine, medical supplies, food, medicines, seeds, and water resource equipment are exempted for basic human needs. Catch-all controls require a license for export of any item if it will be used for nuclear, missile, chemical, or biological proliferation activities. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) maintains an end-user list. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) maintains an end-user list of entities requiring licenses for export control. Regulations include a presumption of denial for licenses to certain entities in Russia, China, Pakistan, India, and Israel, as well as foreign terrorist organizations. The Export Administration Act (EAA) authorizes restrictions on exports to protect domestic industry. Short-supply controls remain for items like crude oil, petroleum derivatives, and horses by sea. The Bureau of Industry and Security administers the license application process. In FY2008, BIS reviewed 21,213 applications. In FY2008, BIS reviewed 21,213 license applications totaling $72.1 billion. Dual-use technology licenses were valued at $21.9 billion, representing 1.7% of total U.S. exports. BIS approved 84% of applications, denied 1.0%, and returned 15%. China received the most licenses with a value of $2.7 billion. In FY2008, the number of approved license applications for chemical manufacturing facilities and equipment was 2,212 with a value of $294 million. The Commerce Control List (CCL) was created under the 1979 EAA, containing items controlled for national security, foreign policy, and short-supply purposes. The CCL includes ten categories of items such as nuclear materials, electronics, and telecommunications. The Commerce Control List (CCL) categorizes controlled items for national security and foreign policy purposes. It includes categories like nuclear materials, electronics, and telecommunications. Each item on the CCL has an Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) and may be restricted based on end-use or end-user, with about 500 ECCN listings currently. The Commerce Control List (CCL) categorizes controlled items for national security and foreign policy purposes, with items often eligible for license exceptions. A commodity jurisdiction (CJ) determines if a product is dual-use or a munition, impacting the regulatory regime. Exporters may seek a BIS commodity classification for less restrictive controls. Exporters can request a BIS commodity classification for dual-use goods that do not match existing CCL listings. However, there have been criticisms of the low number of classification referrals to State and Defense, with only 10 out of 5,370 requests in 2005 being referred. Referral criteria development with State and Defense has also been lacking. The lack of development of renewed referral criteria with State and Defense has led to jurisdictional disagreements and coordination problems between the two departments. Despite recommendations, these disputes have not been resolved, leaving exporters to determine restrictions and governmental review processes. The Export Administration Regulations establish procedures for license application reviews and interagency dispute resolutions, but current procedures were created by Executive Order 12981 in 1995. The procedures for reviewing export licenses were established by Executive Order 12981 in 1995, giving the Secretary of Commerce the authority to determine license disposition. Various agencies can review licenses, with the Secretary making final decisions within nine days of application registration. The 1995 Order established procedures for reviewing export licenses, giving the Secretary of Commerce authority to determine disposition. Agencies must recommend approval or denial within 30 days, with a three-level dispute resolution mechanism in place. The Export Administration Review Board (EARB) is chaired by the Secretary of Commerce and includes the Secretaries of State, Defense, and Energy. The Board may invite other agency heads to participate. The Advisory Committee on Export Policy (ACEP) is under the EARB and has an Operating Committee (OC) for dispute resolution. The Chair of the OC reviews agency recommendations within 14 days. The Export Administration Review Board (EARB) process involves various steps for decision-making and appeals. The Chair informs agencies of decisions within 14 days, with opportunities for appeals to the ACEP and Secretary. The interagency appeal process must be completed within 90 days, but there is no set timeframe for Presidential consideration of a license decision. The Export Administration Review Board (EARB) process includes steps for decision-making and appeals. BIS's denial of an export license must be supported by statutory and regulatory basis, with an explicit appeal procedure specified in the EAR. Appeals can be based on foreign availability assessment. In FY2008, 422 cases were escalated to the OC, and 20 were examined by the ACEP. President George H.W. Bush extended export regulations in 1990 using emergency authority under IEEPA. President Clinton imposed controls under IEEPA after the expiration of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. A major restructuring of export control regulations was published in 1996. President Clinton extended the authority of the 1979 Act until 2001, when emergency controls were renewed by President George W. Bush. Several deficiencies have been noted in maintaining export controls under IEEPA authority, including the lapse of police power of enforcement agents with the EAA. Agents must obtain Special Deputy U.S. Marshal status to function as law enforcement officers, consuming limited resources. IEEPA does not authorize the President to limit federal court jurisdiction or protect information from public disclosure. Additionally, it does not allow the executive to discourage compliance with foreign boycotts against friendly countries. The United States has been criticized for not enacting appropriate legislation on export controls, which undermines its credibility when urging other countries to strengthen their laws. However, the International Emergency Economic Powers Enhancement Act raised criminal penalties to $1 million and civil penalties to $250,000, aiming to enhance enforcement measures. The EAA imposes penalties for violations involving national security controls, with civil penalties capped at $10,000 or $100,000, and criminal penalties of up to $250,000 and 10 years' imprisonment for individuals, and $1 million or 5 times the value of exports for firms. Controversial exports include telecommunications, advanced electronic equipment, precision machine tools, guidance technology, aerospace technology, synthetic materials, and specialized manufacturing equipment. Congressional focus has been on technologically advanced computers capable of complex digital operations. High Performance Computers (HPCs) encompass various technologies like workstations, mainframes, microprocessors, and software. The computing performance of HPCs was traditionally measured using Composite Theoretical Performance (CTP) in MTOPS. However, a new standard called Adjusted Peak Performance (APP) was approved in 2005 to calculate computing power more accurately. The new standard, Adjusted Peak Performance (APP), measures the peak rate of 64-bit or larger floating point operations in digital computers using Weighted Teraflops (WT). The control level is set at 0.75 WT, replacing the previous 190,000 MTOPS benchmark. Restrictions on U.S. exports of HPC technology have been in place, but advocates argue that rapid advancements in computing capabilities and availability of foreign models similar to U.S. products warrant a reevaluation. During the Clinton and Bush Administrations, HPC export thresholds were raised, with the last change in January 2002 to 190,000 MTOPS for Tier 3 countries. This decontrol process significantly impacted BIS regulations, reducing computer assembly and hardware license applications. Despite the switch to WT metric, control level changes still require notification under the National Defense Authorization Act of 1998. The National Defense Authorization Act of 1998 imposed special conditions on the export of high performance computers, requiring prior notification for exports above the MTOPS threshold to Tier III countries. It also imposed post-shipment verification and notification requirements for adjustments in MTOPS threshold levels to Congress. Encryption is the process of encoding electronic messages for secure data transfer. Encryption technology is crucial for secure data transfer, requiring keys to unlock messages. It plays a significant role in e-commerce security and cryptography, with implications for military code-breaking. Executive Order 13026 transferred control authority of encryption technology from the Department of State to the Department of Commerce in 1996. This led to the decontrol of retail encryption products, allowing their export to western countries and non-governmental end-users with a license exemption. Stealth technology involves materials and designs to protect against electronic detection. It can deflect or absorb radar signals, making it difficult to detect objects. Export control is crucial due to civil applications and concerns over dissemination. Certain stealth-related technology has been reclassified as munitions to prevent potential export. In the 1990s, the Department of State reclassified stealth-related technology as munitions. Congress debated controlling exports of commercial satellites and the effectiveness of monitoring foreign launch operations to prevent missile secrets disclosure. The Cox Committee found in 1998 that U.S. satellite manufacturers transferred missile design information to China. Satellite exports were licensed by the Department of Commerce until March 1999 when Congress returned authority to the Department of State. The satellite industry claims this transfer led to licensing delays and lost sales, lobbying for a reversal. The satellite industry has lobbied to reverse export controls to Commerce due to delays and lost sales from regulatory uncertainty. Commercial satellites may contain sensitive technology controlled under the U.S. Munitions List. The Foreign Relations Authorization Act of 2010-11 allows for the transfer of commercial satellite technology from the USML back to the CCL with congressional approval. Manufacturing technology for missiles, aircraft engines, and arms is also covered in this category. The aerospace industry utilizes advanced technology in the production of aircraft engines and arms. There are concerns about the lack of multilateral controls over sales, especially regarding China. The BIS Office of Technology Evaluation recommended decontrolling certain products to China and Taiwan. \"Hot section\" technology is crucial for military and commercial jet aircraft. Technology controlled by the Department of Defense is on the U.S. Munitions List, while technology in commercial aircraft falls under the Department of Commerce. During debates on EAA legislation, concerns were raised about decontrol of technology in commercial aircraft. The civilian aviation industry is worried about DDTC's jurisdiction over aircraft parts. Section 17(c) of the EAA addresses export controls for standard equipment in civil aircraft certified by the FAA. In response to concerns over DDTC's jurisdiction over aircraft parts, legislation was introduced to clarify that civil aircraft equipment eligible for FAA approval should only be subject to controls under the EAA. DDTC released a new rule clarifying the interpretation of Section 17(c) of the EAA. Under a new rule, Commerce will have jurisdiction over parts and components of civil aircraft that are standard equipment and integral to the aircraft. Suppliers no longer need to submit these parts for a commodity jurisdiction determination if they are not significant military equipment. Technology transfers to foreign nationals within the U.S. are regulated by the Export Administration Regulations, requiring a license for such transfers. The Export Administration Regulations regulate technology transfers to foreign nationals in the U.S., requiring a license if the transfer would need one in the foreign national's home country. Deemed exports, not mentioned in the 1979 EAA, have become a larger part of BIS activity, with a significant number of licenses reviewed for Chinese nationals. In response to an IG report, BIS established a rule-making procedure to alter the standard governing which foreign nationals are subject to export controls. The IG recommended using country of birth for export controls, but controls continue to be based on country of citizenship or permanent residency. The Deemed Export Advisory Commission suggested a \"trusted entity\" program for streamlined deemed export applications. The Deemed Export Advisory Commission proposed evaluating an applicant's loyalties based on various factors like country of birth, residence, and citizenship. They also suggested simplifying terminology in export regulations and establishing an expert panel for annual technology reviews. Industry and research groups criticized the recommendations as unmanageable for the government and difficult for compliance. BIS sought feedback on technology scope in May 2008. The Deemed Export Advisory Commission proposed evaluating an applicant's loyalties based on factors like country of birth, residence, and citizenship. BIS sought feedback on technology scope in May 2008, leading to debates on export administration legislation and the tension between commercial and national security concerns. Many support reform of the current export control system to help U.S. businesses compete globally. Some support export control reform to aid U.S. business competitiveness globally, while others prioritize national security concerns, focusing on controlling exports to potential threats. Controversies arise over technology control, multilateral regimes, licensing processes, and economic impacts. Industry groups debate the EAA reauthorization legislation and the controllability of technology. Industry groups advocating for EAA legislation believe that unilateral controls on technology exports are ineffective. They argue that other countries will still obtain advanced technology, benefiting foreign businesses while American businesses suffer. This viewpoint criticizes current multilateral controls on dual-use articles as inadequate. The current export control system is facing challenges due to globalization, as component parts are manufactured worldwide and considered commodities. Purchasing managers are reducing dependence on American components due to delays in licensing procedures. Critics argue that industry proponents' mass market and foreign availability arguments would undermine the entire U.S. control regime. The mass market standard is criticized for potentially nullifying the U.S. control regime by decontrolling items meeting certain criteria. Concerns include the possibility of dual-use items used for proliferation qualifying for mass market status. Industry argues that robust export industries enhance national security, citing the shift in defense procurement and research funding from the military to external sources. Industry argues that selling current technology is crucial for national security, as it generates funds for future development. Export controls hindering American firms could lead to foreign firms gaining market share and surpassing technological lead, impacting national security. Critics argue against selling advanced technology to potentially hostile states, stating it does not promote national security. Some argue against selling advanced technology to potentially hostile states, citing the case of Iraq using U.S. weaponry against Kuwait. They suggest funding R&D for defense capabilities within the Defense Department to maintain control over technology exports. Industry groups highlight the challenges of export control systems in keeping up with rapid technological advancements. The export control system struggles to keep up with technological advancements, particularly in computing power. Attempts to restrict computer trade are seen as ineffective and counterproductive, as advancements in microprocessors and networking allow for the creation of high-performance systems by linking together commodity computers. This erodes the ability to control access to high-performance computing, posing challenges for export regulations. Some believe the US can limit access to high computer technology by restricting exports of American-made computers, which are seen as superior. Advocates argue that qualitative differences are significant, especially in networking parallel processing systems. Monitoring end-use of controlled goods post-shipment is one policy attempted. The post-shipment verification requirement (PSV) on the export of High Performance Computers (HPCs) mandated by Sec 1213 of NDAA98 aims to monitor and verify the end-use of controlled goods, especially for computers destined for tier III destinations like China, Russia, India, Pakistan, and Israel. Lawmakers are concerned about HPC exports to China due to restricted access and limited monitoring efforts by BIS. The close ties between Chinese state-owned enterprises and the military further complicate monitoring efforts. The United States participates in multilateral export control regimes, including the Wassenaar Arrangement (WA) on Dual-Use Goods and Munitions, created in 1996. Other control regimes include the Australia Group, the Missile Technology Control Regime, and the Nuclear Suppliers Group, each with a common control list and national discretion. These groups regulate exports of goods related to national security and proliferation concerns. The Wassenaar Arrangement and other multilateral export control regimes have common control lists, allowing member nations to control exports under national laws. These groups pledge disclosure and consultation on export licenses but operate by consensus, leading to limited effectiveness due to the need for unanimous agreement. Critics argue that the reliance on consensus results in minimal reporting requirements and a level of control acceptable to all. Industry representatives criticize the minimal reporting requirements of the Wassenaar Arrangement, emphasizing the need for effective multilateral controls to ensure all exporting states adhere to regulations. They specifically highlight concerns about unilateral export policies towards China and the lack of consensus on technology transfer limits. This approach, combined with stringent domestic controls, is seen as damaging to American companies. The United States is criticized for its strict licensing policy towards China without actively convincing allies to follow suit. Proponents argue that America should lead in export controls to strengthen international efforts like the Wassenaar Arrangement. They believe that relying solely on other nations' policies is ineffective and harmful to national security. The debate surrounds the need to strengthen multilateral export controls, particularly regarding dual-use items and countries of concern like China. The dilemma lies in the lack of consensus on target countries, leading to the question of whether the US should impose controls unilaterally. This decision hinges on balancing non-proliferation goals with potential economic costs and national security risks. The dilemma of U.S. export control policy towards China revolves around balancing economic benefits with national security risks. Some argue that current controls are too stringent, hindering technology transfers to China and causing U.S. firms to lose out on market opportunities. The U.S. export control policy towards China is a dilemma, balancing economic benefits with national security risks. Concerns have been raised about China's dual-use technology acquisitions, evading export controls to obtain missile and satellite technology. Tightened controls and greater enforcement are deemed necessary. China has also been implicated in nuclear, missile, and chemical proliferation activities. On June 19, 2007, BIS published a final rule on export controls for China. The final rule on export controls for China includes a new licensing requirement for certain products for military end-use, a validated end-user program, and a requirement for an end-user statement for certain licensed products. The concern driving the proposed rule is that the export of commercial technology to certain end-users in China undermines the arms embargo. The new licensing policy includes new military end-use controls and a revised License Review Policy for national security controlled items destined for China. The final rule on export controls for China introduces a new licensing requirement for certain products for military end-use, with a focus on items that may contribute to China's military capabilities. This rule also includes a revised licensing policy for national security controlled items destined for China. The Final Rule on export controls for China introduces a new licensing requirement for products that may enhance China's military capabilities. It also increases the exemption threshold for obtaining End-Use Statements from the Ministry of Foreign Commerce of the PRC. The Value Exporter Unit (VEU) is another component of the rule, establishing a method for trusted PRC civilian entities. The Value Exporter Unit (VEU) is the third component of the China Rule, allowing trusted PRC civilian end-users to receive items without a license if approved by BIS. The approval process includes evaluating the entity's compliance record, capability to comply with VEU requirements, and relationship with U.S. and foreign companies. China's MoFCom announced that companies seeking VEU status need authorization for plant or records inspections. The Value Exporter Unit (VEU) allows trusted PRC civilian end-users to receive items without a license if approved by BIS. Not all items on the CCL are eligible for export under this program. Items controlled for crime control or missile technology by the EAR do not qualify for export under this program. The approved VEU application will be accompanied by a list of items that can be exported to the end-user. The VEU can import approved items from any exporter, not just the nominee. The proposal aims to streamline licensing for certain companies and free up resources for more problematic license applications. On October 2, 2007, BIS expanded the VEU program to India, with General Electric India being the first eligible company. The first five VEU companies were announced on October 19, 2007, including Applied Materials China, National Semiconductor, Boeing Hexcel AVIC I Joint Venture, SMIC, and HHNEC. These companies imported goods worth $54.3 million in 2006. In January 2008, the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control raised concerns about AVIC I and HHNEC's ties to Chinese military and U.S. export control violations. The VEU program expanded to India in 2007, with General Electric India being the first eligible company. Controversy surrounds the VEU program, with concerns raised about companies violating U.S. proliferation sanctions and export control laws. The GAO recommended suspending the VEU program with China due to issues with on-site inspections and candidate selection criteria. Commerce conducted checks under the 2004 end-use verification understanding (EUVU) but requires an MoFCom end-use statement for inspections. BIS fully implemented the VEU program with China in 2009. Concerns were raised about Aviza Technology China sharing an address with a sanctioned firm. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) regulates dual-use exports, consulting with other agencies for input. The Department of Defense conducts national security reviews for license applications, while the Department of Energy reviews dual-use license applications for nuclear uses. The Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC) at the State Department administers the International Traffic in Arms Regulations for weapons and military technology exports. The DDTC controls the export of weapons and military technology through the U.S. Munitions List. Industry leaders highlight issues with the licensing system, including overlapping jurisdiction, lengthy approval times, lack of technological updates, and absence of judicial review. Foreign availability and economic impact are considered important but secondary to national security by some. Export administration officials claim to conduct thorough and fair license reviews. Export administration officials claim to conduct thorough, fair, and expeditious license reviews, checking proposed export items against controlled lists and investigating issues on a case-by-case basis to prevent sensitive technologies from falling into the wrong hands. Some analysts question whether the Department of Commerce, which houses the BIS, is biased towards granting export licenses over national security goals. Some analysts argue that bias towards granting export licenses over national security goals is unlikely due to the Department of Defense's participation in the current structure."
