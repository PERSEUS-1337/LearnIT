    "content": "Copyright is the exclusive right to reproduce, distribute, perform, display, and exploit an original work of authorship. Registration with the U.S. Copyright Office offers advantages, such as the ability to file infringement suits and potentially receive statutory damages and attorney's fees. The 2001 Supreme Court case New York Times Co. v. Tasini involved litigation over the exclusive rights of freelance authors. In the court case New York Times Co. v. Tasini, freelance authors sued publishers for licensing their articles to electronic databases without specific authorization. The Supreme Court ruled that publishers cannot reproduce freelance works electronically without a separate license from the author, leading to many works being removed from electronic databases. In the aftermath of Tasini, freelance works were removed from electronic databases. Three class action infringement suits were activated and consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, along with a fourth coordinated action. Reed Elsevier v. Muchnick is a class action lawsuit where named plaintiffs sue on behalf of a larger group with similar claims. Litigation can only proceed after the court certifies the class. The Reed Elsevier class action lawsuit involves individual authors and trade groups suing publishers for copyright infringement. The plaintiffs claim their works were reproduced in electronic databases without consent. The court must certify the class before litigation can proceed. After mediation, parties in the Reed Elsevier class action lawsuit reached a settlement in 2005. The agreement categorized claims into three groups for compensation: Category A for statutory damages and attorney's fees, Category B for actual damages, and Category C for unregistered copyrights. Each category had a specific damages formula, with claimants receiving either a flat fee or a percentage of the original price of the work. The settlement in the Reed Elsevier class action lawsuit categorized claims into three groups for compensation: Category A for statutory damages and attorney's fees, Category B for actual damages, and Category C for unregistered copyrights. Claimants in Category C received a flat fee or a percentage of the original price of the work, but their payment could be reduced if total claims exceeded $18 million. Plaintiffs agreed to release all claims against the defendants in exchange for compensation. Objectors criticized the settlement as unfair to Category C claimants. The settlement in the Reed Elsevier class action lawsuit categorized claims into three groups for compensation: Category A for statutory damages and attorney's fees, Category B for actual damages, and Category C for unregistered copyrights. Objectors criticized the disparate treatment of Category C claimants, arguing that the named plaintiffs did not adequately represent those with unregistered copyrights. Despite objections, the district court granted final class certification and settlement approval in September 2005. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals raised concerns about jurisdiction before hearing oral arguments. The Second Circuit Court raised jurisdictional questions regarding claims concerning unregistered copyrights in a class action lawsuit. Both plaintiffs and defendants argued that the Copyright Act's registration requirement is not jurisdictional, but the court disagreed, stating that federal courts have limited jurisdiction over such claims. The appellate court held that federal courts have limited jurisdiction over claims concerning unregistered copyrights, citing \u00a7411(a) of the Copyright Act. This decision was based on previous cases and distinguished from a Supreme Court ruling. In Eberhart v. United States, the Second Circuit ruled that copyright registration is a jurisdictional requirement for an infringement suit. The court found that unregistered copyrights prevented class certification and settlement approval, with Judge Walker dissenting on the need for re-evaluation of this requirement. The Second Circuit ruled that copyright registration is a jurisdictional requirement for an infringement suit, leading to a re-evaluation of the requirement. The U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari to review whether 17 U.S.C. \u00a7411(a) restricts federal court jurisdiction over copyright infringement actions. The U.S. Supreme Court is reviewing whether 17 U.S.C. \u00a7411(a) restricts federal court jurisdiction over copyright infringement actions. If registration is refused, the applicant can still sue for infringement by serving notice on the Register of Copyrights. Petitioners argue that registration is a mandatory prerequisite, not a jurisdictional restriction. Petitioners argue that Congress did not intend the registration requirement in 17 U.S.C. \u00a7411(a) to be jurisdictional. They claim that the Second Circuit's interpretation would hinder parties from settling disputes involving unregistered works. Respondents argue that \u00a7411(a) is a claim-processing rule, not a jurisdictional bar, and can be waived by defendants. They also claim that even without original jurisdiction, the district court had supplemental jurisdiction over the case. The United States, as amicus curiae, supports vacatur of the Second Circuit's judgment, stating that \u00a7411(a) does not limit jurisdiction. The U.S. argued that \u00a7411(a) is a mandatory prerequisite to suit but should not be strictly enforced at the court of appeals level to avoid wasting judicial resources. Both petitioners and respondents want the Supreme Court to overturn the Second Circuit's ruling, creating a situation where no party is arguing for affirming the judgment below. The Court appointed Professor Deborah Jones Merritt as amicus curiae to support the Second Circuit's judgment on the interpretation of \u00a7411(a) as jurisdictional. She argued that \u00a7411(a) serves public purposes and should not be waived by the parties due to the integrity of the judicial process. Professor Merritt defended the fairness of the settlement in district court, arguing that the registration requirement protects Internet service providers from excessive copyright claims. The Computer and Communications Industry Association supported the Second Circuit's judgment, emphasizing the importance of the registration requirement in reducing technology companies' copyright exposure. The Computer and Communications Industry Association (CCIA) supported the Second Circuit's judgment, stating that the registration requirement reduces technology companies' copyright exposure. CCIA argued that the Supreme Court should dismiss the petitioners' writ in Reed Elsevier case due to lack of case or controversy and absence of a circuit split on \u00a7411(a) jurisdiction. The Supreme Court unanimously reversed the Second Circuit's judgment on March 2, 2010. The Supreme Court ruled that the Copyright Act's registration requirement is not a limit on federal court jurisdiction for copyright infringement claims involving unregistered works. The district court had the authority to certify the class and approve the settlement between freelance authors, publishers, and electronic databases. The Court clarified that subject-matter jurisdiction pertains to the court's power to adjudicate a case, not the rights or obligations of parties. The Supreme Court clarified that the Copyright Act's registration requirement is not a jurisdictional limit for copyright infringement claims. It distinguished between true jurisdictional conditions and nonjurisdictional claim-processing rules, citing the Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp. decision. In cases where Congress does not designate a statutory limitation as jurisdictional, courts should treat it as nonjurisdictional. This principle was applied in Arbaugh, a Title VII sexual harassment case where the definition of \"employer\" was limited to those with 15 or more employees. The Arbaugh Court clarified that the employee numerosity requirement in Title VII is not a jurisdictional limit, as it did not clearly state so and was separate from the jurisdiction-granting section. This precedent was found to be controlling in the Reed Elsevier case regarding the registration requirement in the Copyright Act. The Court rejected the argument that the registration requirement in \u00a7411(a) of the Copyright Act is jurisdictional, emphasizing that the presence of the word \"jurisdiction\" does not indicate Congress' intent. The Court clarified that the reference to \"jurisdiction\" was meant to establish federal court authority over the issue of registrability, regardless of the Register's involvement in the infringement suit. Additionally, the Court noted that \u00a7411(a) is located in Title 17 of the U.S. Code, separate from provisions in Title 28 that grant jurisdiction over copyright infringement actions. The Court clarified that the registration requirement in \u00a7411(a) of the Copyright Act is not jurisdictional, citing exceptions to the registration rule. It emphasized that the word \"jurisdiction\" in the statute does not indicate Congress' intent, and highlighted that federal court authority over registrability is separate from the Register's involvement in infringement suits. The Reed Elsevier Court distinguished its 2007 decision in Bowles v. Russell regarding statutory prerequisites for initiating a lawsuit. The Bowles case considered a statutory provision for filing a notice of appeal within 30 days, treated as jurisdictional. The Reed Elsevier Court emphasized the relevance of context in interpreting similar provisions historically. The Court's interpretation of \u00a7411(a)'s registration requirement does not consider it jurisdictional, likening it to the Arbaugh employee numerosity requirement rather than the Bowles statutory time limit. The Court rejected arguments to construe it as jurisdictional for policy goals and declined to affirm on estoppel grounds. The Supreme Court rejected the argument that \u00a7411(a) was jurisdictional, following existing precedent in the Second Circuit. The Court did not adopt petitioners' interpretation of \u00a7411(a) as jurisdictional in approving the settlement. The Second Circuit also rejected the argument that \u00a7411(a) restricted the district court's subject-matter jurisdiction. The Supreme Court did not express an opinion on the fairness, reasonableness, or adequacy of the settlement. The court of appeals will consider the merits and objections of the settlement. The Supreme Court did not decide if \u00a7411(a) is a mandatory precondition for copyright infringement claims involving unregistered works. Justice Ginsburg concurred that \u00a7411(a) should be a precondition for filing a claim without restricting federal court jurisdiction, but noted a tension between previous rulings. In a unanimous decision, the Arbaugh Court established a clear rule that statutory conditions are only jurisdictional if Congress explicitly states so. However, the Bowles Court later found the time limit for filing a notice of appeal to be jurisdictional based on long-standing Supreme Court precedents. Justice Ginsburg suggested that Bowles relied on unchanged Supreme Court decisions, while Arbaugh's bright line rule supports the view that \u00a7411(a) is nonjurisdictional. Justice Ginsburg argued that Bowles does not apply to the Copyright Act's registration requirement, as the opinions characterizing \u00a7411(a) as jurisdictional are from lower courts and not the Supreme Court. The Reed Elsevier case is remanded to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to consider the settlement's merits and objections. If upheld, freelance authors will receive compensation and databases can restore publications. The appellate court may focus on objections to the damages formula, as suggested by Judge Walker's dissent. Judge Walker's dissent in the Second Circuit's ruling highlights the failure to create a sub-class for \"C-class\" claims, leading to potential favoritism towards \"A-class\" and \"B-class\" claim holders. This could result in C-class claim holders receiving little or no payment. The Reed Elsevier case has implications for future copyright infringement cases, suggesting that unregistered copyright holders may still participate in settlements. The Reed Elsevier case clarifies that unregistered copyright holders can still be involved in copyright infringement settlements and class action lawsuits. District courts may dismiss claims for unregistered works, but federal courts can approve settlements for both registered and unregistered works. The case also addresses subject-matter jurisdiction in federal courts, reaffirming the clear statement rule for statutory limitations."
