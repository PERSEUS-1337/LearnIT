    "content": "The Act titled \"Safety, Accountability, and Funding Efficiency for Transportation Act of 2007\" emphasizes the importance of conducting cost-benefit analysis before procuring transportation services from private contractors to ensure quality and cost-effectiveness. The Act defines \"architectural, engineering, and related services\" as various services related to construction projects. It also defines \"private contract\" as an agreement between a government agency and a private contractor, and \"government agency\" as any entity receiving Federal funds for transportation projects. The term \"surface transportation project\" refers to projects eligible for assistance under title 23, United States Code, and other related projects as determined by the Secretary of Transportation. SEC. 4. COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS. For fiscal year 2009 and beyond, Federal funds for surface transportation projects can be used by government agencies for private contracts over $100,000 for architectural, engineering, and related services, if a cost-benefit analysis is conducted. The analysis must include a description of services and cost estimates. The cost analysis for private contracts over $100,000 for architectural, engineering, and related services includes estimating government agency costs for negotiation, inspection, and supervision, as well as determining if services could be performed more efficiently by the government agency. The cost analysis for private contracts over $100,000 includes estimating equipment and materials costs, unemployment compensation for displaced employees, and the cost of resuming service by the government agency. SEC. 5. DISCLOSURE OF RESULTS OF COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS.\n\nGovernment agencies must disclose the results of cost-benefit analyses for private contracts deemed in the public interest. Results must be submitted to the Secretary for review, provided to registered individuals or entities, and made available for public inspection, including online publication.\n\nSEC. 6. COMMENTS. SEC. 6. COMMENTS.\n\nWithin 15 days of a government agency publishing the results of a cost-benefit analysis for a private contract, employees and interested parties can submit written comments disputing the accuracy of the results. Additionally, agency employees can submit competitive bids to provide the services outlined in the contract. The Secretary may waive the application of this Act for private contracts at the request of a government agency if the work is of an emergency, specialty, or intermittent nature and cannot be performed by government employees to avoid underutilization."
