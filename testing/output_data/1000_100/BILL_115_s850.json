    "content": "The \"Foreign Medical School Accountability Fairness Act of 2017\" aims to establish consistent eligibility requirements for graduate medical schools outside the US and Canada to increase accountability and protect American students and taxpayer dollars. Congress finds that three for-profit Caribbean medical schools receive the majority of Federal funding under title IV of the Higher Education Act, despite being exempt from meeting the same eligibility requirements as other foreign medical schools. Recommendations have been made for all foreign medical schools to meet consistent eligibility requirements for Federal funding. The attrition rate at US medical schools was 3.4% in 2014, while for-profit Caribbean medical schools can reach 30%. In 2016, residency match rates for foreign trained graduates were 54% compared to 94% for US graduates. Students at for-profit medical schools outside the US and Canada accumulate more debt than those in the US. SEC. 4. REPEAL GRANDFATHER PROVISIONS. Section 102(a)(2) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to require that at least 60 percent of enrolled and graduating students at a foreign medical school are not described in section 484(a)(5) in the year prior to seeking a loan under part D of title IV. The Higher Education Act of 1965 now requires that 75 percent of students or graduates from foreign medical schools pass exams administered by the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates in the year before seeking a loan under part D of title IV. The authority of a graduate medical school to qualify for loan programs under part D of title IV will expire on the first July 1 following the date of enactment of the Foreign Medical School Accountability Fairness Act of 2017. If a graduate medical school loses eligibility for loan programs under part D of title IV due to certain amendments, enrolled students can still receive loans if they meet academic progress requirements until they withdraw, complete their program, or the fourth June 30 after the loss of eligibility."
