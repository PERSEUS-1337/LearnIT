The Corps develops, operates, and maintains infrastructure such as navigation channels, harbors, locks, and dams. Maintenance and construction costs are funded by the Corps and the commercial user industry through user fees. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers manages inland waterways in 38 states, with costs funded by the Corps and commercial user industry. Congress is considering future financing for inland waterway investments, as the current revenue source is insufficient, leading to federal taxpayers covering a significant portion of costs. This shortfall limits new construction projects unless changes are made. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers manages inland waterways in 38 states, with costs funded by the Corps and commercial user industry. Recent proposals highlight issues with inland waterways financing, including the use of fuel tax and lock usage fees. Inland waterways have been used for commercial transport since before the nation's founding, with development initially left to states until federal authority was established in the early 1800s. The United States gained authority over interstate commerce in 1824, leading to federal funding for waterways to support commerce. While rail and highway improvements have reduced reliance on inland waterways for freight transportation, they still play a significant role in the transportation mix, accounting for 4%-5% of total commercial tonnage. In some regions, inland waterways are crucial for moving bulk goods over long distances, making them an important transportation route alongside freight rail. Inland waterways, along with freight rail, are vital for transporting the nation's grain, oilseed exports, coal, petroleum, chemicals, and other bulk products. Despite projections for increased traffic, actual inland waterway traffic has remained relatively flat over the past 20 years. Overall freight tonnage is expected to double in the next 25 years, with inland waterway traffic projected to increase at a slower rate compared to rail and highway shipping. The federal government invests in inland waterways due to their value to the nation, with investments dating back to the early 1800s. Legislation in the 1970s and 1980s introduced user cost-sharing requirements for some of the costs associated with the system. The Inland Waterways Revenue Act of 1978 and the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 established a fuel tax on commercial barges, cost-share requirements for inland waterway projects, and a trust fund to hold revenues for investments in construction. These laws shifted financial and decision-making responsibility to commercial operators on the inland waterway system. The Inland Waterways Revenue Act of 1978 established a fuel tax on commercial barge traffic, creating the Inland Waterways Trust Fund. The act was later supplemented by WRDA 1986, which increased the fuel tax to $0.20 per gallon by 1994 and implemented a cost-sharing process for waterway construction projects. Under WRDA 1986, inland waterway construction projects are funded on a 50/50 basis, with 50% from the IWTF and 50% from the Treasury's GR fund. O&M costs are 100% federal responsibility. Expenditures from the IWTF for construction projects require authorization from Congress and annual appropriations. WRDA 1986 authorized initial projects, with subsequent acts authorizing more. Congress appropriates funds for these projects in annual bills. WRDA 1986 established the Inland Waterways Users Board (IWUB), a federal advisory committee representing shipping interests on inland waterways. The board consists of 11 members and is subject to the Federal Advisory Committees Act. The Inland Waterways Users Board (IWUB) was established by WRDA 1986 to represent shipping interests on inland waterways. The board meets regularly to make recommendations to the Secretary of the Army and Congress on IWTF projects. The IWTF balance varied between 1986 and 2011, with balances increasing from 1992 to 2002. Proposals to increase fees on the user industry and require IWTF funding for operations and maintenance were not enacted by Congress. Appropriations from the IWTF increased significantly starting in FY2005. The IWTF balance fell sharply from 2005 to 2010 due to increasing expenditures exceeding fuel tax collections and interest. Congress implemented \"stopgap\" measures to prevent the balance from falling further, including exempting major rehabilitation projects from cost-sharing requirements and limiting access to the IWTF for projects in FY2009. Over $400 million was allocated for inland waterway projects in construction. Congress provided over $400 million in construction funding for inland waterway projects under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, exempting this funding from IWTF cost-share requirements. Recent measures have limited new contracts requiring IWTF funding since FY2009, stabilizing the trust fund balance. Without changes to IWTF financing, funding for new projects is expected to be limited, with most funding going to the Olmsted Locks and Dam project on the Ohio River. Long-term options and proposals to address the increased project backlog for Corps inland waterways projects are discussed in the \"Inland Waterway Financing Proposals\" section. Concerns have been raised about structural inefficiencies and inequities in the Corps project planning process for inland waterways investments, leading to inefficient project implementation and use of tax dollars. In response, the Corps implemented reforms in FY2006 to improve project delivery processes. The Corps implemented reforms in FY2006 to improve project delivery processes, including risk-based cost estimates and prioritized funding for high-risk projects. However, concerns persist about structural inefficiencies in the planning process, highlighted by cost overruns at the Olmsted Locks and Dam project. The project's estimated cost increased significantly over time, reaching $2.9 billion in FY2014, with completion at 49% as of January 1, 2013. Many advocate for additional structural reforms to enhance planning and oversight of the IWTF. The project to complete the Olmsted Locks and Dam had a resolution enacted on October 16, 2013. The lock components were completed by 2013, with the dam and demolition components expected to finish in 2020 and 2024. Concerns about the solvency of the Inland Waterways Trust Fund (IWTF) led to various proposals by the Bush and Obama Administrations, with a new recommendation to raise revenues for the IWTF. The user industry proposed an increase in fuel tax and federal share for inland waterway investments. The Bush Administration proposed a lock usage fee to replace the fuel tax for inland waterways in 2008. The fee would have phased in charges for commercial barges and tied IWTF balances to this user fee after 2012. In 2008, the Bush Administration proposed a lock usage fee to replace the fuel tax for inland waterways. This fee would adjust based on IWTF balances, with fees increasing when the balance fell below $25 million and decreasing when it rose above $75 million. The House and Senate appropriations committees rejected this approach, citing concerns about the burden it would place on lock users. The Obama Administration also proposed new user fees for inland waterways in its budget requests to Congress. The Obama Administration proposed user fees to replace or supplement the fuel tax for inland waterways in its budget requests. Congress has generally rejected these proposals but agreed to limit revenues instead of finding a long-term financing solution. Recent budgets assumed around $80 million in new revenues from unspecified inland waterway user fees. The Obama Administration proposed a new inland waterway financing structure with a two-tier annual fee for commercial shippers to achieve a revenue target. Shippers would pay an additional fee in addition to the existing fuel tax, with higher fees for vessels using locks. The proposal included more detail than previous budget proposals. The Obama Administration proposed a new inland waterway financing structure with a two-tier annual fee for commercial shippers to achieve a revenue target. The proposed legislation did not specify a fee amount but aimed to generate $1 billion in additional revenues for the IWTF over 10 years. The plan included adding 39 new segments to the inland waterway system, with most segments not expected to bring in significant new revenues. The Inland Waterways Users Board (IWUB) proposed a new financing structure for inland waterways, which was not supported by the Obama Administration. The proposal, known as the IWUB report, has been introduced as legislation in Congress but faced opposition from the Administration. The IWUB report recommended increasing user fees, the federal share of inland waterway costs, overall spending on inland waterways, and IWUB involvement in project planning and construction. The IWUB report recommends increasing user fees, federal share of inland waterway costs, overall spending, and IWUB involvement in project planning and construction. The report proposes raising the inland waterway fuel tax rate by $0.06-$0.09 per gallon, projecting an increase in fuel tax revenues to approximately $112 million annually for the IWTF. Most of the new revenue would be saved for future years to replenish balances. The proposed increase to the fuel tax, as recommended by the IWUB report, would not be indexed for inflation and would shift more of the cost for inland waterway projects to the federal government. This includes increasing federal funding for projects and exempting certain expenses from cost-sharing requirements. Additionally, the report suggests establishing a cap on the use of IWTF funds to prevent construction cost overruns. The IWUB report proposes an increase in federal funding for inland waterways projects, shifting more costs to the federal government and exempting certain expenses from cost-sharing. This would raise the federal share for new projects to approximately 70% over the next 25 years. The report also suggests a significant increase in annual expenditures to approximately $380 million for full funding of investments. The IWUB report proposes a significant increase in federal funding for inland waterways projects to approximately $380 million annually, with federal funding accounting for 74% of the total required investments over the first five years. Funding would primarily come from the GR fund initially, with a gradual shift towards trust fund contributions by 2020. The report recommends increased federal funding for inland waterways projects, with more funding required from the federal government than the IWTF. It suggests reforms to improve cost-effectiveness, including increased involvement of the IWUB in project delivery and oversight of IWTF investments. The IWUB seeks changes in project planning documents funded by the IWTF to prioritize specific projects based on asset condition and system performance improvement. Concerns arise over nonfederal involvement in federal agency studies and potential conflicts of interest. The report does not mandate funding for listed projects, leaving final decisions on funding allocation open. The proposal recommends that the Corps establish selection criteria for inland waterway projects similar to those used in the report. Some groups have suggested shifting costs away from the federal government and increasing user-financed share of inland waterway costs. An analysis by the Congressional Budget Office in the early 1990s highlighted inequalities in spending on certain segments of the inland waterway system. An analysis by the Congressional Budget Office in the early 1990s found that the current uniform tax on the inland waterway system does not cover fixed operational costs, leading to distorted maintenance costs. A user fee structure that recovers true costs is recommended to increase economic efficiency, especially for waterways with low traffic-to-expense ratios. Various entities propose significant increases in inland waterway fees to save federal government costs. A coalition of taxpayer watchdog and environmental NGOs suggested increasing user fees for inland waterway expenditures to save $1 billion over five years. The National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform proposed making inland waterways \"self-funding\" for $500 million in savings over five years. The CBO recommended raising user fees to cover costs, potentially saving $4 billion over a decade. These proposals aim to increase the user share of financing for inland waterways. The 1992 CBO report suggested various forms of user fees to better reflect the cost of operating inland waterways, such as annual licensing fees, congestion pricing, tolls, and lockage fees. Different proposals aim to increase user financing for inland waterways, raising questions for Congress about the level of new investment needed. The Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 made changes to inland waterways financing, including project delivery recommendations, federal responsibility for rehabilitation costs under $20 million, and reduced cost-sharing for the Olmsted Locks and Dam Project. Congress is considering whether to change fuel taxes and cost-share arrangements for inland waterways projects. The Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 made changes to inland waterways financing, including reducing the cost-sharing requirement for the Olmsted Project to 15% from the Inland Waterways Trust Fund (IWTF). Additionally, efforts were authorized to study revenue collection efficiency, potential use of bonds or new fees for IWTF financing, and convening a stakeholder roundtable to evaluate future options for inland waterways. The Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 reduced cost-sharing for the Olmsted Project, allowing more funding for inland waterways construction projects. However, it is believed that these changes may not be enough to finance all necessary upgrades in the long-term. Some propose additional user fees, like the WAVE4 Act, to address the IWTF's long-term solvency. The RIVER Act and H.R. 1149 propose changes to the IWTF cost-sharing, with the federal government taking on 100% of dam construction costs under certain thresholds. Congress faces issues regarding infrastructure investments on federal waterways, with commercial users advocating for increased funding due to aging infrastructure. Some argue for increased investment in inland waterways due to aging infrastructure, expanded capacity needs, and environmental benefits. However, taxpayer and environmental groups oppose increased federal funding, claiming misrepresentation of benefits by the shipping industry. Despite disagreements, most agree that current financing for inland waterways is insufficient for future needs. The Corps of Engineers may have funding for only one lock replacement project (Olmstead Lock on the Ohio River) until at least FY2016. Without new revenue or federal appropriations, other IWTF construction projects could be delayed. Aging infrastructure has led to decreased efficiency in inland waterways, with most locks in the US exceeding their 50-year design age. Lock unavailability has been on the rise, prompting calls for increased investment in inland waterways. In recent years, the user industry has shown a preference for new lock construction over ongoing maintenance. Environmental groups argue against new investments, stating that regular maintenance can extend the life of existing locks for an additional 50 years at a lower cost. They believe that the costs of new lock construction outweigh the benefits and advocate for small-scale improvements instead. The Corps notes that new navigation alternatives depend on traffic forecasts from future trade scenarios, which are difficult to predict due to various variables. Total domestic freight traffic is expected to increase by 70% by 2020, with waterway traffic projected to increase by 2% annually between 2010 and 2035. Shipping interests suggest that improving inland waterway efficiency could reduce anticipated traffic growth. Some groups have criticized industry requests for new lock construction on inland waterways, noting flat or decreasing traffic at certain locks. Previous traffic projections by the Corps have been deemed overly optimistic. Future lock upgrades may increase demand, but the impact would depend on external factors. Shipping interests advocate for increased investment in inland waterways due to their efficiency and environmental benefits compared to other modes of transportation. Studies show that barge shipping is more fuel-efficient and emits fewer greenhouse gases than railroads. Other benefits include reduced highway congestion and noise pollution. However, taxpayer and environmental groups question the basis for new investments in barge transportation. Environmental groups question the accuracy of industry fuel-efficiency calculations for barge shipping, highlighting the need to consider technical factors like circuity. They also raise concerns about the negative impact of inland waterway projects on riparian habitat and species. Increased construction and expansion of inland waterways can have negative environmental effects, such as sedimentation, turbidity, and bank erosion. Congress is considering changes to the system that finances these investments, including proposals like an increase to the fuel tax or new annual fees. The IWUB argues for an increase in the fuel tax to rebuild the trust fund balance and fund new investments. Some groups oppose the proposal due to increased federal cost share responsibilities. The Obama Administration proposed new fees in 2011 to address inadequate revenues from commercial users on the inland waterway system. The Administration proposes new fees for utilizing the inland waterway system, including fuel taxes and fees for non-lock users. Lock users would pay a higher fee in addition to the fuel tax. The proposal aims to add new waterway segments to the fuel-taxed list to increase revenue. The IWUB and Congress have opposed the proposal, arguing that it unfairly targets specific users and goes against the interconnected nature of the waterway system. The user industry opposes major fee increases for utilizing the inland waterway system, arguing that it delegates fee-setting authority to the Secretary of the Army. Various revenue-raising options have been considered, such as lock usage fees, annual licensing fees, tolls, ton-mile charges, and lock charges for congested areas. The concept of \"capital recovery\" for raising revenues on inland waterways involves user fees adjusting to recover government investments, potentially reducing future trust fund shortfalls and focusing on vital projects. This concept is included in the Obama Administration proposal, linking user fees to trust fund balances after FY2022. Users have raised concerns about tying user fees to trust fund balances after FY2022, citing difficulties in planning for constantly changing taxes and the potential for cost increases. Congress could explore an inflation adjustment to increase revenue reliability for inland waterways, either through a fuel tax increase or a new lockage fee. Some argue that this adjustment could lead to hidden tax increases in the future. If a long-term solution is not implemented to address the revenue shortfall, Congress may face challenges in the future. If no long-term solution is enacted to address the IWTF revenue shortfall, Congress may need to take measures to ensure trust fund solvency. Options include capping IWTF withdrawals at current year fuel tax revenues or putting a temporary hold on new contracts. Congress might also exempt some IWTF investments from cost-sharing requirements, but this would incur additional costs to taxpayers. Congress is also considering if the current cost-share arrangement for inland waterway projects is balanced. The IWUB proposal aims to modify cost-sharing arrangements for inland waterway projects, excluding dams and minor rehabilitation from cost-share requirements and shifting funding to 100% federal funding. This change is justified by the belief that dams should be a federal responsibility due to the widespread benefits they provide to the U.S. population. The IWUB proposes a new $100 million threshold for major lock rehabilitation projects, increasing federally funded maintenance and rehabilitation projects. It also suggests making all cost overruns for IWTF construction projects a 100% federal responsibility, which critics argue will add hidden costs to the federal government. The IWUB report proposes shifting the cost-share arrangement for IWTF construction projects from 50/50 to 68% federal, 32% non-federal, which would increase federal costs for inland waterway projects. Critics argue that the IWTF already receives significant federal support with no cost-sharing requirements, amounting to $500 million-$650 million annually. The Obama Administration's proposals recommend altering user fees for inland waterways, but the cost-share structure between federal and nonfederal expenditures would remain at 50/50. Some argue for shifting cost shares away from the federal government and increasing user responsibility for construction. The IWUB has proposed reforms to increase user responsibility for construction, operations, and maintenance of inland waterways. They suggest waterway users should pay for a portion of these costs, which are currently funded by the general treasury. Congress may consider these proposals as part of cost-cutting efforts. The IWUB also seeks reforms to Corps IWTF planning processes to improve project prioritization and reduce cost overruns. The Corps' previous study identified factors contributing to cost overruns in IWTF projects, including inaccurate construction schedules and costs, general cost escalation, and non-optimal funding. Congressional attention may focus on the Corps' prioritization method for inland waterway projects, as decisions are currently made without formal criteria, raising concerns about conflicts of interest. The IWUB proposes a priority ranking system to alter the current practice of Congress deciding on project-specific authorizations and appropriations for Corps inland waterway projects. If implemented as a regulation, the Corps would use these criteria to select projects for funding, potentially limiting Congress's role to providing project authorizations and overall funding levels. This change could shift the traditional role of Congress in directing Corps projects. The IWUB proposes a priority ranking system to change how Congress decides on funding for Corps inland waterway projects, potentially limiting Congress's role to providing authorizations and overall funding levels. This could shift the traditional role of Congress in directing Corps projects."
