    "content": "The Act titled \"Protecting the Second Amendment and Hunting Rights on Federal Lands Act of 2008\" allows for possessing or carrying firearms and ammunition in units of the National Park System and the National Wildlife Refuge System. Congress finds that the second amendment guarantees the right to bear arms and that firearms are used for self-defense over 2,000,000 times a year in the US. States expanding firearm rights have seen a decrease in crime. Federal regulations currently restrict firearm possession in National Parks and Wildlife Refuges, hindering individuals from exercising their second amendment rights. Federal law should clarify that the second amendment rights of an individual in a unit of the National Park System or the National Wildlife Refuge System will not be infringed, protecting the right to keep and bear firearms and ammunition in these areas. Laws regarding firearms in these units often differ from state laws, causing issues for law-abiding gun owners. No Federal regulation can restrict individuals from possessing or carrying firearms or ammunition in units of the National Park System or the National Wildlife Refuge System. SEC. 3. HUNTING ON FEDERAL LAND. The purpose of this section is to require that hunting activities be included in all Federal land management plans unless clearly incompatible with the land's purposes. The head of the agency must ensure hunting is allowed unless it conflicts with the land's management goals, and reasons for any restrictions must be published in the management plan. The management plan for Federal land must include hunting activities unless incompatible with the land's purposes. Restrictions on hunting must be justified in the plan. Fees for hunting activities on Federal land should only cover management costs. The Act limits fees for hunting activities on Federal land to offset management costs. Definitions for hunting and management plan are provided. The section applies to all management plans developed after the enactment date."
