    "title": "AB 1303",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 65961 of the Government Code in California is amended. Section 65961 of the Government Code in California is amended to state that within five years of final map approval for a residential subdivision, a city or county cannot impose new conditions for building permits beyond those previously approved. The amended Section 65961 of the Government Code in California prohibits cities or counties from imposing new conditions for building permits on a residential subdivision within five years of final map approval. The local agency can impose conditions on building permits for health and safety reasons, to comply with state or federal law, or to ensure compliance with zoning ordinances. The section applies to cities incorporating areas from a tentative or parcel map after January 1, 1985. Conditions imposed by the city refer to what the county could have imposed if there was no incorporation. For extended subdivision maps, the five-year period is reduced to three years. Section 66452.25 allows cities to levy fees or conditions for extended tentative subdivision maps, without prohibiting fees upon building permit issuance. Section 66452.25 of the Government Code allows for a 24-month extension of tentative maps, vesting tentative maps, or parcel maps approved within certain counties between January 1, 2002, and July 11, 2013. Section 66452.25 of the Government Code allows for a 24-month extension of approved tentative maps, vesting tentative maps, or parcel maps within specified counties. The extension can be granted if the map is consistent with zoning and general plan requirements at the time of application, otherwise, an extension may be denied or conditionally approved. An extension for a period of 24 months can be granted for approved tentative maps, vesting tentative maps, or parcel maps in specified counties. If an extension is denied by the advisory agency, the subdivider can appeal to the legislative body within 15 days. In a county, the conditions for this section to apply are: annual mean household income is less than 80% of statewide income, and the annual nonseasonal unemployment rate is at least 2.75% higher than the statewide rate. The population eligible for extended poverty status determination must exceed 4% of the statewide median poverty rate. Any approvals related to a development project on an extended map shall be extended by 24 months. The provisions of Section 65961 regarding conditions for building permits for residential subdivisions are modified for tentative maps extended under this section. No reimbursement is required for this act, and it is deemed an urgency statute for public safety. To address expiring development applications in the construction industry during adverse economic conditions, this act allows cities and counties to extend the processing time immediately."
