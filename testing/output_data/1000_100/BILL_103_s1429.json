    "content": "The Act titled \"Women and AIDS Research Initiative Amendments of 1993\" establishes a program for research on women and AIDS. This includes a new section on research regarding women in the Public Health Service Act. The Secretary will establish a program for biomedical and behavioral research on HIV cases in women, including prevention research. Research will focus on HIV transmission to women, the link with other sexually transmitted diseases, and clinical trials on preventing HIV through treating STDs in women. The program focuses on preventing HIV transmission to women by treating sexually transmitted diseases, developing prevention methods, and disseminating prevention programs to reduce substance abuse among women. The program aims to prevent HIV transmission to women through research on symptoms, treatment, and behavioral prevention methods related to gynecological infections, breast changes, hormonal changes, and menopause. Clinical trials involving women infected with HIV must include gynecological evaluations. The program focuses on preventing HIV transmission to women by researching gynecological infections, breast changes, hormonal changes, and menopause. Clinical trials with HIV-infected women include gynecological evaluations to analyze the relationship between gynecological conditions and HIV infection. The Secretary conducts trials to determine the effectiveness of standard treatments for gynecological conditions. The Secretary conducts clinical trials to determine if treatment protocols approved for men with HIV are effective for women with HIV. Support services such as transportation and child care are provided for women participating in these trials. Services provided for women participating in clinical trials under this title include medical, mental health, drug abuse treatment, social services, and addressing domestic violence. These services are tailored to meet the specific needs of women in clinical trials, including training for trial conductors. Additionally, prevention programs are in place to prevent the sexual transmission of HIV. The Secretary will conduct or support research on barrier methods for preventing sexually transmitted diseases, prioritizing research needs identified at a 1993 meeting on topical microbicides development. This includes research on early infectious stages, new preparations, and preclinical evaluation. The Secretary will conduct or support research on barrier methods for preventing sexually transmitted diseases, prioritizing research needs identified at a 1993 meeting on topical microbicides development. This includes research on early infectious stages, new preparations, preclinical evaluation, clinical testing for safety and efficacy, acceptability, compliance of microbicides, and epidemiological research on factors of risk for HIV infection in women. The Secretary is conducting a study on the relationship between HIV infection and substance abuse, including cocaine use, as well as sexual activity. The Women's Interagency HIV Study aims to monitor HIV progression in women compared to men, with a focus on including at least 5,000 infected women in the study. The Secretary is expanding the study on HIV infection in women, ensuring a minimum 8-year study period and addressing the relationship between CD4 cells and serious illnesses in women with the infection. The study will focus on gynecological and other conditions specific to women not currently included in the CDC's list for surveillance. The Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines the term 'human immunodeficiency virus' and authorizes appropriations for clinical trials for fiscal years 1994-1996. For fiscal years 1994-1996, appropriations are authorized for various subsections including $10,000,000 for subsection (c)(3), $15,000,000 for subsection (c)(4), and $30,000,000 for prevention programs under subsection (d)(1). For fiscal years 1994-1996, appropriations are authorized for subsections (d)(1), (d)(2), and (e) totaling $55,000,000."
