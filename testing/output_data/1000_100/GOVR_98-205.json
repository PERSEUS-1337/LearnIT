    "content": "The House and Senate approved FY1999 defense bills, with additional funding of $8.3 billion for various defense-related purposes. The President signed both bills into law on October 17. The FY1999 defense appropriations bill allocated funds for various defense-related purposes, including fixes in the Defense Department, storm damage repairs, purchasing fissile materials from Russia, antiterrorism activities, and defense counter-drug activities. The bill, signed into law on October 21 (P.L. 105-277), primarily funds military activities of the Department of Defense, weapons procurement, and research and development. Additionally, it provides funding for the Central Intelligence Agency retirement fund and intelligence community management, as well as classified amounts for national foreign intelligence activities. The FY1999 defense appropriations bill allocated funds for various defense-related purposes, including fixes in the Defense Department, storm damage repairs, purchasing fissile materials from Russia, antiterrorism activities, and defense counter-drug activities. The Administration's budget included $270.6 billion for national defense, with $250.8 billion requested in the defense appropriations bill. Congress also acts on a national defense authorization bill annually, addressing defense programs in detail. The debate over defense policy and funding issues mainly occurs during action on the authorization bill. Congress completed action on the annual defense authorization and appropriations bills on October 1. The House and Senate allocated funds for defense programs on May 14 and June 16 respectively, which determine the available funding for defense and other programs. The final Senate allocations for defense subcommittee are slightly below the Administration's request, with $250.290 billion in budget authority and $244.942 billion in outlays. The House allocations provide $250.499 billion in budget authority and $244.965 billion in outlays for the national security subcommittee. The House approved the FY1999 defense authorization bill, H.R. 3616, on May 6. The FY1999 defense authorization bill, H.R. 3616, was approved by the House on May 21. The Senate passed their version of the bill, S. 2057, on June 25. Conferees reached agreement on the authorization bill on September 17, and it was signed into law as P.L. 105-261 on October 17. The House also passed the FY1999 defense appropriations bill, H.R. 4103, on June 24. The Senate passed the FY1999 defense appropriations bill, S. 2132, on July 30, which was later signed into law as P.L. 105-262 on October 17. The House approved H.Con.Res. 284 for the annual congressional budget resolution on June 5, but a conference agreement was never completed. Supplemental defense appropriations for FY1998 were approved for military operations in Bosnia and Southwest Asia, domestic and defense disaster relief, totaling $2.7 billion for the Defense Department. In FY1998, supplemental defense appropriations were approved for military operations in Bosnia and Southwest Asia, domestic and defense disaster relief, totaling $2.7 billion. In FY1999, an omnibus appropriations bill (H.R. 4328) provided additional defense-related funding of $8.3 billion, including allocations for Bosnia operations, military readiness, intelligence, missile defense, year 2000 fixes, storm damage repairs, defense health program, purchase of fissile materials from Russia, defense antiterrorism activities, and defense counter-drug efforts. The omnibus appropriations bill for FY1999 allocated $8.3 billion for defense-related funding, including funds for Bosnia operations, military readiness, intelligence, missile defense, year 2000 fixes, storm damage repairs, defense health program, purchase of fissile materials from Russia, defense antiterrorism activities, and defense counter-drug efforts. The bill also included emergency appropriations for various defense activities and made rescissions of $67 million. The conference agreements on the defense authorization and appropriations bills resolved issues related to relations with China, particularly regarding satellite and missile technology exports. The Senate-passed bill included contentious China-related provisions in the authorization conference. The agreement dropped language banning satellite exports to China but included measures transferring technology export review to the State Department, requiring congressional notification for satellite sales to China, and prohibiting missile equipment exports unless certified not to harm the U.S. space launch industry or enhance China's missile capabilities. The appropriations conference agreement includes measures prohibiting the transfer of port facilities near San Diego to a Chinese shipping company and a prohibition on DOD doing business with Chinese Army-owned companies. It also requires a report on the security situation in the Taiwan Strait and does not approve new rounds of military base closures. The Senate approved an amendment to make it more difficult for the Defense Department to realign military bases without a base closure process. DOD objected but the provision was dropped in the conference agreement. The House bill required separation of men and women in basic training, while the Senate bill prohibited new policies until a commission reports. The Senate endorsed a substitute by Senator Snowe allowing current integrated training practices to continue with additional steps for separate sleeping quarters. The House-Senate conference adopted the Senate language with a \"sense of the House\" statement urging separate training units. The conference agreement included a provision for commanders to display \"exemplary behavior\" as a statement. Both the House and Senate rejected amendments to lift the ban on abortions in military medical facilities. The House-passed bill included a measure on tritium production. The House-passed bill included a measure on tritium production, which would prohibit the DOE from buying tritium from commercial nuclear reactors. The cost of buying tritium from commercial sources over the next forty years is estimated at $3 billion, while building new facilities in South Carolina would cost $10 billion. The Senate version allows DOE to choose the long-term option, but implementation is prohibited for a year for Congress to review the decision. The House also rejected an Administration request to eliminate floors on active duty end-strength levels. The House-passed bill included a measure on tritium production, prohibiting the DOE from buying tritium from commercial nuclear reactors. The Senate version allows DOE to choose the long-term option, but implementation is prohibited for a year for Congress to review the decision. The House also rejected an Administration request to eliminate floors on active duty end-strength levels. The Senate and House versions of the appropriations bill agreed to the Administration's proposed reductions in end-strength levels. The authorization conference report agreed to the Administration's request. The House initially provided a pay raise of 3.6% for military personnel, while the Senate and both House and Senate versions of the appropriations bill initially provided only the requested raise of 3.1%. However, an amendment was approved to increase the pay raise to 3.6%, offset by a reduction in R&D funds. The authorization and appropriations conference agreements ultimately provided a 3.6% raise. The Administration requested $1.9 billion for Bosnia in FY1999 as emergency funding not subject to the cap on defense spending. The Senate approved the funding, while the House did not. The Senate version stipulated the funding as emergency appropriations, while the House capped Bosnia spending at $1.9 billion. Both houses rejected measures to withdraw U.S. troops from Bosnia by a specific date. The authorization conference agreement authorizes $1.9 billion in emergency funding for Bosnia, with the possibility of larger expenditures if certified necessary for national security. The appropriations conference agreement did not include emergency funding but was later provided in a supplemental appropriations measure. Weapons priorities were less contentious this year, with the Administration requesting one C-130J aircraft and objecting to additional funding for 7 more aircraft in the House authorization. The House and Senate authorization and appropriations bills allocated funds for 7 additional aircraft, exceeding the requested amount. Funding for the THAAD system was reduced after a test failure in May, with the authorization conference agreement cutting $294 million and the appropriations conference agreement cutting $376 million. The Senate bills also reduced or eliminated funding for the MEADS system, a cooperative program with allies that the Administration wants to continue. The authorization conference agreement cuts funding for the MEADS system from $44 million to $24 million and requires Defense Department approval for future budget plans. The appropriations conference agreement only provides $10 million. Funding for the Airborne Laser program was reduced while Space-Based Laser R&D received an increase. Both House and Senate appropriations bills also decreased funding for new aircraft carrier development due to the Navy's decision not to pursue a new design. The authorization conference agreement provides $110 million and the appropriations conference agreement provides $105 million of the $190 million requested for developing progressive changes in the current design. Funds were allocated for a new LHD-8 amphibious ship and 30 F-18s, as requested. There were disagreements on the procurement of new F/A-18E/F aircraft and the addition of funds for unrequested F-16 aircraft. The Administration objected to a requirement in the Senate authorization bill regarding testing for the F-22 aircraft before additional procurement contracts are signed. The authorization conference agreement includes restrictions that can be waived, with some cuts in certain programs to finance increases in others. Long-term weapons issues seem to have been resolved, with the battle over B-2 bomber procurement and design competition in the New Attack Submarine program settled. Both House and Senate bills aim to ensure military retirees have access to the defense health care system. The authorization conference agreement includes pilot projects to test alternative approaches for military retirees' access to healthcare, such as joining the Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan (FEHBP) and using TRICARE as a supplement for Medicare. Other key matters discussed in the defense debate included military base closures, Bosnia funding, technology export controls, efficiency measures, and military readiness. The defense debate in Congress for the FY1999 budget was constrained by the 1997 budget agreement, with key issues including military base closures, Bosnia funding, technology export controls, efficiency measures, military readiness, and various social issues. The Administration's request for FY1999 defense spending was at the agreed level of $270.5 billion, leading to discussions on major weapons programs, military personnel levels, National Guard funding, and other defense-related matters. The defense debate in Congress for the FY1999 budget involved a \"zero-sum game\" where any additional funds added for favored programs had to be offset by reductions in other defense programs. Congress ultimately provided an extra $8.3 billion for defense programs in the omnibus appropriations bill. This budget constraint could have led to a confrontation between Congress and the Administration over defense priorities. Senior Administration officials tried to avoid conflicts by compromising with Congress on ongoing programs of interest. They fully funded national missile defense development, increased funding for National Guard and Reserve equipment, covered all defense health program costs, and accelerated funding for the next Nimitz-class aircraft carrier. The House and Senate did not engage in a contentious debate over defense budget priorities in the FY1999 bills, with only small amounts allocated for unrequested weapons programs. The FY1999 defense budget priorities were influenced by the Quadrennial Defense Review, Defense Reform Initiative report, and National Defense Panel report. The QDR reassessed U.S. defense policy, the DRI report identified efficiency measures, and the NDP report focused on future defense requirements. These reports will continue to shape congressional discussions. The Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) proposed a revised U.S. defense strategy, emphasized the need for efficiency to save money for weapons modernization, and endorsed military base closures. The National Defense Panel report supported the QDR's focus on shaping the international security environment but called for greater emphasis on homeland defense. The National Defense Panel recommended a shift in focus towards homeland defense and preparing for future threats, calling for increased spending on experimental force exercises and new technology. It also supported two more rounds of military base closures to save money for defense modernization programs. Congress was not initially receptive to the proposal, but Secretary Cohen pushed for approval of two new base closure rounds in 2001 and 2005. The Defense Department released a report on base closures, reaffirming previous estimates of annual savings. Two future base closure rounds are projected to save $2.8 billion each. Resistance in Congress stems from objections to actions following the 1995 base closure round. The 1995 Base Closure Commission recommended closing two Air Force maintenance facilities in California and Texas, but the White House opted for privatization instead. This decision sparked controversy in Congress over politicizing the base closure process. Lawmakers criticized an Air Force memo discussing a White House request for the Defense Department to encourage a private company to bid on a contract for work at the Sacramento facility. Secretary Cohen faced complaints in congressional hearings about privatization eroding support for base closures. Cohen suggested Congress could prohibit privatization in future base closure legislation and advocated for more base closures to be approved in preparation for the long-term defense plan. Congressional action did not agree to additional military base closures in the FY1999 defense authorization. In a critical measure of support for base closures, the Senate voted down a proposal for another base closure round in 2001. An amendment by Senator Inhofe aimed to make it harder for DOD to realign facilities without a congressionally established base closure process. However, Senator Inhofe predicted that Congress would approve another base closure round for 2001. The amendment was ultimately dropped by the authorization conference. Additionally, the Administration requested about $1.8 billion in supplemental appropriations for military operations in Bosnia. The Administration requested about $1.8 billion in supplemental appropriations for military operations in Bosnia and an additional $1.9 billion for extending the mission through FY1999. Congress provided funding in H.R. 3579 for FY1998 and in the omnibus appropriations bill (H.R. 4328) for FY1999. The Administration sought to designate the funding as \"emergency\" to avoid cuts in other defense spending. The Administration requested $1.8 billion for military operations in Bosnia and an additional $1.9 billion for FY1999. Congress approved the funding in H.R. 3579 for FY1998 and H.R. 4328 for FY1999. The Administration argued for the funding to be designated as \"emergency\" to avoid cuts in other defense spending. Congress approved $1.9 billion for Bosnia in FY1999 in addition to the regular defense funding. In FY1999, Congress approved $1.9 billion for Bosnia as emergency appropriations, in addition to regular defense funding. The House rejected a motion to cut off funds for Bosnia operations without prior approval. The Senate approved an amendment urging the President to reduce U.S. troop presence. The Senate rejected an amendment to cut off funds for Bosnia operations without prior approval but added $1.9 billion as emergency appropriations. The House included a provision to prohibit expenditures on offensive military action without advance congressional approval. The White House threatened a veto if the provision were passed. The authorization conference agreement approves $1.9 billion in emergency funding for Bosnia, contingent on presidential certification for national security. The appropriations conference agreement does not include emergency funding for Bosnia, leaving the issue for later consideration. The Skaggs amendment was dropped. Requested emergency funding for Bosnia was provided in the FY1999 Omnibus appropriations bill. Congressional focus shifted to relations with China and technology export controls. In the wake of allegations that LoralSpace Corporation assisted China in missile technology, Congress approved amendments to restrict technology exports to China and other countries. The White House objected to these measures, including limiting missile and satellite technology exports and transferring export review responsibility to the State Department. The House-passed bill also included provisions to prohibit certain exports. The House-passed bill included provisions to prohibit the transfer of facilities at Long Beach naval shipyard to a Chinese shipping company. Several amendments related to technology exports to China and trade sanctions were proposed in the Senate. Senator Hutchinson's China-related amendments were rejected, leading to a delay in the debate on China policy. Senator Stevens postponed floor action on the defense appropriations bill due to concerns about contentious amendments. Ultimately, the Senate addressed various China-related issues, with Senator Hutchinson offering a revised amendment on the defense appropriations bill. The revised amendment on the defense appropriations bill requires the State Department to deny visas to foreign officials involved in forced abortions, sterilization, or genital mutilation. The authorization conference agreement includes provisions regarding technology exports to China, such as transferring review authority to the State Department, requiring congressional notification for satellite sales, and prohibiting missile equipment exports unless certain conditions are met. The conference agreement includes a ban on transferring port facilities to COSCO and efficiency measures such as reducing staff in the Office of the Secretary of Defense and pursuing public-private competitions for activities carried out by civilian DOD employees. Congress has pressured the Defense Department to reduce overhead activities while imposing barriers. The Defense Department faced challenges in reducing overhead personnel levels, with Congress debating cuts in acquisition and headquarters staff. The House pushed for deep cuts in acquisition personnel, while resisting privatization measures for weapons maintenance. Congressional action urged the Defense Department to not waive mandated cuts in acquisition personnel. The House Armed Services Committee (HNSC) criticized the Defense Department for not complying with personnel cuts mandated in the previous year's defense authorization act. HNSC imposed a $500 million across-the-board cut in funding for consultants as a reform measure. The White House objected to the cut in consulting funds and other measures in the House-passed authorization bill. The authorization conference agreement includes withholding 10% of funds for the Office of the Secretary of Defense unless DOD meets all statutory requirements to cut headquarters staff and provide mandated reports to Congress, cutting 25,000 acquisition personnel, reducing consultant funding by $240 million, and decreasing the number of Assistant Secretary of Defense positions from 10 to 9. Military readiness is also a key focus. The House Armed Services Committee imposed cuts in funding for consultants and personnel in the Defense Department. Military readiness has been a major concern, with reports of various problems in Air Force, Army, and Navy personnel and equipment. Some believe this signals an imminent crisis due to inadequate funding and excessive overseas missions. Administration officials acknowledge some issues but deny an overall readiness crisis. Overall, there is no crisis in readiness currently or in the near future. Early deploying units are fully ready, while some later deploying units may take longer to prepare. Issues such as Air Force engine spares shortage and pilot retention are being addressed, with efforts to resolve them underway. Army recruiting continues to meet quality goals. Officials in the military have raised concerns about recruitment and retention issues, urging higher defense spending. The Joint Chiefs testified about the need for over $17 billion annually in additional defense funding, with potential shortfalls of up to $135 billion over five years. Congressional actions included restructuring funding for maintenance and implementing changes in readiness reporting, which the DOD finds challenging and costly. The Senate approved amendments on the defense appropriations bill, requiring reports on food stamp use by military families and addressing readiness erosion due to budget cuts and expanded missions. The authorization conference agreement includes improved readiness reporting, increased funding for recruiting and troop benefits, and emphasizes quality of life measures like day care centers and housing. The FY1999 omnibus appropriations bill allocates $1.3 billion for enhanced military readiness. The FY1999 omnibus appropriations bill includes $1.3 billion for enhanced military readiness and addresses concerns about long-term weapons modernization programs. Funding for defense modernization has been a priority, leading to reallocation of procurement funds to readiness-related accounts. The requested procurement funding for FY1999 is close to last year's planned level, with some decline due to adjustments in weapons programs. The Administration aims to increase procurement funding to $60 billion per year by FY2001, relying on efficiency savings and base closures. However, achieving this goal without raising overall defense spending is challenging due to historical budget trends and potential obstacles like maintenance costs and unplanned expenses. The $60 billion procurement target is becoming harder to reach due to various expenses such as weapons maintenance costs, unplanned requirements, and health care cost growth. Congressional actions do not include substantial increases in modernization funding, with only $1 billion allocated for BMD programs in the omnibus appropriations bill. The QDR mandates reductions in military personnel end-strength levels, with 37,000 active duty personnel and 55,000 reserve positions to be cut by 2003. There is resistance in Congress to proposed personnel cuts. There is vocal resistance in Congress to proposed personnel cuts, particularly in the Army due to existing shortages in certain skills. Congress must agree to reduce or eliminate statutory floors on active duty personnel levels to carry out the QDR reductions, but some Members of Congress are against this. The Administration requested a reduction in active duty end-strength by over 35,000 from the authorized FY1998 level. HNSC rejected the request to repeal statutory floors on end-strength and reduced authorized end-strength by 11,000 positions less than requested. SASC approved the end-strength reductions and repeal of statutory floors. The House and Senate versions of the defense appropriations bill assumed the cuts in end-strength in FY1999. The authorization conference report agreed to the Administration's request. The dispute between the active Army and the Army National Guard over the role of ARNG combat units has escalated. The Guard feels they are not given appropriate roles in war plans, leading to Congress appointing special advisors and increased funding for Guard and reserve weapons procurement. The Army Chief of Staff is working to resolve the ongoing dispute, while Congress consistently adds money for Guard and reserve weapons programs to the budget. Congress has added substantial amounts for equipment earmarked for National Guard and Reserve forces, including major weapons programs such as Missile defense. The Administration increased funding for NMD programs, with unresolved policy disputes remaining. The Administration is pursuing NMD technology development while deferring deployment decisions. Congress advocates for early nationwide defense deployment due to threats, questioning the relevance of the ABM Treaty. Disputes over TMD systems like THAAD, Navy Theater-Wide, and MEADS persist. THAAD development is delayed due to test failures, and procurement of the Navy system is postponed for affordability reasons. MEADS is a cooperative program with European allies for an improved air/missile defense system. Congressional action has included provisions for a nationwide defense, but separate legislation has been considered. The Senate Armed Services Committee reported a bill calling for nationwide defense deployment, but cloture was not invoked. Congress has also acted on TMD programs earlier in the year. On March 30, the House approved additional funding for selected TMD programs in FY1998. The House-passed FY1999 authorization included more money for Navy Area Defense and other TMD systems. The Senate approved a $253.9 million cut to the THAAD program due to test failures and delays in engineering development. The House approved restructuring the THAAD program, adding a second contractor and shifting funds. MEADS funding was cut, and alternatives were studied. SASC criticized the ABL program and increased funding for Space-Based Laser R&D. The Senate appropriations bill cut funding for ABL and added funds for boost phase intercept technology. The congressional defense committees have endorsed accelerated development of the Navy Theater Wide TMD system as an alternative to THAAD. Budget additions range from $70 million to $150 million. Funding for THAAD, MEADS, Space Based Laser, and Airborne Laser programs has been cut in various amounts. The FY1999 omnibus appropriations bill includes an additional $1 billion for missile defense with no specific allocation. Members of Congress have also discussed the restructuring of the B-2 bomber program. The B-2 bomber procurement battle seems to be coming to an end as no additional funds are being allocated for more bombers. Instead, there is a focus on upgrades for existing B-2s. Three new fighter aircraft programs are in development: the Navy F/A-18E/F, the Air Force F-22, and the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF). DOD requested funding for F/A-18E/F aircraft, F-22 development, and JSF R&D in FY1999. The QDR decided to continue all programs with reductions. Some Members of Congress believe DOD cannot afford all three programs. Congressional action included reducing F/A-18E/F procurement to 27 aircraft. SASC required F-22 to complete 10% of flight tests before next procurement funding. Cost of F-22 a major concern in the Senate. The Senate rejected a Bumpers amendment for 601 hours of flight testing before the next round of procurement. Authorization and appropriations conferences approved funds for 30 F-18s. Congress has added funds to shipbuilding programs to avoid production gaps and ensure shipyards have enough work. An issue concerns the procurement of the CVN-77 aircraft carrier. The Navy has moved up procurement of the CVN-77 aircraft carrier to the FY2001 budget, avoiding a big bill in FY1999 and FY2000. The shipbuilder, Newport News Shipbuilding, had proposed an accelerated funding plan called \"Smart Buy\" to save the Navy $600 million, but the new DOD plan will not save as much. Another issue is the development of the next generation DD-21 destroyer by Ingalls Shipbuilding Company and Bath Iron Works. The Navy has reached agreements with shipbuilders and combat system integrators to form teams to pursue competition in combat systems and design. They have abandoned plans for a new-design aircraft carrier and will focus on incremental improvements to the next three Nimitz-class carriers. Congressional approval has been given for the Administration's shipbuilding program, including funding for a new attack submarine. This marks the end of a debate over competition between shipbuilders. The Navy has decided not to pursue a new-design aircraft carrier and will focus on incremental improvements to existing carriers. Congressional approval has been given for the Administration's shipbuilding program, including funding for a new attack submarine. The key issue now is how money for carrier research and development will be allocated. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended a $130 million reduction in funding for CVX R&D and a $50 million increase for CVN-77. The House Appropriations bill cut funding for the CVX by $100 million. The authorization conference agreement provides $110 million for CVX R&D, while the appropriations conference agreement provides $105 million. Additionally, the Administration did not request funding in the FY1999 budget to purchase additional F-16 aircraft. The House authorization added funds for F-16s and JSTARS aircraft, as well as National Guard and Reserve equipment. They also provided funds for multiple C-130 cargo aircraft. The House appropriations bill allocated funds for F-16s, JSTARS, Guard and Reserve equipment, and C-130s. The Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC) provided funds for JSTARS, additional C-130s, and Guard and Reserve procurement. The Senate Appropriations Committee (SAC) funded additional C-130s and Guard and Reserve procurement. Rep. Obey proposed eliminating funds for 4 C-130s to restore F/A-18E/F procurement and upgrade existing C-130s. The aircraft procurement funding includes 7 C-130s, 1 F-16, and advance procurement funds for JSTARS. The National Defense Panel recommends focusing on leap-ahead technologies for future threats and reducing legacy programs. The National Defense Panel recommends focusing on leap-ahead technologies for future threats, criticizing various legacy programs in the Army, Navy, and Air Force. Congressional action includes requiring a Quadrennial Defense Review and a review of the Army's Crusader artillery program. The agreement requires a report on Crusader, sexual harassment, gender-integrated training, and other social issues. The focus of discussion has been on sexual harassment cases in the Army and gender-integrated training. Recommendations include separate units and barracks for men and women during basic training. The Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services (DACOWITS) disagreed with the recommendation for greater gender separation in training. Secretary of Defense Cohen left it to each service to decide on changes, with no alterations made so far. The HNSC version of the authorization bill included a provision for separate units and barracks for men and women in basic training, while SASC prohibited any changes until a congressionally-mandated commission reports. Senator Brownback proposed further actions. The Senate approved a Snowe substitute allowing current unit training practices to continue, with a requirement for separate sleeping quarters for men and women in basic training. The authorization conference agreement also includes statements urging separate training and holding senior officials to exemplary standards. Defense health care issues are under discussion. Defense health care issues, including Tricare effectiveness and health care benefits for military retirees, are being evaluated by Congress. A demonstration program called Medicare subvention was established to test a system where Medicare pays for care provided to eligible military retirees. HNSC and SASC took steps to ensure access to health care for retirees, including establishing demonstration projects for alternative healthcare provision. The House approved testing military retirees' access to the Federal Employee Health Benefits Plan. The authorization conference agreement includes demonstrations for retirees' health care, such as enrolling in FEHBP, Tricare benefits as a supplement to Medicare, and Tricare pharmacy benefits. Defense appropriations bills have earmarked funds for medical programs like bone marrow transplants and cancer research. The Senate set aside $250 million for medical R&D earmarks in the defense appropriations bill. The appropriations conference agreement provides separate earmarked funds for medical programs, including breast cancer and prostate cancer research. The Defense Department faces potential computer problems with the year 2000 transition, and the House Appropriations Committee added emergency funding to help fix these issues. The House Appropriations Committee approved emergency funding for the Treasury Department and Defense Department for Y2K issues. However, the House Republican caucus decided not to provide emergency appropriations for the \"Y2K\" problem, leading to the removal of $1.6 billion in emergency funding from the defense appropriations bill. The issue of emergency funding for Bosnia and Y2K was left to be addressed in a separate supplemental appropriations bill. The FY1999 omnibus appropriations bill provides $1.1 billion for the Defense Department for Y2K conversion and an additional $2.4 billion for other agencies. The defense authorization bill approves funding for Department of Energy weapons activities and Department of Defense activities. The bill does not provide funds for DOE, which are allocated in the energy and water development appropriations bill. A key issue is tritium production for DOE nuclear weapons programs, with the House-passed bill prohibiting DOE from buying tritium from commercial sources. The cost of tritium production is estimated at $3 billion over 40 years from commercial sources and $10 billion from new facilities. The Senate-passed authorization bill allows DOE to choose a long-term tritium production option, but implementation is delayed for a year for Congress to review. Senator Kyl has objected to this provision, urging DOE to pursue a new tritium source urgently. The Senate approved the budget resolution for fiscal year 1998, while the House revised the congressional budget for fiscal years 1998 and 1999. Additionally, an emergency bill for natural disaster recovery and peacekeeping efforts was passed by the Senate. The House and Senate passed H.R. 3579, an emergency supplemental appropriations bill for fiscal year 1998, which was signed into law as P.L. 105-74 on May 1, 1998. Additionally, H.R. 3616 was passed to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 1999. H.R. 3616 (Spence) authorized appropriations for fiscal year 1999 for military activities of the Department of Defense. It passed the House with amendments on May 21, 1998, and was later approved by the Senate with amendments on October 1, 1998. S. 2057 (Thurmond) authorized appropriations for fiscal year 1999 for military activities of the Department of Defense, passed by the Senate (96-2) on October 1, 1998, and signed into law by the President on October 17, 1998. S. 2132 (Stevens) made appropriations for the Department of Defense for fiscal year ending September 30, 1999. H.R. 4103 (Livingston) made appropriations for the Department of Defense for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1999. Subcommittee and full Appropriations Committee markups were held, with the bill passing in lieu of S. 2132. The House approved the bill with amendments, and the Senate passed it with amendments as well. A conference agreement was reached and approved by both the House and Senate. The House and Senate approved the conference agreement for H.R. 4328, a bill for omnibus appropriations for FY1999. It was signed into law by the President on October 17, 1998 (P.L. 105-262). Defense Appropriations for FY1995 to FY1999 were also included in the bill. The FY1999 budget includes funding for Defense, Ballistic Missile Defense, and Congressional Action on Major Weapons Programs. Sources include the Office of Management and Budget, Department of Defense, and Congressional Budget Office. Major Weapons Programs: FY1999 Authorization and Appropriations in millions of dollars. Amounts exclude initial spares and military construction. Sealift ship procurement handled under Revolving Funds in the National Defense Sealift Fund. Guard and Reserve Equipment amounts provided separately. Ballistic Missile Defense military construction request is $17.2 million. The military construction request for Ballistic Missile Defense is $17.2 million, often reported separately. Guard and Reserve Equipment amounts are provided in a separate account. Emergency funding is not included in the amounts provided. The House and Senate reports have adjusted the data to align with the request structure. Totals may not add up due to rounding. The appropriations bills differ from authorization figures in how they allocate Defense Health funding. Congressional actions on defense appropriations and national defense authorization are detailed in the reports. The annual defense appropriations bill provides funds for military activities of the Department of Defense (DOD) and other agencies. It includes funding for military construction, energy and water development, civil defense activities, and Selective Service System activities. The defense appropriations bill funds military activities of the Department of Defense and other agencies, including military construction, civil defense, and Selective Service System activities. It is the largest of the defense-related appropriations measures for FY1999. The Administration's defense budget request for FY1999 and projected defense budgets through FY2002 reflect a budget agreement finalized in June 1997. National defense budget authority will grow slowly in nominal terms but remain flat when adjusted for inflation. By FY2003, it will be almost 38% below the level in FY1985. The defense budget cuts in recent years have mainly reduced military force size and slowed weapons modernization. The FY1999 budget requests $48.7 billion for weapons procurement and $36.1 billion for research and development, a significant decrease from previous years. The Quadrennial Defense Review aims to increase procurement funding. The Quadrennial Defense Review aims to increase procurement funding by reducing defense civilian personnel levels and transferring savings to weapons acquisition. The Administration projects $61.3 billion for procurement by FY2001, contingent on achieving savings through defense business reforms and controlling operation and maintenance expenses. Congress has added substantial amounts to the defense budget in recent years but has no room to add to the FY1999 request.
