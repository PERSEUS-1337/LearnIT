    "content": "The Act titled \"Veterans Medicare Reimbursement Demonstration Act of 1997\" establishes a demonstration project. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs and the Secretary of Health and Human Services will jointly conduct a three-year demonstration project starting in 1998. The project involves reimbursing the Department of Veterans Affairs for healthcare services provided to targeted Medicare-eligible veterans. The Secretary of Health and Human Services has the authority to waive certain Medicare requirements for this project. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will designate up to three geographic service areas for facilities to participate in a demonstration project. The selection plan will be established in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The selection plan for facilities in the demonstration project will prioritize those suited to serve targeted Medicare-eligible individuals based on demand, billing capability, quality indicators, and other relevant factors. At least one facility near a closed base will be selected. The demonstration project will prioritize facilities based on demand, billing capability, and quality indicators. Veterans can voluntarily participate, with cost-sharing requirements set by the Secretary. Selected facilities must be in the same catchment area as a closed military medical facility under specific laws. The demonstration project for veterans will have the same requirements as medicare-eligible patients at non-governmental facilities. Payments received will be credited to the Department of Veterans Affairs medical appropriation. SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF REIMBURSEMENT AMOUNTS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will reimburse the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for services provided under the demonstration project at a rate equal to 95 percent of the amounts that would be payable under the medicare program for such services. Payments under this section will be made periodically from medicare trust funds. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will reimburse the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for services provided under the demonstration project at a rate equal to 95 percent of the amounts payable under the medicare program. Payments will be made periodically from medicare trust funds, with an annual limit of $50,000,000. To avoid shifting costs onto the medicare program, payment amounts may be reduced for failure to maintain VA effort. For medicare-eligible veterans, payment amounts for the project may be reduced if actual VA medical expenditures for targeted veterans are less than the maintenance of effort level for the fiscal year. Maintenance of effort levels are determined based on previous fiscal year expenditures or fiscal year 1997 expenditures for targeted veterans. The payment amounts for medicare-eligible veterans may be adjusted based on VA medical expenditures for targeted veterans compared to previous fiscal years. Maintenance of effort levels are determined using fiscal year 1997 expenditures for targeted veterans. The VA may adjust payment amounts for medicare-eligible veterans based on VA medical expenditures for targeted veterans compared to previous fiscal years. This includes considering the reduction in priority in service delivery to targeted medicare-eligible veterans due to legislative amendments and implementation of specific plans. The Department of Veterans Affairs tracks medical expenditures for targeted medicare-eligible veterans under chapter 17 of title 38, United States Code. This does not include costs for medical examinations for claims adjudication or services reimbursed under a demonstration project. The Secretaries, with the Comptroller General, monitor the impact on Medicare program costs. The Comptroller General closely monitors expenditures under the medicare program for targeted medicare-eligible veterans during a demonstration project. The Comptroller General audits these expenditures annually and submits a report to Congress on the costs of the Secretary of Health and Human Services under the medicare program. The Comptroller General audits expenditures under the medicare program for targeted medicare-eligible veterans during a demonstration project. If expenditures increase, the Secretaries must recoup the amount and prevent future increases. The Secretaries must recoup increased expenditures from the current medical care appropriation of the Department of Veterans Affairs to the medicare trust funds. They may also suspend or terminate the demonstration project or adjust the percentage under subsection (a)(1). SEC. 4. EVALUATION AND REPORTS. The Secretaries will arrange for an independent entity to evaluate the health services demonstration project annually. The entity will submit reports to the Secretaries and Congress by March 1 each year, assessing the project's cost to the Department of Veterans Affairs and the quality of care provided by participating facilities. The independent entity evaluates the health services demonstration project annually, reporting on costs to the Department of Veterans Affairs and quality of care at participating facilities. The report includes comparisons of quality of care, costs, savings or costs to Medicare programs, changes in access to care for targeted Medicare-eligible veterans, and effects on access to care for veterans not participating in the project. The Secretaries will submit a report to Congress within six months of the final report, recommending whether to extend or make permanent the demonstration project, expand it to cover more sites and increase reimbursement amounts, and continue or modify project terms. Additionally, by March 1, 1999, they will report on the feasibility of establishing a new demonstration project to reimburse the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. The demonstration project reimburses the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for health care services provided to targeted Medicare-eligible veterans in managed health-care plans. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, key definitions include \"demonstration project\" and \"project\" referring to a specific project, \"geographic service area\" defined by natural patient referral patterns, and \"medicare program\" as health benefits under title XVIII of the Social Security Act.
