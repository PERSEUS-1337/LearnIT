    "content": "LIBOR is an index measuring the cost of funds for global banks in London markets. The British Bankers' Association constructs it, and Thomson Reuters publishes it. Daily surveys of banks determine the rates, with averages reported at 11:30 a.m. There are 15 different maturities for each of 10 currencies, ranging from overnight to one year. In the U.S., many contracts reference the three-month dollar LIBOR. The three-month dollar LIBOR is determined by a panel of 18 banks, with the highest 4 and lowest 4 responses discarded. Banks can apply to participate in the survey, with criteria including market share and expertise in currency transactions. The panel for each currency's LIBOR is chosen based on specific criteria. The LIBOR index is used as a benchmark in private loan contracts and financial derivatives. It is compared to fixed interest rates in various currencies and maturities. Other locations have similar indexes like EURIBOR for Europe and TIBOR for Tokyo. LIBOR is used as a benchmark in private loan contracts and financial derivatives. It represents the cost of borrowing dollars by the largest banks in global financial markets. Policymakers use it in complex indexes like the TED spread to assess financial market stress. Private parties voluntarily choose to use LIBOR as a benchmark for setting interest rates in future contracts. Alternatives to LIBOR for private contracts exist, such as using the yield on U.S. Treasury securities or the Federal Funds Rate as benchmarks. However, the recent financial crisis showed that borrowing costs of banks do not always align with government borrowing costs. Interbank repurchase agreements in New York money markets could also be considered as an alternative benchmark. The value of loans, derivatives, and other financial instruments referencing LIBOR is significant. Estimates show that a large percentage of adjustable rate mortgages and subprime ARMs use LIBOR as a benchmark. Additionally, many municipalities have contracts tied to the index. While the BBA eliminates extreme survey responses, a single bank on a LIBOR reporting panel can still impact the index. A single bank on the LIBOR reporting panel can impact the index by influencing the middle responses used for calculation. For example, if 4 banks report 3%, 10 banks report 8%, and 4 banks report 10%, the average would be 8%. If a bank with a 10% rate wants to lower the LIBOR, it can affect the outcome by adjusting its bid. If a bank on the LIBOR reporting panel wants to lower the index, it can influence the average by adjusting its bid. By reporting a lower rate, even if it is thrown out, it can impact the middle responses used for calculation. This manipulation can shift the index, but there is a limit to the magnitude of the effect. Barclays admitted to submitting false survey responses to manipulate the LIBOR index, which is used in U.S. derivatives markets. This manipulation is a violation of U.S. law, and Barclays settled separately with UK officials for violating UK law. The bank's admissions with the CFTC and DOJ are detailed in the settlement documents. The settlement documents signed by Barclays with the CFTC and DOJ include employee emails documenting manipulation of the LIBOR index. The emails can be categorized into three groups: changing survey responses for trade positions, protecting Barclays' reputation, and attempting to influence other banks' responses. Collusion with other banks was attempted but not confirmed. LIBOR's calculation methodology limits the impact of a single bank's false bid. Barclays' derivatives trades are just one part of its balance sheet. Barclays' internal emails reveal derivatives traders asking employees to submit false survey responses to benefit their trading positions. Unlike other divisions, derivatives traders' preferred LIBOR outcome changes daily, sometimes high and sometimes low. In the settlement, Barclays admits to submitting false survey responses. Barclays admitted to submitting false survey responses for the LIBOR index during the 2005-2007 period to protect its reputation. UK officials raised concerns about Barclays' responses being higher than other responders, potentially signaling weakness to global investors. Barclays consistently under-reported its cost of funds in 2008, leading to concerns raised by UK officials and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York about the methodology for the LIBOR index. The FRBNY posted documents revealing its concerns with how LIBOR was being calculated and reported in 2008. Documents from 2008 reveal concerns about the calculation and reporting of LIBOR, including presentations to the U.S. Treasury and emails between officials."
