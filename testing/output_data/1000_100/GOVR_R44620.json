    "content": "A biologic or biological product is a preparation made from living organisms, such as proteins, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, cells, or tissues. Biosimilars are similar but not identical to brand-name biologics. Generic drugs are chemically identical to their brand-name counterparts. The molecular structure of a commonly used chemical drug is much smaller and simpler compared to a biologic drug. For example, aspirin has nine carbon atoms, eight hydrogen atoms, and four oxygen atoms, while Remicade, a biologic drug, has over 6,000 carbon atoms, almost 10,000 hydrogen atoms, and about 2,000 oxygen atoms. Inflectra, a biosimilar to Remicade, was FDA approved in April 2016. The FDA regulates both biologics and chemical drugs, with CBER overseeing traditional biologics, gene therapy products, cellular therapy products, and human tissue used in transplantation. The FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) regulates prescription brand-name and generic drugs, over-the-counter drugs, and most therapeutic biologics, including monoclonal antibodies and cytokines used to treat various diseases. Biologics and biosimilars, like interleukins and growth factors, are used to fight diseases like cancer. They require special handling and are usually administered via injection or infusion. Immunomodulators can stimulate or suppress the immune system to help the body combat diseases. Biologics, also known as specialty drugs, are expensive medications that are often administered via injection or infusion. The cost of some biologic medications can exceed $250,000 per patient annually. Spending on biologics in the United States totaled $105.5 billion in 2016, with $3.2 billion spent on biologics subject to biosimilar competition. In 2016, $3.2 billion was spent on biologics in the United States, with $2.9 billion on original biologics and $0.3 billion on biosimilars. Biologics spending has increased by 10% annually since 2011. Medicare Part B program spending has been driven by biologics, which accounted for 63% of prescription drug spending in 2014. Biologics are more expensive in the US than in Europe and Canada, where biosimilars have reduced prices by up to 33%. The 1984 Hatch-Waxman Act allowed FDA approval of generic chemical drugs, leading to price reductions of 60% to 90% on branded oral-solid medications. This Act has helped lower drug costs for consumers and expand the U.S. generic drug industry. The Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984 led to significant cost savings by allowing FDA approval of generic drugs, reducing prices for consumers. Generic drug companies must demonstrate to the FDA that their product is identical to the original, allowing them to rely on previous safety and effectiveness findings. This Act also promoted the growth of the U.S. generic drug industry. The FDA approved the first human drug developed by the biotechnology industry in 1982, which was human insulin. This was followed by other human therapeutic agents such as human growth hormone, alpha interferon, tissue plasminogen activator, and erythropoietin. Biological products are regulated by the FDA through a biologics license application (BLA) under the Public Health Service Act (PHSA). In contrast, chemical prescription drugs are regulated through a new drug application (NDA) or abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA). The Hatch-Waxman Act facilitated the approval of generic drugs, leading to cost savings for consumers and promoting the growth of the U.S. generic drug industry. After the approval of human insulin in 1982, the Hatch-Waxman Act allowed for generic drug approval under the FFDCA but not for follow-on biologics under the PHSA. This limited companies from submitting follow-on biologics applications for most therapeutic biologics licensed under the PHSA. Insulin, a small protein regulating sugar metabolism, was historically regulated as a drug under the FFDCA. In the 1940s, insulin and other natural source biological products were regulated as drugs under the FFDCA rather than as biologics under the PHSA. Market competition for biosimilars was limited due to FDA's unclear regulatory authority. The Generic Pharmaceutical Association (GPhA, now called the Association for Accessible Medicines) advocated for FDA approval of biosimilars, while the Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO) filed a petition to inhibit biosimilar approval. In Europe, the pathway to marketing biosimilars had fewer barriers, with the European Medicines Agency authorizing several biosimilar products. In the US, FDA approved the first biosimilar, Omnitrope, in June 2006 following a court ruling in favor of its sponsor, Sandoz. The U.S. District Court ruled in favor of Omnitrope's sponsor, Sandoz, stating that the FDA must consider the application for Omnitrope, which was deemed \"indistinguishable\" from Genotropin. The 505(b)(2) pathway was used to approve Omnitrope in 2006, but the FDA clarified that this approval did not establish a pathway for other follow-on biologic drugs. Congress later addressed the issue in March 2010. In March 2010, Congress established a new regulatory authority for FDA through the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA) of 2009, allowing for an abbreviated licensure pathway for biosimilar and interchangeable biological products. FDA can collect user fees from the industry for this purpose. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 established a regulatory pathway for biosimilar and interchangeable biological products. To be considered interchangeable, a biosimilar product must demonstrate the same clinical results as the reference product in any patient. Interchangeable products can be substituted by pharmacists without the intervention of the prescribing healthcare provider. FDA held a public meeting in 2010 to gather industry perspectives on this topic. The FDA held a public meeting in November 2010 to gather input from industry and the public before developing guidance on the biosimilars pathway. Three draft guidance documents were released in February 2012, with final guidance issued in April 2015. Additional guidance on biosimilars has also been released by the FDA. Companies seeking to market biosimilar products in the US must submit an application demonstrating biosimilarity through analytical, animal, and clinical studies. The FDA requires companies seeking to market biosimilar products in the US to conduct analytical, animal, and clinical studies. Any changes to the approved manufacturing process must demonstrate comparability to ensure product quality and safety. Brand-name biologics like Remicade underwent multiple manufacturing changes, each requiring a demonstration of comparability through various assays. The FDA has approved seven biosimilars for marketing in the US, but sales of five have been delayed by brand-name manufacturers. Patent infringement lawsuits and anticompetitive tactics are causing delays in the launch of three US biosimilars. Pfizer has sued Johnson & Johnson for preventing insurers from covering its biosimilar Inflectra. The FDA has approved seven biosimilars for marketing in the US, but sales of five have been delayed by brand-name manufacturers. Pfizer has sued Johnson & Johnson for preventing insurers from covering its biosimilar Inflectra, impacting the sales of another biosimilar, Renflexis. The high costs of biologics have raised interest in the government's role in drug development. Six of the seven biosimilars had their brand-name drugs discovered by public-sector research institutions. In March 2015, FDA approved Zarxio, the first biosimilar in the US, marketed by Sandoz Inc. It is biosimilar to Neupogen by Amgen Inc. Neupogen was discovered by scientists at Sloan Kettering, with Amgen receiving a license in 1991. Zarxio is approved for the same indications as Neupogen. In April 2016, FDA approved Inflectra, a biosimilar to Remicade by Janssen Biotech, Inc. Remicade was discovered by scientists at New York University, with a license issued to Centocor Inc. in 1998. In late November 2016, Pfizer began marketing the biosimilar Inflectra in the United States at a price 15% below Remicade. Pfizer filed a lawsuit against J&J in September 2017 for alleged anticompetitive practices related to biosimilar-exclusion contracts with health insurers. The rebate offered by brand-name manufacturers like J&J for their drug Remicade creates a financial incentive for insurers to prefer the higher-priced brand over Pfizer's biosimilar Inflectra. This strategy, known as a \"rebate trap,\" involves withdrawing rebates on the brand-name drug if the biosimilar manufacturer offers a significant discount to insurers. This can double the cost for patients using the brand-name drug, even if the biosimilar is priced 60% lower. The rebate trap can increase payer total costs when only 50% of patient users switch to the biosimilar. To avoid this, a near-complete switch from the branded biologic to the biosimilar is needed. However, many chronic disease patients are unlikely to switch due to well-maintained disease on current therapy. Pfizer's lawsuit states that providers are not purchasing Inflectra, even for insured patients. The lawsuit alleges that providers are not buying Inflectra for insured patients, with only 4% of total infliximab unit sales in the US. J&J's anticompetitive practices with Remicade could set a precedent for biologic originator firms, undermining competition-enhancing objectives. In response to the Pfizer lawsuit, J&J's Janssen Biotech president stated that Pfizer has failed to demonstrate sufficient value with Remicade. FDA approved a third biosimilar, Erelzi, which is biosimilar to Enbrel. Enbrel is one of the top-selling drugs in the world. Erelzi, a biosimilar to Enbrel, has been approved for all indications on the Enbrel label. Clinical data confirms Erelzi's similarity to the reference product. A release date for Erelzi's marketing is pending due to a lawsuit filed by Amgen against Sandoz. In April 2017, FDA approved a fifth biosimilar, Renflexis (infliximab-abda), manufactured by Samsung Bioepsis. Due to patent infringement litigation between Amgen and AbbVie, Amjevita (adalimumab-atto) is unlikely to be commercially available until at least 2018. Renflexis, a biosimilar to Remicade, was approved by the FDA in April 2017 and launched in the US by Samsung in partnership with Merck. It is priced 35% lower than Remicade. Another biosimilar, Cyltezo, was approved by the FDA in August 2017, manufactured by Boehringer Ingelheim, and is a biosimilar to Humira. Cyltezo, a biosimilar to Humira, is manufactured by Boehringer Ingelheim. AbbVie filed a lawsuit against BI for patent infringement, delaying the launch date of Cyltezo. Mvasi, a biosimilar to Avastin, was approved by the FDA in September 2017 and is manufactured by Amgen. The proprietary name of a drug product is the trademarked name used for marketing, usually capitalized with a superscript R in a circle (\u00ae). The Purple Book lists biological products licensed by the FDA, including biosimilars and interchangeable products. Appendix D provides examples of proprietary and nonproprietary names for CDER and CBER licensed biological products. The nonproprietary name is used to identify the active pharmaceutical ingredient in drug labeling and scientific literature. The FDA released guidance on the nonproprietary naming of biological products in 2015, finalized in 2017. The naming convention includes a proper name with a core name and a unique four-letter suffix. An example is filgrastim-xzwy. The FDA is considering the appropriate suffix format for interchangeable products. For originator biological products, the FDA plans to use a core name adopted by the USAN Council. In Europe, reference drugs and biosimilars use the same INN naming system. The WHO released a Biological Qualifier proposal in 2016 for biosimilar naming. The FDA is considering the appropriate suffix format for interchangeable products, while the WHO released a Biological Qualifier proposal in 2016 for biosimilar naming. The BQ is a code formed of four random consonants in two 2-letter blocks separated by a 2-digit checksum. Biosimilar industry groups support the shared use of a nonproprietary name, while innovator companies prefer a naming scheme that distinguishes between the reference biologic product and the biosimilar. The Federal Trade Commission expressed concern that the FDA's naming proposal could deter physicians from prescribing biosimilars, impeding market development and competition. The FTC expressed concern that the FDA's naming proposal for biosimilars could hinder market competition by creating confusion among physicians about product differences based on nonproprietary names. Participants at an FTC workshop on biosimilars argue that the misuse of the term \"identical\" creates fear and misunderstanding. Biosimilars are not required to be identical to their reference biologics, as variability is inherent in biologics. FDA's labeling rules for prescription drug products provide information on safety and effectiveness for healthcare providers to determine suitability for patients. The FDA-approved labeling for prescription drug products contains essential information for safe and effective use, including warnings, indications, dosage, contraindications, and more. It is tailored for healthcare practitioners and is based on thorough analysis of the new drug application or biologics license application. The FDA-recommended biosimilar labeling includes a \"Biosimilarity Statement\" in the highlights section, emphasizing the relationship to the reference product. Comparative data demonstrating biosimilarity is advised against to prevent confusion. The FDA-recommended biosimilar labeling includes a \"Biosimilarity Statement\" in the highlights section, emphasizing the relationship to the reference product. Comments on the FDA labeling guidance reflected differing views on the amount of information in biosimilar labeling, with the generic industry wanting less information and the brand-name industry preferring more information. Under the BPCIA, biological products approved as drugs under the FFDCA will transition to biological licenses under the PHSA in March 2020. This provision affects a small set of products like insulin, glucagon, growth hormone, infertility treatments, menopause and osteoporosis hormones, and certain enzymes. FDA released draft guidance in March 2016 regarding this transition, emphasizing the need for transparent labeling to distinguish between biosimilar and reference products. Applications for biological products must be submitted under section 351 of the PHS Act, with an exception until March 23, 2020. An application can be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act by that date if a biological product in the same class was approved under section 505 by March 23, 2010. However, if there is a biological product approved under section 351(a) of the PHS Act that could be a \"reference product,\" an application cannot be submitted under section 505. Approved applications under section 505 will be considered licenses under section 351 on March 23, 2020. The FDA's interpretation of the PHS Act states that applications for biological products approved under the FFDCA will be replaced by approved BLAs under the PHSA as of March 23, 2020. Any pending applications under the FFDCA should be withdrawn and resubmitted under the PHSA. Industry representatives have raised concerns about delays in the approval of competing biological products. The FDA's interpretation of the PHS Act states that applications for biological products approved under the FFDCA will be replaced by approved BLAs under the PHSA as of March 23, 2020. Any unexpired orphan drug exclusivity would continue to apply to the drug for the protected use after this date. Industry groups have raised concerns about FDA's policy on exclusivity and the eligibility of transitional biological products for the 12-year biologics exclusivity period. The FDA's interpretation of the PHS Act states that biological products approved under the FD&C Act will be replaced by approved BLAs under the PHSA as of March 23, 2020. Concerns have been raised about exclusivity and the eligibility of transitional biological products for the 12-year biologics exclusivity period specified by the BPCIA. FDA clarifies that no exclusivity period should impede biosimilar or interchangeable product competition until 2032. Interchangeable products can produce the same clinical result as the reference product and may be substituted without the intervention of the prescribing health care provider. The FDA released draft guidance on interchangeability for biosimilar products in January 2017, with the comment period extended to May 19, 2017. The agency has not yet approved an interchangeable product, while in Europe, the EMA does not make determinations on interchangeability. The FDA and EMA do not provide recommendations on interchangeability of biosimilar products. Individual member states have their own policies on interchangeability, with some allowing interchangeability unless proven otherwise. In the United States, FDA regulates the drug product while states regulate pharmacies. At least 37 states have considered legislation on biosimilar substitution. The FDA gained authority to collect user fees from manufacturers of brand-name prescription drugs and biological products in 1992 through the Prescription Drug User Fee Act. This allowed FDA to increase staff for application reviews and reduce review times. 27 states and Puerto Rico have enacted legislation on biosimilar substitution, with varying provisions. The FDA has authority to collect user fees for various types of applications, including biosimilars, to reduce review times. User fees made up 43% of the FY2016 FDA budget. The Biosimilar User Fee Act of 2012 (BsUFA I) authorized FDA to collect fees for biosimilar reviews from 2012 to 2017. Fees were based on PDUFA human drug application fee amounts. The Biosimilar Product Development (BPD) program assists industry sponsors in early stages of developing biosimilar products. There were 64 BPD programs for 23 reference products as of February 2017. Companies can discontinue participation but must pay a reactivation fee. The biosimilar biological product application fee may be waived for small businesses. FDA collects BsUFA fees annually and discloses spending in a financial report. The five-year biosimilars user fee authority was set to expire in October 2017. The biosimilar user fee authority was reauthorized through the Food and Drug Administration Reauthorization Act of 2017 (FDARA, P.L. 115-52) signed into law by President Donald J. Trump on August 18, 2017. FDA faced challenges in meeting BsUFA I goals for advisory meetings with industry according to March 2017 congressional testimony. The FDA aims to strengthen staff capacity and modernize hiring practices to meet performance goals under BsUFA II. The new hiring authorities in the 21st Century Cures Act will help save time and resources for applicants, encouraging price competition and lowering healthcare costs. The supplement and establishment fees have been dropped, while BPD fees have been retained. The FDA has made changes to fees under the BsUFA program, dropping supplement and establishment fees while retaining BPD fees. The product fee is now called the BsUFA Program fee, with a limit of five fees per fiscal year per application. The application fee will no longer be reduced by cumulative BPD fees paid. The agency estimates needing $45 million in FY2018 for program costs, with a possible adjustment of up to $9 million. The high costs of pharmaceuticals, especially biologics, have raised concerns about the federal role in developing new therapeutics. Studies have shown that a small percentage of new drugs approved by the FDA originated from non-industry sources. This highlights the importance of publicly funded research in drug discovery. Between 1990 and 2007, publicly funded research contributed to 9.3% of drugs approved by the FDA, with 19% of priority review applications resulting from this research. This highlights the significant role of publicly funded labs in developing new therapeutics. The authors found that 46.2% of new-drug applications from public-sector research institutions received priority reviews, compared to 20.0% from private-sector research. Priority review is for drugs that offer significant improvements in treating serious conditions. Data suggests that public-sector research institutions tend to discover drugs with important clinical effects. The Stevens study excluded the role of PSRIs in developing platform technologies like recombinant DNA, bacterial production methods, antibody production methods, glycosylated protein production methods, and gene silencing methods, all developed with public funds. These technologies enabled the development of FDA-approved products but were not considered in the study. The study excluded FDA-approved products developed with public funds, such as platform technologies like recombinant DNA and antibody production methods. These technologies enabled the development of 36 biologic drugs listed in Table 6 over the past 40 years. Regulatory oversight for biological products falls under the Public Health Service Act, while chemical drugs are regulated under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The Biologics Control Act of 1902 was the first national regulation for biologics, focusing on premarket approval and manufacturing processes in response to deaths from contaminated vaccines. The Biologics Control Act of 1902 focused on premarket approval and manufacturing processes for biological products, predating the Pure Food and Drugs Act of 1906. The Pure Food and Drugs Act was replaced by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act in 1938, which required drug manufacturers to submit a new drug application demonstrating product safety before marketing. The Biologics Control Act was revised and recodified under the Public Health Service Act in 1944. The Public Health Service Act (PHSA) of 1944 specified that biological products licensed under it are subject to regulation under the FFDCA. Biological products include viruses, vaccines, blood products, etc., used for disease prevention or treatment. The FFDCA applies to biological products regulated under the PHSA, except those with approved licenses. Most biological products also meet the definition of drugs under the FFDCA for diagnosis or treatment. The PHSA, amended by the FDA Modernization Act of 1997, requires a single BLA for biological products. It also allows for immediate license suspension in case of public health danger. The PHSA was further amended by the BPCIA in 2009, creating a licensure pathway for biosimilar or interchangeable biological products. The BPCIA of 2009 established a pathway for biosimilar and interchangeable biological products, creating regulatory exclusivity periods and procedures for resolving patent disputes. Regulatory responsibility for biologics was initially with the Hygienic Laboratory, then transferred to the FDA's Bureau of Biologics in 1972, and later split into the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) in 1988. In 1988, the FDA split Biologics into CDER and CBER. CBER used NIH facilities until moving to the new FDA headquarters in 2014. Determining jurisdiction for biotechnology products has been challenging. An Intercenter Agreement in 1991 stated that traditional biologics and most biotechnology products would be regulated by CBER. In 2002, the FDA reorganized review responsibilities, transferring most therapeutic biologics from CBER to CDER. CDER now regulates licensed biologics like monoclonal antibodies, growth factors, and cytokines, while CBER oversees traditional biologics such as vaccines and blood products. Blood products, including recombinant versions of plasma derivatives, are regulated by CBER and are clotting factors produced via biotechnology. The Purple Book provides a comparison of biologic drug prices and lists top-selling drugs."
