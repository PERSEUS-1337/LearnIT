The Act titled \"Promoting Unlicensed Spectrum Act of 2015\" defines key terms including appropriate committees of Congress, Assistant Secretary, Commission, Federal entity, and Spectrum Relocation Fund. The \"Promoting Unlicensed Spectrum Act of 2015\" defines unlicensed operations as the nonexclusive use of spectrum without protection from interference under specific regulations. The \"Promoting Unlicensed Spectrum Act of 2015\" defines unlicensed operations as the nonexclusive use of spectrum without protection from interference under specific regulations. Federal Communications Commission allocates and allots spectrum. The Commission must balance spectrum allocation for exclusive licensing through auctions and unlicensed operations. Within 18 months of the Act's enactment, rules must be established to achieve this balance and consider allowing unlicensed operations in auctioned spectrum until commercial use begins. These rules must be included in the service rules of spectrum auctions. The Commission must establish rules within 18 months to balance spectrum allocation for exclusive licensing and unlicensed operations, including allowing unlicensed operations in auctioned spectrum until commercial use begins. The rules must be included in the service rules of spectrum auctions and reflected in reports submitted to Congress. The National Strategy for Unlicensed Spectrum is outlined in Section 4. The policy of the United States aims to maximize spectrum resources, promote innovation in wireless broadband services, and ensure a balanced spectrum policy. The Commission must develop a national strategy within a year to make additional radio frequency bands available for unlicensed operations, including clearing bands for such use. The Commission is considering rules to expand opportunities for unlicensed operations by permitting spectrum sharing and utilizing additional radio frequency ranges. This includes expanding the spectrum sharing model and allowing underlay unlicensed operations without causing harmful interference to licensees. The Commission is exploring ways to enhance unlicensed operations in spectrum bands, improve spectrum utilization, and optimize databases for spectrum sharing. Additionally, they are evaluating the harmonization of bands for unlicensed operations to achieve greater economies of scale. A report detailing these strategies must be submitted to Congress within one year of the Act's enactment. The Commission will publish the report on its website when submitting recommendations for legislative changes developed under subsection (b). SEC. 5. MAKING FEDERAL SPECTRUM AVAILABLE FOR UNLICENSED OPERATION. The Assistant Secretary, along with the Commission and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, must submit a report to Congress within 270 days of this Act's enactment on designating additional radio frequency bands for unlicensed operations by Federal entities without causing interference. Recommendations for reforming the Spectrum Relocation Fund and ensuring its solvency will be considered in the report. The report to Congress must address the potential for unlicensed operations in spectrum bands used by Federal entities without causing harmful interference, as well as explore other spectrum sharing techniques for access to Federal spectrum."
