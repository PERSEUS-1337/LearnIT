    "content": "Songwriters and recording artists have legal rights to be paid for reproductions and performances of their music. However, they do not have complete control over their music. For example, Taylor Swift withdrew her music from Spotify, but a cover version by Ryan Adams could still be heard on the service. Copyright law allows artists to perform, reproduce, and distribute music under certain conditions as long as royalties are paid. Ms. Swift can withdraw her own recorded music from Spotify as the rights owner, but she cannot control how the music service uses other versions of her works. The payment she receives for her music depends on market forces, contracts, and copyright laws. Congress updated some laws in the 1990s to address internet music distribution and unauthorized use of copyrighted content. The evolution of music distribution has blurred traditional lines of exploitation, with different copyright laws applied to digital services. In 1999, recording industry revenues peaked at $21.3 billion, coinciding with the introduction of the Napster file-sharing service. In 2003, Apple launched the iTunes Music Store after negotiating licensing agreements with major record labels. By 2012, digital downloads surpassed physical media sales in the recording industry. Apple dominated with a 65% market share but faced a decline in digital downloads due to the rise of streaming services like Spotify. To compete, Apple introduced Apple Music in 2015, reflecting the shift in music consumption patterns towards subscription services. The rise of subscription music services has significantly changed music consumption patterns, with a notable increase in spending on streaming services from 9% in 2011 to 67% in 2017. Despite a recent growth in consumer spending on music, it remains below its 1999 peak. These shifts impact how performers, songwriters, and music industry professionals are compensated under copyright law. Creators of musical works and artists license their rights to third parties for exploitation. Owners of musical works and sound recordings have exclusive rights under the Copyright Act, including reproduction and distribution rights known as \"mechanical rights.\" Music publishers issue mechanical licenses to reproduce musical compositions, collecting royalties from manufacturers. The term \"mechanical rights\" has persisted through changes in music reproduction methods. Federal copyright protection for sound recordings applies to those fixed after February 15, 1972. Works fixed before this date are protected by state laws until February 15, 2067, with some services voluntarily paying royalties for pre-1972 recordings. The Copyright Act grants owners of musical works and sound recordings the right to publicly perform their works, but for sound recordings, this right only applies to digital audio transmissions. Examples of digital audio transmission services include webcasting, digital subscription services, and music streaming services. Public performance rights for sound recordings under federal copyright laws are granted only to recordings fixed after February 15, 1972. Consumers of compact discs purchase the rights to listen to each song on the disc in a private setting. Retail outlets pay distribution subsidiaries of major record labels for physical copies of sound recordings. Radio listeners have less control over song playback compared to purchasing the song. Broadcast radio stations do not pay public performance royalties to record labels and artists but do pay royalties to music publishers and songwriters. Congress exempted broadcast radio stations from paying public performance royalties to record labels and artists in 1995. Digital services must pay record labels and music publishers for public performance rights, including making temporary copies of songs known as \"ephemeral recordings.\" Interactive music streaming services allow users to listen to songs on demand, similar to playing a CD or listening to a radio broadcast. The music industry involves three main categories: songwriters and music publishers, recording artists and record labels, and music licensees. Songwriters often work with music publishers to reproduce and distribute musical works. Royalties are paid to music publishers/songwriters and record labels/artists for the right to reproduce and distribute music. Music publishers, also known as \"songwriters,\" promote songs to record labels and others, license intellectual property, collect royalties, and provide advances to songwriters. They monitor and generate revenue from music use in various formats, such as sheet music, digital downloads, and broadcast radio. Publishers often work with performing rights organizations for licensing and payment collection. Music publishers contract with performing rights organizations to license and collect payment for public performances. Songwriters and publishers share royalty income, with a standard 50-50 division between them. Major publishers like Sony/ATV, Universal Music Publishing Group, and Warner Music Group dominate the U.S. music publishing revenue. Multiple songwriters with their own publishers can complicate the division of income. Independent publishing companies handle the creative aspects of songwriting management, while major publishers handle royalty administration. Independent publishers administer their own music catalogs. Some songwriters control their own publishing rights, especially well-established ones or those who perform their own works. Record labels are responsible for finding talent, recording music, and promoting artists. Major record labels reproduce and distribute physical copies of sound. The three largest record labels, known as \"majors,\" distribute physical and electronic copies of sound recordings. They handle functions such as adding data for royalties, negotiating with streaming services, and monitoring sales. Recording artists can either contract with a label or distribute their own music. Recording artists may contract with a record label to transfer their copyrights for defined periods and regions in exchange for royalties. Record companies finance recordings, advance funds, and guide artists' careers. Major stars can negotiate full ownership of future sound recordings. The three major record labels are Sony Corporation (14.4%), Universal Music Group (29.4%), and Warner Music Group (21.2%), earning 65% of the industry's U.S. revenue. The music industry is dominated by major record labels like Sony Corporation, Vivendi SA, and Access Industries. While some artists like Chance the Rapper retain their copyrights and distribute their music independently, others like Taylor Swift have contracts with labels for distribution. Chance the Rapper gives away his music for free and earns from touring and merchandise sales. Chance the Rapper earned $500,000 from Apple Music for his exclusive streaming-only album, Coloring Book. He was the first artist to have a streaming-only album in the top 10 U.S. albums. Record producers are responsible for bringing creative music into tangible form, handling creative and administrative tasks. Artists now work with multiple producers on albums, giving them control over compensation terms. The producer's compensation terms are controlled by negotiations, with royalties being demanded by those with leverage. Sound engineers oversee recording sessions, while mixers piece together finished products. Mixers typically receive one-time payments per track, but those in high demand may negotiate for a share of artist royalties. The 1909 Copyright Act granted copyright owners the exclusive right to make mechanical reproductions of music, applying to works published after its enactment. A mechanical license allows for audio-only music reproduction through mechanical devices like player pianos, phonograph records, and CD players. The 1909 Copyright Act established the first compulsory license in U.S. copyright law to prevent a potential monopoly by a player-piano manufacturer. This allowed music publishers to withhold the right to reproduce a musical work, but once a sound recording is distributed to the public, others must be allowed to make similar use of it. In 2015, Ryan Adams recorded a cover version of Taylor Swift's album 1989 without seeking her permission. Instead, they paid a compulsory mechanical license royalty rate set by the government. The 1909 Copyright Act established a royalty rate of $0.02 per \"part manufactured,\" which remained in place for nearly 70 years. Technological changes in the 20th century led to record labels paying mechanical royalty rates on a \"per song\" basis. Congress revisited the mechanical license in the Copyright Act of 1976. The Copyright Act of 1976 codified the compulsory mechanical license as 17 U.S.C. Section 115, specifying rates payable for each distributed record. The law defines \"phonorecord\" for audio-only recordings and outlines procedures for obtaining mechanical licenses through serving a notice of intention to license the music on the copyright owner or the Copyright Office. Licensees must file the NOI within 30 days of making a new recording or before distribution. The 1976 Copyright Act simplified the process for copyright owners to sue by removing limitations on liability and requiring potential licensees to provide a notice of intention to license. Failure to do so makes them ineligible for a compulsory license. Copyright holders no longer need to file a \"notice of use\" to recover against unauthorized record manufacturers, but must identify themselves to receive royalties under a compulsory license. Under current law, there may be no public record of the fact that the copyright owner triggered the NOI requirements for royalties under a compulsory license. Reproduction and distribution licenses are not issued on a blanket basis, leading to controversy between rights holders and licensees. The idea of adjusting the statutory mechanical royalty rate periodically stemmed from a suggestion by a representative of the National Music Publishers Association in a 1967 hearing. In 1976, a separate royalty tribunal was established by Congress to simplify administering compulsory licenses and mechanical licenses. The tribunal considers four policy objectives when setting rates for mechanical licenses, including maximizing public access to works, fair returns for copyright owners, reflecting contributions of owners and users, and minimizing disputes. The Copyright Royalty Board (CRB) was established in 2004 to set licensing rates every five years, acting as a ceiling for what owners may charge. In 1995, the Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act amended 17 U.S.C. Section 115 to cover reproduction and distribution. The Copyright Royalty Board (CRB) was established in 2004 to set licensing rates every five years, acting as a ceiling for what owners may charge. In 1995, the Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act amended 17 U.S.C. Section 115 to expressly cover the reproduction and distribution of musical works by digital transmission (digital phonorecord deliveries, or DPDs). Congress directed that rates and terms for DPDs should distinguish between incidental and general digital phonorecord deliveries, sparking a debate on what constitutes an \"incidental DPD.\" The Copyright Office proposed new rules in 2008, emphasizing the need for resolution in order for the music industry to survive in the 21st Century. In September 2008, music industry groups reached a landmark agreement on mechanical licenses for streaming services, ensuring revenue for music publishers. The CRB adopted the agreement in 2009, applying through 2012. In 2012, music industry groups reached a new agreement on mechanical royalty rates for music streaming services, covering 2013-2017. In January 2018, the CRB set rates for 2018-2022, including flat rates for physical deliveries and downloads, and formula-based rates for interactive streaming. The music streaming services calculate the pool of money available for distribution to publishers for mechanical royalty payments using formulas. The amount each publisher receives is based on another set of formulas, with minimum per-subscriber payments set depending on the type of music service. Rates for public performance royalties are either overseen by the U.S. District Court or negotiated between publishers and licensees. Songwriters were granted the exclusive right to publicly perform their works in 1897. In 1897, songwriters were granted the exclusive right to publicly perform their works. To address the logistical issue of licensing and collecting payment for public performances, composers formed ASCAP in 1914, a performance rights organization. ASCAP represents songwriters and publishers in issuing public performance rights secured by copyright law. In 1930, SESAC was founded as a competing PRO to help European publishers and writers collect royalties from U.S. licensees. SESAC expanded its representation to include U.S. composers as broadcast radio grew more popular. ASCAP negotiated public performance rights for songwriters and publishers in 1932. In 1932, ASCAP negotiated a public performance license with radio broadcasters based on a percentage of advertising revenues. Broadcasters founded BMI in 1939 to attract new composers and secure copyrights. ASCAP and BMI had exclusive rights to negotiate for their members and offered blanket licenses for all songs in their catalogs. The licensing agreement between ASCAP and radio stations expired in 1940, leading to a dispute over royalty rates. This led to an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice and consent decrees from both ASCAP and BMI in 1941. The decrees included requirements for nonexclusive licensing rights and granting licenses to any. ASCAP and BMI must offer nonexclusive licenses to members' public performance rights, accept any songwriter or music publisher that meets minimum standards, and provide alternative licenses. Rates charged by ASCAP and BMI are overseen by federal district court judges, while SESAC and GMR rates are based on marketplace. The rates charged by SESAC and GMR are based on marketplace negotiations, while ASCAP and BMI rates are overseen by federal district court judges to ensure they are \"reasonable\" and consider their market power. Current law prohibits judges from considering rates paid by digital services to record labels when setting public performance rates for music publishers and songwriters. According to a report by the House Judiciary Committee, Congress aimed to address concerns about the impact of license fees for sound recordings on music performance royalties. The ASCAP and BMI consent decrees have been periodically reviewed for effectiveness, with the last amendments made in 2001 and 1994 respectively. In 2016, the DOJ completed a review of the consent decrees, and in 2017, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals upheld BMI's challenge to the DOJ's interpretation of the decrees. The 1971 Sound Recording Act was created to combat unauthorized duplications of sound recordings. It applied to recordings fixed on or after February 15, 1972, and several states passed their own antipiracy laws. In 1975, the U.S. Department of Justice recommended amendments to federal copyright laws. The 1976 Copyright Act recommended excluding pre-1972 sound recordings from federal copyright laws to preserve antipiracy laws. Works in the public domain are no longer under copyright protection and can be used freely. The Act preempted state laws equivalent to copyright but exempted pre-1972 works. States can protect pre-1972 recordings until 2067, after which federal law will preempt all state protection. Noninteractive digital services may need to make ephemeral copies. In 1998, Congress established a license under Section 112 of the Copyright Act for noninteractive digital services to create temporary reproductions of sound recordings. The rates and terms of this license are set by the CRB, and through SoundExchange, copyright owners of sound recordings receive Section 112 fees. Recording artists who do not own the copyrights do not benefit from this license. Prior to the 1990s, public performance rights for sound recordings were not granted to record labels and artists. With the rise of the internet in the early 1990s, the recording industry faced concerns about music piracy. The Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act (DPRA) in 1995 and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) in 1998 were amendments to the Copyright Act that aimed to address these issues. The DPRA granted record labels and artists an exclusive public performance right for their sound recordings, limited to certain digital audio services, and also created a compulsory license for licensing sound recordings for specific subscription services. The DPRA and DMCA were amendments to the Copyright Act in response to concerns about music piracy. The DPRA granted record labels and artists exclusive public performance rights for their sound recordings on digital audio services. The DMCA expanded on this by addressing issues related to compulsory licensing and public performance royalties for sound recordings. The DMCA expanded statutory licensing provisions for online music services, setting up a bifurcated system for rate-setting standards. Services existing before July 31, 1998, are subject to one standard, while webcasters and newer services follow a different standard based on marketplace negotiations. The Section 801(b)(1) rate-setting standard aims to minimize disruptive impact on industries and prevailing practices. It led to lower copyright royalty rates in one case, but overall effects are unpredictable. The DPRA allows negotiation between sound recording rights owners and interactive music streaming services for public performance rights at market rates. Interactive services enable individuals to arrange specific recording transmissions. The Senate Judiciary Committee in 1995 highlighted concerns about certain audio services impacting traditional record sales and copyright control. Interactive services pose the greatest threat to record sales and livelihoods dependent on them. Congress does not mandate public performance licenses for broadcast radio stations. The committee aimed to balance interests in the industry. The Senate Judiciary Committee in 1995 emphasized the benefits of free over-the-air broadcast for the music industry. They stated that broadcast radio provides a mix of entertainment and public interest activities to local communities. The Copyright Royalty Board (CRB) sets statutory rates through rate determination proceedings involving copyright users, holders, and trade groups. The Copyright Royalty Board (CRB) conducts rate-setting proceedings where parties negotiate for three months before submitting written statements and attempting to reach a settlement. If no agreement is reached, the CRB may adopt proposed rates or hold an evidentiary hearing to issue a determination published in the Federal Register. The CRB conducts rate-setting proceedings, and issues determinations published in the Federal Register. Participants can request a rehearing or appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals. RIAA established SoundExchange for royalty distribution, which deducts costs before payments. CRB sets rates based on \"per-performance\" or percentage-of-revenue standards for online music services. The CRB has adopted percentage\u2010of\u2010revenue rates for public performances of sound recordings by certain services. Congress passed legislation allowing SoundExchange to negotiate alternative royalty schemes. Recent agreements expired in 2015, and the CRB began setting royalty rates for noninteractive music streaming services for 2016-2020. The CRB set royalty rates for noninteractive music streaming services for 2016-2020, but questions arose about the interpretation of a provision barring consideration of agreements negotiated under the Webcaster Settlement Acts. SoundExchange argued for exclusion of these agreements, while Pandora Media and Clear Channel disagreed, leading to a debate during the rate proceeding. The Copyright Royalty Board (CRB) set royalty rates for noninteractive music streaming services for 2016-2020. The CRB's decision included a provision tying annual rate increases from 2017 through 2020 to the Consumer Price Index. The CRB also ruled that directly negotiated licenses reflecting provisions in a Webcaster Settlement Act agreement may be considered. The CRB tied annual rate increases from 2017-2020 to the Consumer Price Index and included ephemeral recording fees with Section 114 royalties. Public performance rates vary based on music service type and start date. Royalties under Section 114 are distributed with 50% to the copyright owner, 45% to the featured artist, and 2.5% each to nonfeatured musicians and agents. The CRB tied annual rate increases from 2017-2020 to the Consumer Price Index and included ephemeral recording fees with Section 114 royalties. Public performance rates vary based on music service type and start date. Royalties under Section 114 are distributed with 50% to the copyright owner, 45% to the featured artist, and 2.5% each to nonfeatured musicians and agents. The act does not include record producers in the split of royalties for public performances by noninteractive digital services. Producers can be compensated by providing a letter of direction to SoundExchange. In the context of public performance rights, 17 U.S.C. Section 114 defines interactive services as those that allow users to receive personalized transmissions of sound recordings. The distinction between interactive and noninteractive services is not relevant for obtaining mechanical rights from music publishers under 17 U.S.C. Section 115. The CRB uses these distinctions to set rates for mechanical licenses. In 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled on a music streaming service that offers personalized song selections based on user feedback. The court's decision on interactive services was based on the concern that users could predict songs they would hear, leading to a decrease in record sales. Launch Media, Inc.'s LAUNCHcast online radio service was at the center of the case. The court determined that LAUNCHcast online radio service by Launch Media, Inc. was noninteractive due to its unique playlists for users. Noninteractive services must limit features to be eligible for compulsory licensing under the Copyright Act, such as not announcing specific songs in advance. The decision affirmed restrictions on personalized music streaming services like Pandora. The Launch Media decision affirmed that personalized music streaming services like Pandora and iHeartRadio can obtain statutory licenses for public performances of sound recordings. The rates set by the CRB do not differentiate between customized services and other radio-style internet services. Spotify offers on-demand access to albums, songs, and artists with a free limited version supported by ads or a paid subscription for ad-free listening on multiple devices. Congress provided antitrust exemptions to statutory licensees and sound recording copyright owners in 1995. The DPRA provided antitrust exemptions for copyright owners and statutory licensees to designate common agents for collective negotiation with SiriusXM and subscription services over royalty rates. The exemption is only available for nonexclusive common agents to prevent supracompetitive rates. Interactive services do not have an antitrust exemption for rate negotiations. In 1998, Congress added Section 112 to the DMCA for ephemeral server reproductions. It provided an antitrust exemption for copyright owners to designate common agents for negotiating royalty payments. Section 112(e)(2) does not require exclusive designation. The CRB was created in 2004 with provisions on licensee obligations. In 2004, P.L. 108-419 introduced provisions for licensees to make royalty payments through a designated entity. This allowed parties to continue making payments while appealing royalty decisions by the Copyright Royalty Judges. In 2006, the CRB designated SoundExchange as the sole \"collective\" for copyright royalty distribution. Royalty Logic, a subsidiary of Music Reports, Inc., requested recognition as a collective to compete with SoundExchange. The CRB argued that copyright owners and performers are designated agents, not entities like Royalty Logic. The CRB designated SoundExchange as the sole collective for copyright royalty distribution in 2006. Royalty Logic, a subsidiary of Music Reports, Inc., sought recognition to compete with SoundExchange. The CRB found that selecting a single collective was the most efficient system for collecting royalties under statutory licenses, which was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in 2009. Royalty Logic's argument about promoting competition on pricing was deemed irrelevant in the statutory license context. The CRB designated SoundExchange as the sole collective for copyright royalty distribution in 2006. Royalty Logic argued that the CRB could not give a single entity exclusive ability to receive payments, but the court disagreed. The court concluded that by selecting SoundExchange as the sole collective, the CRB fulfilled Congress's expectation of designating a single entity to receive royalty payments. The CRB designated SoundExchange as the sole collective for copyright royalty distribution from 2011-2014 and again in 2015. SoundExchange reached agreements with public and college radio stations for webcast sound recording rates, which were approved by the CRB. SoundExchange was designated as the sole collective for collecting, monitoring, and distributing sound recordings. SoundExchange was designated as the sole collective for copyright royalty distribution from 2011-2014 and again in 2015. The CRB stated that no objections were made to SoundExchange continuing its role, citing their administrative and technical expertise. Congress created an antitrust exemption for owners and licensees of musical works to designate common agents for negotiating and distributing mechanical licenses. Music publishers collect mechanical royalties through third-party administrators in the US. In 2015, SESAC acquired the Harry Fox Agency from the National Music Publishers Association. Music publishers may issue and administer mechanical licenses themselves. The CRB has not specified an agent for administering mechanical licenses. Royalty Logic, Inc. raised concerns about competition among agents for licensing musical works and distributing mechanical royalties. Royalty Logic and copyright owners agreed that Royalty Logic would not participate in licensing musical works unless competition among collectives was raised by other parties. Noncash considerations, like equity stakes in Spotify, can influence the prices interactive services pay for music access. Sony shared proceeds from selling its Spotify stake with artists and independent labels. The rates paid by interactive music services to music publishers are linked to the rates paid to record labels for performance rights. This allows music publishers to participate in deals that include equity stakes or advertising revenues. Concerns have been raised about the lack of transparency in payments from digital music services to publishers and record labels. Music publishers and record labels are not receiving fair shares from digital music services, leading to lower payments than they would get under statutory licensing schemes. ASCAP and BMI represent about 90% of songs for licensing in the US, while SESAC and Global Music Rights handle a smaller share. Publishers allege they are not getting their fair share of performance royalty revenues from streaming services due to restrictions in ASCAP and BMI consent decrees. Beginning in 2011, publishers pressured ASCAP and BMI to allow them to withdraw their digital rights. In response to publishers' pressure, ASCAP and BMI amended their rules in 2011 and 2013 to allow music publishers to license their public performance rights for new media uses. However, courts ruled that publishers cannot selectively withdraw rights and must either include all songs or none in licensing agreements. After court rulings, music publishers cannot selectively withdraw rights from a PRO's song catalog. Major publishers and PROs requested modifications to consent decrees, including allowing partial grants of rights, expedited arbitration, and bundled licenses. DOJ evaluated the consent decrees in 2014 and solicited comments on \"100% licensing\" versus \"fractional licensing\" in 2015. Fractional licensing is the industry practice where each writer's publisher licenses only a portion of a song. The DOJ proposed requiring 100% licensing for musical works, arguing it promotes competition. BMI filed a lawsuit challenging this interpretation in the Southern District of New York. The DOJ called on Congress to reconsider copyright law in the music industry. In September 2017, Judge Louis Stanton ruled that BMI's consent decree allows fractional licensing, which was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in December 2017. Licensees must serve a Notice of Intention (NOI) to the copyright holder before distributing phonorecords and pay royalties. The Copyright Office introduced new procedures in April 2016 for bulk electronic filing of NOIs for reproducing and distributing musical works under Section 115. The Copyright Office introduced new procedures in April 2016 for bulk electronic filing of Notice of Intentions (NOIs) for reproducing and distributing musical works under Section 115. This change significantly reduced filing costs for licensees like Spotify, Amazon, and Google, allowing them to file NOIs for up to 100 songs at once. Digital music service companies argued that digitizing the compulsory licensing process would ensure proper compensation for songwriters and publishers. The Music Modernization Act, passed by the House of Representatives in April 2018, aims to create a new nonprofit mechanical licensing collective funded by online music services to offer blanket mechanical licenses. This would streamline the process of obtaining licenses and ensure proper compensation for songwriters and publishers. The Music Modernization Act aims to set royalty rates for musical works used by subscription services and satellite digital audio services. It would extend federal copyright protection to sound recordings made before February 15, 1972, and create procedures for producers, mixers, and sound engineers to receive royalty payments. Online music services could pay for a broad blanket mechanical license through a new nonprofit entity called the Mechanical Licensing Collective. The Music Modernization Act establishes the Mechanical Licensing Collective (MLC) and a digital licensee coordinator for online music services. The MLC would have a 17-member board of directors and be funded by online music services through assessments reviewed every five years. Its duties include maintaining a musical works database, offering blanket licenses, and locating copyright owners. The Mechanical Licensing Collective (MLC) would administer processes for copyright owners to claim ownership of musical works, collect and distribute royalties from online music services, and ensure songwriters receive at least 50% of royalties for unmatched works. The MLC would not negotiate royalty rates, grant licenses for public performances, or engage in government lobbying activities. The digital licensing coordinator would establish a governance structure and membership. The digital licensing coordinator would establish governance structure, membership criteria, and payment dues. They would enforce notice and payment obligations, set administrative assessment rates, and maintain records. The collective cannot engage in government lobbying. Failure to provide reports or royalties would lead to default. Online music services can seek court review for license termination issues. Claims not resolved by the MLC can be brought to federal district court. Copyright owners of musical works can bring a claim in federal court for unresolved issues by the MLC's board. They cannot sue online music services with a valid blanket license. If a lawsuit is filed after January 1, 2018, for unauthorized reproduction or distribution, only royalties under the new system can be recovered, not damages or other remedies. The CRB would set royalty rates for music services based on the \"willing buyer/willing seller\" standard. Judges in the Southern District of New York could consider rates for public performances of sound recordings when setting rates for online services and satellite digital audio services. The current system of assigning judges in the Southern District of New York for ASCAP and BMI cases would change to a random process for rate setting cases, excluding original judges overseeing consent decree interpretation. This change is not based on past actions but on the belief that rate decisions should be assigned impartially. The committee in the Southern District of New York believes rate decisions for sound recordings should be randomly assigned to judges not involved in consent decrees. Rights owners of pre-1972 sound recordings can receive payments from digital music services under federal law, in addition to state copyright protections. To claim statutory damages or attorney's fees, owners must file sound recording information with the Copyright Office. The bill addresses the filing of sound recording identification information by rights owners and contact information by licensees of sound recording public performance. It provides federal protection for pre-1972 sound recordings until February 15, 2067. Producers, mixers, and sound engineers have the right to seek royalties through a nonprofit collective designated by the CRB. The entity distributing royalties must also be a nonprofit collective designated by the CRB. In 2007, the CRB stated that a collective does not need formal recognition to be involved in royalty distribution. Copyright owners and performers can designate collectives for royalty receipt. Legislators introduced measures like S.Con.Res. 6 and H.Con.Res. 13 to support the Local Radio Freedom Act, opposing new fees on radio stations for sound recordings. Representative Issa introduced the Performance Royalty Owners of Music Act in April 2017. In April 2017, Representative Issa introduced the PROMOTE Act of 2017, H.R. 1914, giving copyright owners the right to withdraw music from radio stations. Broadcast stations can play music without permission if they pay royalties or fall under specific exemptions. In July 2017, Representative Sensenbrenner introduced the Transparency in Music Licensing and Ownership Act, H.R. 3350, to create a searchable database for music licensing. The bill introduced by Representative Hakeem Jeffries, H.R. 3945, aims to establish a Copyright Claims Board as an alternative forum for copyright owners to address infringement issues. Senator Ron Wyden also introduced a bill, S. 2933, known as the ACCESS to Recordings Act, which provides federal copyright protection for sound recordings. The bill, S. 2933, aims to provide federal copyright protection for sound recordings made before February 15, 1972. It allows rights holders to receive payments from digital services for public performances of their works and preempts state copyright protection. Owners of pre-1972 sound recordings must give timely notice of federal copyright registration and infringement to be eligible for statutory damages or attorney's fees within a limited three-year window. If infringement has ceased when the action is brought, owners cannot claim damages or fees. Pre-1972 sound recordings, like those made after February 15, 1972, would eventually enter the public domain. Sound recordings made before February 15, 1972 would enter the public domain either 95 years after release or 120 years after recording. Recordings from 1923 to 1930 would be protected until December 31, 2025 if copyright owner engages in commercial exploitation and complies with regulations. Failure to meet requirements would result in recordings entering the public domain."
