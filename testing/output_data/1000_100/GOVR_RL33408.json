    "content": "The President's gravest decision is directing the use of nuclear weapons through Nuclear Command and Control (NC2). NC2 involves the President's authority over nuclear weapon operations, government activities, and multinational actions. The Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS) supports the President and Unified Command Commanders in exercising this authority. The Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS) is essential for planning, directing, and controlling nuclear weapon operations. It supports the President's authority over nuclear weapons and is part of Continuity of Government activities. Congress reviews Department of Defense's plans for the NCCS and its modernization. The NCCS architecture, shaped during the Cold War, may need restructuring due to evolving threats. Analysts suggest potential nuclear challenges from China, North Korea, or Iran, requiring robust NC2 with a different structure. Non-nuclear responses and active defenses could add complexity. Legacy systems may need to be retired per the 2006 QDR recommendations. The NCCS, often overlooked, plays a crucial role in supporting the Secretary of Defense and Joint Chiefs of Staff. It includes the National Military Command System (NMCS) for command and control of both nuclear and conventional forces. Proposed modernization initiatives aim to update the NCCS architecture in response to evolving threats. The National Military Command System (NMCS) includes command nodes such as the National Military Command Center (NMCC) and the National Airborne Operations Center (NAOC). The NMCC is responsible for day-to-day national command and control, monitoring nuclear forces and military operations, while the NAOC serves as a survivable command center if ground-based facilities are destroyed. The NAOC is a fleet of modified Boeing 747-200B aircraft based at Offutt AFB in Nebraska, serving as a survivable airborne backup to the NMCC's command and control capabilities. It includes communications hardened against Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) and is tasked by the Joint Staff, with personnel and administration provided by USSTRATCOM. Site-R in Maryland can serve as an alternate NMCC location, and USSTRATCOM's Global Operations Center (GOC) is also involved in the operations. The USSTRATCOM Global Operations Center (GOC) at Offutt AFB in Nebraska serves as a backup to the NMCC for emergency actions and day-to-day management. It is protected against EMP, has its own power supply, and is staffed 24/7 by senior military personnel. The USSTRATCOM Airborne Command Post (ABNCP) can serve as a survivable airborne backup if needed. The ABNCPs are modified Boeing 707 aircraft with a crew of 22, including aircrew, communications operators, and battlestaff led by an Airborne Emergency Action Officer. It can communicate launch codes to ICBM launch facilities and serve as a TACAMO relay for Navy ballistic missile submarines. The aircraft can deploy a trailing wire antenna for communication and use various communication systems. The USSTRATCOM Mobile Consolidated Command Center (MCCC) is a convoy of trucks that can deploy as a survivable road-mobile backup to the USSTRATCOM GOC or ABNCP. The Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS) has evolved to serve the President's requirements for advice and decision making for the strategic nuclear forces, including situation monitoring of the military, political, or physical environment. The NCCS centers monitor strategic intelligence from classified and open sources for indicators of upcoming events. This includes tracking weather for aircraft operations and quickly detecting and analyzing potential attacks to aid decision makers in shaping responses. The TW/AA centers use dual phenomenology to verify attacks, providing critical information for decision makers. The President consults with senior commanders and advisors, including the CJCS, for nuclear weapon decisions. Continuous updates on nuclear deterrent readiness are essential for force management. Force Management involves collecting data on the readiness of the nuclear deterrent and supporting forces, including forces available, locations, and maintenance/supply status. This information is presented in easily understandable formats for key leadership. Force Direction includes nuclear surety to prevent unauthorized use of nuclear weapons and positive control to ensure instructions to launch nuclear weapons are carried out if given by the President. It also encompasses employing forces and ending hostilities. The National Military Command System (NMCS) must be survivable, reliable, and support rapid connectivity between decision makers and forces during time critical events. It should operate in extreme environments and not generate false alarms or pass inaccurate information. The National Military Command System (NMCS) must be secure, limiting access to authorized personnel and ensuring communication authenticity. Security is crucial to prevent interference and hostile listening, especially with the rise of asymmetric threats like computer attacks. Nuclear command and control is central to deterrence, as highlighted in the DOD's 2001 Nuclear Posture Review directed by Congress. The curr_chunk discusses United States nuclear deterrence policy, including requirements for maintaining a credible posture, nuclear delivery systems, weapons complex, and stockpile management. J.D. Crouch, Assistant Secretary of Defense for International, is mentioned. On January 9, 2002, Assistant Secretary of Defense J.D. Crouch briefed the public on the unclassified aspects of the NPR report, highlighting the need for changes in response to evolving threats post-Cold War. The NPR emphasized reduced dependence on offensive nuclear forces for deterrence due to emerging threats from WMD proliferation and ballistic missiles. The DOD advocated for a \"capabilities based approach\" to address these unpredictable threats. The NPR report emphasized the need for a \"capabilities based approach\" to address evolving threats post-Cold War. It introduced a \"new triad\" of capabilities including offensive and defensive forces, as well as a responsive weapons infrastructure. Command, control, intelligence, and planning were central to linking these components. The NPR's new triad focuses on enhancing command and control for precision strike and defense forces, enabling adaptive planning to confront emerging threats, and integrating nuclear and non-nuclear forces for increased flexibility. The Bush Administration has started implementing this framework. USSTRATCOM implemented the 2001 NPR framework, taking on additional missions such as global strike, space operations, missile defense, and combating weapons of mass destruction. General James Cartwright established a Center for Combating Weapons of Mass Destruction in partnership with the Defense Threat Reduction Agency. The 2001 NPR framework has been incorporated into DOD doctrinal guidance, with a focus on deterring and responding to weapons of mass destruction threats. Joint Staff was working on updating its doctrine for Joint Nuclear Operations, emphasizing crisis action planning and integration of nuclear and non-nuclear forces. However, there are reports that this update may have been cancelled. The new joint doctrine would prioritize rapid crisis action planning for unexpected WMD threats. The concept of crisis action planning for unanticipated WMD threats is a carry-over from the 2001 NPR. Rapid planning is crucial for both conventional and nuclear combatant commands, requiring increased computer workstation capability, communication capacity, and integration with other military operations. Air forces are adapting to the need for daily dissemination of the Air Tasking Order in combat theaters. Networked planning systems are becoming standard, including for nuclear planning. Senior leaders now rely on video-teleconferencing for long-distance deliberations. Congress has directed a commission to review the implementation of the 2001 NPR and study the programmatic requirements needed to achieve its goals. The commission tasked with reviewing the 2001 NPR and studying programmatic requirements to achieve its goals is required to submit a report to Congress by June 30, 2007. The NPR suggests using precision non-nuclear weapons to fulfill missions previously allocated to nuclear weapons, but the continued presence of nuclear weapons in the U.S. arsenal seems likely. The policy for the role and uses of nuclear weapons is not addressed by the NPR, which could impact the required command and control architecture. The nuclear command and control systems were developed during the Cold War to manage a potential nuclear confrontation with the Soviet Union. However, as the post-Cold War environment evolves, questions arise about the relevance of this infrastructure today. The focus on robustness, redundancy, and survivability of the systems may need to be reevaluated in light of changing circumstances. The post-Cold War environment may require reevaluation of the nuclear command and control systems. Concerns during the Cold War included the threat of a \"decapitation attack\" targeting leadership to disrupt retaliation efforts and political control. During the Cold War, upgrades to nuclear command and control were made to ensure government control of weapons. The threat of a nuclear strike from Russia has decreased, with arms reduction treaties reducing deployed weapons significantly. In the current environment, reevaluation of nuclear command and control systems is necessary. In the current strategic environment, the necessity of a command and control architecture designed for a major nuclear exchange is questioned. Analysts warn of potential nuclear threats from China, with increasing military expenditures and advanced systems capable of targeting the United States. General Zhu Chenghu of China's National Defense University has threatened nuclear attacks on U.S. cities if the U.S. intervenes in Taiwan. Peter Brooks from the Heritage Foundation suggested that China may be seeking preeminence in the Pacific Rim and East Asia, while Kurt Campbell from the Center for Strategic and International Studies argued that the relationship with China is not a clear confrontation like the Cold War. Some analysts believe that highlighting a \"China threat\" is an attempt to find a great power peer competitor since the end of the Cold War. Some analysts argue that a potential threat from China's increasing nuclear capability could pose a survivability threat to the nuclear command and control system. Others believe that rogue states like Iran and North Korea, pursuing nuclear weapons, reinforce the need for a viable NC2 architecture. North Korea has been actively seeking nuclear weapons since the 1960s, with A.Q. Khan possibly aiding them in the 1990s. North Korea, with possible assistance from A.Q. Khan, announced having nuclear weapons in 2005. Estimates suggest they may possess around ten bombs. They have developed various missiles but it's uncertain if they can attach nuclear warheads. Reliable information on their capabilities is scarce. The U.S. intelligence community is hesitant to provide estimates on North Korean nuclear programs due to past criticisms. Some analysts believe North Korea's claims of having nuclear weapons are deceptive. The Iranian nuclear program is also a concern, with varying predictions on when they may acquire nuclear weapons. Some suggest Iran could have a bomb within two years, while others project a capability by 2009. Iran's nuclear activities at Natanz and other sites have raised suspicions, with concerns about developing long-range nuclear delivery systems. Reports suggest Iran's military is studying high explosives for nuclear weapon construction, linking it to the civilian nuclear program. Iran's aggressive rhetoric towards Israel and the U.S. heightens worries about their intentions. Iran's nuclear activities at Natanz and other sites have raised suspicions about hostile Iranian intentions. Nations with small nuclear arsenals could threaten U.S. infrastructure through an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) from a high-altitude nuclear explosion. This could lead to catastrophic failures in critical infrastructure elements, potentially resulting in the deaths of thousands or millions of people. The EMP Commission was chartered by Congress to assess the threat of an electromagnetic pulse attack, which could result in catastrophic failures in critical infrastructure and lead to the deaths of thousands or millions of people. Analysts suggest that China, North Korea, and Iran may be developing capabilities for such attacks. Some analysts suggest that launching a short-range missile from a freighter off the U.S. coast or generating a localized EMP burst could be potential strategies for an attack. However, there is skepticism about the extent of the EMP threat, as many military and commercial systems have EMP protection. The potential for catastrophic failures from a single weapon attack may not be as severe as some envision. Some analysts question the feasibility of using EMP against the continental United States due to unclear motivations and potential retaliatory consequences. The EMP Commission has raised concerns about the decline in EMP hardening and practice in the military since the 1990s. Congress has directed the reestablishment of the EMP Commission to deliver a report by June 30. The EMP Commission was directed to deliver a report by June 30, 2007, focusing on the vulnerability of military systems to EMP. The challenges for the nuclear command and control system include integrating nuclear and non-nuclear forces, as well as expanding its reach to include additional participants. The NPR recommendations may drive a demand for additional capacity and speed in decision-making processes involving non-nuclear forces. The process for directing release of non-nuclear strikes requires further development, including conventional attacks and non-kinetic options. The NPR recommendations may lead to a need for faster decision-making on non-nuclear forces, including conventional attacks and non-kinetic options. The question arises whether the President should also have authority over these non-nuclear options, although historically Presidents have not been heavily involved in planning specific conventional missions. The NPR recommendations may require faster decision-making on non-nuclear forces, including conventional attacks. The question of Presidential involvement in these non-nuclear options arises, especially in cases of strategic importance or criticality that might warrant Presidential authorization. The complexity increases when conventional weapons are mixed with nuclear weapons on the same platform. The NPR recommendations may require faster decision-making on non-nuclear forces, including conventional attacks. Concerns arise regarding non-kinetic strikes like cyber-attacks, which could have strategic impacts such as disrupting a nation's power grid. There are calls for increased Presidential involvement and control, especially when non-nuclear and non-kinetic responses are involved. Technical solutions for enforcing such control have not been discussed. The merging of active defenses, particularly missile defenses, into the NC2 architecture will require further adaptation. Approval processes may need to be revised to prevent delays in decision-making and implementation, ensuring critical targets are not missed. Decision-making on release authority for limited defensive capabilities will be necessary in some scenarios. In some scenarios, decision-making on release authority for limited defensive capabilities may require Presidential involvement, but analysts suggest delegating authority to the unified combatant commander to prevent delays in responding to incoming missiles. Choosing between defensive launches and offensive strikes may also need Presidential consideration to ensure timely decision-making. Successful coordination of offensive and defensive conversations is crucial in limited time frames. In limited time frames, decision-making on defensive responses may alter offensive options. Regional combatant commanders will be responsible for defense, requiring coordination with USSTRATCOM for missile defense programs. Multiple command centers will be involved in the process. The regional combatant commands like USCENTCOM and USNORTHCOM will have theater missile defense responsibilities. General Cartwright of USSTRATCOM has directed personnel to ensure interoperability of missile defense command and control systems. Bandwidth demands on networks will increase with more participants in decision conferences for missile defense. The ultimate customer for any command and control system involving defensive choices is the President. The system must present these choices for Presidential decision. The nuclear command and control system must present choices for Presidential decision, facilitate interaction with advisers, aid in quick decision-making, maintain tight control of nuclear weapons, and ensure clear and actionable orders for weapons operators. Additionally, these systems may have value beyond nuclear operations by supporting other military and government functions. The nuclear command and control system has versatile national assets that can support non-nuclear military forces direction and status monitoring, including during crises, conflicts, and peacetime contingencies. Command and control assets also aided in mitigation and recovery after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. The nuclear command and control system's assets, such as NORAD and NMCC, played a crucial role in coordinating the restoration of air traffic after the 9/11 attacks. These assets are essential for continuity of operations during domestic contingencies or natural disasters. President Bush utilized secure facilities like USSTRATCOM and U.S. Northern Command to monitor and communicate during crises like Hurricane Rita. The government utilizes nuclear command and control assets like the National Airborne Operations Center (NAOC) for disaster response. FEMA and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff have an agreement to use NAOC during emergencies. These systems provide versatile monitoring and communication capabilities for day-to-day support. The NMCC is easily accessible to senior government leadership in the Pentagon. The National Airborne Operations Center (NAOC) in the Pentagon is easily accessible to the Secretary of Defense and other DOD leadership. Secretary Rumsfeld relies on the NAOC for support during official travel. Using NC2 assets for missions beyond nuclear forces requires balancing tradeoffs and could lead to competition for access during crises. Tying these systems to other agency functions, like FEMA, may force the military to sustain systems that are no longer needed. The DOD chartered a committee in 2001 to conduct an \"End-to-End Review of the U.S. Nuclear Command and Control System,\" chaired by Brent Scowcroft. The commission examined the architecture from \"national command authority to individual weapons,\" considering new technology and potential threats. The End-to-End Review of the U.S. Nuclear Command and Control System highlighted issues with system survivability and recommended shifting life cycle management to operators. Maintenance and procedural discipline for system hardness may have eroded since the Cold War. The End-to-End Review recommended shifting life cycle management of NC2 systems to operators, as operator requirements for new capabilities are often not supported by acquisitions. Operator-generated requirements may be unrealistic or exceed program budgets, leading to a focus on technical capability over total costs of sustainment and operation. The debate continues on meeting operator needs and managing acquisition programs economically, with a concern about the decline in NC2 expertise since the end of the Cold War. This has led to a brain drain and lack of depth in key NC2 positions, potentially hindering responses during crises. The legacy NC2 architecture may face challenges from the Defense Department's military transformation towards more network-oriented operations. US Strategic Command has established subordinate functional component commands for specific mission aspects, promoting decentralization and collaboration. The 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review recommends significant changes in NC2 programs to enable USSTRATCOM's transition to distributed command and control capabilities. This includes retiring legacy mobile platforms like the E-4B NAOC aircraft and replacing them with C-32 aircraft. The new command and control capabilities must be survivable in the face of various threats, including WMD, electronic, or cyber-warfare attacks. DOD proposes tailored systems for WMD elimination, requiring robust communications infrastructure. USSTRATCOM is exploring an IP-based architecture, but concerns exist about rapid message transmission for nuclear command and control. Communication bandwidth is already strained due to a 500% growth in capacity requirements over the past decade. The DOD has seen a 500% growth in communications capacity needs over the past decade, with a 1000% increase in satellite communications since 9/11. The nuclear community will face competition for command and control links, with a potential 2500% growth in demand in the next 10 years. Integration of new systems like missile defense into the NC2 network raises questions about certification and compatibility, requiring coordination to avoid chaos in a distributed architecture. The DOD has seen a significant increase in communications capacity needs, especially in satellite communications, since 9/11. The nuclear community is facing competition for command and control links, with a potential growth in demand in the next decade. Integration of new systems like missile defense into the NC2 network raises questions about certification and compatibility in a distributed architecture. Key to avoiding chaos is the clear definition and enforcement of the chain of command and identification of the level empowered to direct action or forces. Upgrades and enhancements of existing systems, rather than the procurement of new systems, are a focus in the DOD's budget requests for the nuclear command and control system. The Minimum Essential Emergency Communications Network (MEECN) is being upgraded with funds allocated for procurement and research and development. The FY2006 Defense Authorization Act authorized amounts for R&D and the FY2006 Defense Appropriations Act funded $49 million for R&D. The FY2007 budget request includes $3.4 million for procurement and $64.1 million for R&D. Modernization efforts in MEECN include upgrades for data rate terminals, secure computer terminals, and satellite communications for Minuteman ICBM Launch Control Centers. The Minuteman MEECN Program involves upgrades to Minuteman ICBM Launch Control Centers in the upper Midwest US. The Ground Element MEECN System is installing VLF and EHF communications for bomber and tanker forces. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld is directing upgrades to the National Military Command System, including consolidating separate command centers into two new centers in the Pentagon. These new centers will focus on tracking global crises and meeting the Secretary's and Chairman's requirements. The Defense Department is consolidating separate command centers into two new facilities in the Pentagon to track global crises and provide military advice to the President. The consolidation aims to create efficiencies, reduce manpower, and enhance survivability against various threats. Funding for planning and engineering is requested for FY2006 and onwards, with Congress authorizing the full amount for FY2006. Additional funding is sought for FY2007. The Defense Department is seeking funding for various projects including missile warning systems, airborne command and control platforms, and research and development for FY2007. Congress funded the full DOD request for FY2006 and additional funds are requested for FY2007. The Defense Department requested $5.6 million for E-4B modifications procurement and $283 thousand for R&D in FY2007. The funds will cover improvements to aircraft structures, propulsion, fuel systems, environmental controls, electrical generation, and flight safety, including updates to audio distribution equipment, development of an \"office in the sky\" for senior leaders, improvements to the aircraft's LAN, and transition from analog to digital UHF radio link. The Defense Department requested upgrades for the E-6B aircraft, including precision navigation, integration with air traffic systems, cockpit displays, and mission system improvements. The modifications would cost $11.2 million for procurement and $31.4 million for RDT&E. The Navy argues that the airframe has exceeded its service life and needs upgrades to replace legacy computers and communication equipment. The Navy requested upgrades for the E-6B aircraft due to unsupportable communications equipment after 2010. Congress supported the request in the FY2006 Defense Authorization Act, providing funding for procurement and R&D. The Defense Department is seeking funds for E-6 modifications and research in FY2007. The acquisition of the Advanced EHF communications satellite is a key aspect of nuclear command and control modernization programs to replace the aging MILSTAR satellite constellation. The AEHF system, with five satellites launched since 1994, provides secure communications capabilities. Lockheed Martin and Northrop-Grumman are contractors for the program. Congress fully funded the Air Force budget request for AEHF in FY2006. In FY2007, the Air Force seeks $633 million for R&D, as procurement funds have already been allocated for the three satellites. The AEHF program, seeking $633 million for FY2007, has faced schedule delays and cost overruns. Technical issues with communications encryption equipment have caused delays, with the first launch now targeted for 2008 instead of late 2004. The program's estimated cost has grown to over $7 billion, prompting a Nunn-McCurdy notification to Congress. AEHF is intended to bridge between MILSTAR and the TSAT program, which is set to launch in 2013 with advanced capabilities. The TSAT program faced a two-year delay due to budget cuts and immature technologies. Congress considered additional AEHF satellites as a backup plan and reduced funding for TSAT in FY2006. The focus shifted to technology development rather than acquisition. Congress approved $436-plus million for the acquisition program, reserving $120 million for either a fourth AEHF satellite or continued systems development for TSAT. The NCCS faces challenges due to increased demands driven by the 2001 NPR and DOD policy, competing for budget priority against conventional systems. The system's value lies in its ability to fulfill missions beyond traditional DOD purview, despite differing opinions on its relevance in today's threat environment. The NCCS faces challenges in fulfilling missions beyond traditional DOD purview, with competing budget priorities and evolving threat perceptions, particularly regarding China's role in the global community. The role of nuclear weapons in U.S. strategy is debated, with some advocating for reduction to support non-proliferation efforts, while others want to increase their utility against proliferators. The architecture of the NCCS is questioned, with concerns about the current centralized system developed during the Cold War. Revisions to the NCCS architecture may need to incorporate additional command and control requirements for non-nuclear offensive responses and missile defense. A debate on release authorities and potential legislation may precede architectural decisions. A more dispersed approach, like the one proposed by USSTRATCOM, could be more suitable for the current threat environment, potentially leading to manpower and budget savings in the long term. However, the application of a distributed, network style approach to nuclear command and control has not been tested. The level of investment needed for modernization or new procurement is still uncertain, with ongoing initiatives projected to continue for years. The retirement of the E-4B NAOC and MCCC may offer short term savings as services look to recapitalize equipment. Questions arise about the adequacy and necessity of existing NCCS platforms, as well as their value for secondary uses. With increasing focus on homeland security and disaster response, some platforms could have greater utility, raising the question of continued investment in functions beyond primary mission requirements. The text questions the justification for continued investment in NCCS platforms if their primary mission requirements are surpassed, and whether their procurement and operation should be transferred to civilian agencies."
