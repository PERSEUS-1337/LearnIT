    "content": "The Act titled \"Red River Private Property Protection Act\" disclaims the Secretary's right to land south of the Red River's South Bank boundary line. Previous surveys by the Bureau of Land Management will not determine the current boundary line. The \"Red River Private Property Protection Act\" requires a new survey to identify the current South Bank boundary line, conducted by Licensed State Land Surveyors chosen by the Texas General Land Office and completed within 2 years. The survey must adhere to the gradient boundary survey method and be approved by the Texas General Land Office. SEC. 4. APPEAL.\n\nWithin 1 year of survey approval, private property owners can appeal public domain claims to an Administrative Law Judge.\n\nSEC. 5. RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PLAN.\n\nFederal land designation for resource management plans is prohibited until survey approval and appeal process completion.\n\nSEC. 6. CONSTRUCTION.\n\nThis Act does not impact State or tribal sovereignty over lands north of the Red River's South Bank boundary.\n\nSEC. 7. SALE OF REMAINING RED RIVER SURFACE RIGHTS. After survey approval and resolution of any appeals, remaining identified Federal lands will be offered for competitive sale at fair market value. Sales are subject to existing tribal, State, and local rights, with proceeds used to offset Act-related costs. A report must be submitted within 5 years of enactment. The Secretary must report to Congress within 5 years of the Act's enactment on any Federal lands not sold and the reasons for not selling them. SEC. 8. DEFINITIONS. For the purposes of this Act, the term \"affected area\" refers to lands along a 116-mile stretch of the Red River between Texas and Oklahoma. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior, and \"South Bank\" refers to the water-washed elevation along the southerly side of the Red River. The term \"South Bank boundary line\" refers to the boundary between Texas and Oklahoma identified through the gradient boundary survey method, as specified in a decree rendered in Oklahoma v. Texas on March 12, 1923. The \"gradient boundary survey method\" is the measurement technique used to locate this boundary line along the Red River, recognizing that it is subject to changes. The Red River boundary line between Texas and Oklahoma is subject to natural changes like erosion and accretion, as outlined in a 1923 decree in Oklahoma v. Texas."
