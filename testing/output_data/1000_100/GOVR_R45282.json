    "content": "FIFRA requires EPA to review and register pesticide products, establish maximum limits for pesticide residues in food, and assess fees on pesticide manufacturers for registrations. Congress has authorized fee collection since 1954 to help fund EPA's pesticide regulatory activities. The Pesticide Registration Improvement Act of 2003 (PRIA 1) established a fee framework to fund EPA's pesticide regulatory activities. PRIA 1 authorized the collection of maintenance and registration service fees to expedite EPA's review of pesticide registrations. The Pesticide Registration Improvement Act of 2003 (PRIA 1) established a fee framework for EPA's pesticide regulatory activities. PRIA 2 and PRIA 3 amended the framework, adding new application categories, revising decision timeframes, and adjusting fee amounts. The current framework, extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, outlines the authority to collect pesticide maintenance fees. The authority to collect pesticide maintenance fees expires on September 30, 2018, as outlined in the Appropriations Act, 2018. FIFRA Section 4, amended by PRIA 3, sets annual maximum maintenance fees per registrant based on registrations held. EPA may cancel pesticide registrations if maintenance fees are not paid. Small businesses receive fee reductions, and certain public health pesticides are exempt from maintenance fees. Collected fees are deposited in the \"Reregistration and Expedited Processing Fund\" for EPA's use in offsetting evaluation costs. The EPA receives mandatory appropriations for evaluating inert ingredients, processing applications, and reevaluating pesticides. Section 4 allocates funds for enhancing information systems. The authority to collect registration service fees will phase out starting in FY2018. If not extended, fees will be reduced by 70% in FY2019 and expire by the end of the year. FIFRA Section 33, amended by PRIA 3, sets registration service fee amounts for various actions requested by applicants. EPA must complete actions within specified timeframes. The current fee schedule allows for fee reductions for small businesses and exemptions for certain applications. Tolerance setting in the public interest and governmental entities are exempt from fees. EPA has the authority to collect registration service fees under FIFRA Section 33. Section 33 of FIFRA requires EPA to collect registration service fees in advance through annual appropriations. The EPA cannot assess fees if appropriations for specified functions are below FY2012 levels. However, from FY2013 to FY2018, EPA was authorized to collect fees regardless of appropriations. Collected fees must be deposited in the \"Pesticide Registration Fund\" in the U.S. Treasury. The \"Pesticide Registration Fund\" in the U.S. Treasury receives fee receipts for pesticide registration. These receipts can be used for various purposes such as application review, worker protection activities, grants, and education programs. The fund is audited annually as required by FIFRA and the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990. The Inspector General must submit audit findings and recommendations to EPA and congressional committees. FIFRA requires EPA to report annually on pesticide program activities. Congress appropriated $8.89 billion for EPA in FY2018. The exact amount for EPA's Office of Pesticide Programs is not readily reported. EPA is authorized to assess registration service fees. Maintenance fees collected from FY2004 to FY2018 ranged from $21.4 million to $28.7 million. Collected maintenance and registration service fees from FY2004 to FY2018 ranged from $21.4 million to $28.7 million and $10.6 million to $18.6 million per fiscal year, respectively. These fees are estimated to provide one-fourth of the total appropriation for EPA's pesticide program activities. Congress initiated legislative efforts to reauthorize fee collection in 2017, with separate versions of reauthorization legislation passed by the House and Senate awaiting resolution of differences. The Senate passed an amendment to H.R. 1029, renamed the Pesticide Registration Improvement Extension Act of 2018, reauthorizing the collection of maintenance fees and registration service fees through FY2023 and FY2025. The bill increases the cap on annual maintenance fees per registrant by 12% and directs EPA to set aside funds for expedited rulemaking and guidance development related to evaluating pesticides. The Senate amendment to H.R. 1029 would require EPA to carry out two final rules before October 1, 2021, related to enhancing good laboratory practices standards compliance monitoring and revising registration service fee amounts. EPA would also be authorized to propose and promulgate revisions to agricultural worker protection standards. The Senate amendment to H.R. 1029 authorizes EPA to propose revisions to standards for pesticide applicators, including addressing application exclusion zones. It also directs the U.S. Government Accountability Office to report on designated representatives' impact on pesticide application information and worker safety. The House and Senate versions of H.R. 2, the Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018, are being reconciled in a conference to resolve differences. Previous PRIA reauthorizations were passed without roll call votes, indicating broad support for extending the pesticide fee framework. Members have acknowledged a coalition of organizations that helped develop PRIA in the early 2000s. The current PRIA reauthorization has not been finalized due to disagreements between the House and Senate on EPA administration and enforcement of certain FIFRA regulations."
