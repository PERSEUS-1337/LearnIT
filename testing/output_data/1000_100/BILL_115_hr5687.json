The Secretary may issue an order requiring the holder of a covered application to implement technologies for packaging or disposal of drugs to mitigate abuse or misuse, after consulting with stakeholders. The Secretary may issue an order requiring technologies, controls, or measures to reduce the risk of abuse or misuse of a drug listed in a covered application, while ensuring patient access is not unduly burdened. The order may provide options for implementing these measures.

Alternatively, a requested alternative date may be agreed upon if submitted within 60 calendar days of the order. The holder of a covered application must implement approved changes within 90 calendar days or a longer period approved by the Secretary. Alternative technologies and controls may be proposed and approved by the Secretary.
