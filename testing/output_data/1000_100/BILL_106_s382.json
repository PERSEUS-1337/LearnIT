    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Minuteman Missile National Historic Site Establishment Act of 1999\". Congress finds that the Minuteman II intercontinental ballistic missile launch control facility and launch facility known as \"Delta 1\" and \"Delta 9\" are significant examples of American history during the Cold War. These facilities symbolize the dedication of Air Force missileers stationed in remote locations, provide insight into the Cold War, arms race, and ICBM development, and fill a gap in the National Park System's representation of the Cold War. The Act aims to preserve and interpret structures related to the Minuteman II missile defense system, highlight its historical significance in America's strategic commitment to world peace and the Cold War, and enhance interpretive programs offered by the South Dakota Air and Space Museum. The Act establishes the Minuteman Missile National Historic Site to preserve structures related to the Minuteman II missile defense system.
