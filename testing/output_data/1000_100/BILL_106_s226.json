The Nigerian Democracy and Civil Society Empowerment Act of 1999 includes findings that highlight the negative impact of successive military regimes in Nigeria, the progress made by the current regime under Gen. Abdusalami Abubakar, and the need for a transition to civilian rule. Since 1993, limited sanctions have been imposed on Nigeria by the United States and the international community due to human rights violations and political repression. Despite some progress in protecting freedoms, decrees still exist that suspend constitutional rights, allow indefinite detention without charge, and revoke civilian court jurisdiction over executive actions. Nigeria remains a haven for international drug trafficking rings and criminal organizations, with the government cooperating with the United States to combat trafficking. Despite being a party to various human rights agreements, Nigeria's recent history raises doubts about the success of its transition process. Nigeria has played a significant role in peacekeeping efforts in Liberia and Sierra Leone. The events in the Niger Delta highlight the urgent need for stability. The events in the Niger Delta over the New Year emphasize the importance of ongoing monitoring and the potential for the military to resort to repressive methods. Congress declares support for political, economic, and legal reforms in Nigeria to ensure respect for human rights and a transition to democratic civilian government. The Sense of Congress is stated in Section 3. The Sense of Congress is that the President should coordinate with other countries to promote the rule of law, respect for human rights, and transition to democratic civilian government. Additionally, the President should instruct the US Representative to the UN Human Rights Commission to condemn human rights abuses in Nigeria and advocate for the renewal of the mandate. The Sense of Congress is to promote the rule of law, human rights, and democratic civilian government. They also urge for the renewal of the mandate for the special rapporteur on Nigeria. Assistance to promote democracy and civil society in Nigeria. Development Assistance for Nigeria under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 should allocate specific amounts for promoting democracy, good governance, and the rule of law through assistance to nongovernmental organizations. The Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development must ensure that nongovernmental organizations in Nigeria receiving assistance promote democracy, human rights, and accountable government. Additionally, grants of at least $500,000 per fiscal year should be available to support individuals or organizations advancing human rights in Nigeria. The United States Information Agency should receive funding to support activities in Nigeria promoting democracy, the rule of law, and human rights. Congress acknowledges inadequate staff levels at the United States Agency for International Development in Lagos, Nigeria. The United States Information Agency in Nigeria needs more personnel to support democracy, the rule of law, and human rights. Additional staff should be placed in Lagos and other parts of Nigeria to effectively carry out their mission.

The text chunk outlines Congress's stance on Nigerian nationals' admission to the United States and the denial of visas to certain government and military officials if a democratic transition in Nigeria is not certified by the President by July 1, 1999. The President may waive prohibitions in sections 5 or 6 for a fiscal year if a determination is made that the Government of Nigeria is respecting human rights and democracy, implementing a transition program, and upholding freedom of speech and the media. The Government of Nigeria has released imprisoned individuals, provided access for human rights monitors, repealed laws granting undue powers to the military, suspended constitutional protections, and ensured proper policing of the oil sector. The Government of Nigeria has taken steps to improve human rights conditions, including releasing prisoners, allowing human rights monitoring, and reforming military powers.
