    "content": "This report, General Management Laws: Major Themes and Management Policy Options, along with the companion CRS Report RL30795, aims to identify and describe key general management laws governing the executive branch. It assists Congress in overseeing executive branch management and considering potential changes to management laws and legislation. The compendium profiles selected general management laws crucial for maintaining accountability in the executive branch. The report focuses on general management laws that are crucial for maintaining accountability in the executive branch and influencing the effectiveness of federal agencies in implementing public policies. It includes over 90 entries organized into seven functional categories and will be updated to reflect actions taken by Congress. The report focuses on general management laws essential for accountability in the executive branch and agency effectiveness. It includes over 90 entries categorized into seven functional areas, such as Information Management and Human Resources. The entries profile specific laws, with a focus on civil service laws codified in Title 5 of the United States Code. The report provides a comprehensive overview of general management laws in the executive branch, including civil service laws in Title 5 of the United States Code. It discusses the roles of Congress and the President in managing the executive branch, compares management in public and private sectors, and analyzes key themes and policy options. The President and Congress both manage the executive branch, with a system of separated powers and checks and balances. The question is how they share power in managing federal agencies, as outlined by Justice Robert Jackson. The Constitution grants Congress the power to establish and regulate administrative agencies, while also giving the President authority to manage the executive branch. This balance of power is outlined in the system of separated powers and checks and balances between the President and Congress. The President's duty is to ensure officials obey Congress's instructions, as the 'take Care' clause in Article II does not grant unlimited power. Article II mentions executive departments and the President's appointment powers. In 1789, Congress enacted laws establishing the Treasury Department and federal financial management system. In 1789, Congress established the federal government's financial management system and set annual salaries for Secretaries of the Treasury, State, and War. By 1801, the Federalists had created an administrative system with an independent chief executive and effective delegation of authority. After 1801, the Democratic-Republicans under Thomas Jefferson continued the Federalist framework for government administration. Congress became more involved in the administrative system, which struggled with increasing workload. Federal employment grew significantly from 1816 to 1861, and executive departments became more complex. In 1861, the organization of executive departments became more complex with the addition of bureaus handling routine business, leading to significant challenges in managing the executive branch. This complexity was further exacerbated by developments after the Civil War, including industrialization, the Progressive Movement, efforts to combat the Great Depression, and two world wars. By 1946, measures were taken to address the growing administrative state. By 1946, Congress had delegated much legislative authority to administrative agencies, leading to the executive branch taking the initiative in policy making and budgeting. Observers noted that agencies sometimes exercised legislative powers, prompting Congress to expand general management laws to improve executive branch management practices. This included increasing transparency in oversight through legislation like the Administrative. Congress has improved oversight of the executive branch through legislation such as the Administrative Procedure Act (1946) and the Freedom of Information Act (1966). They also established inspectors general in 1978 and enacted the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act in 1974 to reassert influence over the budget process. Additionally, laws like the Chief Financial Officers Act (1990) were passed to improve agencies' financial management capacities. The compendium's entries illustrate various aspects of general management laws, questioning whether they bring disciplined management or stifle flexibility. The conclusion depends on the viewpoint and situation, with history shedding light on the matter. Numerous controversial issues remain for Congress to consider. Scholars debate the comparison of management practices in public and private sectors, cautioning against applying private-sector principles to government agencies. Public administration scholar Wallace Sayre's aphorism highlights the fundamental similarities with key differences that should be respected. Public-sector agencies and private-sector companies operate under different laws to regulate their behaviors. The government has coercive power under the Constitution and public law, while private companies operate under laws to regulate the market economy. Federal government agencies must act within the authority of public law, established by Congress, the President, and the courts. Laws regulating market economy, such as antitrust and financial reporting laws, do not dictate company operations. Companies are primarily accountable to owners/shareholders. Government agencies differ as they cannot retain earnings for private benefit, allocate resources based on preferences, or choose their own goals. Control over revenues, resources, and goals is largely in the hands of entities. The control over revenues, resources, and goals of government agencies is largely influenced by external entities like legislatures, courts, politicians, and interest groups. Agency managers must address the demands of these external entities, which can make measuring agency performance challenging. The differences between public and private sector management practices highlighted in general management laws can raise public policy issues for specific agencies. Congress faces management policy options when considering these themes in the compendium of general management laws. The debate over how much discretion to give the executive branch in determining agency actions has been a longstanding issue for Congress. Providing flexibility to agencies allows for tailored implementation of laws and quicker responses to changing circumstances. This discretion is argued to expedite regulatory processes and management actions compared to the time needed for new legislation. The debate over granting discretion to the executive branch in agency actions has been ongoing. Some argue that the executive is better equipped for technical judgments, while others raise concerns about decisions not supported by Congress. Discretion can lead to actions that differ from Congress's views, potentially lacking transparency and accountability. Granting discretion may also empower unelected agency officials, limiting oversight and intervention by Congress. In 2002 and 2003, Congress faced tension between flexibility and accountability when considering granting discretion to DHS and DOD for their HRM systems. Similar debates occurred in 1993 with the NPR's recommendations on procurement policy. The regulatory arena often sees this tension when Congress decides on agency discretion. Scholars have identified four general options for Congress to address delegation situations. Congress can address delegation situations by setting conditions for authority delegation to ensure executive branch compliance and reduce adverse consequences. This can include establishing goals, sanctions, probation periods, or sunsets, requiring pilot projects, or creating \"profit-sharing relationships\" to incentivize agency behavior. Screening and selection mechanisms can also be implemented to prevent poor performance by agencies. Congress can ensure effective agency performance by looking for signals beforehand, such as rigorous problem analysis and organizational capacity. They can also increase accountability through monitoring and reporting requirements for agency actions and milestones. The advent of information technology and the Web may enable real-time reporting to Congress, but some argue that excessive reporting requirements can be burdensome. Institutional checks like involving additional agencies or entities can help ensure oversight of delegated agency actions. The tension between standardization and customization in management laws for agencies is a frequent issue for Congress. Experts believe standardization can improve transparency and accountability in the executive branch. Standardization in the executive branch, such as through the Administrative Procedure Act and the CFO Act, promotes transparency and accountability. Congress has introduced standardization in various functional areas to ensure agencies meet basic requirements and prepare audited financial statements. This has led to agencies receiving clean opinions on their financial statements. Standardization also places the burden of proof on agencies, further promoting accountability. Customization in agency management aligns with internal and external environments. Congress uses statutes and reports to direct agency actions. Small agencies were exempt from audited financial statements until recently. The CFO position at DHS was not initially subject to the CFO Act. The Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) allows for a mixed approach in applying general management laws to agencies, balancing standardization with customization. Congress can make exceptions or allow flexibility within broader requirements. The Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) required executive branch agencies to develop strategic plans, allowing for a mixed approach of standardization and customization. Standardization can be rigid, while customization may reduce transparency and accountability if not monitored effectively. Congress has policy options to avoid problems that arise from agencies gaining pay flexibility and engaging in bidding wars for employees. The decision to use these approaches depends on various factors, including the nature of the problem, stakeholders' perspectives, and historical context. Regularly evaluating the need for customization or standardization in management laws can improve transparency, accountability, efficiency, and effectiveness. Analytical support can be obtained from agency management, program evaluations, inspectors general, and other sources. The decision to use policy options to avoid problems from agencies gaining pay flexibility depends on various factors, including stakeholders' perspectives and historical context. Regularly evaluating the need for customization or standardization in management laws can improve transparency, accountability, efficiency, and effectiveness. Analytical support can be obtained from various sources including agency management, program evaluations, inspectors general, and outside scholars. Maintaining real-time descriptions of the current state of affairs and updated comparisons across agencies can help monitor government-wide developments in areas like pay, performance management, and adverse actions. Establishment of reporting requirements in areas of widespread customization may help reduce the analytical burden for Congress and the public in examining the extent of customization and standardization. Central management agencies like OMB, OPM, GSA, FMS, or others could report how management policies are customized to facilitate government-wide analysis. Reporting on a real-time basis on the Web could be possible, but would likely entail costs for the reporting agencies. The general management laws are categorized into functions like financial management, human resources, and procurement. Organizations in both private and public sectors typically operate with a functional orientation. This perspective is valued for its efficiency and centralized control benefits, but excessive focus on functions can hinder organization-wide coordination and development of general managers. Functional silos can inhibit general managers, leading to missed opportunities or organizational problems. Management literature emphasizes the importance of an integrated, general management perspective over isolated functional perspectives. Different backgrounds and experiences shape individuals' viewpoints on problems, opportunities, or decisions. The importance of a general management perspective is highlighted to integrate multiple functional perspectives for a complete understanding of problems or opportunities. This approach can provide a toolbox of options for addressing executive branch management problems, such as using information technology to improve human resources and financial management. The general management laws offer a toolbox of options for addressing executive branch management problems by integrating functional perspectives and leveraging legislative tools like the E-Government Act of 2002 for improved financial and performance reporting. The E-Government Act of 2002 offers options for improving financial and performance reporting by utilizing the Federal Enterprise Architecture, directing appropriations for hiring contract oversight specialists, restructuring budget accounts, and aligning resources with individual programs and evaluations. The E-Government Act of 2002 provides options for improving financial and performance reporting by aligning resources with programs and evaluations. This can be achieved by leveraging various functional perspectives such as information policy, regulation, strategic planning, performance measurement, program evaluation, auditing, investigation, financial management, and human resources management. The history of federal government management reform includes efforts to improve agencies' performance, organization, and management practices. Despite challenges, progress has been difficult to achieve in ensuring executive branch agencies comply with general management laws and measure their progress. Management literature suggests that measurement can motivate action. Measurement systems can motivate action and commitment, but they can also create perverse incentives. For example, rewarding employees based only on short-term profits may lead to neglect of long-term performance. Similarly, achieving clean financial audits may not indicate good fiscal management if achieved through brute force rather than addressing deficient systems. In the last 25 years, agency inspectors general and the GAO have reported persistent management problems in executive branch agencies. GAO released reports detailing \"high risk\" areas and major challenges, noting progress but also highlighting remaining work to be done in addressing these issues. During the last 25 years, various management reform initiatives were pursued by presidential administrations, including Reagan's Reform '88, Bush's efforts in financial and information management, and Clinton's NPR. Concerns about government management were frequently expressed by Congress, with recommendations made to improve central management, procurement, information resources, financial management, and human resources. In 2001, Senator Fred Thompson released a report highlighting \"urgent federal government management problems.\" In 2001, a report highlighted \"urgent federal government management problems\" faced by the administration of President George W. Bush, including workforce, financial, and information technology issues. President Bush's Office of Management and Budget released the President's Management Agenda (PMA) with five government-wide initiatives to address these problems. The PMA includes Strategic Management of Human Capital, Competitive Sourcing, Improved Financial Performance, Expanded Electronic Government, and Budget and Performance Integration. OMB conducts quarterly evaluations of agencies based on \"stoplight scores\" to track progress on these initiatives. The PMA website categorizes agency progress as green, yellow, or red based on meeting initiative standards. OMB evaluates agencies on deliverables and timelines, with green indicating on-track implementation, yellow showing slippage, and red signaling serious jeopardy. The five government-wide PMA initiatives are Strategic Management of Human Capital, Competitive Sourcing, Improved Financial Performance, Expanded Electronic Government, and Budget and Performance Integration. The five government-wide PMA initiatives are categorized into functional categories and are meant to be mutually reinforcing. They leverage various general management laws to achieve their goals, such as the FAIR Act, Antideficiency Act, Chief Financial Officers Act, and others. The PMA initiatives leverage various general management laws to achieve their goals, such as the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993. Some agencies have reported significant progress, but there are concerns about transparency in PMA evaluation practices, particularly in comparison to the more transparent OMB assessments using the Program Assessment Rating Tool. The OMB's integration initiative increased transparency by publishing detailed worksheets for agency program assessments. Subjectivity may be present in stoplight scoring criteria for initiatives like Expanded Electronic Government and Strategic Management of Human Capital. Independent evaluation organizations have not verified agency stoplight scores, and the PMA's scope may not cover all aspects. The PMA's scope may not cover all aspects of general management laws, such as contract oversight and small business concerns. Real property management issues are also not explicitly addressed. Various entities have tried to influence agencies to improve management practices over the years. Some in Congress have implemented measurement efforts to evaluate agency compliance with general management laws. Representative Stephen Horn and Adam Putnam issued letter grades for financial management and information security performance. Senator Fred Thompson also graded agency annual performance reports. Congress seeks options to ensure agencies improve management practices. Congress is exploring options to measure and monitor agency progress in improving management practices, including using existing oversight tools like GAO and agency IGs. Critics argue that Congress does not use these tools effectively or frequently enough. Independent verification may be necessary. Congress could improve oversight by directing GAO and agency IGs to verify and validate PMA stoplight scores, increase transparency by accessing final PMA stoplight worksheets, and implement independent measurement through GAO or IGs. Congress could direct GAO or IGs to develop measures to systematically measure agency progress in improving management practices, potentially comparing across agencies. This option may increase workload and costs but could provide more systematic management improvement measurement. Alternatively, Congress could amend GPRA to require agencies to address major management problems and high-risk areas in their strategic plans and performance reports, establishing milestones for improvement. The expanding set of agency \"chief officer\" positions and interagency councils is a major theme in general management laws, requiring agencies to improve management capacity and address issues in government-wide performance plans. This could increase workload for agency and OMB personnel. The establishment of various chief officer positions within agencies, such as inspectors general, chief financial officers, chief information officers, chief human capital officers, and chief acquisition officers, is summarized in Table 1 with key information about each position. Some officers are presidentially appointed with Senate confirmation. Some chief officer positions within agencies are presidentially appointed with Senate confirmation, while others may be appointed by an agency head. Certain positions require political appointees, while reporting relationships vary among the officers. The creation of these positions aimed to address the lack of attention to functional perspectives in agency management. Many observers believed that functional perspectives within agencies needed to be elevated in management ranks to address long-standing problems. Chief officers were placed into interagency councils by statute or executive order, with varying memberships. Four councils were established by law, while two exist through executive order. The Office of Management and Budget's deputy director for management chairs or vice-chairs various councils, allowing the Executive Office of the President to influence their activities. The first council, the President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency (PCIE), was established by President Ronald Reagan in 1981 to combat fraud and waste in government programs. The PCIE became a valuable tool for agency IGs to advocate for resources and independence, as well as to build informal networks for organizational learning. The PCIE was established by President Ronald Reagan in 1981 to combat fraud and waste in government programs. It allowed IGs to share ideas and cooperate on projects, leading to the development of standing committees. While praised for promoting collaboration and providing a unique mechanism for addressing issues, the PCIE was also criticized as a \"trade union\" for IGs. President George H. criticized the PCIE in the late 1980s. In 1992, President George H. W. Bush established two IG councils, the PCIE for presidentially appointed IGs and the Executive Council on Integrity and Efficiency (ECIE) for IGs typically appointed by agency heads. The Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Council was created by the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990, which also established the deputy director for management (DDM) position in the President's Office of Management and Budget. The CFO Act gave the DDM chairperson status over the CFO Council and charged the DDM with overall responsibility for establishing \"general management policies\" in the executive branch. The CFO Council, established by the CFO Act of 1990, initially passive, recommended actions in 1994 to energize the council. OMB supported the recommendations, broadening membership and allowing council officers to set the agenda. The CFO Council formed committees for special emphasis areas and serves as a model for interagency efforts. The CFO Council, established by the CFO Act of 1990, recommended actions in 1994 to energize the council. Congress later established the CIO Council in 2002, the CHCO Council in 2002, and the CAO Council in 2003. The establishment of IGs, CFOs, and CIOs has been successful in bringing focus to agency management practices, despite facing challenges such as high turnover among CIOs and difficulties with change management. Some commentators argue that agencies face management difficulties due to budget pressures and lack of attention from political appointees. Management scholars are wary of functional silos that hinder a more integrated management perspective. Interagency councils have been both effective and beneficial, with increasing attention from public management scholars on the benefits of interagency collaboration. Interagency councils play an important role in improving federal management by facilitating knowledge sharing and best practices among human capital officers. This collaborative approach is seen as valuable in enhancing organizational performance, as highlighted in the management literature and practiced in many companies and government agencies. Some scholars and practitioners suggest re-thinking the structure and role of OMB within the Executive Office of the President to improve federal executive branch management. Questions arise about the need for additional chief officers in executive branch agencies and how to preserve institutional memory for political appointees in these positions. The need for additional chief officers in executive branch agencies is being considered, including the establishment of agency \"chief security officers\" (CSOs) to ensure government services are available in emergencies. Over half of surveyed corporate CEOs have designated CSOs, many of whom focus on information technology and report to the company CIO. The establishment of agency \"chief security officers\" (CSOs) is being considered to ensure government services are available in emergencies. CSOs may handle all security responsibilities, including IT, access to buildings, and grounds. While some argue that creating more chief officer positions could be excessive, it could bring a more integrated approach to security and risk management at federal agencies. Many agencies may already have systems in place to address these issues, but there are concerns about the lack of evaluation of program performance and results across agency boundaries. Establishing \"chief program evaluation officer\" (CPEO) positions in major agencies could bring more attention to evaluation efforts, helping improve performance and coordinate programs with overlapping missions. Critics may argue that creating additional chief officer positions would be excessive. If Congress decides to alter existing chief officer positions or establish new ones, there are various options to consider. If Congress decides to alter existing chief officer positions or establish new ones, there are various options to consider. Existing chief officers can be political, career, or at the agency head's discretion. Political appointees provide a functional perspective, while career officials offer continuity and institutional memory. Similar arguments were made for CAOs in recent discussions. In enacting the CFO Act, Congress reflected perspectives on chief officer reporting relationships. CFOs and CIOs must report directly to the agency head, while IGs report to the agency head or the official \"next in rank.\" CHCOs and CAOs reporting relationships are at the agency head's discretion. Direct reporting to the agency head ensures chief officers have personal access to senior leadership, but it could overwhelm agency heads with too many direct reports. The possibility of adding an additional direct report to executive branch agencies could lead to an excessive span of control for agency heads. Congress is considering making the IG councils statutory to enhance training, strengthen relationships with Congress, and improve coordination among IG offices. This change may require modest appropriations but could limit the President's flexibility and control. The funding for interagency councils is provided through various methods, such as self-financing via MOUs for IG councils and budget allocation for the CHCO Council. Operations for the CHCO Council are funded by the Office of Personnel Management, while other councils may receive funding from different sources. The CFO, CIO, and Procurement Executives Councils have been funded through interagency transfers or reimbursements in recent years. Congress could maintain the current funding method or consider separate appropriations for each council. This could potentially increase congressional control and improve institutional memory and continuity across presidential administrations. Congress could consider altering reporting and strategic planning requirements for interagency councils. Some councils have no reporting or planning requirements, while others only report to the President or Congress without articulating strategic plans. The CFO, CIO, and CAO Councils lack statutory requirements to report or prepare plans for Congress. OMB could be required to submit an overall plan for leading the chief officer councils as part of the government-wide performance plan. The government-wide performance plan required by GPRA could increase transparency and accountability of interagency councils to Congress. However, implementing planning and reporting requirements may limit the President's discretion and raise costs for the councils or OMB."
