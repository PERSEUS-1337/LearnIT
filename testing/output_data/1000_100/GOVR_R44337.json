    "content": "The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) is a regional free trade agreement among 12 Pacific-facing nations, pending congressional approval. It aims to liberalize trade in goods and services, including agricultural products, potentially benefiting U.S. food and agricultural exports. Foreign demand for U.S. food and fiber, such as wheat, rice, soybeans, cotton, almonds, pecans, pistachios, and walnuts, contributes to higher commodity prices and farm income. This positive impact extends to rural communities, farm input industries, commodity processors, and food manufacturers involved in foreign markets. Rising farm productivity, market-oriented farm policies, and the potential to compete in developing countries' food markets drive negotiations to liberalize agricultural trade. The TPP agreement reached in October 2015 aims to improve market access for U.S. food and agricultural products, enhancing competitiveness in TPP markets. It also provides TPP partners with greater access to U.S. product markets, potentially increasing competition. The U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) issued a report on the economic impact of the TPP agreement on the U.S. economy and specific industry sectors, including agriculture and food. The report highlights key considerations for U.S. food and agriculture, projected effects of TPP, changes in market access for agricultural products, and selected provisions beyond market access. The U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) issued a report on the economic impact of the TPP agreement on the U.S. economy and specific industry sectors, including agriculture and food. The report includes key considerations for U.S. food and agriculture, projected effects of TPP, changes in market access for agricultural products, and selected provisions beyond market access. Among significant TPP markets, the United States lacks free trade agreements (FTAs) with five countries: Brunei, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, and Vietnam. Japan, Vietnam, and Malaysia offer the greatest potential for boosting U.S. farm and food exports via lower tariffs or expanded tariff rate quotas (TRQs). The United States has lower agricultural tariffs than some TPP countries, giving an advantage to U.S. farm and food exports. Japan and Vietnam have high tariffs on agricultural products, making them key markets for potential growth. Japan, with its protected markets and high GDP per capita, presents a significant opportunity for U.S. exports. Vietnam, with a large population and growing economy, also holds promise for future growth in U.S. farm and food exports. The TPP agreement could open up new markets for U.S. farm and food products, potentially impacting current preferential access under NAFTA. Concerns have been raised about the impact on U.S. rice exports to Mexico as tariffs are lowered. Key export expansion opportunities for products like beef, pork, and dairy to Japan, Canada, and Vietnam would be phased in over time. Safeguard measures in certain countries like Japan and the United States allow for additional tariffs if imports exceed specified thresholds. Failure to implement the TPP agreement could give U.S. agricultural export competitors an edge, such as Australia with preferential tariff arrangements. The TPP would equalize tariff rates for U.S. beef with Australia in Japan. The EU is negotiating FTAs with Japan, Malaysia, and Vietnam. The TPP does not address domestic subsidy regimes, which are typically handled by the WTO. The TPP, as analyzed by the ITC in a report from May 2016, would benefit U.S. agriculture by eliminating tariffs and expanding markets. The report projected that by year 15 (2032), U.S. agricultural exports would increase by $7.2 billion (2.6%), while imports would rise by $2.7 billion (1.5%). Additionally, there would be a $10 billion (0.5%) gain in U.S. agricultural output and a 0.5% increase in agricultural employment. Dairy product exports would see a significant increase of $1.85 billion (18%). The TPP would benefit U.S. agriculture by increasing exports by $7.2 billion, with dairy product exports expected to rise by $1.85 billion. Processed foods, beef, and dairy imports would also increase. The American Farm Bureau Federation supports TPP, stating it would boost U.S. farm. The TPP agreement would boost U.S. farm income by $4.4 billion per year once fully implemented. Support for TPP in the food and agriculture sector is broad-based but not universal. The agreement would impact market access for various agricultural commodities, including beef. Under the TPP agreement, Japan would reduce tariffs on beef from 38.5% to 27.5% in year one, with further reductions to 9% by year 16. A safeguard duty would be applied if imports exceed specified quantities, gradually decreasing each year. Japan would also lower tariffs on other beef products, while Vietnam would eliminate tariffs over three to eight years. The United States would eliminate tariffs on beef and beef products within 15 years, and in fewer than 10 years in most cases. Japan and Vietnam are making changes to their tariffs on pork and poultry products under the TPP agreement. Japan will reduce its tariff on pork cuts immediately and phase out the residual over nine years. Vietnam will eliminate tariffs on pork products within 10 years. Canada will allow incremental increases in access to its poultry and egg markets over five years. Canada will allow incremental increases in access to its highly protected poultry and egg markets over five years via new duty-free, TPP-wide TRQs. Vietnamese tariffs on poultry will be eliminated within 13 years, while U.S. tariffs will be eliminated within 10 years. Dairy markets will also be opened to greater import competition, with Canada allowing incremental additional access to its highly protected dairy product markets. Canada will allow incremental increases in access to its highly protected dairy product markets under TPP, with TRQs phased in over five years. This additional access would amount to about 0.3% of current U.S. milk production and be open to all TPP countries. In-quota dairy products would enter Canada duty-free, with TRQs for dairy products from Australia and New Zealand increased annually. Japan would eliminate tariffs on cheese imports within 16 years and on whey within 21 years. Under the U.S.-Australia FTA, products would be transferred to perpetual TRQs. New U.S. TRQs for Canadian dairy products would increase gradually each year until year 19, plateauing at that point. The individual TRQs provided for Canadian dairy products include various items like cheese, milk powder, yogurt, and butter. Japan would establish a new CSQ for U.S. corn and potato starch, increasing over six years. Vietnam and Malaysia would reduce tariffs on corn products, with the U.S. eliminating tariffs as well. Under the U.S.-Australia FTA, products would be transferred to perpetual TRQs. New U.S. TRQs for Canadian dairy products would increase gradually each year until year 19, plateauing at that point. Japan would establish a new CSQ for U.S. corn and potato starch, increasing over six years. Vietnam and Malaysia would reduce tariffs on corn products, with the U.S. eliminating tariffs as well. In addition, Japan, Vietnam, and Malaysia would eliminate tariffs on soybeans and soybean products, as well as wheat and wheat products, over varying timeframes. Japan would establish a new duty-free quota for U.S. wheat of 114,000 metric tons, increasing to 150,000 tons in seven years. New quotas would also be provided for U.S. processed wheat products. Vietnam would eliminate tariffs on wheat products within four years, while Malaysian tariffs would be eliminated immediately. U.S. tariffs on wheat would be eliminated within 10 years. Japan would establish a new TRQ for barley of 25,000 metric tons, expanding to 65,000 tons over nine years. Japan would establish a new TPP-wide TRQ for barley of 25,000 metric tons, expanding to 65,000 tons over nine years with a progressive reduction in the maximum markup. Japan would also eliminate its tariff on feed barley and create duty-free quotas for U.S. unroasted and roasted malt. Additionally, Japan would establish a duty-free quota for U.S. rice of 50,000 tons initially, rising to 70,000 tons in year 13. Japan would eliminate tariffs on cotton, ranging up to 10%, within four years. U.S. tariffs on cotton products, up to $0.314 per kg, would be phased out within 10 years. Japan would also immediately remove tariffs on certain tree nuts, such as almonds, walnuts, and pecans. In the agreement, tariffs on dried nuts would be reduced, with specific rates for almonds, walnuts, and pecans. Vietnam would gradually eliminate tariffs on walnuts and almonds. U.S. tariffs on fresh or dried nuts would be eliminated within five years. Japan would reduce tariffs on oranges over six to eight years, extending the lower tariff season. The agreement includes a phased reduction of tariffs on citrus fruits and non-citrus fruits in Japan. Tariffs on grapefruit, orange juice, and grapefruit juice would be gradually eliminated over six to eight years. Tariffs on fresh apples, cherries, grapes, and other fruits would also be reduced and eliminated over varying timeframes. The United States, Vietnam, Malaysia, Australia, and Canada would eliminate or reduce tariffs on various fruits such as plums, strawberries, raspberries, kiwifruit, avocados, grapes, apples, cherries, apricots, mangoes, papayas, peaches, pears, and sugar. The US would also expand access to its sugar market through new TRQs. The United States, Japan, Malaysia, Australia, and Canada would adjust sugar tariffs and quotas. Japan would provide new TRQs for sugar and sweetener products, while the US would expand its sugar market access. Tariffs on tobacco would be eliminated gradually over 10 years. The agreement involves the gradual elimination of tobacco tariffs over 10-16 years, creation of TRQs for unmanufactured tobacco imports, and controversy over excluding tobacco product manufacturers from ISDS protections for tobacco control measures. The TPP agreement includes provisions for gradual elimination of tobacco tariffs, creation of TRQs for unmanufactured tobacco imports, and controversy over excluding tobacco product manufacturers from ISDS protections for tobacco control measures. USDA has compiled summaries on market access for various farm commodity groups and food/agricultural products under liberalized terms of trade. The agreement also addresses trade-related measures beyond tariffs and TRQs, including new provisions in areas like sanitary regulations. The TPP agreement includes provisions for gradual elimination of tobacco tariffs, creation of TRQs for unmanufactured tobacco imports, and controversy over excluding tobacco product manufacturers from ISDS protections for tobacco control measures. USDA has compiled summaries on market access for various farm commodity groups and food/agricultural products under liberalized terms of trade. The agreement also addresses trade-related measures beyond tariffs and TRQs, including new provisions in areas like sanitary regulations. Specifically, ITC cites new provisions in the areas of sanitary and phytosanitary measures (SPS), technical barriers to trade (TBT), and biotechnology as beneficial elements for U.S. agriculture. The agreement outlines rules of origin, SPS, agricultural biotechnology, geographic indications (GIs), export programs, and TBT for goods to receive preferential tariff rates and TRQs. Criteria for determining TPP origin include products grown, cultivated, harvested, or obtained in TPP countries. The TPP agreement outlines criteria for determining TPP origin of goods, including products obtained from animals in TPP countries and de minimis provisions allowing for non-TPP content up to 10% of the transactional value. Exceptions to the de minimis rule apply to certain agricultural goods like dairy products and edible oil-bearing crops of non-TPP origin. The TPP agreement addresses non-TPP agricultural goods like soybean oil, peanut oil, citrus juices, various fruits, peaches, pears, and apricots. Non-tariff barriers, such as sanitary and phytosanitary measures, are highlighted in the TPP, going beyond the WTO agreement in areas like risk assessment, transparency, and rapid response to issues. The TPP agreement includes commitments on sanitary and phytosanitary measures, such as transparency, laboratory testing, and rapid response to export issues. It establishes an SPS committee, requires measures to be based on international standards or scientific evidence, and allows for public comment. TPP countries must provide rapid notification of import shipment restrictions within seven days. SPS disputes are to be resolved through technical consultations first, with a procedural timeline set in the agreement. The TPP agreement includes commitments on sanitary and phytosanitary measures, establishing an SPS committee for resolving disputes through technical consultations. Parties can resort to dispute settlement procedures if issues cannot be resolved, with a focus on transparency and notification of national laws related to agricultural biotechnology products. The agreement also promotes information sharing on low-level presence of biotech material in food and agricultural products, with importers and exporters exchanging information to minimize disruptions to trade. Additionally, a working group on agricultural biotechnology within the TPP Committee on Agricultural Trade serves as a forum for exchanging information on trade-related laws, regulations, and policies. The TPP agreement covers national laws, regulations, and policies affecting trade in biotech products. Parties are not obligated to change existing laws. Geographical Indications (GIs) protect products from specific regions, like Parmesan cheese and Champagne. GIs can provide relief from infringement and unfair competition. GIs are controversial in international trade. The TPP agreement obligates members to recognize and protect Geographical Indications (GIs), which can extend beyond the EU through bilateral trade agreements. Parties must provide a transparent process for recognizing GIs and allow for objections before official recognition. The agreement also includes reasons for opposing a GI, such as potential confusion. The TPP agreement requires members to recognize and protect Geographical Indications (GIs), with specific criteria for opposing a GI, such as potential confusion with a trademark or a pre-existing application. Members are not required to recognize a GI if it is identical to the customary name of a grape variety in their territory. Criteria for determining the customary common name include usage in dictionaries, newspapers, websites, and trade references. The TPP agreement requires members to protect Geographical Indications (GIs) by providing information and allowing comments on prospective recognition. Signatories commit to eliminating export subsidies, setting a standard for future reform, while cooperation is encouraged for export credits and insurance programs. The TPP agreement encourages cooperation to develop multilateral disciplines and discourages restrictions on food and agricultural exports. It limits restrictions to 6 months and requires consultation for restrictions over 12 months. Technical barriers to trade (TBT) include regulations affecting goods. The TBT chapter includes annexes relevant to food and agriculture, such as parameters for labeling wines and distilled spirits. The TPP agreement sets guidelines for labeling wines and distilled spirits, limits information requirements for prepackaged foods, and encourages exchange of rules for organic products among member states. The TPP agreement encourages cooperation among member states on organic production and certification standards. Various food and agricultural organizations have expressed their support for the TPP agreement since its issuance on November 5, 2015. Various food and agricultural organizations, including the American Farm Bureau Federation, American Feed Industry Association, American Soybean Association, and others, support the TPP agreement. Agricultural Technical Advisory Committees also provided input to key stakeholders on the completed agreement. The ATAC for Trade in Fruits and Vegetables endorsed the TPP as positive for growers, packers, and marketers. Members included representatives from various agricultural organizations. The ATAC for Trade in Sweeteners also expressed unanimous support for the TPP agreement. The ATAC for Trade in Processed Foods praised aspects of the TPP agreement but did not endorse it outright. Criticisms included dairy product TRQs from Canada and Japan and a product-specific exception for tobacco products. Groups opposing TPP include the Burley Tobacco Growers Cooperative Association, National Farmers Union, R-CALF USA, U.S. Rice Producers Association, and UFCW. The TPP agreement was signed by trade ministers from 12 countries on February 4, 2016. Congress would need to pass implementing legislation for the agreement to enter into force. Some groups, like the UFCW, criticize the lack of enforcement against currency manipulation in the agreement. USA Rice has not taken a clear stance on the TPP. After the TPP agreement was signed, Congress would have 90 days to vote on implementing legislation without amendments."
