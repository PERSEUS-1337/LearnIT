    "content": "This report provides a cumulative history of Department of Energy (DOE) funding for renewable energy compared with funding for other energy technologies over the past 71 years. The final amount of FY2017 Energy and Water Development appropriations for DOE energy technologies was established by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018 set final funding for DOE in FY2018. Funding levels for DOE are included in Energy and Water Development programs. Tables and figures present funding totals in real terms since 1978 and show relative shares of spending for each technology or energy source over different periods. The Atomic Energy Act of 1946 established the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) to oversee R&D activities from the Manhattan Project, focusing on nuclear weapon development and civilian control of nuclear power management. The Atomic Energy Act of 1946 established the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) to oversee nuclear weapon development and civilian control of nuclear power management. The AEC focused on research for \"atoms for peace\" and the use of nuclear energy for civilian electric power production. In response to the 1973 oil embargo, the Federal Energy Administration was created in 1974, followed by the Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA) in 1975. The Department of Energy (DOE) was established in 1977, consolidating various energy programs under its administration. The federal government expanded its energy R&D programs in response to the energy crises of the 1970s, including support for fossil energy, nuclear power, renewable energy, and energy efficiency technologies. Funding for fossil energy technologies amounted to $17.1 billion, while nuclear energy R&D received $51.6 billion from FY1948 to FY1977. Since FY1978, the Department of Energy (DOE) has been the main source of energy R&D funding compared to other federal agencies. The Department of Energy (DOE) has been the main supplier of energy R&D funding, with funding for energy technologies peaking in FY1979 at $8.6 billion (2016 dollars) before dropping to $2.0 billion per year in the late 1990s. Funding has gradually increased since then, with a spike to $13 billion in FY2009 due to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. In FY2018, DOE energy R&D funding was nearly $4.5 billion (2016 dollars)."
