    "content": "The \"Adoption Equality Act of 2005\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. Congress finds that the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 prioritizes a child's health and safety, leading to thousands of adoptions from State care. Despite efforts to promote adoption, over 118,000 children in foster care still await permanent homes, especially older children with special needs. Children with special needs in foster care require Federal financial assistance and support for physical and emotional healing after years of abuse and neglect. SEC. 3. PROMOTION OF ADOPTION OF CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS. Section 473(a) of the Social Security Act is amended to include criteria for a child to meet requirements for placement with a public or private agency for safety reasons. The Social Security Act is amended to include criteria for a child to meet requirements for placement with a public or private agency for safety reasons, including eligibility for supplemental security income benefits for a child with special needs residing in a foster family home or child care institution. The State determines the amount of payments to be made to the adopting parents based on the child's needs and the circumstances of the adopting parents. The Social Security Act is amended to include criteria for a child to meet requirements for placement with a public or private agency for safety reasons, including eligibility for supplemental security income benefits for a child with special needs. A child who is not a citizen or resident of the United States and meets certain requirements shall be treated as meeting the requirements for adoption assistance payments. This applies to a child who was eligible for adoption assistance payments in a prior adoption and is now available for adoption due to the dissolution of the prior adoption. The Social Security Act is amended to include criteria for a child to meet requirements for adoption assistance payments. No payment may be made to parents for a child with special needs who is not a citizen or resident of the United States and was adopted outside of the United States. The Social Security Act requires states to use savings from adoption assistance for services to children or families. The Act also outlines criteria for determining a child with special needs for adoption assistance payments. The Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 673(c)) is amended to specify that a child must meet certain criteria to be considered a child with special needs for adoption assistance payments. This includes a determination by the State that the child cannot be returned to their parents' home and meeting medical or disability requirements for supplemental security income benefits. Additionally, the State must identify specific factors or conditions related to the child. The child must meet specific criteria to be considered a child with special needs for adoption assistance payments, including factors like medical conditions or handicaps that prevent placement with adoptive parents without assistance. Efforts must be made to place the child with adoptive parents before providing adoption assistance or medical assistance. The amendments made by this section regarding adoption assistance or medical assistance under title XIX shall take effect on October 1, 2005."
