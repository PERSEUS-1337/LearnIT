    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Citizens' Self-Defense Act of 2011\". The Congress finds that police are not legally liable for failing to protect individual citizens, as courts have ruled that their duty is only to the public at large, not to individual community members. Former Florida Attorney General Jim Smith also acknowledged this. Former Florida Attorney General Jim Smith revealed that police only responded to 200,000 out of 700,000 calls for help in Dade County. The Department of Justice found that in 1989, there were 168,881 violent crimes where police did not respond within an hour. Additionally, over 2,400,000 people in the US use firearms to defend themselves annually, showing that guns are used more for protection than harm. In self-defense cases, over 2,400,000 people in the US use firearms annually, with 192,000 cases involving women defending against sexual abuse. 92 percent of the time, individuals only brandish or fire a warning shot, while less than 8 percent result in injury or death to the attacker. Despite seeking to protect their families, law-abiding citizens using firearms for self-defense can face prosecution. For instance, in 2001, two brothers were investigated for using firearms to defend themselves. The grand jury decided not to press criminal charges against 2 brothers who used firearms to protect their concrete business from burglaries in Reisterstown, Maryland. They shot and killed 1 burglar and injured 2 others during a break-in. The injured men were charged with burglary, along with 2 others connected to previous burglaries at the warehouse. In 2008, a store clerk in Waukegan, Illinois, shot a robber but faced potential criminal charges for not having a firearm owner's identification card. Illinois law only allows individuals with ownership or proprietary interest to carry a gun in a place of business. In September 2009, a Lithonia homeowner in Dekalb County, Georgia, was charged with aggravated assault for shooting a person attempting to break into his home. The robber was not inside the home at the time. In January 2004, a Wilmette, Illinois homeowner was charged with misdemeanors for owning handguns in violation of a village handgun ban ordinance. A homeowner in Illinois faces a potential $750 fine for not renewing his firearm owner's identification card after shooting a home intruder who entered the house twice. The homeowner confronted and shot the intruder, who then stole the family's car to go to the hospital and was charged with residential burglary. The courts have granted immunity from prosecution to police officers using firearms in the line of duty. Law-abiding citizens using firearms to protect themselves against violent felons should not be sued by the felons. The right to obtain firearms for security and use them in defense of self, family, or home is protected by law. The right to obtain firearms for security and use them in defense of self, family, or home is reaffirmed for individuals not prohibited from owning firearms. This includes using firearms in self-defense against imminent threats or during the commission of a violent felony against oneself or family members. The term \"firearm\" includes shotguns and rifles as defined by law. The right to possess firearms for self-defense is reaffirmed for eligible individuals. Violations of this right can be legally challenged in court for damages and other relief, with the possibility of receiving attorney's fees. Any such legal action must be taken within five years of discovering the violation."
