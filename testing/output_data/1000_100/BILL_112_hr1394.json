    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Act of 2011\". It includes findings related to lung cancer. Congress finds that lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death, with projections showing a significant increase in incidence by 2030. It causes more deaths annually than the next 4 leading causes of cancer combined. Lung cancer has a low 5-year survival rate of 15 percent, compared to breast cancer (89%), prostate cancer (99%), and colon cancer (65%). Despite its high mortality rate, lung cancer receives the least research funding among major cancers. The National Cancer Institute has highlighted the inadequate funding for lung cancer research and called for a comprehensive plan to address this issue. Smoking is the primary risk factor for lung cancer. The President's National Cancer Advisory Board Report of 2010 identified radon as the second leading cause of lung cancer, along with 15 other environmental contaminants. Hormonal and genetic factors may also influence the onset of lung cancer. Nearly 20 percent of lung cancer patients have never smoked, and 60 percent are former smokers who quit. Lung cancer in non-smokers is the sixth leading cause of cancer death. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in various ethnic groups, with a higher impact on African-American males. Military personnel and workers exposed to carcinogens have an increased risk of lung cancer. Only 16% of cases are diagnosed early, with no specific targets for early detection or treatment. An actuarial analysis by Milliman Inc. in 2009 showed early detection of lung cancer could save over 70,000 lives annually in the US. A National Cancer Institute study projected a $433 billion loss to lung cancer by 2020, but a 4% decline in mortality could cut that in half. The National Lung Screening Trial in 2010 revealed promising results. A large-scale national trial compared low-dose CT scans to standard chest x-rays for lung cancer screening, showing a 20% decrease in lung cancer deaths among CT scan participants. The Congress emphasizes the need for a national public health priority to reduce lung cancer mortality and calls for a comprehensive program coordinated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Additionally, a new Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Program is added to the Public Health Service Act. The Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Act of 2011 mandates a program to reduce lung cancer mortality by 50% by 2020, involving various government agencies and stakeholders. The National Institutes of Health are implementing strategic measures to reduce lung cancer mortality, including prioritizing research grants, expanding research programs on predispositions to lung cancer, and improving diagnosis and treatment of related diseases. The Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering is expediting the development of screening, diagnostic, surgical, treatment, and drug testing innovations to reduce lung cancer mortality. This includes expanding programs like the Quantum Grant Program and Image-Guided Interventions. Additionally, funds are being provided to the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences for research programs on lung cancer incidence, and to the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities for collaboration on prevention and early detection efforts. The curr_chunk discusses collaboration on prevention, early detection, and disease management research for lung cancer in minority populations. It also mentions providing funds to the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiologic Health to establish quality standards for facilities conducting computed tomography screening for lung cancer. The curr_chunk focuses on conducting an annual random sample survey to review compliance and evaluate dose and accuracy performance related to lung cancer. It also includes provisions for funding programs aimed at early detection services for high-risk populations and research on environmental contaminants associated with lung cancer in the workplace. The curr_chunk focuses on the National Comprehensive Cancer Control Program requiring lung cancer mortality reduction measures. It also includes the annual review of lung cancer early detection methods by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the coordination of programs to address lung cancer burden on women and minorities. The curr_chunk emphasizes the cooperation and coordination of tobacco control and cessation programs within the Department of Health and Human Services to reduce lung cancer mortality, with a focus on women and minority populations. The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs will coordinate with the Secretary of Health and Human Services to develop a Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Program, implement a demonstration project for military personnel and veterans at risk for lung cancer, and establish coordinated care programs for those diagnosed with lung cancer. The Congress supports a national lung cancer screening project to assess public health needs and develop an effective process. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will lead a demonstration project within a year of the Act's enactment, in collaboration with various agencies and experts. The Advisory Board established under the Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Act of 2011 will create the Lung Cancer Computed Tomography Screening and Treatment Demonstration Project. The Secretary will ensure the project identifies optimal risk populations, develops effective screening processes, allows for quality control improvements, and integrates health information technology. The Secretary will select at least 5 participants for the project. The Secretary will select various healthcare centers to participate in the demonstration project for computed tomography screening for lung cancer. Quality standards and guidelines will be established for licensing facilities conducting the screenings. The Secretary will establish a quality assurance program for facilities participating in a 5-year demonstration project for computed tomography screening for lung cancer. Reports on cost projections and progress will be submitted to Congress. The Secretary will establish a quality assurance program for facilities participating in a 5-year demonstration project for computed tomography screening for lung cancer. Reports on cost projections and progress will be submitted to Congress. Additionally, a Lung Cancer Advisory Board will be created. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish a Lung Cancer Advisory Board to monitor programs under the Act and provide annual reports to Congress. The Board will include representatives from various government agencies and experts in clinical medicine and lung cancer research. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will appoint experts in lung cancer research, radiology, drug development, minority health advocacy, veterans services, and occupational medicine to a Lung Cancer Advisory Board. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2012 through 2016 is provided to carry out the Act and its amendments."
