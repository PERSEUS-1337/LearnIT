The agreement was concluded in late 2015 and signed in February 2016. Congress played an active role in the negotiations, and implementing legislation would be required for the TPP to take effect in the U.S. The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement, concluded in late 2015 and signed in February 2016, is a subject of debate in the 114th Congress. Proponents argue that the TPP's strategic significance goes beyond economics, aiming to strengthen regional alliances, maintain U.S. leadership in the Asia-Pacific region, and create conditions for broader political and security influence. The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) aims to strengthen alliances, enhance U.S. national security, liberalize trade, and establish trade rules in line with U.S. interests. China's economic rise and trade initiatives in the region are key factors in analyzing U.S. influence in the Asia-Pacific region. Some analysts argue that China's investment initiatives in the region aim to minimize U.S. presence and power. The TPP is seen as a way to maintain U.S. leadership in Asia and establish trade rules with an eye towards China. However, some believe that countering Chinese initiatives may be unproductive and that U.S. and Chinese goals for trade liberalization may be mutually reinforcing. Trade agreements involve economic and political elements at the intersection of domestic and foreign policy. The TPP involves economic and political elements at the intersection of domestic and foreign policy, creating tension in balancing various policy priorities. Supporters highlight the broader strategic implications, while opponents focus on the agreement's potential impact on the U.S. economy. The report will examine strategic arguments presented by the Administration, TPP proponents, and opponents in the Asia-Pacific region. The report focuses on the Asia-Pacific region and implications for Asia, highlighting strategic issues for Congress to consider regarding the TPP agreement. The United States has historically used trade agreements like FTAs to advance foreign policy goals, with FTAs in the 2000s also serving security and foreign policy objectives. The first U.S. FTA in Asia was with Singapore in 2004, emphasizing strategic partnerships. The TPP agreement, signed in 2004 with Singapore, is seen as a key U.S. trade policy initiative in Asia with significant geostrategic importance. The Obama Administration views it as crucial for shaping the global economic order and maintaining U.S. leadership in the region. The TPP is considered a test of U.S. credibility as a regional leader and aims to set new rules of the road, strengthen partnerships, and promote inclusive development in the Asia-Pacific region. The TPP agreement, signed in 2004 with Singapore, is a key U.S. trade policy initiative in Asia with significant geostrategic importance. The Obama Administration views it as crucial for shaping the global economic order and maintaining U.S. leadership in the region. If not approved by Congress, the entire rebalancing strategy could be seen as weak, signaling a divided U.S. stance on its leadership role in Asia. Administration officials argue that the agreement signals active U.S. integration into Asia's economic and diplomatic structures, with expectations of deeper U.S. involvement in the region. In May 2015, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong emphasized the strategic significance of the TPP agreement, stating that its completion would strengthen ties across the Pacific. Failure to finalize the TPP would damage the credibility of the U.S. globally. Proponents believe that the TPP is essential for developing regional institutions that promote cooperation and peaceful conflict resolution through adherence to rules and norms. The TPP is seen as crucial for strengthening international rules and norms for trade and growth. Proponents argue that it is vital for reinforcing U.S. alliances and partnerships in East Asia, with Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter likening its importance to that of an aircraft carrier. However, critics question the specific ways in which the agreement would enhance U.S. security partnerships in the region. The impact of trade agreements like the KORUS FTA and TPP on U.S. security alliances in East Asia is debated. Factors like countries' security interests and perceptions of threats from China or North Korea play a larger role in determining alliance strength than trade agreements alone. Japan's strategic decisions drive its cooperation with the U.S., with the TPP's success or failure seen as less influential. The TPP may have a significant impact on countries like Vietnam, potentially leading to deeper market-oriented institutional changes. Approval of the agreement could signal closer ties with the United States, while failure to approve it may affect Vietnam's perception of the U.S. as a reliable partner. The TPP agreement aims to promote a global order reflecting US interests and values, including a rules-based trading system. It is suggested that large trade agreements like TPP can influence countries' strategic interests and strengthen partnerships with the US in the Pacific region. Implementing the TPP could signal the US's commitment to the Pacific Rim, impacting its leadership and credibility in Asia. Failure of the TPP may be seen as a decline in US interest in the region, potentially creating an influence vacuum filled by China. China's rise and North Korea's nuclear capabilities challenge U.S. influence. Rejection of the TPP could lead to loss of trust and cooperation, impacting U.S. influence in shaping trade and investment. Proponents believe TPP rules will promote economic growth and advance U.S. interests. The TPP aims to update trade rules and create incentives for Asia-Pacific nations to join, matching preferential access in major markets like the US and Japan. The US seeks to update the rules-based trading system to promote economic growth and prosperity through trade liberalization negotiations. Under the GATT, the US played a key role in liberalizing trade barriers and establishing the rules-based trade system of the WTO. However, the current WTO Doha Round negotiations have stalled due to member differences. With rapid technological advancements, current trade rules do not address issues like digital trade and state-owned enterprises. As a result, some countries, including the US, are pursuing new trade rules through bilateral and regional agreements. The TPP aims to establish new trade rules and liberalization through bilateral and regional agreements. Proponents argue that the agreement's scale creates a significant bloc of nations with broad disciplines. The TPP countries account for a large portion of global trade and GDP. The agreement is open to new countries willing to adhere to its provisions, potentially promoting domestic reforms in emerging economies. The TPP aims to establish new trade rules and liberalization through bilateral and regional agreements. Proponents argue that the agreement's scale creates a significant bloc of nations with broad disciplines. The TPP countries account for a large portion of global trade and GDP. The agreement is open to new countries willing to adhere to its provisions, potentially promoting domestic reforms in emerging economies. U.S. goals include respect for worker rights and environmental protection. Proponents believe the TPP will draw interest from other countries, leading to further trade and investment liberalization in the region. However, some experts note that the TPP does not include some of Asia's largest economies, limiting its comprehensive impact on trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific. Several large Asian countries, including Indonesia, the Philippines, South Korea, and Thailand, have expressed interest in joining a \"second round\" of TPP members once the agreement is implemented. Taiwan has also shown interest in membership. U.S. FTA partners in Asia and Latin America, such as South Korea and Colombia, are likely candidates to seek entry into the TPP in the near future. TPP proponents believe that mega-regionals like TPP and T-TIP could influence global trade negotiations by setting new rules beyond WTO commitments. Critics fear that focusing on bilateral and regional deals may hinder multilateral efforts, potentially undermining the WTO's role in trade liberalization. The WTO's role in future trade liberalization could be affected by mega-regionals like TPP and RCEP, which may create overlapping rules instead of following multilateral rules. RCEP includes ASEAN members and six other nations in a collective FTA, excluding the United States. The United States does not have an FTA with ASEAN and has not shown interest in joining RCEP negotiations. A comparison between ASEAN trade agreements and the finalized TPP suggests potential differences, with the TPP being more comprehensive in terms of trade liberalization. The TPP includes intellectual property rights, investment, labor, environmental provisions, and disciplines on state-owned enterprises not found in ASEAN FTAs. Some argue that RCEP could present an alternative or challenge to the TPP, while others believe the agreements can be complementary. The TPP and RCEP are two proposed trade agreements in the region. Seven countries are in both agreements, potentially leading to compatibility and synergy. The TPP is at a more advanced stage than RCEP, with uncertainties on how they may affect each other and the existing trade architecture in the region. Delay in TPP ratification could alter the sequencing of the agreements. The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum aims for open and free trade within the region. APEC members have discussed creating a Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP) since 2006, supported by China and the United States. In 2014, APEC leaders recognized TPP and RCEP as potential pathways to FTAAP, with China's inclusion in TPP having implications for the US and the region. China's growing international influence increases the strategic importance of completing the proposed TPP. Analysts argue that China is trying to minimize U.S. presence and power in the region, making TPP necessary to counter this effort. The proposed TPP would allow the U.S. to shape a model in line with its interests and influence China's economic and diplomatic decisions. Completing the TPP could influence China's economic and diplomatic decisions in favor of U.S. interests. President Obama highlighted the importance of enforceable standards and market access in shaping China's behavior. The TPP could also push China to further liberalize its trade regime and provide cover for reformers advocating for deeper changes. China's economic initiatives in Asia could be beneficial for regional development, but opposition from the United States may be perceived as obstructionist. Other Asian nations have their own trade policies and may not align with U.S. interests. China's leaders are focused on strengthening their economy, defense, and global role. They are implementing policies to boost their economy and expand their global economic influence through initiatives like the \"One Belt, One Road\" project to enhance trade and economic integration with Europe, the Middle East, central Asia, and Southeast Asia. China aims to facilitate trade and economic development through new financial institutions like the AIIB and Silk Road Fund. Efforts to increase the overseas use of the renminbi are meant to simplify transactions, reduce risk for Chinese companies, and enhance global economic stature. RCEP is seen as a foundation for a broader FTAAP, reflecting Chinese leadership's vision for regional rules and norms. China is actively promoting reforms in international institutions like the United Nations, IMF, and World Bank, with the establishment of the AIIB as an alternative model. These efforts are part of China's broader strategy to reshape economic institutions and reduce U.S. influence in diplomatic and security spheres. China has attempted to refashion the Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia (CICA) into a new Asian continental security system to counter the U.S. alliance network. China's actions in the South China Sea are seen as countering U.S. naval power. China's views on the TPP have varied, with initial portrayals of the TPP as a U.S.-dominated process aimed at isolating China. China's initial views on the TPP were of it being a U.S.-dominated process aimed at isolating China. However, China's criticisms softened after Japan joined the talks in 2013. Chinese officials have expressed interest in joining the TPP, with Vice Finance Minister Zhu Guangyao stating that an agreement would be incomplete without China. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang also mentioned openness to negotiations on the TPP, emphasizing the positive role of various FTA arrangements in promoting international and regional trade. U.S. officials have welcomed China to join the TPP. U.S. officials have welcomed China to join the TPP, with President Obama mentioning China's interest in participating. Analysts believe the U.S. aims to integrate China into deeper trade commitments and establish new rules not covered by the WTO. This could subject China to higher standards and prevent it from weakening existing trade rules. The United States is negotiating a bilateral investment treaty with China to boost investment flows and potentially join the TPP. Congress plays a direct role in guiding TPP negotiations and will consider implementing legislation. Key issues for Congress include examining whether TPP aligns with broader foreign policy strategy. TPP proponents argue that the agreement is part of a broader foreign policy strategy to promote respect for international rules in the Asia-Pacific region. It could further U.S. diplomatic and security goals beyond trade, reinforcing U.S. leadership and encouraging nations to adopt a more U.S.-supportive foreign policy outlook. Congress should consider these arguments and weigh them deeply in their decision-making. The TPP is seen as part of a broader foreign policy strategy to promote respect for international rules in the Asia-Pacific region. Congress must weigh the agreement's strategic implications and consider if they distract from its direct impact on the U.S. economy. The potential strategic benefits of the TPP may rely on its ability to drive economic growth and prosperity. Some argue that the agreement's strategic impact will depend on whether a broader group of nations ultimately decides to join it. The proposed TPP, established by like-minded countries, offers the United States the best opportunity to pursue regional and multilateral trade policy goals. Congress must consider the implications of failed ratification on U.S. leadership in the region. The rejection of the TPP by Congress could delay a U.S.-led alternative agreement for years. Other countries in the region are pursuing their own trade arrangements. The impact of not ratifying the TPP on foreign governments' views of U.S. leadership and credibility in the region is a concern. Some suggest the U.S. should expand economic engagement beyond the current TPP membership to prevent neglecting important countries in the Asia-Pacific region. The U.S. may need additional economic initiatives in Asia to enhance influence in the region. Congress should consider expanding TPP to include other countries. Analysts have mixed views on how mega-regional negotiations may impact the multilateral trading system. The proposed TPP may impact global trade and the WTO. Congress should consider if it will promote multilateral trade liberalization or fragment the global trading system. They may need to seek new trade initiatives to ensure the TPP's effects align with global trade goals."
