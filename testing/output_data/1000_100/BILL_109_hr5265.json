    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Community Hazard Assessment and Mitigation Program Act\". The Congress finds that the 2004 tsunami in Southeast Asia caused over 230,000 deaths. There is a fault line along the west coast of the United States with a 10 to 15 percent chance of a major seismic event in the next 50 years. This event could lead to a devastating earthquake and tsunami, highlighting the lack of preparedness in coastal communities. The Community Hazard Assessment and Mitigation Program (CHAMP) aims to provide one-year grants to emergency management departments for tsunami warning infrastructure and post-tsunami needs. The program's primary goal is to assist departments in tsunami hazard preparedness, mitigation, and response, especially those lacking necessary resources. Improving warning systems for coastal communities will enhance overall hazard capabilities. The Secretary of Homeland Security may provide grants to certain areas for tsunami preparedness, prioritizing areas with a 10% or greater likelihood of a tsunami in the next 50 years. Grants will be awarded based on financial need, community benefit, and cooperation with other emergency service providers. An emergency management department receiving a grant under this Act can use funds for warning systems, rescue equipment, reinforcing buildings, post-tsunami shelters, and outreach programs for resident education. Develop outreach programs to educate residents and tourists on different types of tsunamis and how to react to each type. SEC. 6. MATCHING FUNDS. Emergency management departments serving areas with different population sizes are required to provide a percentage of the total project cost with non-Federal funds to be eligible for grants under this Act. The percentages vary based on the population size: over 50,000 (20%), between 20,001 and 50,000 (10%), and under 20,000 (5%). The Secretary considers in-kind contributions of emergency management departments, not exceeding 50% of their non-Federal funds, towards the total project costs funded by grants under this Act. SEC. 7. EVALUATION AND REPORT. The Director will assess if grant-receiving emergency management departments meet tsunami readiness standards and evaluate program effectiveness. A report on the findings will be submitted to Congress within 90 days of the evaluation. SEC. 8. DEFINITIONS. The term \"Director\" refers to the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Administration. The term \"emergency management department\" is defined as an agency responsible for planning, preparing, and managing emergencies or disasters. The term \"State\" includes all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and various territories. Authorization of Appropriations: $100,000,000 authorized annually from 2007 to 2012 for the Community Hazard Assessment and Mitigation Program under the Department of Homeland Security. 5% may be reserved for administrative costs, and funds remain available until expended."
