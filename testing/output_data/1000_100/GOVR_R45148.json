    "content": "Economics is the study of efficient resource use and trade for mutual enrichment. Countries benefit from trade by producing efficiently and trading for goods they produce less efficiently, driven by comparative advantage. Trade allows for higher standards of living and increased consumption. Importing goods and services can boost consumer welfare, with the United States importing for various reasons such as satisfying demand, cost-effectiveness, and efficiency by foreign firms. Trade allows for access to a greater variety of goods at lower costs, benefiting consumers, especially lower-income households. It also helps control inflation and improves global competitiveness by providing lower-cost inputs for production. Trade leads to greater competition, encourages innovation, and allows firms to exploit economies of scale in overseas markets. Trade leads to greater competition, encourages innovation, and supports increased productivity and economic growth through specialization and comparative advantage. Economist David Ricardo's theory remains relevant in explaining how countries trade today, emphasizing the importance of opportunity cost in determining whether specialization and trade should occur. The theory of comparative advantage, introduced by economist David Ricardo, explains how countries can benefit from trade by specializing in goods they can produce well and trading for goods they produce less efficiently. This theory has been expanded upon to analyze complex trade patterns in the 21st century, including global value chains and digital trade. Differences in comparative advantage between countries arise from variations in factor endowments like labor, capital, human capital, and technology. Countries excel in activities that utilize their abundant factors, leading to specialization in certain goods. For instance, the US has a comparative advantage in high-skilled labor-intensive products like aircraft due to its abundance of skilled labor. Technology differences also impact efficiency and comparative advantage in global trade. The ICT revolution and digital trade have facilitated technology and knowledge-flows across countries, impacting comparative advantage. Governments can influence advantage through policies like eliminating corruption, enforcing property rights, and supporting education. Direct policies, such as subsidies or tariffs, can promote specific industries. Protectionist policies like subsidies or tariffs can promote specific industries with strategic and economic potential, but there is debate on their effectiveness. Some economists argue that such policies can distort trade and investment flows, reduce efficiency, and hinder the development of competitive industries. Intra-industry trade is common among advanced economies with similar resources and development levels. Trade patterns can be influenced by economies of scale, leading to specialization in certain goods. Trade impacts employment, wages, income distribution, and overall standard of living positively. Protectionist policies like subsidies or tariffs can distort trade and hinder competitive industries. Intra-industry trade is common among advanced economies with similar resources and development levels. Trade benefits include more efficient resource use, competition, economies of scale, and consumption gains. Increased trade can boost GDP, efficiency, and consumer welfare. Liberalizing trade globally has reduced extreme poverty by half in the past 25 years. However, trade benefits are not evenly distributed, leading to disruptions in certain sectors and concentrated costs like job losses and stagnant wages. The economic impact of trade on jobs and wages is debated due to various factors, including technological changes. Trade benefits include more efficient resource use, competition, economies of scale, and consumption gains. Economists argue that policies facilitating adjustment and compensating for losses from trade are more economically viable than protective measures. Adjustment assistance for displaced workers is crucial for maintaining political support for free trade. Policymakers debate the effectiveness of existing trade-related policies, with many experts finding them inadequate. Trade creates and destroys jobs, known as \"job churn,\" impacting the economy. Trade, including both international and domestic trade, can lead to job shifts within and between industries due to comparative advantage. While job loss attributed to trade is a small share of overall job losses annually, it can impact workers differently based on their occupational exposure. Trade liberalization can result in job churn, but policies that assist displaced workers are crucial for maintaining political support for free trade. Between 2001 and 2016, over 150,000 U.S. net jobs were lost annually due to increased trade in manufactured goods, accounting for 1% of layoffs. While some workers may find new employment, others face challenges in switching occupations or industries, leading to reduced wages. Import competition from China has particularly impacted U.S. labor markets and manufacturing jobs. However, equating trade deficits with unemployment is debated among economists. Historically, U.S. global trade has expanded during economic growth, leading to a trade deficit and impacting unemployment rates. Studies show mixed results on the effect of trade on U.S. worker wages and income inequality, with technological change playing a significant role. Trade tends to increase returns for capital and high-skilled workers. Trade tends to increase returns for capital and high-skilled workers in the United States, while decreasing returns for low-skilled labor. Imports, especially from countries like China with abundant low-skilled labor, can negatively impact wages of low-skilled U.S. workers in import-sensitive industries. Global value chains have led to the shift of labor-intensive production overseas by some U.S. multinational corporations, creating competition for low-skilled workers from lower-cost producers in developing countries. On the other hand, high-end services jobs in the U.S. often require high levels of education and skills. Economic globalization involves trade in goods and services, capital flows, technology transfer, and international labor migration. Scholars have identified periods of globalization and deglobalization. Globalization began after World War II, with global trade increasing significantly. From 1960 to 2017, global trade as a percentage of global GDP rose from 25% to 57%. Foreign direct investment also grew substantially, from 6% of global GDP in 1980 to 39% in 2017. Technical advances in transport and communication have helped reduce barriers between economies, while policies have lowered man-made barriers to international exchange. Most economists believe globalization has improved living standards. Globalization has led to increased global trade and foreign direct investment. There is a debate on whether economic integration has been inclusive and contributed to inequality. Global value chains, organized by multinational corporations, involve products being assembled from parts produced in different countries. Over half of global manufacturing imports are intermediate goods within supply chains. The OECD suggests that a significant portion of national exports include foreign content, with the United States seeing an increase in foreign value-added share in exports from 1995 to 2011. Global value chains have driven globalization, leading to increased trade and technological advancements, blurring the distinction between domestic and foreign activities. The evolution of global value chains has blurred the distinction between domestic and foreign activities, making it challenging to determine who benefits from global trade. Trade in intermediates has made imports crucial for exports, with policies affecting imports also impacting exports. Analysts predict shifts in GVCs that will shape future globalization and policy challenges. Foreign direct investment (FDI) is a key driver of trade, supporting the development of global value. Foreign direct investment (FDI) has facilitated the growth of global value chains by multinational corporations (MNCs), leading to increased intra-firm trade. U.S. firms invest abroad to access foreign markets and understand customer preferences. This has resulted in the expansion of trade between parent companies and their foreign affiliates. Foreign direct investment by multinational corporations has led to increased intra-firm trade. In 2016, 11% of sales of U.S. foreign affiliates went to U.S. parent companies, while 59% went to the local market and 30% to other foreign countries. Firms establish operations abroad for various reasons such as accessing raw materials or cheaper labor. Global integration through trade and investment can disrupt markets, leading to concerns about offshoring and outsourcing. U.S. MNCs focus on high-end activities. Globalization and trade liberalization impact U.S. employment and wealth distribution. U.S. multinational corporations outsource production abroad, affecting U.S. worker incomes and employment. Manufacturing jobs may decrease, while service-related jobs increase. Globalization can dampen wages for lower-skilled workers and increase returns to capital over labor. Globalization has contributed to declining labor share in national income, with studies showing a 10-20% impact on U.S. wage inequality. Most-favored-nation treatment in the WTO requires equal trade benefits for all members. The principle of Most-Favored-Nation (MFN) treatment in the WTO requires equal trade benefits for all members. Exceptions include trade agreements outside the WTO and special treatment for developing countries. National treatment mandates non-discrimination between domestic and foreign products once imported. The Most-Favored-Nation (MFN) trade status ensures equal treatment for trading partners, with lower duty rates for countries with Non-Discriminatory Treatment (NTR) status. Some countries may receive temporary NTR status before graduating to Permanent NTR (PNTR). The Trade Act of 1974 prohibits granting PNTR status to countries not receiving it at the time of the law's enactment. The Jackson-Vanik amendment further denies PNTR status to countries restricting freedom of emigration. Cuba and North Korea do not have PNTR with the United States. The United States must extend Most-Favored-Nation (MFN) treatment immediately and unconditionally to all WTO members. This includes establishing Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) for countries like China, Vietnam, and Russia upon their accession to the WTO. The Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) determines tariffs on imported goods using a structure of tariff classification developed by the World Customs Organization. The Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) categorizes goods into product subheadings at different levels, with 5,000 separate groups at the 6-digit level. HS codes are standard worldwide up to the 6-digit level, with the HTSUS further subdividing into unique 8-digit and 10-digit tariff lines for the United States. Rules of origin (ROO) determine the nationality of imported products and are crucial for various reasons. U.S. Customs and Border Protection enforces the tariff code, while the U.S. International Trade Commission publishes and updates the HTS. Rules of origin (ROO) are crucial for determining the nationality of imported products, assessing duty rates, and eligibility for trade programs. In today's global economy, determining a product's origin can be complex due to parts sourced from multiple countries. The United States negotiates different ROO within its free trade agreements to ensure tariff benefits for eligible trading partners. For example, the \"yarn-forward\" rule in apparel requires yarn and fabric to come from FTA partners for assembly. The yarn-forward rule in apparel requires materials to come from FTA partners for assembly, with some arguing its strictness while others see it as crucial for the U.S. industry. Global trade has been a key driver of the economy, but recent years have seen weakened growth following the 2008 financial crisis. Trade growth in 2016 was the slowest since 2009, attributed to various factors like weak import demand and trade protectionism. However, it rebounded in 2017 to over 5%, driven by increased investment and consumption. The IMF and WTO projected further growth for 2018 and 2019, but with rising trade tensions, global trade growth is expected to slow. Global trade growth is expected to slow due to trade policy uncertainty, with restrictive measures impacting trade flows and prices. The top-five largest trading economies in 2017 were the United States, China, Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom. China was the largest exporter, while the United States was the largest importer. The United States was the largest importer and second-largest exporter in goods trade. It also led in services trade as both the largest importer and exporter. Despite a decrease in global goods exports share from 15% in 1960 to 9% in 2017, the U.S. export share of global services is 14%. In 2017, U.S. exports and imports of goods and services combined were equivalent to 27% of GDP. The U.S. economy's trade size relative to its overall size is smaller compared to other major trading economies. The United States ranked first in the World Economic Forum's \"Global Competitiveness Index\" among 140 economies. The United States was the largest importer and second-largest exporter in goods trade, leading in services trade as well. U.S. exports have grown over 40% in the past decade, reaching 12% of GDP in 2017. China was the top U.S. trading partner, with the EU being the largest export destination and source of imports. U.S. global trade is primarily with countries with which it has free trade agreements. The majority of U.S. global trade, about 65%, is with countries without free trade agreements. Multinational corporations produce worldwide, using inputs from many countries, leading to complex value chains. Traditional trade statistics do not fully reflect the true source of resources used in production. For example, products like iPhones by U.S. firm Apple are developed in the U.S. but assembled in China with imported components. The majority of U.S. global trade is with countries without free trade agreements. Multinational corporations like Apple produce worldwide, with products such as iPhones developed in the U.S. but assembled in China using imported components. The value added in China is small, with most high-wage functions and employment occurring in the U.S. This leads to an inflated bilateral trade deficit between the two countries. Trade in value-added (TiVA) is a measure that attempts to identify the origin of the value added of goods and services. According to TiVA estimates, the U.S trade deficit with China would have been reduced by one-third in 2011 if bilateral trade flows had been measured based on the origin of value added. The trade deficit refers to the difference between a country's exports and imports of goods and services, indicating when a country imports more than it exports. The United States has consistently run trade deficits since WWII. The United States has had trade deficits annually since WWII. In 2017, the global trade deficit was $552.3 billion, driven by a goods trade deficit of $807.5 billion. The U.S. services trade surplus was $255.2 billion. The current account deficit in 2017 was $449.1 billion, down from its peak in 2006. The U.S. trade deficit in 2017 was $552.3 billion, driven by a goods trade deficit of $807.5 billion. The deficit has decreased from its peak in 2006 due to economic slowdown and lower commodity prices. The trade deficit reflects that the U.S. consumes more than it produces and imports more than it exports, primarily due to low domestic savings. Americans borrow from countries like China to make up for the shortfall. The U.S. trade deficit is driven by borrowing from countries like China, allowing for higher economic growth and increased consumption. The role of the dollar as a global reserve currency also contributes to sustaining the deficit by broadening the availability of dollar-denominated assets. Foreign investors seek these assets as safe-havens, supporting the deficit as long as they continue to loan funds to the U.S. economy. The U.S. trade deficit is influenced by borrowing from countries like China and the role of the dollar as a global reserve currency. The lack of savings in the U.S. economy contributes to the deficit, with the current account deficit relative to GDP declining from a historic high in 2006 to 2.3% in 2017. Countries with a ratio of gross domestic savings to total investment below 100, like the United States, are net borrowers and typically run current account deficits. The U.S. trade deficit is influenced by borrowing from countries like China and the role of the dollar as a global reserve currency. Countries with the largest current account deficits as a percent of GDP include the U.S., while those with surpluses are the Netherlands, Germany, and South Korea. Policymakers view U.S. bilateral trade deficits with countries like China as unfair due to market-distorting trade policies. However, reducing protectionist measures in certain countries could lead to increased exports for U.S. products. Reducing trade measures in certain countries could boost U.S. exports, but without changes in consumption and savings, the trade deficit may remain unchanged. Bilateral trade balances are influenced by factors beyond trade barriers, such as economic development, raw materials, and technological change. Complex supply chain relationships with trading partners like China also impact trade deficits. The trade deficit, influenced by complex supply chain relationships, can lead to adjustments in a country's exchange rate. Net imports cause an excess supply of U.S. dollars, which can lower its value relative to other currencies. This can make imports more expensive for Americans and exports cheaper for foreign buyers, potentially reducing the trade deficit over time. Countries use the dollar as a medium of exchange and reserve currency, making the U.S. economy a safe haven for investments. Foreign intervention in currency markets, like China buying U.S. Treasury securities, can impact the value of the dollar and trade balances. Trade deficits reflect the savings/investment shortfall, with the United States borrowing from abroad. Concern arises from debt accumulation due to sustained trade deficits. The impact of borrowing to finance imports depends on whether funds are used for productive investments or current consumption. Borrowing for technology and productivity-enhancing products can lead to higher economic growth, while borrowing for consumer purchases may burden future generations without improving the ability to repay. Some economists warn that a rising U.S. trade deficit could lead to a sharp decline in the dollar's value, causing financial turmoil. Attempts to reduce the deficit without addressing underlying imbalances may harm the economy. Ways to reduce the current account deficit include increasing domestic savings or decreasing foreign investment. Realigning exchange rates or preventing market interventions by other countries could also help. In 2017, the United States had a merchandise trade deficit of $698 billion, with manufactured goods accounting for 56% of exports and 70% of imports. Top exports and imports included transportation equipment, computer products, chemicals, and machinery. Global value chains have transformed certain U.S. manufacturing industries. The growth of global value chains has reshaped U.S. manufacturing, shifting towards advanced technology and less labor-intensive production. This has led to factory closures and job losses, contributing to the perception of a shrinking manufacturing sector. Despite a decline in manufacturing employment, output has increased due to improved productivity. Manufacturing output has increased due to higher productivity, with fewer workers needed. While the sector's importance has declined relative to services, it remains significant in the U.S. economy. From 1980 to 2017, U.S. manufacturing real output rose over 80%, and since 2009, it increased by about 20%. However, the value-added of manufacturing as a share of GDP decreased to 11% in 2017 from 21% in 1980, while services increased to 70% from 55%. U.S. manufacturing employment fell from 19.4 million in 1979 to 12.4 million in 2017, but has been rising since 2010. In 2017, manufacturing accounted for 8.5% of total nonfarm employment, down from 20.7% in 1980. The decline in manufacturing employment in the United States is not unique and has been influenced by various factors such as technology, consumer preferences, and trade. While some attribute the decline to increased imports from China, others argue that job losses in manufacturing were offset by job gains in services due to global exports expansion. Trade's role in the decline of manufacturing jobs is a topic of debate. The U.S. manufacturing sector has undergone significant restructuring over the past two decades, with automation and other factors playing a role alongside trade. Despite a decline in the U.S. share of global manufacturing value-added, the country remains a top global manufacturer. Manufacturing is a key component of the U.S. economy, accounting for a large portion of private-sector research and development and exports. In 2017, the U.S. had a trade surplus of $17 billion in agricultural goods. In 2017, the U.S. had a trade surplus of $17 billion in agricultural goods, with exports accounting for about 20% of total farm production by value. Foreign markets are a major outlet for many agricultural goods, such as wheat and cotton, which rely on other countries for absorbing over half of U.S. output. Additionally, imports of certain products like coffee, cocoa, spices, fish, and juices have accounted for a large share of U.S. food consumption in recent years. In recent years, \"Services\" encompass a variety of economic activities including audiovisual, construction, computer services, energy, express delivery, e-commerce, financial, retail, transportation, tourism, and telecommunications. These services not only serve as end-use products but also support the overall economy by facilitating global value chains, e-commerce channels, and providing credits for manufacturing. Barriers to trade in services differ from those for goods, with obstacles like tariffs and quotas affecting goods trade more prominently. Barriers to trade in services differ from those for goods, with restrictions occurring within the importing country as \"behind the border\" barriers. Discriminatory regulations may favor domestic service providers over foreign ones. Trade barriers for services often relate to establishing a commercial presence in the consumers' country or the movement of providers and consumers across borders. In 2017, the United States had a $255 billion trade surplus in services, with exports accounting for 34% of total exports and imports for 19% of total imports. U.S. services trade is significant, accounting for 79% of GDP and 82% of full-time employment. Surpluses in services trade help offset deficits in goods trade. Trade data may underestimate services trade due to the value chain's embedded services like R&D and design. The value of value-added services in trade can be captured in trade statistics. Digital trade includes various services like online shopping, communication channels, and financial services. ICT services are growing faster than trade in ICT goods. Digital trade constraints can be tariff or nontariff barriers. Nontariff barriers in digital trade, such as data localization requirements, restrict cross-border data flows and can limit the type of services a firm can offer or how it can communicate with subsidiaries abroad. The United States has historically focused on supporting economic growth and jobs through trade policies, liberalizing markets, enforcing trade commitments, and advancing strategic goals. This includes promoting economic development in developing countries, strengthening alliances, and extending influence abroad. The U.S. Trade Representative outlines key trade policy objectives annually, including supporting national security, negotiating new trade deals, enforcing trade laws, and reforming the multilateral trading system. The U.S. government's trade functions involve formulating policy, negotiating agreements, enforcing laws, and administering trade programs. Congress plays a significant role in U.S. trade policy through legislative and oversight authority. The U.S. Trade Representative plays a major role in U.S. trade policy by advising the President, negotiating trade agreements, and coordinating with multiple U.S. agencies. Agency roles have evolved over time through legislative and administrative actions, with Congress designated as the primary authority over trade policy. The U.S. Trade Representative advises the President on trade policy, negotiates agreements, and coordinates with U.S. agencies. Congress holds primary authority over trade policy, with powers granted by the U.S. Constitution to regulate commerce and make necessary laws. Trade policy is based on statutory authorities passed by Congress, including tariff schedules, trade remedy laws, and trade agreements. Congress also sets trade negotiating objectives through trade promotion authority. The President has delegated powers to negotiate reciprocal trade agreements and take executive action on trade policy. Congress passed the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act in 1934, allowing the President to reduce tariffs within approved levels and implement new tariffs without additional legislation. This authority was renewed until the Trade Act of 1974, which broadened the executive branch's mandate to open markets. The executive branch has the authority to negotiate trade agreements and open markets. The House Ways and Means Committee and Senate Finance Committee are primarily responsible for trade matters, with subcommittees dedicated to trade issues. Other committees may also have a role in trade agreements and policies. Congressional Advisory Groups on Negotiations provide advice to USTR during trade agreement negotiations. The Congressional Advisory Groups (CAGs) advise USTR during trade negotiations. Separate groups exist for each house: House Advisory Group on Negotiations (HAG) and Senate Advisory Group on Negotiations (SAG). Members influence trade policy through voting, committee membership, testimonies, letters to USTR, and informal influence. Trade promotion authority (TPA) streamlines the negotiation process. Trade promotion authority (TPA), also known as \"fast track,\" expedites the approval and implementation of trade agreements by Congress through guaranteed up-or-down votes with no amendments. Negotiations must meet specific requirements and reflect TPA objectives for expedited consideration. Congress exercises its constitutional authority over trade agreements through TPA. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), also known as \"fast track,\" streamlines the approval and implementation of trade agreements by Congress. It gives the President added negotiating credibility and assures U.S. trading partners that the final agreement will be considered by Congress in a timely manner without amendments. TPA was first enacted in 1974 and has been renewed four times, with the most recent legislation signed into law on June 29, 2015. The executive branch is responsible for executing trade policy, negotiating treaties, implementing trade agreements, and customs enforcement. The executive branch is responsible for U.S. trade agreements, customs enforcement, duty collection, trade remedy laws, budget proposals, export/import policies, and tariff rate adjustments. The President directs trade policy and the USTR advises on trade matters, negotiates agreements, and enforces trade laws. Congress created the USTR in 1962 to oversee trade policy. The USTR was created by Congress in 1962 to enhance trade profile and balance domestic and international interests in trade policy. Various executive branch agencies handle trade functions, with the USTR primarily responsible for trade negotiations and policy decisions. Other key agencies involved in trade policymaking and enforcement include Commerce, Agriculture, State, Treasury, Homeland Security, and Labor. The USTR has primary responsibility for trade negotiations and policy decisions, involving other Cabinet-level departments in a multidepartment interagency process. Congress established the Trade Policy Committee, chaired by USTR and including Secretaries of Treasury, Commerce, State, Agriculture, Labor, and other department heads. Sub-Cabinet groups like TPRG and TPSC were formed, along with a trade advisory committee system. The President influences trade legislation and signs trade agreements. The President plays a crucial role in influencing trade legislation, signing trade agreements, and making key decisions on U.S. trade policies. This includes requesting TPA, initiating trade remedy cases, and meeting with foreign leaders to discuss trade relations. The private sector and stakeholders also have a role in shaping U.S. trade policy through a three-tiered committee system established by Congress. The U.S. trade policy is shaped by the President, private sector, and stakeholders through a three-tiered committee system established by Congress. The advisory system, consisting of 28 committees, provides information and advice on negotiating objectives for trade agreements. NGOs, labor groups, and other stakeholders influence U.S. trade policy by testifying before congressional committees and government bodies, providing assessments of trade negotiations, and lobbying Congress and the executive branch. They also participate in trade initiatives and promote their interests in trade agreements. Trade plays a crucial role in the U.S. economy. Trade is a vital part of the U.S. economy, encompassing various goods and services that can be traded internationally. The decisions made regarding trade policy can impact industries, firms, workers, employment, economic growth, product choices, and prices for consumers. Market access in different countries is a key concern for many groups, while trade agreements now also address non-tariff issues like intellectual property rights and labor and environmental protections. Trade policy decisions impact various stakeholders such as businesses, farmers, workers, and consumers. Legal challenges in federal court can be brought by importers, exporters, and domestic manufacturers regarding trade actions and decisions. Cases may involve customs classification, antidumping proceedings, national security investigations, and state economic sanctions. The federal government can also enforce customs laws and restrictions on imports and exports through legal proceedings. Legal challenges in federal court can be brought by importers, exporters, and domestic manufacturers regarding trade actions and decisions, including customs laws and statutory restrictions on imports and exports. Some trade statutes may preclude judicial review, such as preliminary determinations in AD and CVD proceedings and actions related to World Trade Organization agreements. Court decisions can impact U.S. trade policy by examining agency interpretations of statutory mandates, deference to executive branch actions, and the legality of trade statutes. The U.S. Court of International Trade (USCIT) has exclusive jurisdiction over trade-related matters, including customs decisions, trade remedy determinations, and import embargoes. It consists of nine judges appointed by the President with Senate approval. USCIT decisions can be appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and possibly the U.S. Supreme Court. The U.S. Court of International Trade (USCIT) has exclusive jurisdiction over trade-related matters, including customs decisions, trade remedy determinations, and import embargoes. Statutory provisions related to the USCIT can be found at 28 U.S.C. Sections 251-258 (establishment), 28 U.S.C. Sections 1581-1585 (jurisdiction), and 28 U.S.C. Sections 2631-2647 (procedure). The United States negotiates trade liberalizing agreements for economic, commercial, foreign policy, and national security reasons. Objectives include encouraging trade partners to reduce tariffs and nontariff barriers, gaining competitive advantages for U.S. firms, increasing market access for U.S. exporters, and strengthening alliances. The United States participates in various trade agreements to strengthen alliances and increase its influence in different regions. These agreements include multilateral agreements negotiated in the World Trade Organization, free trade agreements (FTAs) involving two or more countries, and plurilateral agreements focusing on specific sectors. Currently, the United States has 14 trade agreements in place. The United States has 14 FTAs in force, covering 20 countries, with the majority of partners being small, developing countries. Only 35% of total U.S. trade is with FTA partners, while more than 99% is with WTO member countries. U.S. trade policy under the Trump Administration has shifted towards bilateral negotiations, with the withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and a focus on future trade deals. The United States, under the Trump Administration, has shifted towards bilateral trade negotiations, withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. President Trump has renegotiated two U.S. FTAs and proposed new negotiations, including the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) and amendments to the U.S.-South Korea FTA (KORUS). The renegotiations were conducted under Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) procedures, allowing for expedited consideration by Congress. The United States, under the Trump Administration, has shifted towards bilateral trade negotiations, withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. President Trump has renegotiated two U.S. FTAs and proposed new negotiations, including the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) and amendments to the U.S.-South Korea FTA (KORUS). In October 2018, USTR notified Congress of its intent to negotiate new trade agreements with Japan, the European Union, and United Kingdom, with negotiations potentially starting in early 2019. U.S. FTAs are comprehensive, covering tariff reductions, services trade barriers, foreign investment rules, intellectual property rights, government procurement markets, labor standards, and environmental provisions. The U.S. seeks to establish new trading rules in recent negotiations, including digital trade and state-owned issues. The United States has over 50 Trade and Investment Framework Agreements (TIFAs) with developing countries, allowing for consultations on mutual economic interests to promote trade and investment. TIFAs are nonbinding and do not require congressional approval, but can lead to further negotiations such as Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) or bilateral investment treaties (BITs). The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) was established in 1947 post-WWII. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) was created in 1947 post-WWII to establish rules governing international trade. It was replaced by the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1995, but some of its principles continue to be applied today. GATT aimed to lower tariffs and promote non-discriminatory trade practices among its original 23 signatories, including the United States. Despite its limited enforcement mechanisms, GATT led to a significant reduction in tariffs and trade barriers. The World Trade Organization (WTO) was established on January 1, 1995, succeeding the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) created in 1947. It administers trade rules and agreements to eliminate barriers, govern trade, and facilitate negotiations and dispute resolution. The WTO oversees agreements for trade in goods, services, intellectual property rights, and conducts multilateral and plurilateral negotiations among its members. The World Trade Organization (WTO) oversees multilateral and plurilateral negotiations among its members, such as the Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) and Information Technology Agreement (ITA). The Doha Development Agenda, which began in 2001, has been stalled since the WTO Nairobi Ministerial in 2015. The latest WTO Ministerial Conference in December 2017 did not produce major deliverables, with ongoing talks in fisheries subsidies and e-commerce. The WTO's effectiveness in trade liberalization negotiations has been questioned. The WTO is facing scrutiny for its role in trade liberalization and dispute resolution post-Doha Round collapse. Members are pushing for reforms to enhance the organization's effectiveness, including improvements to the dispute settlement system. The Trump Administration's delay in approving appointments to the WTO Appellate Body could lead to the system's dysfunction by late 2019. Dispute settlement proceedings can be initiated by WTO members to challenge trade practices violating agreements. The WTO dispute settlement process involves consultations between parties, followed by adjudication by a dispute panel and possible appeal to the WTO Appellate Body. If a member is found to violate WTO obligations, they must remove the measure or face retaliatory action. The United States has been heavily involved in WTO disputes, with 575 complaints filed since 1995. Several pending disputes are significant for the US. Several pending WTO disputes are of significance to the United States, including challenges to recent tariff measures imposed by the Trump Administration. WTO decisions do not directly impact U.S. law, requiring legislative action for implementation. USTR determines compliance actions for successful challenges, which may involve amending regulations or providing compensation to complainant countries. The United States generally complies with WTO decisions, seeking to ensure compliance from other members. Disputes under U.S. FTAs are resolved through consultations or panels, with possible trade benefit suspension for non-compliance. State-state dispute settlement is not commonly used under U.S. FTAs, with disputes usually resolved through consultations. The United States resolves disputes under NAFTA and other FTAs through consultations or WTO rules. There is a separate dispute system for investment-related provisions in most U.S. FTAs. NAFTA and USMCA have a unique binational panel system for trade remedy laws. Trade preference programs provide duty-free access to the U.S. market for eligible developing countries. The United States resolves disputes under NAFTA and other FTAs through consultations or WTO rules. There is a separate dispute system for investment-related provisions in most U.S. FTAs. NAFTA and USMCA have a unique binational panel system for trade remedy laws. Trade preference programs provide duty-free access to the U.S. market for eligible developing countries, including the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), Andean Trade Preference Act (APTA), Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (CBERA), United States-Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act (CBTPA), African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity Through Partnership Encouragement Act (HOPE), and country-specific trade preferences for Nepal. GSP is the largest U.S. trade preference program, covering 120 countries and territories, with $21 billion imports entering the United States in 2017 under the program. Eligibility criteria include protections for intellectual property rights and worker rights. USTR is currently conducting eligibility reviews. Trade capacity building (TCB) involves U.S. assistance to support developing countries' integration in international trade. The U.S. invested $1.2 billion in TCB activities in FY2016 across 134 countries. TCB helps countries negotiate trade agreements, implement customs reforms, improve labor and environment protections, and meet export standards. The U.S. government lacks a single agency responsible for coordinating Trade Capacity Building (TCB) activities. USAID and the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) receive the most funding for TCB, with other agencies like Agriculture, Labor, State, and the Trade and Development Agency also involved. Congress has the power to set tariffs, which has been partially delegated to the President. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) collects tariffs at ports of entry, generating just 1% of total federal revenue in 2016. The United States has historically used tariffs to promote global trade liberalization and reduce tariffs through bilateral and multilateral agreements. By 2016, U.S. tariffs averaged 3.3%, the lowest among top global economies. Tariffs collected only 1% of total federal revenue in 2016. The United States has historically used tariffs to promote global trade liberalization and reduce tariffs through agreements. U.S. tariffs averaged 3.3%, the lowest among top global economies. The Trump Administration has increased tariffs on certain goods from key trading partners. Trade remedies like antidumping and countervailing duty laws are used to address unfair trade practices. Trade remedy laws in the United States, including antidumping and countervailing duty laws, are used to address unfair trade practices. These laws must comply with U.S. WTO obligations and aim to protect U.S. industries and workers from unfair competition. Some stakeholders support these trade remedies, while others, including importers and downstream consuming industries, have concerns about their impact. Antidumping (AD) is a commonly used U.S. trade remedy law aimed at addressing unfair trade practices where exporters sell goods at lower prices in one market than in their home market. This can lead to market share gains, competition deterrence, or industrial overcapacity reduction. AD duties are imposed when foreign goods are sold at \"less than fair value\" in the U.S., causing harm to domestic industries. AD orders are subject to annual review if requested. As of mid-December 2018, the United States had 354 AD orders in place, with over one-third against China. Countervailing duty (CVD) is another frequently used U.S. trade remedy law to offset foreign subsidies, with 113 CVD orders in place as of the same time. The procedures for both AD and CVD investigations are similar. As of mid-December 2018, the United States had 113 CVD orders in place, nearly half against China. Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974 authorizes the President to restrict imports causing serious injury to domestic industry. Safeguard actions provide temporary relief through tariffs or quotas to aid domestic industry adjustment to import competition. Unlike AD and CVD cases, no unfair trade practices allegation is needed for a safeguard investigation. The ITC conducts investigations initiated by petitions from trade associations, companies, or unions. If imports cause serious injury, the ITC recommends temporary relief to the President for final action implementation. In 2017, two safeguard investigations were initiated under the Trump Administration. The President imposed safeguard measures on imports of solar cells and large residential washing machines. The ITC conducted 73 investigations from 1975 to 2001, with 19 cases resulting in safeguard measures imposed by the President. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 allows the President to impose restrictions on imports for national security reasons. The Trade Expansion Act of 1962 allows the President to impose restrictions on imports for national security reasons. The Secretary of Commerce determines if imports threaten national security, with the President having the discretion to impose tariffs or quotas. In 2018, tariffs were imposed on steel and aluminum imports due to national security concerns. In 2018, the President imposed a 25% tariff on steel imports and a 10% tariff on aluminum imports. The Administration is investigating uranium, autos, and auto parts imports under Section 232. Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 allows the US to enforce trade agreements and address unfair trade barriers, including intellectual property rights violations. Cases can be initiated by petition or by USTR, seeking a negotiated settlement with the trading partner. The USTR enforces trade agreements and addresses unfair trade barriers, including intellectual property rights violations. They use formal dispute settlement proceedings for cases involving trade agreements like the WTO. If a resolution is not reached, USTR may retaliate with tariffs on selected products. The \"Special 301\" provision requires USTR to report annually to Congress on countries with inadequate IPR protection. USTR issues a three-tier list of countries with inadequate IPR regimes, with a \"Priority Foreign Country\" designation for the most serious cases. USTR has initiated 125 Section 301 cases since 1974, retaliating in 16 instances. In 2017, USTR launched an investigation of China's IPR technology policies that may harm U.S. economic interests. In March 2018, USTR found certain Chinese policies to be \"unreasonable or discriminatory\" and subsequently increased tariffs on $250 billion worth of U.S. imports from China. China responded by increasing tariffs on $110 billion worth of U.S. products. Both sides pursued dispute cases at the WTO, with USTR reporting in November 2018 that China had not fundamentally altered its unfair practices. At the G-20 Leaders' Summit, President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to start negotiations on \"structural changes\" regarding IP and technology issues, agriculture, and services within 90 days. China agreed to make significant purchases of U.S. agricultural, energy, and industrial products, while the U.S. agreed to suspend planned tariff increases from 10% to 25% on January 1, 2019, contingent on reaching an agreement in 90 days. Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 prohibits unfair competition in importing goods to the U.S., particularly for IPR enforcement. Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 prohibits imports infringing U.S. patents, copyrights, trademarks, and semiconductor products. The ITC conducts investigations and may issue exclusion orders. Trade Adjustment Assistance programs offer federal aid to those affected by trade. The Trade Adjustment Assistance programs, authorized by the Trade Act of 1974, provide assistance to workers affected by foreign competition through job loss or relocation. The largest program, TAA for Workers (TAAW), received $790 million in FY2019 for benefits such as career services, training, and income support. Additional TAA programs are available for firms and farmers impacted by foreign competition. Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) programs provide support to workers, firms, and farmers affected by foreign competition. TAA aims to facilitate adjustment, compensate those impacted by trade liberalization, and generate support for international trade. Critics argue that TAA is costly and reduces incentives for relocation and adjustment. Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) programs are criticized for being costly and inefficient, reducing incentives for relocation and adjustment, and lacking effectiveness. Despite disagreements, Congress has consistently maintained the program over the past five decades. Additionally, various federal agencies such as the Export-Import Bank, Department of Agriculture, and Overseas Private Investment Corporation support U.S. exports and investments through finance programs. The BUILD Act of 2018 further promotes U.S. investments in developing countries. The BUILD Act of 2018 establishes a new agency for U.S. commercial interests and foreign policy objectives. U.S. trade financing aims to level the playing field for U.S. firms against foreign competitors. The Ex-Im Bank provides financial support for U.S. exports to counter similar activities by foreign governments. The Ex-Im Bank operates under a statutory charter extended through September 30, 2019. However, it has not been fully operational due to a lack of board quorum, hindering approval of export financing above $10 million. Presidential appointments to the board require Senate approval, sparking debate over the role of government in export financing. Export controls are controversial, balancing national security goals with economic interests. The United States restricts exports of defense items, dual-use goods, nuclear materials, and items related to weapons proliferation through various laws and authorities. Export controls are administered by multiple government departments, requiring licenses for certain exports. The Export Controls Act of 2018 grants broad authority to the President in this area. The Export Controls Act of 2018 (ECA) grants the President broad authority to implement dual-use export controls, replacing the Export Administration Act of 1979. The ECA allows the Department of Commerce to regulate the export of \"emerging and foundational technologies\" crucial to national security. Dual-use goods have both civilian and military applications and are licensed by the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security. The Bureau of Industry and Security issues licenses based on an item's technical characteristics, destination, and end use. Capital flows include foreign direct investment (FDI) and foreign portfolio investment (FPI). FDI involves acquiring real assets in another country, while FPI involves purchasing foreign equities or bonds. FDI stimulates direct employment, while FPI is highly liquid. Official capital flows are generated by governments for various purposes. Global capital flows have grown significantly since 1990, with trade in goods and services increasing from $4 trillion to $23 trillion. Gross capital flows expanded from $1 trillion to $4 trillion annually, peaking at over $12 trillion in 2007. Other capital flows, such as foreign exchange and derivatives markets, also saw substantial growth during this period. These markets facilitate trade in assets and impact international exchange. The total daily trading of foreign currencies exceeded $5.1 trillion in 2016, impacting the international exchange value of the dollar and prices of goods and services. Multinational corporations invest abroad to increase profits, driven by competitive advantages, resources like low-cost labor, and intra-firm relationships. MNCs possess special knowledge or managerial abilities that give them an edge over foreign firms. Foreign direct investment (FDI) by multinational corporations (MNCs) is driven by various factors such as gaining access to resources, improving efficiency, and expanding market share. FDI supports global value chains and allows firms to operate close to customers in foreign markets. Mergers and acquisitions through FDI transactions can enhance a firm's global competitiveness. The total stock of global outward FDI in 2017 was $31 trillion, with the United States being the largest source of FDI worldwide. In 2017, the total stock of global outward FDI was $31 trillion. The United States is the largest source and recipient of FDI, with developing Asia leading in global FDI inflows. FDI to and from the United States has significantly increased over the past few decades. The largest destinations for U.S. FDI outflows include the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Luxembourg, Ireland, Canada, Singapore, Australia, Germany, and Japan. U.S. outward FDI is concentrated in high-technology, finance, and services sectors. Economists advocate for unimpeded international capital flows like FDI for mutual economic benefits. Direct investment benefits both the home and host countries by allowing firms to exploit competitive advantages, acquire skills, and strengthen their competitive position. Inward FDI adds to the capital stock and skill set of the host economy, brings technological advances, boosts capital formation, and contributes to a more competitive business environment and productivity growth. Overall, FDI promotes international trade and global economic integration. Foreign firms investing in the United States contribute significantly to the economy, employing millions of workers, exporting billions in goods, and adding value to the GDP. Concerns exist about U.S. firms investing abroad and potentially shifting production and jobs overseas, impacting domestic employment and wages. Official sources do not track activities of U.S. firms moving operations abroad, leading to limited data on this phenomenon. Most data on U.S. firms shifting plants or jobs abroad is anecdotal. Outward FDI is mainly in high-income developed countries with similar markets. Economists argue that U.S. direct investment abroad doesn't necessarily lead to job losses or lower incomes overall. However, specific companies and sectors can be negatively impacted when production is moved overseas. International investment agreements establish rules on investment protections. International Investment Agreements (IIAs) set binding rules on investment protections, with over 2,600 IIAs globally. They aim to reduce FDI restrictions, ensure fair treatment of investors, and safeguard governments' right to regulate. U.S. IIAs, such as bilateral investment treaties (BITs), require Senate ratification for reciprocal commitments between the U.S. and partner countries. The United States negotiates bilateral investment treaties (BITs) and investment chapters in free trade agreements (FTAs) through USTR and the State Department. Currently, the U.S. has BITs with 40 countries, with the latest one ratified with Rwanda in 2012. BIT negotiations with China and India have stalled. Additionally, the U.S. has 14 FTAs covering 20 countries, most of which include investment chapters. Investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) allows private investors to bring claims against host country governments for alleged violations of investment agreements through international arbitration panels. Investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) is a procedure for resolving disputes between investors and countries, overseen by organizations like the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). The number of ISDS cases has increased due to global foreign direct investment growth. U.S. investors make up a significant portion of these cases, with most claims under NAFTA. The use of ISDS has sparked debate in recent U.S. trade negotiations. The Trump Administration made major changes to ISDS under the NAFTA renegotiation, with the proposed USMCA aiming to eliminate ISDS between the United States and Canada. ISDS has been a point of contention in various trade negotiations, with the EU pushing for an investment court system in place of ISDS. Foreign investment, especially by firms owned by foreign governments, can raise national security concerns. CFIUS, an interagency committee, oversees foreign investment transactions that could impact U.S. national security. Established in 1975, it gained formal review authority in 1988 and was expanded in 2007. The Secretary of the Treasury chairs CFIUS, which conducts risk-based analyses of foreign investments in U.S. firms. The President has the authority to block foreign investments in U.S. firms, with CFIUS overseeing transactions that could impact national security. Recent cases include blocking acquisitions by Chinese and Singapore-based firms. The FIRRMA Act of 2018 expands CFIUS' review process to include non-controlling investments in critical technology or infrastructure, sparking objections. The United States promotes both inward and outward foreign direct investment (FDI). The Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) provides services to facilitate U.S. private investments abroad. The BUILD Act establishes a new U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) to expand and consolidate development finance functions. SelectUSA coordinates federal efforts to attract FDI in the United States. SelectUSA, established in 2011 via executive order, coordinates federal efforts to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) in the United States. Its primary functions include providing information and data on investments, helping resolve issues with federal programs, and advocating for investments in the U.S. over foreign locations."
