    "content": "Federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs have been in existence since the National Defense Education Act of 1958. These programs offer borrowers the opportunity to have their student loan debt forgiven or repaid in exchange for service in specific professions or occupations. Currently, there are over 50 federal loan forgiveness and repayment programs available. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs have been created, with over 50 authorized and approximately 30 operational as of October 1, 2017. These programs involve the federal government forgiving or canceling a portion of an individual's student loan debt in exchange for fulfilling certain requirements, often through public service or specific occupations. Some programs also offer loan forgiveness as part of income-driven repayment plans. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs aim to provide financial incentives for individuals to enter public service or high-need professions, occupations, or specialties. They also offer debt relief to borrowers who have not fully repaid their student loans after an extended period of time. These benefits are available to borrowers of federal student loans who choose to enter public service, work in specific professions, or repay their loans through an income-driven repayment plan. Other forms of debt relief may be available to borrowers in specific circumstances, such as loan discharge for disability, death, school closure, false certification, unauthorized loans, unpaid refunds, successful defense to repayment, and bankruptcy. The NDSL program, established in 1958, was one of the earliest federal student loan forgiveness programs. In response to the Soviet Union's Sputnik launch in 1957, Congress funded education programs like the NDSL program, offering low-interest loans to college students. A student loan forgiveness component was also included to attract more teachers by canceling up to half of their loans for full-time public school teaching. The NDSL loan forgiveness program was initially created to offer low-interest loans to college students in response to the Soviet Union's Sputnik launch in 1957. It later evolved to provide loan forgiveness benefits to teachers in elementary or secondary schools with low-income students or students with disabilities, as well as those serving in Head Start programs or in the Armed Forces. Borrowers could have a portion of their loans canceled based on years of public service completed. The Federal Perkins Loan Program, formerly known as the NDSL, was established in response to the Soviet Union's Sputnik launch in 1957. It later expanded to include loan forgiveness programs for teachers, healthcare professionals, and other high-need areas. Currently, there are over 50 federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs available. The curr_chunk provides a summary of federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs authorized by federal law. It outlines the purpose and general operation of these programs, with over 50 programs available to provide debt relief to borrowers in specific service areas. Comprehensive details can be found in federal statutes, regulations, and agency guidance. Federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs offer benefits to borrowers based on service, employment, profession, location, or income-driven repayment plans. Each program has unique criteria, benefit amounts, funding sources, and means of providing benefits. This overview identifies parameters to characterize the programs and highlights similarities and differences, using consistent terms to describe the various aspects of the programs. Federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs have different criteria for benefits, including employment-focused loan forgiveness, repayment plan-based loan forgiveness, and income-driven repayment plans. These programs relieve borrowers of responsibility for repaying a portion of their student loan debt after meeting specified requirements. The availability of benefits may be considered an entitlement for qualified borrowers. Loan forgiveness benefits are entitlements to qualified borrowers, funded through mandatory appropriations. Borrowers must meet eligibility criteria outlined in loan terms and conditions to receive these benefits. Loan forgiveness benefits for qualified borrowers are generally funded through mandatory appropriations. There are two categories: forgiveness for public service employment and forgiveness following income-driven repayment. Loan repayment programs offer debt relief for specific service, profession, or location, with the entity either repaying the borrower's debt directly or providing funding for repayment. Loan repayment benefits are separate from federal student loan programs and are designed to address employment needs or shortages. These benefits can help federal agencies recruit and retain qualified employees. Availability is limited, discretionary, and subject to fund appropriation. Some programs may incur federal income tax liability. Debt forgiven under loan forgiveness programs may result in federal income tax liability. Employment-focused loan forgiveness programs exclude debt from gross income for tax purposes, while income-driven repayment or public service forgiveness may include debt in gross income, leading to tax liability for borrowers. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs are available for public service employment and income-driven repayment. Eligible loans include federal student loans from Title IV of the Higher Education Act, loans from the Public Health Service Act, and private education loans. Federal student loans eligible for loan forgiveness or repayment include loans from HEA or PHSA programs, and in some cases, private education loans. Currently, federal student loans are only offered through the Direct Loan program under HEA Title IV, previously also through the FFEL program until 2010, and the Federal Perkins Loan program until 2017. Loans were made through the Federal Perkins Loan program and the Direct Loan program, with the government providing federal capital in the latter. The FFEL program involved nonfederal lenders and capital. Nonprofit guaranty agencies managed federal loan insurance and loan forgiveness benefits. The FFEL and Direct Loan programs offered similar loan types with some differences in loan forgiveness benefits. In the Perkins Loan program, loans were made by institutions of higher education with federal and institutional capital. The institution acted as the lender and was responsible for loan origination, servicing, and cancelation benefits. Direct Subsidized Loans in the Direct Loan program are available to undergraduate students with financial need, with the government subsidizing interest charges. The federal government subsidizes Direct Subsidized Loans by not charging interest while the borrower is in school at least half-time, during a grace period before repayment, and during deferment. Borrowing limits apply, with $21.5 billion in loans made in FY2017. Direct Unsubsidized Loans are available to all students regardless of financial need. Loan proceeds can be used to cover parts of a student's cost of attendance. Direct Unsubsidized Loans and Direct PLUS Loans are non-need-based loans available for postsecondary education expenses. Borrowers are responsible for all accrued interest on Unsubsidized Loans, with borrowing limits in place. PLUS Loans are for parents of dependent undergraduate students and graduate/professional students, with no explicit borrowing limits. In FY2017, $49.8 billion in Unsubsidized Loans and an unspecified amount in PLUS Loans were issued. In FY2017, Direct PLUS Loans had no explicit borrowing limits, with $12.5 billion made to parents of undergraduate students and $9.9 billion made to graduate and professional students. Direct Consolidation Loans allow borrowers to combine federal student loans into a single loan. Consolidation Loans allow borrowers to combine different types of federal student loans, including loans from various programs like HPSL, LDS, NSL, and HEAL. This feature enables borrowers to access loan forgiveness and repayment benefits for loans that were originally made without these benefits. The current Direct Consolidation Loans are fixed-rate loans based on the weighted average interest rate of the loans being consolidated. In FY2017, 0.9 million Direct Consolidation Loans totaling $48.8 billion were made, with interest rates based on the weighted average interest rate of the loans being consolidated. Perkins Loans, available to undergraduate and graduate students, have a fixed interest rate of 5% per year. Borrowers engaged in public service may have a portion of their Perkins Loans cancelled. In FY2017, approximately 253,000 Perkins Loans totaling $782.23 million were made. HRSA offers student loans to health professions students through five loan programs. HRSA offers student loans to health professions students through five loan programs authorized under Title VII and Title VIII of the PHSA. In academic year 2016-2017, a total of 20,849 loans were made for approximately $162.8 million. The programs include low interest rate loans for dentistry, optometry, pharmacy, podiatric medicine, veterinary medicine, and 5% fixed interest rate loans for allopathic or osteopathic medicine students. Administered by schools and individual medical schools, the loans are available to citizens, nationals, or lawful permanent residents of the United States who are financially needy. The Primary Care Loan Program offers need-based, low-interest loans to students from disadvantaged backgrounds who are citizens, nationals, or lawful permanent residents of the United States. Recipients must complete a residency in a primary care field and practice in that field for 10 years. Failure to meet service requirements results in repayment at a higher interest rate. In 2016-2017, HRSA estimated 252 loans totaling $17.8 million were made. The Primary Care Loan Program offers low-interest loans to students pursuing degrees in various medical fields. Administered by individual schools, the program selects students who are U.S. citizens, nationals, or lawful permanent residents. In 2016-2017, HRSA estimated 1,619 loans totaling $21.7 million were made for allopathic or osteopathic medicine, optometry, podiatry, pharmacy, or veterinary medicine. Additionally, the program provides loans to nursing students pursuing diplomas, associate, baccalaureate, or graduate degrees. Administered by nursing schools, the program selected financially needy participants who are U.S. citizens, nationals, or lawful permanent residents, with 10,138 loans totaling $31.8 million in 2016-2017. The Nursing Faculty Loan Program provides loans to registered nurses completing graduate studies to become nursing school faculty. Administered by nursing schools, the program made 1,998 loans totaling $27.3 million in 2016-2017. The Health Education Assistance Loans (HEAL) program, phased out between 1995 and 1999, supported students pursuing degrees in various medical fields. The Health Education Assistance Loans (HEAL) program supported students in medical fields such as osteopathic medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine, optometry, podiatry, public health, pharmacy, chiropractic, and graduate programs in health administration, clinical psychology, and allied health professions. Borrowers of HEAL program loans are still responsible for repayment. Private student loans are also available through various nonfederal entities like banks, credit unions, state-supported programs, and institutions of higher education. Terms and conditions for private education loans are determined by the lending entity. The report outlines different categories of debt relief programs for student loans, with unique characteristics and features. These programs aim to provide borrowers with debt relief by offering benefits to those who meet specific eligibility criteria. Program components and parameters are used to classify and compare the various programs. The report categorizes debt relief programs for student loans based on qualifying service, borrower economic circumstances, debt relief amounts, and limitations. It presents loan forgiveness entitlement programs, followed by programs for public service and income-driven repayment plans. Loan repayment programs for broad public service or employment needs are also discussed. See Appendix A for program-specific details. Loan forgiveness for public service employment provides debt relief to qualified borrowers in certain occupations, specific employers, or public service. These benefits are entitlements for federal student loans and potentially available to many qualified borrowers. Public service loan repayment programs are more narrowly targeted for agency-specific recruitment and retention needs. Loan forgiveness for public service employment programs offer debt relief to qualified borrowers with federal student loans. Table 1 summarizes the various forgiveness programs, highlighting eligibility criteria based on employer, occupation, and economic circumstances during repayment. Programs are listed by size of benefits available. Loan forgiveness programs are ranked by the scale of benefits available to borrowers. To qualify, borrowers must meet specific eligibility criteria, such as completing a certain type of service or entering a particular occupation. These programs are available to teachers, with Federal Perkins Loan Cancellation extending to other public service occupations like law enforcement and public defenders, and Direct Loan Public Service Loan Forgiveness open to a broader range of individuals in full-time public service roles. Loan forgiveness programs for federal student loans involve service commitments in government agencies or nonprofit organizations for a minimum period of time. The repayment plans are based on income-driven repayment and are entitlements for qualified borrowers. These programs are distinct from those targeting public service employment. Table 2 summarizes various loan forgiveness programs based on income-driven repayment, showing availability to a wide range of eligible borrowers. Unlike Table 1, programs are not grouped by scope or financial resources, as factors like borrower characteristics impact participation. Under income-driven repayment programs, borrowers must make monthly payments towards qualifying federal student loans for 20-25 years based on factors like debt amount and income. Monthly payments are capped at a percentage of discretionary income. At the end of the repayment period, the remaining loan balance is forgiven. No specific employer or service requirements exist for these programs. Loan forgiveness for public service employment offers debt relief. Loan repayment for public service employment provides debt relief benefits to borrowers in specific occupations or public service. These programs aim to address employment needs or shortages and help government agencies recruit and retain qualified employees. The programs are limited in availability and not considered entitlements to borrowers. Loan repayment programs for public service employment offer debt relief benefits to qualified borrowers. These programs are smaller in scale compared to loan forgiveness programs and aim to address employment needs or shortages. Table 3 summarizes the various repayment programs available, highlighting eligibility criteria such as specific employers, occupations, and economic circumstances. Table 3 illustrates 19 loan repayment programs targeting health-related occupations, including those addressing provider shortages and healthcare faculty needs. These programs aim to meet various employment needs and are not grouped by availability or financial resources. Loan repayment programs target various occupations such as legal, large animal veterinarians, and healthcare faculty to meet employment needs. Borrowers can work for multiple employers but may be required to serve in specific geographic locations. Service commitments typically last between one and five years. Loan repayment programs for federal government employees are tailored to agency-specific recruitment and retention needs. Loan repayment programs for federal government employees are narrowly targeted to meet agency-specific recruitment and retention needs. Information on the programs' scale is not readily available, but the Office of Personnel Management reports on the number of agencies participating and the amount of benefits received. Table 4 summarizes the various loan repayment programs offered for individual federal agencies to recruit and retain qualified employees. Repayment benefits may be available to borrowers employed by a single government agency or federal government employers. Table 4 summarizes federal loan repayment programs for recruiting and retaining qualified employees. It outlines program details such as eligibility requirements, operational status, and administering departments. Unlike Table 1, these programs are not categorized by availability or financial resources. Federal loan repayment programs are utilized by federal agencies to recruit and retain qualified employees, with 25 programs available. 8 of these programs specifically target members of the Armed Forces. Benefits vary in availability, with some programs open to all agency employees and others targeting specific fields or occupations. Participants in loan repayment programs must commit to serving for a minimum period of time. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs require a minimum service commitment of one to five years. Eligibility is influenced by economic circumstances, with some programs considering borrower's economic status at the time of borrowing, while others assess it during the repayment period. Economic circumstances are a key criterion for qualifying for benefits in these programs. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs are available based on economic circumstances. Eligibility is determined by family economic circumstances or if monthly loan payments exceed a certain percentage of income. Programs vary in the amount of forgiveness or repayment benefits provided and the schedule for receiving them. Benefits can include forgiving the entire loan balance, repaying a specified dollar amount, or a percentage of the outstanding loan. Some programs offer complete forgiveness of student loans after a certain number of payments. Some loan forgiveness and repayment programs offer benefits such as forgiving the remaining balance of outstanding loans after a specified period. Other programs provide repayment benefits in the form of a flat dollar amount or a percentage of the borrower's outstanding loans. Restrictions may apply to the availability of benefits in certain programs. Certain federal loan forgiveness and repayment programs have restrictions that limit benefits in certain situations. Borrowers in default are usually not eligible for benefits. Some programs also restrict borrowers from receiving benefits from multiple programs for the same service. U.S. citizenship may be required for eligibility in some programs. Failure to complete the service term may result in financial penalties. The Stafford Loan Forgiveness for Teachers program does not overlap benefits with other forgiveness programs like PSLF or AmeriCorps Education Awards. Some programs may require U.S. citizenship for eligibility, while others do not explicitly state this but may still only be available to certain groups based on the type of loan. Federal student loans under the Higher Education Act are only available to specific groups like U.S. citizens, nationals, and legal permanent residents. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs, such as PSLF, are restricted to certain types of loans based on the borrower's citizenship and immigration status. Defaulted loans may also impact eligibility for loan forgiveness benefits in some programs. In federal loan forgiveness programs, borrowers may be eligible for loan forgiveness even if their loans are in default. Clawback provisions may require recipients to repay benefits if they fail to complete service obligations. Clawback provisions in federal loan forgiveness programs may require participants to repay unearned benefits, sometimes with interest and punitive fees. Some exemptions exist for disability or death. Student loan forgiveness and repayment benefits are typically included in gross income for federal income taxation, but exceptions may apply. Loan forgiveness or repayment benefits may be excluded from gross income and exempt from income tax liability. The Higher Education Act specifies that forgiven Federal Perkins Loans are excluded from gross income. Loans must have been borrowed for education and contain terms for cancellation based on work in certain professions. Loan forgiveness or repayment benefits may be excluded from income tax liability if certain conditions are met, such as loans being borrowed for education and work in specific professions. However, individuals are responsible for paying any income tax associated with loan forgiveness if not excluded by statute. Some loan forgiveness programs offer supplemental funds to offset tax liability. Researchers debate the effectiveness of loan forgiveness and repayment benefits in incentivizing borrowers to enter specific fields or government service. Approximately $200 million in revenue was lost in FY2017 due to the exclusion of income from student loan debt forgiveness. Key issues include whether individuals would enter these fields without loan benefits and if student loan debt is the main barrier to entry. The effectiveness of loan forgiveness and repayment benefits in incentivizing borrowers to enter specific fields or government service is debated. Key issues include whether student loan debt is the main barrier to entry and if debt relief encourages students to finance more of their education with loans. The cost of these programs to the federal government relative to the benefits received is also a consideration. One issue to consider when evaluating the impact of loan forgiveness or repayment programs on employment choices is whether recipients would have engaged in qualifying service without the program. Comparing career paths of individuals with access to these benefits to those without can provide insights. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) studied the career trajectories of loan repayment recipients in its Intramural Research Program (IRP) to assess the program's effectiveness in encouraging individuals. The NIH studied the career trajectories of loan repayment recipients in its Intramural Research Program (IRP) to assess the program's effectiveness in encouraging individuals to continue medical research. Individuals who received loan repayment benefits were more likely to stay at the NIH or pursue a career in medical research elsewhere. The program may be meeting its goals, but other factors also influence individuals' career choices. The effectiveness of a loan repayment program in incentivizing individuals to enter certain fields or positions may be questioned if individuals would have chosen those paths regardless of the program. For example, in recent years, law school graduates facing limited job opportunities may opt for public interest or government jobs even without loan repayment benefits. Similarly, healthcare providers practicing in rural areas may have done so even without receiving a loan repayment award. The NIH found that loan repayment awards were a key factor in attracting physicians with competing job offers to stay in research. Loan repayment programs are effective in recruiting and retaining staff in federal agencies. Loan repayment programs are effective at recruiting and maintaining staff, but some aspects of the program's design may undermine its effectiveness. Discretionary programs may have funding reduced or cut, making loan repayment benefits uncertain for individuals. The effectiveness of these programs as a recruitment incentive is hard to determine as job applicants do not know if they will receive a loan repayment award until after accepting a job. Loan repayment amounts may not be a sufficient incentive for individuals to enter and remain in certain professions. Researchers suggest that financial benefits need to be meaningful to offset borrowing costs for loan repayment programs to be successful in meeting recruitment and retention needs. Loan repayment programs may not be as attractive to participants due to tax liabilities associated with receiving loan repayment benefits. Some agencies estimate that taxes can account for 39% of the repayment amount, making the program less appealing. Short-term nature of programs, like a two-year employment commitment, may also contribute to turnover. Some researchers have found that individuals with service obligations have shorter tenures in a position. Loan forgiveness programs assume student loan debt heavily influences employment decisions, but career choices are more complex. Other deterrents may also impact job choices. The National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment Program (NHSCLRP) offers loan repayment benefits to physicians in specific geographic areas, but lower compensation levels and other deterrents also affect career choices. Debt levels may influence career decisions for certain racial and ethnic groups. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs may be available to individuals regardless of race or ethnicity to address career choice factors. However, these programs may not fully compensate for the earnings gap between different fields, such as primary care medicine and specialty fields. High levels of debt can still influence job choices, despite the availability of loan repayment options. High levels of debt influence job choice, as seen in a literature review on law school debt's impact on career paths. Graduates with high debt are more likely to work at large law firms for higher pay. Similarly, undergraduates with higher debt tend to choose higher salary jobs over education-related or nonprofit roles. Some studies suggest debt levels play a secondary role in job selection, with demographics being a more significant factor. The impact of student loan forgiveness and repayment programs on career choices of law school graduates is uncertain. There is a question of whether these programs lead students to take on more debt for education expenses. Under Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) plans, monthly payments are based on income, not the amount owed, with the possibility of loan forgiveness after a set period. Critics argue that this approach may lead to over-borrowing and reduce sensitivity to education costs. The Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program has similar concerns about incentivizing excessive borrowing. The costs incurred by the federal government for loan forgiveness and repayment programs depend on the program structure. There are three categories of costs: loan subsidy costs, appropriated program costs, and administrative costs. Loan forgiveness programs are part of federal credit programs, including federal direct loans and loan guarantees. The federal credit includes federal direct loans and loan guarantees. The William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan program is a direct loan program, while the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program is a guaranteed loan program. Loan subsidy costs for these programs are funded through mandatory appropriations. The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 requires measuring the budgetary costs of loans based on their estimated long-term costs to the government. The loan subsidy cost is the estimated present value of cash flows from the government, less the cash flows to the government, resulting from a direct loan or loan guarantee. A positive cost means a cost to the government, while a negative cost means the government earns a return. Loan forgiveness benefits increase subsidy costs. Loan forgiveness benefits, such as Stafford Loan Forgiveness to Teachers and Public Service Loan Forgiveness, result in an increase in loan subsidy costs for government programs. Borrowers qualifying for forgiveness have a portion of their loan balance discharged by the government, leading to reduced cash flows to the government. The estimated cost of providing these benefits is accounted for in the loan subsidy costs for the fiscal year when the loan was made. Loan forgiveness programs like Public Service Loan Forgiveness and income-based repayment plans provide borrower benefits funded through annual appropriations. The costs are not included in subsidy rates of federal credit programs. Funding can be discretionary or mandatory, with benefits available based on appropriations and fund availability. Loan forgiveness programs, such as Public Service Loan Forgiveness and income-based repayment plans, are funded through discretionary or mandatory appropriations. Availability of funds may limit benefits for borrowers who meet eligibility criteria. Examples of funded programs include Government Employee Student Loan Repayment and National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment. Perkins Loan Cancellation benefits are unique, specified in loan terms, and granted by the loan institution to eligible borrowers. The Perkins Loan program is not a federal credit program and funding for loan cancellation benefits is authorized through discretionary appropriations. Despite no funding being appropriated since FY2009, qualified borrowers have had their loans canceled. Institutions have absorbed the costs of loan cancellation without reimbursement. The Department of Education maintains records of eligible reimbursement amounts for institutions. The costs of administering loan forgiveness and repayment programs are funded separately through discretionary or mandatory appropriations. Administrative costs for federal credit programs are accounted for separately and funded through annual appropriations. Loan repayment programs are administered by various agencies with different funding mechanisms for administrative costs. Limited information is available on the actual costs incurred. Limited information is available on the actual costs of federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs. Cost estimates for loan forgiveness programs are often based on projected future loan forgiveness amounts. Data on the amount of debt relief provided and the number of recipients for some programs are available. In Appendix A, data on debt relief and recipients for various loan forgiveness programs are detailed. For the Direct Loan Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, estimated costs totaled $1.5 billion over FY2008-FY2012, with $1.2 billion linked to pre-FY2008 loans. Estimates for borrower numbers were not provided. The Revised Pay-As-You-Earn (REPAYE) repayment plan is expected to make approximately 6 million borrowers eligible from 1994 to 2025. Approximately 6 million borrowers will be eligible for REPAYE from 1994 to 2025, with an estimated 2 million choosing to enroll, costing approximately $15.4 billion. For the PAYE plan, the government estimated a cost of $2.1 billion over FY2012-FY2021, with around 1.67 million borrowers opting for it. Approximately 400,000 borrowers are expected to receive loan forgiveness through public service loan forgiveness or after 20 years of repayment, with an average original loan balance of $39,500. The government estimated a cost of $2.1 billion for the PAYE plan over FY2012-FY2021, with around 1.67 million borrowers opting for it. Borrowers with an average original loan balance of $39,500 are expected to have an average of $41,000 in loans forgiven. Additionally, estimates were provided for the number of borrowers who would repay their loans according to the IBR plan for both pre-July 1, 2014, and post-July 1, 2014 cohorts. The government estimated a cost of $2.1 billion for the PAYE plan over FY2012-FY2021, with around 1.67 million borrowers opting for it. Approximately 52,000 borrowers are expected to have some debt forgiven after 25 years. Congress may need to review existing policies on federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs to determine if changes are necessary. Issues such as the availability of multiple forgiveness programs for similar activities and potential financial windfalls for borrowers should be examined. Existing federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs may lead to financial windfalls for borrowers engaging in the same activities they would have done anyway. It is important to assess if these programs are effectively achieving their intended purposes and if there is overlap between multiple programs with similar goals and activities. This overlap could result in the same borrower receiving benefits from different programs or the government spending unnecessary money on administrative costs. Individuals may qualify for benefits under multiple programs, highlighting the need for a review of existing policies. Some federal programs allow recipients to qualify for benefits from multiple sources for the same service performed, potentially leading to financial windfalls. For example, an individual working in a federal agency could receive loan repayment benefits under the GESLRP and student loan forgiveness under the PSLF concurrently. The federal government offers multiple programs that can overlap, leading to potential financial windfalls for recipients. For instance, individuals may receive benefits from both the GESLRP and PSLF for the same service. Additionally, programs like NELRP and NFLRP aim to increase qualified nursing faculty and may serve the same group of individuals. Under the NFLRP, nursing schools establish loan repayment programs funded by HRSA. This may create an administrative burden as both NELRP and NFLRP target the same group for the same purpose. Congress may need to consider combining, altering, or abolishing programs to avoid double benefits. Loan forgiveness programs aim to incentivize individuals to enter specific jobs or public service. Loan forgiveness programs aim to incentivize individuals to enter specific jobs or public service. Some concerns have been raised about the effectiveness of these programs, as they may provide windfalls for individuals who would have entered the field regardless of benefit availability. Notably, certain loan forgiveness plans have no limits on the amounts that may be forgiven, raising questions about the large amounts individuals may borrow. Some individuals may borrow larger amounts under loan forgiveness programs, potentially leading to concerns about limits on forgiveness amounts. Research suggests that loan forgiveness may not influence individuals' career decisions if they are already seeking employment in certain fields. Loan forgiveness programs may be ineffective if their goal is to attract skilled employees to specific occupations. Loan repayment programs may influence individuals' decisions to stay in a job or career. Congress could improve program effectiveness by implementing more specific funding controls. Insufficient data are available to assess the effectiveness of federal loan forgiveness and repayment programs in achieving their objectives. The effectiveness of federal loan forgiveness and repayment programs in achieving program objectives is difficult to assess due to limited available data. For example, in the PSLF program, little is known about forgiveness benefits received as borrowers must remain employed in a public service job for 10 years before becoming eligible for forgiveness benefits. Limited or no programmatic data are available for many programs, making it challenging to project future participation. The Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program allows borrowers to receive loan forgiveness after working in public service jobs for 10 years. Limited data is available for assessing the effectiveness of loan forgiveness programs, including PSLF. Borrowers may qualify for forgiveness through income-driven repayment plans, but data collection on participants is often limited to program administration needs. Improved data collection and reporting are essential for assessing program effects and determining if program design changes could enhance effectiveness. There is variation in the types and amounts of student loan debt that qualify for debt relief across different programs. Some programs have specific limitations on loan types and amounts eligible for forgiveness, while others offer relief for multiple loan types with fewer restrictions on maximum amounts. Consideration may be given to imposing limitations on the types and amounts of student loan debt that qualify for forgiveness and repayment programs. Concerns have been raised about the availability of programs incentivizing students to over-borrow. Should individuals be allowed to borrow non-need-based federal student loans for expenses covered by their expected family contribution (EFC)? Consideration may be given to imposing limitations on the types and amounts of student loan debt that qualify for forgiveness and repayment programs. Selection criteria for agencies administering student loan repayment programs can vary greatly, with 34 federal agencies providing employees with loan repayment benefits in CY 2016 under the GESLRP. Participants must sign a service agreement to serve in the paying agency for at least three years. Participants in the GESLRP must sign a service agreement to serve in the paying agency for at least three years and reimburse any benefits if they do not complete their service. They cannot be employees in the excepted service, but agencies can determine benefit recipients. Different agencies have varying eligibility requirements, making it challenging for participants to discern. The GESLRP program has eligibility requirements that are difficult for participants to understand. It may only attract individuals to work in a limited number of agencies. Program-specific details are provided in an appendix, with information varying in scope and level of detail for each program. The curr_chunk provides information on program details such as repayment requirements, maximum benefits, eligibility restrictions, post-benefit requirements, tax treatment, budget classification, appropriations, loan discharges, beneficiaries, and data sources. The information is sourced from authoritative sources and is relevant for analysis. For complete details on specific programs, legal citations are recommended. The curr_chunk provides details on various loan forgiveness programs for public service employment, categorized by different criteria such as income-driven repayment and federal government employment. Abbreviations like FFEL and PHSA are used throughout the appendix. Legal citations are recommended for specific program details. The loan forgiveness programs in this section offer debt relief to qualified borrowers in specific occupations or public service. These benefits are entitlements for federal student loans and potentially available to many borrowers. The Direct Loan Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program aims to forgive student loan balances for borrowers who have made 120 full, scheduled payments after October 1, 2007. The Direct Loan Public Service Loan Forgiveness program forgives loans for borrowers who have made 120 full monthly payments on eligible loans while working full-time in public service. Eligible loan types include Subsidized Loans, Unsubsidized Loans, Graduate PLUS Loans, and Consolidation Loans. Qualifying service includes employment in public service organizations, AmeriCorps, or the Peace Corps. Public service organizations include government agencies, tribal colleges, nonprofit organizations, and certain private nonprofits. The Public Service Loan Forgiveness program forgives loans for borrowers who have made 120 full monthly payments on eligible loans while working full-time in public service. Eligible public service organizations include government agencies, nonprofit organizations, and certain private nonprofits. Borrowers must make 120 separate, full, on-time, scheduled monthly payments within 15 days of the due date. Each payment must be made according to specific repayment plans. The maximum amount that may be forgiven is any loan balance remaining after 120 qualifying monthly payments. The Public Service Loan Forgiveness program requires borrowers to make 120 full monthly payments while working in public service. Borrowers must be employed full-time in public service at the time of required payments, application for forgiveness, and forgiveness grant. Loans must not be in default, and religious activities do not count as public service. Loan forgiveness amount is tax-exempt and falls under mandatory budgetary classification. Loan forgiveness amounts are included in student loan subsidy costs. Borrowers first eligible in October 2017. No amounts discharged or repaid. Annual beneficiaries unknown. Resources include CRS reports and Department of Education website. Stafford Loan Forgiveness for Teachers governed by HEA statutes and CFR regulations. The program encourages individuals to enter and continue in the teaching profession by offering loan repayment benefits for full-time teachers serving in designated schools or education service agencies. Loan types eligible for repayment include Subsidized Loans, Unsubsidized Loans, and Consolidation Loans used to repay Subsidized or Unsubsidized Loans. Qualifying service requires at least five consecutive complete academic years, with specific requirements for school years after 1997-1998 or 2007-2008. The program offers loan repayment benefits for full-time teachers serving in designated schools or education service agencies. Borrowers must be \"highly qualified teachers\" as defined under the ESEA for the full five years of service. Maximum benefit amounts range from $5,000 to $17,500. Forbearance may be granted during the service period. Repayment benefits are available to borrowers with no outstanding balance on federal student loans obtained before the end of the five-year teaching service.
