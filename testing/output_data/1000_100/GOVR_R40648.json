    "content": "Several tax options have been proposed to finance health care reform, including restricting itemized deductions for high-income taxpayers, modifying the tax exclusion for employer-provided health care, increasing taxes on alcoholic beverages, and imposing an excise tax on non-diet sweetened beverages. The House Ways and Means Committee has suggested financing the reform through a surtax on high-income individuals, which was passed by the House on November 14, 2009. The House passed H.R. 3962 on November 14, 2009, which was based on H.R. 3200. The Senate passed H.R. 3590 on December 24, 2009, with revenue-raising provisions similar to S. 1796. President Obama proposed changes to H.R. 3590, including delaying the tax on high-cost employer plans to 2018 and raising the exemption threshold. The new plan also broadens the proposed increase of the Medicare HI tax for high-income individuals. The House passed H.R. 3590, which proposed increasing the Medicare HI tax for high-income households and adding a 3.8% tax on unearned income. The President signed H.R. 3590 on March 23, along with H.R. 4872 on March 30. The tax proposals varied in their effects on behavior and income distribution. The tax proposals in H.R. 3590 and H.R. 4872 varied in their effects on behavior and income distribution. The distributional analysis in the report shows that tax changes can be progressive for high-income taxpayers and regressive for lower-income taxpayers. Excise taxes tend to fall more heavily on lower-income classes. The revenue raisers proposed in the House and Senate bills, along with President Obama's proposals, are reviewed in this report. The main revenue raiser in the final legislation is the increased Medicare tax, accounting for 48% of revenue over FY2010-FY2019. Other significant revenue raisers include a fee on health insurance providers, a \"Cadillac\" tax on high-value employer health insurance plans, and a fee on branded drugs. The largest revenue raiser in the final legislation is the increased Medicare tax, accounting for 48% of revenue over FY2010-FY2019. Other significant provisions include fees on health insurance providers, a \"Cadillac\" tax on high-value employer health insurance plans, and a fee on branded drugs. Additional provisions account for about 90% of revenues, with shares changing over time due to delays and expirations. In 2019, the Medicare tax is 44% of the total, while the Cadillac tax is 22%. The House Ways and Means Committee announced revenue- and tax-related provisions to fund health care reform, including a tax on high-income individuals. Legislation like H.R. 3200 and H.R. 3962 included modifications to proposals and new revenue raisers. H.R. 3962, passed in November 2009, involved revisions to the surtax on high-income taxpayers and additional revenue raisers. The initial proposal in H.R. 3200 aimed to fund health care reform by generating $583.1 billion for FY2010-FY2014, with $543.9 billion coming from a surtax on individual taxpayers. The surtax would be based on adjusted gross income, with rates ranging from 1% to 5.4% for different income levels. There was also a provision to raise $8 billion by aligning the definition of medical expenses for health savings accounts with itemized deductions for health. The proposal in H.R. 3962 included revenue raisers related to international taxation and tax evasion, such as a delay in the revised allocation of interest for the foreign tax credit, a provision to address tax sheltering by corporations, and an expansion of the definition of dependents for certain health-related tax purposes. These measures were estimated to raise billions of dollars, with the most recent addition being a 5.4% surtax on incomes over $1 million for joint filers. H.R. 3962 imposed a 5.4% surtax on incomes over $1 million for joint filers and half that amount for single taxpayers, raising $460.5 billion over FY2010-FY2014. It also included revenue raisers related to international taxation and tax evasion, projected to raise billions of dollars. Additionally, the bill had restrictions on health-related tax provisions. H.R. 3962 includes restrictions on health-related tax provisions such as limiting health flexible spending arrangements, increasing penalties for nonqualified distributions from health savings accounts, disallowing deductions for subsidies related to Medicare Part D, imposing an excise tax on medical devices, and requiring information reporting on payments to corporations. The Senate Finance Committee proposal includes health benefits for spouses and dependents, fees on insured and self-insured health plans, and a provision to exclude Indian Tribe health benefits from gross income. The proposal also includes a tax on the sale of medical devices and other provisions. The original surtax on high-income individuals would target the top 1.2% of taxpayers. The surtax proposal in H.R. 3962 would affect 0.3% of taxpayers, with concerns raised about its impact on small businesses and entrepreneurship. Only about 4% of businesses would be affected initially, with 1.2% of unincorporated businesses paying the revised surtax. Higher-income individuals would be more affected due to their larger share of income. The concentration of income at higher levels is evident, with individuals earning over $1 million accounting for 15.1% of adjusted gross income but only 0.2% of returns. Business income is more concentrated in higher-income levels. Labor income makes up three-quarters of overall income, while passive capital income, pensions, and business income account for the rest. In the top 1%, labor income is less than half of total income. Individuals with incomes over $1 million contribute to 33% of unincorporated business net income, and those with incomes over $500,000 contribute to 39%. Individuals with incomes over $500,000 account for 39% of total income, primarily from partnership and Subchapter S firms. Returns with income over $1 million contribute 7.5% of total proprietorship income. For partnerships and Subchapter S firms, those with income over $1 million account for 49% of net income. Taxpayers at the top tax rate are responsible for 61% of business flow-through income. Some income in partnerships and proprietorships may come from passive income and tax shelters. According to IRS data, almost 85% of partnership income is in limited liability companies or limited partnerships, with high-income taxpayers only accounting for 46% of active positive business income. The Tax Policy Center found that only 22.8% of returns affected by the surtax had business income that was more than half of total income, suggesting that much of this income is passive investment income. The majority of partnership income comes from finance, real estate, oil and gas extraction, and services like doctors and lawyers. About 8% of income is from real estate and oil and gas, 19% from finance and insurance, with most of that from securities and investment firms. 15% is from professional services, mainly legal services, and 5% from health services, including physicians and dentists. This data suggests that a significant portion of small business income is from passive investments and professions like stockbrokers, lawyers, and doctors. Small business income is associated with passive investments, stockbrokers, lawyers, doctors, and accountants who are unlikely to be innovators or important sources of job creation for lower and moderate income individuals. Very little of the increased tax revenue is likely to be collected from these businesses. Small businesses create more jobs but also are the greatest sources of job loss. The evidence on job creation is not entirely clear due to migration across size classifications. This sector of the economy may offer more opportunities to women and minorities but pays less, is less stable, and has fewer fringe benefits. There is no need for a permanent policy to create jobs. There is no need for a permanent policy to create jobs. The economy creates its own jobs over time. Excluding certain types of business income from a surcharge could address objections from small businesses. Excluding flow through income from the top 1% would sacrifice revenue, but excluding passive income and income from certain sectors could minimize the loss. Other revenue-raising provisions have smaller effects. The initial bill includes provisions to raise revenue, such as disallowing spending on over-the-counter medications in flexible spending plans. Other minor provisions relate to health-related tax expenditures and corporation taxes. The Senate Finance Committee proposal includes provisions on corporation taxes and the tax gap as revenue offsets. A brief discussion on the excise tax on medical devices is provided, with both House and Senate bills containing a tax on medical devices, albeit in different forms. The House bill imposes a 2.5% tax on manufacturers and importers, while the Senate proposal includes a fixed fee and other fees. The Senate Finance Committee proposal includes provisions on corporation taxes and the tax gap as revenue offsets. The excise tax on medical devices will be partially covered by insurers, leading to higher insurance payments for consumers. Producers of unique devices under patent may absorb some costs, but the tax could discourage investment in new devices. The interest allocation proposal would repeal a provision allowing worldwide interest allocation for the foreign tax credit. The 2004 provision allows for foreign tax credits to be increased by allocating more income abroad, reducing U.S. tax liability. It also includes interest on foreign borrowing in the calculation, which can increase the foreign tax credit limit. Another provision aims to reduce \"treaty-shopping\" by imposing withholding taxes on certain payments to foreigners. The curr_chunk discusses provisions related to withholding taxes, treaty benefits, and the economic substance doctrine in tax arrangements. It aims to eliminate benefits for firms setting up subsidiaries in treaty countries to avoid withholding tax and proposes legislative standards for the economic substance doctrine. The curr_chunk discusses the stricter tests for transactions to meet tax objectives, penalties imposed, and the provision in H.R. 3962 for information reporting on payments to corporations to aid in tax enforcement. Tax attorneys are concerned about specific rules providing a roadmap for tax avoidance. The provision in H.R. 3962 aims to increase compliance for smaller corporations by changing information reporting requirements, excluding certain fuels from biofuels producer credits. This may simplify reporting but also add to compliance burdens for businesses. The original black liquor credit and alcohol fuel mixture credit expired in 2009. The black liquor provision was seen as unintended for reducing fossil fuel use in the paper industry. Firms must report payments over $600 to unincorporated businesses. The reporting requirements for payments over $600 aim to increase third-party reporting to address missing income from businesses. Compliance rates for other types of income are higher. The proposal includes expanding reporting for services to corporations, a long-standing suggestion from both political parties. The expansion of reporting requirements for payments over $600 aims to increase compliance, especially for small firms. This includes reporting on goods as well as services, simplifying compliance for businesses. This change is expected to increase the number of firms filing these forms and improve enforcement and income reporting compliance for smaller businesses. The proposed expansion of reporting requirements for payments over $600 aims to simplify compliance for businesses, but has faced criticism for increasing costs and administrative burdens. Suggestions to scale back the proposal include raising the minimum reporting requirement or only requiring additional information to be reported to the IRS, not the payee. The Senate Finance Committee reported S. 1796, America's Healthy Future Act of 2009, which is expected to generate $381 billion in revenues over the 2010-2019 period. The Senate Finance Committee reported S. 1796, America's Healthy Future Act of 2009, which is expected to generate $381 billion in revenues over the 2010-2019 period. The largest provision includes a 40% excise tax on health coverage exceeding $8,000 for singles and $21,000 for families, raising $201.4 billion. H.R. 3590, passed by the Senate, raises $398.1 billion with a scaled-back provision imposing a 40% excise tax on health coverage exceeding $8,500 for singles and $23,000 for families. Additional revenue raisers include an increase in the payroll tax for high-income earnings and a 10% excise tax on indoor tanning facilities. The Senate Finance Committee reported a bill that includes a temporary fee on insured and self-insured plans, liberalized the adoption credit, and excluded assistance for state student loan repayment programs for health professionals. Other provisions include conforming medical expenses for health savings accounts, limiting health flexible spending arrangements, increasing penalties for nonqualified distributions from health savings accounts, and disallowing deductions for Medicare Part D subsidies. The Senate Finance Committee's bill includes provisions such as raising the floor for itemized deductions for medical costs, limiting deductions for certain individuals in the health insurance industry, imposing fees on medical device manufacturers and health insurance providers, and implementing taxes on branded drugs and indoor tanning facilities. The Senate Finance Committee's bill includes various revenue-raising provisions such as fees on health plans and an additional HI payroll tax on high wages. It also includes provisions for community benefits, employer reporting, and a safe harbor for small employers. Additionally, there are some cost-incurring provisions like a therapeutic discovery project credit and an adoption tax credit refundable provision. The Senate Finance Committee's bill includes revenue-raising provisions like fees on health plans and an additional HI payroll tax on high wages. It also has cost-incurring provisions such as a therapeutic discovery project credit and an adoption tax credit refundable provision, with details on excise taxes and fees related to health insurance coverage and medical devices. The provision in the Senate Finance Committee's bill would increase premiums or reduce benefits for certain plans, leading to higher tax liability. It is estimated to generate $148.9 billion in revenue over 10 years, with thresholds for plan coverage increasing annually. Thresholds would be higher initially for plans in high-cost states and for individuals over 55 or in risky professions. The Senate Finance Committee's provision aims to limit tax liability for high-cost health insurance plans in industries like mining, agriculture, forestry, and fishery. Thresholds for plan coverage would be $9,850 for single plans and $26,000 for family plans. A study shows that 90% of plans would be unaffected, with the excise tax approach meant to curb rising healthcare costs. The tax approach aims to discourage rising healthcare costs by implementing an excise tax on high-cost health insurance plans. This tax would be collected at the insurance-company level or could result in reduced health insurance plan costs and increased wages. There are concerns about fairness, especially for lower-income employees, and questions about how self-insured firms would be treated. The excise tax's revenues are generally reduced by about 25% to account for interactions, and there may still be a net tax advantage for these benefits if the tax is deductible. H.R. 3590 proposes increasing the HI payroll tax by 0.9% for earnings over $200,000 for individuals and $250,000 for joint returns, raising $86.8 billion in revenue. The tax would be collected by employers on compensation exceeding $200,000, with employees responsible for any discrepancies. This provision targets high-income taxpayers and is progressive, but does not apply to capital income. Health insurance provider fees generate $59.6 billion in revenue, with all fees and excise taxes totaling $106.3 billion. The fees on branded drugs and medical devices, along with revenue raisers, account for $106.3 billion from FY2010 through FY2019. The fees increase over time for health insurance providers and medical devices. The fees on insured and self-insured plans are smaller and designed to finance the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust fund. The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust fund is financed through fees on branded drugs and medical devices, which could impact prices and profits. The fees aim to capture increased demand from expanded health insurance coverage. Certain devices under $100 are exempt from the medical device fee, and both the medical device and branded drug fees have a sliding scale. The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust fund is financed through fees on branded drugs and medical devices, with exemptions for certain devices under $100. The fees have a sliding scale to reduce the impact on small producers, with specific apportionment rules for each category such as drugs, insurance, and third-party administrators. The fees are not deductible and are imposed as a fixed amount with apportionment to create a tax at the margin. The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust fund is funded through fees on branded drugs and medical devices, with exemptions for certain devices under $100. The fees are imposed as a fixed amount with apportionment to create a tax at the margin. H.R. 3590 also includes a 10% excise tax on indoor tanning facilities, expected to raise $2.7 billion over 10 years. A provision for taxing cosmetic producers was discussed but not included in the final bill. The tax on hospitals is deductible by the provider, as it is imposed on the customer. Charitable hospitals receive benefits such as tax exemptions and bond financing, based on meeting a \"community benefit\" standard. Concerns arise regarding the level of charity care provided by nonprofit hospitals compared to for-profit hospitals. Studies have shown that nonprofit hospitals only slightly exceed for-profit hospitals in charity care. The federal tax exemptions for nonprofit hospitals are estimated to be around $6 billion. The benefits of federal tax exemptions for nonprofit hospitals were estimated at $6 billion in 2002. Hearings were held by the Senate Finance Committee in 2006 and the House Ways and Means Committee in 2005 on the topic of charitable care and community benefits at nonprofit hospitals. Concerns raised by Senator Grassley in a staff discussion draft included charity care, community benefits, governance, and billing practices. In 2007, the IRS released an interim report on nonprofit hospitals. The IRS released an interim report in July 2007 on nonprofit hospitals' charity care spending, highlighting that the median share of revenues spent on charity care was 3.9%. Nonprofit hospitals have not been required to demonstrate specific charity standards since a 1969 revenue ruling, leading to concerns about the lack of quantitatively defined community benefit standards. A proposal to codify rules for charitable status includes a community needs standard and a minimum level of charitable patient care. This provision may not significantly impact revenues but could increase charity care levels. Flexible spending accounts (FSAs) allow reductions in taxable income to fund program benefits chosen under a cafeteria plan. Concerns include the \"use it or lose it\" nature of the plan, with amounts forfeited at year-end, leading to excessive spending. Options for raising revenue include limits on contributions or their elimination. The House and Senate bills limit arrangements for unspent amounts to $2,500, indexed by CPI after 2011. Over-the-counter medication is not deductible for expenses exceeding 7.5% of income but is covered by health savings accounts. This provision aligns eligible spending for employer accounts with itemized deductions. Taxpayers can deduct medical expenses above 7.5% of income, costing $10.7 billion annually. The medical expense deduction allows taxpayers with large medical costs relative to income to deduct expenses above 7.5% of income, benefiting middle-class taxpayers more than other deductions. It is claimed by about 12 million taxpayers, with only 4% claimed by those with incomes over $200,000. The Senate bill increases the floor for medical expense deductions to 10%, remaining at 7.5% for individuals aged 65 and older. Blue Cross and Blue Shield, along with other tax-exempt companies from 1986, are eligible for a special deduction of 25% of claims and expenses exceeding surplus. They are also exempt from a rule approximating the taxation of unearned premiums, resulting in a revenue loss of about $1 billion annually. In 1986, tax exemptions for Blue Cross and Blue Shield were removed due to their activities being similar to commercial insurance. Special benefits were provided as a substitute, benefiting shareholders and other groups. A proposal in the Senate bill aims to disallow tax benefits for firms with premiums exceeding 85% of claims. The Obama Administration released a compromise proposal in 2010, modifying revenue provisions of the bill, including a tax on high-cost health insurance plans. The Obama Administration's proposal modifies the tax on high-cost health insurance plans from the Senate-passed H.R. 3590, delaying the effective date to 2018. The exemption amount is raised to $27,500 for families and $10,200 for individuals. To offset the revenue loss, the proposal broadens the Medicare HI tax for high-income taxpayers, including a 0.9% increase on the HI tax rate for married couples earning over $250,000 and individuals earning over $200,000. Additionally, a 2.9% assessment on unearned income is proposed for high-income earners. The President's compromise proposal includes revenue provisions from H.R. 3962, clarifying tax credits for certain byproducts and codifying the economic substance doctrine. The tax on high-cost insurance is reduced, while the Medicare tax on high-income taxpayers' investment income is increased. The House passed H.R. 3590, and the President is expected to sign the bill on March 23. The House passed H.R. 3590, and the President is expected to sign the bill on March 23. H.R. 4872 was also passed by the House, and the Senate is currently reviewing it. Health insurance benefits paid by firms for employees are excluded from taxes, including group insurance, self-insurance, and cafeteria plan options. Deductible contributions can be made through health savings accounts and flexible spending accounts. There have been discussions about capping the exclusion for employer-supplied health insurance. The Finance Committee is considering options to cap the employer exclusion for health insurance benefits, which is the largest health-related income tax benefit. The exclusion is estimated to have cost $132.7 billion in 2008 and causes additional tax revenue losses of $93.5 billion from payroll taxes. The Urban Brookings Tax Policy Center estimated these amounts to have grown at an average of about 8% per year. The Finance Committee is considering capping health insurance benefits to recover lost tax revenue. The cap would offset some revenue, estimated at $14 billion in 2010 and increasing. The revenue from a cap depends on indexing and could raise $18.2 billion if not indexed. A cap on health insurance benefits could raise significant revenue, with estimates ranging from $4.9 billion to $226.5 billion in 2019, depending on indexing. It is crucial to index caps to health price inflation to ensure a steady revenue stream. The employer exclusion for health insurance benefits has been criticized for favoring high-income employees and incentivizing the purchase of excessive insurance, leading to increased healthcare costs. Higher-income individuals benefit more from this exclusion due to their higher marginal tax rates. The payroll-tax exclusion, on the other hand, is not as targeted towards higher-income families. The payroll-tax exclusion is not as targeted towards higher-income families as the employer exclusion for health insurance benefits. Payroll taxes are flat rate taxes, with the Social Security portion subject to an income cap. The excluded income from health insurance benefits does not rise with an individual's income due to group plans providing the same coverage for everyone. This suggests that the tax benefit may not increase as a percentage of income, making the burden from repealing the tax benefit not necessarily progressive. The tax effects as a percentage of income are highest in absolute value in the middle income brackets, indicating a proportional tax benefit from the current exclusion. The tax benefit from the current exclusion is proportional to income across middle income brackets, with smaller burdens on lower- and higher-income taxpayers. Repealing the exclusion would result in an average tax increase of $1,578, but this amount would be $3,336 if averaged over covered employees. The exclusion reduces adverse selection in the health care market. The exclusion reduces adverse selection in the health care market by driving up costs for less healthy individuals. Employer health insurance covers 62% of the non-elderly population, and concerns exist about altering tax subsidies affecting employer participation. Imposing a cap on the exclusion could address the issue of purchasing more insurance than necessary without significantly impacting coverage. However, challenges include determining includable income for tax purposes, which may lead to inequities and administrative burdens. Imposing a cap on the health insurance exclusion could address the issue of purchasing more insurance than necessary, but challenges include determining includable income for tax purposes, leading to inequities and administrative burdens. Individual costs vary by geographic location, number of individuals covered, age, sex, health status, benefits generosity, and provider network, with employer plans involving implicit cost shifting. Premiums for firms purchasing insurance and claims for firms self-insuring are affected by group characteristics, leading to subsidy disparities among different groups. The health status inconsistency with insurance risk sharing objectives varies by family size, age, and location. Proposals consider variations in family coverage but not necessarily by age. Imputing income based on age may lead to inequities and burden younger individuals. Age-based imputations could shift costs towards higher incomes due to older individuals earning more. Imputing income based on age for health insurance may lead to inequities across employees, especially for firms with older workers or other characteristics. Adjustments for factors like gender, age, and workforce health could add to administrative burden. Suggestions include setting rules similar to COBRA benefits for governing the allocation of benefits included in income. The Senate Finance Committee options document suggests reformulating the exclusion as a deduction, credit, or a combination of both to equalize treatment across taxpayers. An alternative approach could be to restrict deductions for employers, reducing or eliminating deductions for insurance costs above a certain threshold to raise revenues and discourage overly generous health insurance packages. The Senate Finance Committee's report listed various health-related income tax expenditures, including the exclusion of Medicare benefits from income for tax purposes, which amounts to $40.6 billion. The report also mentioned the exclusion of medical benefits for military dependents and retirees, totaling $3.3 billion. Additionally, the report highlighted the benefits of health savings accounts (HSAs) for individuals with high-deductible employer health plans, allowing tax-deductible contributions and exclusions from both income and payroll tax for employer contributions. Health savings accounts (HSAs) offer tax advantages such as exclusions for employer contributions, tax-free investment earnings, and tax-free withdrawals for medical expenses. Contributions are capped, costing around $0.5 billion annually. HSAs encourage individuals to purchase insurance for catastrophic costs while reducing unnecessary healthcare spending. However, they can lead to adverse selection by attracting healthier individuals. The Finance Committee is considering limits on individual contributions and increased penalties. The Senate Finance Committee is considering proposals to change HSA regulations, including requiring substantiation for medical cost spending, imposing an employer cap on contributions, and clarifying FICA tax exceptions for students, particularly medical residents. The Senate Finance Committee proposal aims to extend Medicare coverage and associated taxes to all state and local employees, with exceptions for certain employees. This provision would increase health insurance payroll taxes that finance Medicare, leading to increased Medicare costs. Additionally, the proposal discusses excise tax provisions on alcoholic and sugared beverages, as well as potential increases in tobacco taxes. Alcoholic beverage taxes vary by type, with distilled spirits taxed at $13.50 per proof gallon, beer at $18 per barrel, and wine at $1.07 per gallon for table wine. The tax rates are based on alcohol content and have not been revised since 1991. The alcohol tax rates have not been revised since 1991, with the distilled spirits tax rate at $13.50 per gallon. Studies show that the external costs of alcohol are higher than current taxes, and consumption is somewhat responsive to price changes. Alcohol taxes, like tobacco taxes, are regressive, impacting low-income individuals more. The distributional data from a 1990 Congressional Budget Office study shows the relative burden of alcohol taxes as a percentage of income is more concentrated in lower income classes due to the higher prices of alcohol purchased by higher income classes. This could result in a significantly greater regressivity of the tax than suggested by expenditure data. For example, if the average price of distilled spirits is twice as much for the top quintile than the bottom one, the burden relative to income would be 333% larger rather than 116%. The unit tax nature of excise taxes makes them more regressive than sales taxes. Alcohol taxes may not be as regressive as tobacco taxes due to higher income groups purchasing more alcohol. The proposal suggests equalizing taxes on beer, wine, and distilled spirits, with potential increases in tax rates. Current federal alcohol taxes collect $9.4 billion in revenues. The proposal suggests equalizing taxes on beer, wine, and distilled spirits, with potential increases in tax rates. The tax increases would raise about $5.7 billion in revenue per year, with an offsetting reduction in income tax revenues. Price elasticity estimates suggest that consumption is not highly responsive to price changes. The elasticity estimates for alcohol consumption show that beer has an elasticity of 0.16, wine 0.58, and spirits 0.39. Overall elasticity for a proportional price change is 0.52. Current alcohol sales are $187.6 billion. Proposed tax increases would lead to a slight decrease in consumption for beer, wine, and spirits. Older elasticity estimates were higher. The proposal suggests imposing a tax on non-diet sweetened beverages, with estimates indicating it could raise significant revenue. Unlike alcohol and tobacco, the impact of these beverages on health and society costs has not been extensively studied. The tax may be regressive and some question why this specific food source is being targeted when other unhealthy items could also be taxed. Individual taxpayers have the option to take a standard deduction or itemize deductions, which include certain state and local taxes and home mortgage expenses. President Obama's tax proposals include capping the value of itemized deductions for the top two tax rates to 28%. The largest share of itemized deductions are for mortgage interest (36%) and taxes (35%), with income taxes and property taxes on owner-occupied homes making up the majority. Charitable deductions account for about 15% of the total. When the 2001 tax cuts expire, top tax rates will rise to 36% and 39.5%, affecting high-income taxpayers. The proposal aims to raise revenues by about $25 billion, primarily impacting those with incomes over $250,000. Itemized deductions, which benefit about one-third of taxpayers, would be capped at 28% for the top two tax rates. The $500,000-and-above class accounts for a small percentage of mortgage interest and property tax deductions but a significant portion of charitable contributions deductions. Studies suggest a modest 1% reduction in charitable giving due to the proposed limit on tax benefits. Charitable objectives favored by higher-income individuals, such as health, art, and education, would have larger effects on charitable giving. Excluding these deductions from the cap could sacrifice about one-quarter of the expected revenue gain. Other proposals include limiting all itemized deductions to 15% to raise $141 billion in 2011. President Obama also suggests base-broadening provisions to finance health care reform through increased compliance and administrative measures. The tax provisions aim to increase compliance and revenue gain, with the first set resulting in about $1 billion when fully implemented. The second set includes revisions affecting financial institutions, tax accounting methods, and estate tax, raising around $5 billion to $6 billion annually. Key provisions include restrictions on valuation discounts for family-owned assets, modification of corporate-owned life insurance, and repeal of a certain inventory valuation method. The tax provisions aim to increase compliance and revenue gain, with potential measures such as rate increases, widening rate brackets, and adjusting the indexing of rate brackets to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) minus 1%. These changes could generate additional revenues, with one proposal estimated to raise $8 billion in 2010 and $50 billion in 2019, growing over time. Shea suggested increasing the capital gains tax, taxing carried interest as ordinary income, reforming international tax enforcement, and repealing LIFO inventories. Revenue estimates from the Treasury's \"Greenbook\" show that these measures could raise significant funds, with international reforms alone raising over $20 billion. Increases in payroll taxes are also considered as a potential source of revenue. One option for raising revenue is to increase payroll taxes, either by raising rates or the earnings ceiling. Eliminating the Social Security earnings cap could also generate significant revenue. Another proposal is to implement a 10% value added tax (VAT), which could raise $600 billion. Additionally, a carbon tax or revenue from a cap and trade system could be considered. However, implementing a new tax like VAT may come with administrative compliance challenges and costs. Implementing a carbon tax or cap and trade system may be challenging due to administrative costs and compliance issues. These taxes could also pose problems with transition and other program issues. Additionally, they may be regressive in nature. Table A-1 compares revenue provisions in H.R. 3962 and H.R. 3590 with those enacted in P.L. 111-148 and P.L. 111-152."
