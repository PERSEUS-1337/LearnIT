    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Cavernous Angioma CARE Center Act of 2010\". Congress finds that cavernous angioma, also known as cerebral cavernous malformations or CCM, affects approximately 1,500,000 individuals in the United States. It is a serious blood vessel disease characterized by vascular lesions in the brain and spinal cord. Detection of these lesions requires specialized medical imaging techniques. Many individuals may not be aware they have the disease until they experience severe symptoms such as neurological deficits, seizures, stroke, or sudden death. Limited research exists on cavernous angioma. Due to limited research, cavernous angioma has no specific treatment regimen other than brain and spinal surgery. Some individuals may not be eligible for surgery, leaving them with no treatment options. New Mexico has the highest population density of cavernous angioma due to a specific disease-causing mutation passed down through generations. A shortage of knowledgeable physicians may make it difficult for affected individuals to receive timely diagnosis and care. Senate Resolution 148, 111th Congress, adopted unanimously on May 13, 2009, highlights the critical need to increase research, awareness, and education about cerebral cavernous malformations. The National Institutes of Health supports biomedical research through extramural centers of excellence to better understand complex biomedical systems. To address the public health threat of cavernous angioma, a specialized center is needed at the University of New Mexico to provide care, research, and education for individuals nationwide. A specialized Cavernous Angioma Care Center is established at the University of New Mexico under SEC. 409K of the Public Health Service Act to provide care, research, and education for individuals nationwide. The Director of NIH establishes a Cavernous Angioma CARE Center of Excellence at the University of New Mexico to conduct research, provide care, and serve as a model for medical schools and research institutions. The center will consist of researchers, clinicians, and medical staff, including a medical director with expertise in cavernous angioma research and clinical care. The Cavernous Angioma CARE Center of Excellence at the University of New Mexico will include specialists such as a headache or pain specialist, epilepsy specialist, psychiatrist, neuropsychologist, dermatologist, nurse practitioner, nurse coordinator, research coordinator, clinical nurse, radiology specialist, vascular fellow, basic science postdoctoral fellow, and genetic counselor. The Cavernous Angioma CARE Center of Excellence at the University of New Mexico requires a genetic counselor affiliated with a university medical center with an accredited medical school. They must maintain a program for postdoctoral fellows in cavernous angioma research, recruit new researchers and clinicians, provide continuing medical education for clinicians, and have programs for patient advocacy and education. The Cavernous Angioma CARE Center of Excellence at the University of New Mexico focuses on patient outreach, education, and awareness through various initiatives such as launching public awareness campaigns, creating patient education materials, organizing educational conferences, and developing electronic health tools. They also aim to establish communication with other major cavernous angioma research centers. The CARE Center aims to facilitate translational projects, collaborations for clinical trials, and establish an advisory board composed of individuals with expertise in cavernous angioma and relevant biomedical disciplines. The CARE Center, affiliated with CARE Center, is led by a Director with expertise in cavernous angioma patient care and research. The Director's duties include promoting understanding and treatment of cavernous angioma, providing high-quality care, encouraging participation in research studies, and developing the center as a model. The CARE Center, affiliated with CARE Center, is led by a Director with expertise in cavernous angioma patient care and research. The center aims to serve as a model and training facility for other facilities in the United States engaged in research and care for individuals with cavernous angioma. Reporting requirements include submitting biannual reports on activities, progress, and expenditures to the Secretary.
