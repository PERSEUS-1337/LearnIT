    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Pulmonary Hypertension Research Act of 2003\". The Congress finds that Federal investment in pulmonary hypertension research must be expanded to find a cure or treatment. Primary pulmonary hypertension is a rare, chronic, and incurable lung disorder with a poor survival rate. Approximately 300 new cases are diagnosed in the US each year, with the majority occurring in women aged 21 to 40. Primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH) can affect men and women of all ages and ethnicities. It is challenging to study due to its low prevalence and lack of a good animal model. In some cases, PPH is familial. In advanced stages, patients have limited activity and may become bedridden. PPH is often not detected in routine medical exams. In 1981, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute established the first PPH-patient registry, following 194 people with PPH for up to 7.5 years. Research on PPH focuses on immunologic and genetic factors, pulmonary blood vessel narrowing, smooth muscle growth, and scar tissue formation. During 1996-1997, 6,000,000 Americans took anorexic drugs, leading to PPH in some. SPH is caused by conditions like emphysema, bronchitis, and collagen vascular diseases. Other causes include congenital heart defects. Some causes of pulmonary hypertension include ventricular and atrial septal defects, chronic pulmonary thromboembolism, HIV infection, and liver disease. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute is expanding its activities for research on pulmonary hypertension. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute is expanding its activities for research on pulmonary hypertension by coordinating with other national research institutes and agencies of the National Institutes of Health. Grants and contracts will be made with public or nonprofit private entities for this purpose. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute is expanding research on pulmonary hypertension by collaborating with other national research institutes and agencies. Grants and contracts will be awarded to develop and operate research centers focusing on the cause, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of pulmonary hypertension. These centers will also provide training programs for scientists and health professionals, as well as information and education programs for healthcare professionals. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute will establish research centers to focus on pulmonary hypertension, providing grants for training programs and dissemination of information to the public. The Director will coordinate information among centers and require regular communication and reports on their activities. Each center will be based at a single institution. The Director will establish not less than three research centers focusing on pulmonary hypertension, with each center being based at a single institution. Support for each center may last up to 5 years, with the possibility of extension for additional 5-year periods based on peer review recommendations. The Director of the Institute will establish a data system for collecting and analyzing data on pulmonary hypertension, as well as an information clearinghouse to disseminate knowledge about the condition to health professionals, patients, industry, and the public. Public input will be solicited for these efforts. The Director of the Institute will provide means for the public to access information on National Institutes of Health programs for primary hypertension and receive public feedback. Biennial reports on activities will be prepared, and up to $25,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2004 through 2008."
