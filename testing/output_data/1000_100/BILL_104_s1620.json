    "content": "The Act titled \"Environmental Dredge Disposal Act of 1996\" establishes regulations for dredged material disposal facilities. The Water Resources Development Act of 1986 amends Section 101 to include provisions for dredged material disposal facilities associated with Federal navigation projects. This includes upland, aquatic, and confined aquatic disposal facilities for harbors and inland harbors, considered as a general navigation feature for cost sharing. The Water Resources Development Act of 1986 includes provisions for dredged material disposal facilities for Federal navigation projects, with restrictions on funds for construction until operation and maintenance costs are covered. The Federal share of operation and maintenance costs for a project under the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 shall not exceed $25,000,000 per fiscal year. Eligible costs include constructing dredged material disposal facilities for Federal navigation projects and operating and maintaining these facilities. The Federal government covers costs for navigation projects, environmental dredging, and disposal facilities for contaminated sediments in Federal navigation channels to mitigate environmental impacts. Additionally, it funds dredging, management, and disposal of contaminated sediments in critical port areas to support maritime commerce and navigation. The Secretary gives preference to port areas where harbor maintenance fees exceed Federal expenditures for eligible projects. This subsection applies to dredged material disposal facilities and associated navigation projects without awarded contracts before the enactment date. The subsection requires amending existing cooperative agreements between the Secretary and non-Federal interests to conform to new provisions, including those related to project costs for dredged material disposal facilities. Amendments must be requested within 30 days of enactment and will apply prospectively. The subsection requires amending cooperative agreements between the Secretary and non-Federal interests to conform to new provisions on project costs for dredged material disposal facilities. Amendments must be requested within 30 days of enactment and will apply prospectively, without increasing non-Federal costs."
