    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Crowdsourcing and Citizen Science Act of 2015\". The Congress acknowledges the importance of crowdsourcing and citizen science. The Congress recognizes the benefits of using incentive prizes and challenges for Federal agencies, including paying only for success, setting ambitious goals without predicting success, involving a broader group of people, bringing diverse perspectives, and maximizing cost-effectiveness. Federal agencies are granted direct, explicit authority under the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010. Federal agencies are granted direct authority to use crowdsourcing and citizen science, removing ambiguity and encouraging their appropriate use to advance agency missions. This stimulates broader public participation in the innovation process. Crowdsourcing projects offer unique benefits such as improving government services with lower resource investments and connecting citizens to Federal agency missions. Citizen science involves acquiring data in various locations, enabling community involvement in research, advancing scientific research through group discovery, and improving science literacy and skills for competitiveness in STEM fields. Citizen science promotes collaboration between scientists and citizens, building trust and understanding. Participants in crowdsourcing and citizen science projects should be incentivized with recognition and opportunities for learning and skill development. Citizen science encourages collaboration, trust, and understanding between scientists and citizens. Participants are motivated by recognition, learning new skills, connecting with others, and contributing to solving meaningful problems in science for the benefit of society. SEC. 3. CROWDSOURCING AND CITIZEN SCIENCE. In this section, \"citizen science\" refers to open collaboration where individuals or organizations participate in various scientific activities. \"Crowdsourcing\" is a method to obtain services or content by soliciting contributions from a group, especially online. The terms defined in this section include Director, Federal agency, Participant, and Related entity, all relevant to crowdsourcing and citizen science projects. The term \"related entity\" includes Federal Government contractors, subcontractors, suppliers, users, customers, cooperating parties, grantees, investigators, fellows, or detailees of a Federal agency. Federal agencies can use crowdsourcing and citizen science approaches to further their missions, accepting voluntary services under certain regulations. Federal agencies can accept voluntary services from participants for crowdsourcing or citizen science projects, as long as the services are unpaid, not used to replace government employees, and promoted for broad participation. Each agency must also ensure consent, registration, and terms of use for participants. Each Federal agency can determine the level of consent, registration, or acknowledgment required for crowdsourcing or citizen science projects. When seeking consent, agencies must disclose privacy, intellectual property, data ownership, compensation, and other terms clearly. Consent can be obtained electronically or in writing from participants. Federal agencies must disclose privacy, intellectual property, data ownership, compensation, and other terms clearly when seeking consent for crowdsourcing or citizen science projects. Data collected should be made open and available to the public in machine-readable formats, with participants notified of the expected uses of the data. Human subjects in research projects must adhere to regulations regarding human subjects. Federal agencies conducting crowdsourcing or citizen science projects must disclose data ownership, availability for public use, and participant authorization to publish data. Technologies developed through these projects should be made open to the public. Participants must agree to liability terms. Citizen science projects must assume risks and waive claims against the Federal Government, except for willful misconduct. Federal agencies must ensure participants adhere to scientific integrity policies. Federal agencies engaged in crowdsourcing or citizen science activities can share administrative duties with private sector entities, government agencies, or institutions of higher education. Funding for these activities can come from Congress, other federal agencies, or private sector entities. Federal agencies can collaborate with private sector entities, government agencies, or institutions of higher education for crowdsourcing or citizen science activities. Funding sources can include Congress, federal agencies, or private sector entities. The General Services Administration will provide assistance in developing products and services to support these activities. The Director shall report on crowdsourcing and citizen science activities carried out by Federal agencies every 2 years, as part of the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act report. The Director reports on crowdsourcing and citizen science projects conducted by Federal agencies every 2 years. Each report includes a summary of projects, participation rates, and resources used. The report on crowdsourcing and citizen science projects by Federal agencies every 2 years includes details on funding, activities, obligations, expenditures, project advancements, results, and methods used. The report on crowdsourcing and citizen science projects by Federal agencies every 2 years includes details on funding, activities, obligations, expenditures, project advancements, results, methods used, data quality assurance, public data availability, savings or costs incurred, challenges faced, steps taken to address challenges, and recommendations for the future. The report on crowdsourcing and citizen science projects by Federal agencies every 2 years includes details on funding, activities, obligations, expenditures, project advancements, results, methods used, data quality assurance, public data availability, savings or costs incurred, challenges faced, steps taken to address challenges, recommendations for future administrative or legislative action, summary of the use of crowdsourcing and citizen science methods by Federal agencies, and any other relevant information considered by the Director. Nothing in this section may affect the authority to conduct crowdsourcing and citizen science authorized by other laws or displace resources allocated to Federal agencies for these projects."
