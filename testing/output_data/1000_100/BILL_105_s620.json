Catchup contributions for families with children not covered by a pension plan involve amending the Internal Revenue Code to allow eligible participants to make additional elective deferrals under their plan or arrangement. This includes specific provisions regarding qualified trusts, plans under sections 401(a) and 403(b), eligible deferred compensation plans under section 457, and meeting requirements of section 408(k) or (p). A plan must allow eligible participants to make additional elective deferrals in a catchup year, limited to the lesser of the amount allowed under the plan or a specified limit. In a catchup year, eligible participants can make additional elective deferrals limited by the plan or a specified limit. The excess is calculated as 120 percent of the dollar limitation under section 402(g), 408(p), or 457(b)(2)(A) for the applicable taxable year, minus any other elective deferrals made by the participant without regard to this subsection.

Matching contributions made during the year must comply with section 401(a)(4) requirements and not exceed the maximum amount allowed for elective deferrals without this subsection. Participants must certify to the plan administrator when making additional elective deferrals. An eligible participant can certify one or more catchup years, limited to a total number not exceeding the excess of years before the current year over years previously certified. An eligible participant in a plan is not considered to fail requirements due to relying on an incorrect certification unless the plan administrator knew or should have known it was wrong. The term 'eligible participant' refers to a plan participant who was not an active participant for any plan year before the current year. The subsection defines terms like 'elective deferral' and 'plan' for the purpose of the section. It also outlines rules for eligible participants in a plan. The amendment made by this section applies to contributions in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1997, with certain retroactive adjustments not required."
