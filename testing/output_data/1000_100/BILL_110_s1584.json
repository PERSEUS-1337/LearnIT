    "content": "The \"Hydrographic Services Improvement Act Amendments of 2007\" redesignates sections and adds new findings and purposes to the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998. The Congress finds that in 2007, the Survey of the Coast, established in 1807 by President Thomas Jefferson, evolved into the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, providing various services related to surveying, mapping, and ocean observations. The need to maintain federal expertise in hydrographic data and services is crucial for supporting a safe and efficient marine transportation system, vital for international trade and economic prosperity. The increasing congestion in the nation's marine transportation system, expected growth in international maritime commerce, and the significant volume of hazardous cargo transiting U.S. waters highlight the importance of hydrographic data and services. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration provides services for the Great Lakes, coastal waters, and the United States' territorial sea. This includes emergency response, homeland security, marine resource conservation, coastal resiliency, ocean and coastal science advancement, and ocean observing system integration. NOAA also establishes national standards for hydrographic data in cooperation with other agencies and states. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Office of Coast Survey serves as the U.S. National Hydrographer and representative to the international hydrographic community. NOAA's hydrographic expertise provides the basis for marine territorial limits and jurisdiction. Research and development of new technologies will enhance efficiency and promote competitiveness. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration aims to enhance safety, provide accurate hydrographic data for trade and commerce, support homeland security, and promote coastal resiliency. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration aims to enhance safety, provide accurate hydrographic data for trade and commerce, support homeland security, and promote coastal resiliency by offering various services and applications such as storm surge monitoring, habitat restoration, and research in hydrographic data and technologies. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration aims to enhance safety, provide accurate hydrographic data for trade and commerce, support homeland security, and promote coastal resiliency by offering various services and applications such as storm surge monitoring, habitat restoration, and research in hydrographic data and technologies. Additionally, it aims to provide national and international leadership for hydrographic and related services, sciences, and technologies. SEC. 4. CHANGES IN DEFINITIONS. Section 303 of the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998 is amended to define hydrographic data as information acquired through various surveying methods for providing hydrographic services. This includes the management, maintenance, interpretation, certification, and dissemination of various types of information related to bathymetry, hydrography, shorelines, geodesy, geospatial data, geomagnetism, tides, water levels, and currents. The amendment to Section 303 of the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998 includes defining hydrographic data as information acquired through surveying methods for providing hydrographic services, such as producing nautical charts and databases derived from hydrographic data. It also amends the definition of the Coast and Geodetic Survey Act. SEC. 5. CHANGES IN FUNCTIONS OF THE ADMINISTRATOR. Section 304 of the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998 is amended to fulfill data gathering and dissemination duties under the Coast and Geodetic Survey Act, promote safe marine transportation, and provide hydrographic services. The Administrator has the authority to procure, operate vessels and equipment for safe navigation, maintain hydrographic monitoring systems, and enhance navigation safety and efficiency. The Administrator may acquire hydrographic data and provide services to support coastal and ocean resource conservation, save lives, protect property, and resume commerce during emergencies. They have the authority to create joint centers and enter contracts to fulfill these purposes. The Administrator may award contracts for hydrographic data acquisition in accordance with the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949. Changes to quality assurance program and hydrographic services review panel are being made in accordance with the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998. Section 306 of the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998 is amended to change the composition of the panel, with 15 voting members appointed by the Administrator and nonvoting members from the Joint Hydrographic Institute and NOAA. The Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998 is amended to change the panel composition, with voting members reimbursed for expenses incurred in performing duties. The Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998 is amended to authorize appropriations of $168,771,000 in fiscal year 2008 and subsequent years for carrying out the Act."
