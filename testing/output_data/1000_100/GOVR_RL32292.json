    "content": "Offshoring, or offshore outsourcing, involves U.S. businesses contracting with firms outside the country for services previously done in-house. This practice has expanded from manufacturing to service providers, raising concerns about job loss for U.S. workers, especially in light of high unemployment rates post-recession. The labor market implications of offshore outsourcing post-2009 recession are unclear. Some believe it contributed to job loss, while others argue that job creation will eventually recover. Offshoring may have accounted for 3% of net job loss in the early 2000s. There are concerns that offshoring is hindering the labor market's recovery from the 2007-2009 recession. Many economists agree that trade and globalization benefit the nation by offering a greater variety of products at lower prices and expanding markets. However, there are concerns that offshoring of service activities mainly benefits companies rather than promoting growth in the U.S. economy. The offshoring of service jobs may have different implications for the labor market and public policy compared to production jobs. Data shows that factory workers have lower educational levels, while administrative and professional workers are more likely to have college degrees. There are concerns that offshoring service jobs could lead to a decrease in entry-level positions for college graduates and questions about the adequacy of trade adjustment assistance programs for well-educated office workers who lose their jobs. The offshoring of service jobs raises concerns about job loss for well-educated office workers. Policymakers support measures to promote U.S. job growth and discourage offshoring. Some advocate for trade and labor policies to support U.S. companies, while others prefer limited government intervention for economic growth. The report examines the development of outsourcing by U.S. companies and its impact on U.S. employment since the early 2000s to evaluate the effectiveness of retraining and income support programs for displaced workers. Overseas relocation of manufacturing work predates services offshoring, with major U.S. companies opening facilities abroad in response to competition from Japanese and European multinational corporations in the 1970s and 1980s. The 1970s and 1980s saw U.S. companies outsourcing manufacturing work abroad in response to competition. This led to the restructuring of operations, with jobs being outsourced to domestic entities for efficiency. The trend of domestic outsourcing has become a permanent reorganization of work in the United States. The 2001 recession further pushed U.S. employers to seek efficiencies. The 2001 recession prompted U.S. employers to utilize technological innovations for efficiency, leading to the offshoring of jobs in both IT and IT-enabled services. Other countries also enhanced their ability to export services, particularly IT services, to the United States and other developed countries. The offshoring of jobs in IT and IT-enabled services to countries like India and the Philippines was prompted by the 2001 recession. These countries were able to provide a skilled workforce with IT and accounting skills that exceeded local needs. The use of English as the language of the computer industry allowed for IT services to be provided from non-English-speaking, low-wage nations like Argentina and Brazil. The offshoring of jobs in IT and IT-enabled services to countries like India and the Philippines was prompted by the 2001 recession. This trend has allowed U.S.-based companies to fragment tasks across borders, including research, design, management, and IT support, in nations like Argentina, Brazil, Bulgaria, China, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Jordan, Lithuania, Mexico, Slovenia, Russia, and Ukraine. This has contributed to increased wage dispersion in the United States. The offshoring of jobs in IT and IT-enabled services to countries like India and the Philippines was prompted by the 2001 recession, leading to increased wage dispersion in the United States. Data on jobs lost to offshoring is limited, with the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics underestimating the impact due to its focus on large layoffs and exclusion of small companies. Forrester Research, Inc. provided statistics on offshoring of service sector jobs, forecasting 3.4 million jobs moving abroad between 2003 and 2015. Half of these jobs were expected to relocate outside the United States within the first 7 years, and the other half over the following 5 years. Forrester Research forecasted 3.4 million service sector jobs moving overseas between 2003 and 2015. Bhagwati et al. noted that this loss of jobs represents a small share of total U.S. employment turnover. Bardhan and Kroll estimated that 14 million jobs in 49 service occupations could potentially be offshored in 2001. The vulnerability of certain occupational groups to offshoring includes office support, auditors, computer programmers, medical transcriptionists, and technical writers. These jobs are mainly found in industries such as information, finance, insurance, and professional services. Studies project potential job losses in various metropolitan areas due to services offshoring. The study analyzed the potential job loss in 246 metropolitan areas due to services offshoring between 2004 and 2015. Only 2.2% of jobs in these areas were likely to be offshored, with some metro areas like Boulder, Lowell, San Francisco, San Jose, and Stamford expected to lose between 3.1% and 4.3% of jobs by 2015. Metropolitan areas most vulnerable to offshoring tend to be populous, located in the Northeast and West, and have high concentrations of IT jobs. Jensen and Kletzer developed a geographically based approach to estimate the share of tradable and nontradable jobs in various industries. About 9.4% of total U.S. employment in 2000 was found to be in offshorable industries, with manufacturing and professional services industries being most vulnerable to offshoring. Jensen and Kletzer examined the task content of service occupations to rank their vulnerability to offshoring. They found that certain occupational groups like computer and mathematical, legal, and office/administrative support had a large share of employment in the most offshorable category. This category accounted for 27.4% of all service employment in 2005. They also discovered that a service occupation's offshorability was linked to its level of educational attainment. The vulnerability of service occupations to offshoring is linked to their level of educational attainment. Out of 515 service occupations, 160 may be susceptible to offshoring, with a focus on professional and technical categories. These offshorable occupations accounted for over one-fifth of total employment in 2007, with computer and mathematical science occupations being particularly susceptible. Despite this vulnerability, employment in these occupations grew slightly faster than overall service-providing employment from 2001-2007. During the 2001-2007 period, offshorable occupations saw faster wage growth compared to overall service-providing employment. However, the 33 most vulnerable service-providing occupations to offshoring experienced below-average employment and wage growth. These vulnerable occupations range from office and administrative support to professional and related occupations, with varying education requirements. Blinder created an index of offshorability for blue-collar, white-collar, and service occupations based on personal interaction needs. Blinder estimated that a majority of U.S. occupations and workers are non offshorable, while a minority fall in the highly offshorable and offshorable categories. He considered the estimate of potentially offshorable jobs to be too conservative and created moderate and aggressive estimates totaling 25.6% and almost 40% of all U.S. workers, respectively. Blinder's aggressive estimate suggests that almost 40 million workers, or 29.0% of all U.S. jobs, are potentially offshorable. He found that the correlation between skill and offshorability is minimal, contradicting the belief that offshorable occupations are low-end jobs. Blinder used three survey methods to determine job vulnerability to offshoring, with all methods indicating that about one in four U.S. jobs could be moved overseas. Blinder's analysis suggests that around 29.0% of U.S. jobs are potentially offshorable, with offshorability prevalent in factory and administrative support occupations. Some experts believe fears about services offshoring are exaggerated, but caution that executives need to learn how to effectively utilize offshore talent to boost productivity. Deloitte Consulting is cautious about the future pace of moving potentially vulnerable U.S. jobs abroad. Deloitte Consulting predicts a shift away from outsourcing as companies prioritize retaining core functions in-house for knowledge and control. Some organizations are re-insourcing to address customer dissatisfaction and quality issues, bringing back services like IT, call centers, and legal support to the United States. Some U.S. manufacturers have brought production back from overseas due to China's shrinking wage advantages, long delivery times, quality control issues, and intellectual property concerns. Examples include Caterpillar, National Cash Register, and Otis Elevator. Offshore providers of IT services were able to address U.S. firms' security concerns post-9/11, leading to increased outsourcing of maintenance jobs by U.S. airline carriers overseas. Concerns over regional unrest have prompted global software service providers to diversify work locations, including near-shore markets like Canada and Mexico. Some U.S. employers prefer moving work to Canada due to fewer cultural differences with the U.S. compared to countries like India or the Philippines. Despite rising labor costs in some Asian nations, low wages in countries like Vietnam continue to attract U.S. jobs. There is no comprehensive data on the number of U.S. workers losing jobs to offshore outsourcing, with analyses focusing on jobs susceptible to moving abroad. This approach may overstate job losses as other factors influencing employers' location decisions are not considered."
