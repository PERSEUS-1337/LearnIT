Presumptions of service connection for diseases associated with Project 112 under laws administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. This new section establishes a presumption of service connection for diagnosed diseases with increased incidence related to service, even without evidence during that period. The new section establishes a presumption of service connection for veterans who were subjected to chemical or biological warfare tests under Project 112 and develop a related disease within a specified period. The new section establishes a presumption of service connection for veterans exposed to biological, chemical, or other toxic agents associated with diseases, unless there is conclusive evidence to prove otherwise. The Secretary will determine when this presumption is warranted based on sound medical and scientific evidence. The Secretary will consider all medical and scientific information available when determining the association between exposure to biological, chemical, or other toxic agents and the occurrence of a diagnosed disease in humans or animals. The results must be statistically significant, replicable, and withstand peer review for consideration. The association between exposure to biological, chemical, or other toxic agents and the occurrence of a diagnosed disease in humans or animals is considered positive if credible evidence outweighs evidence against it. If the presumption of service connection for a disease is removed, veterans and survivors will still be entitled to compensation.
