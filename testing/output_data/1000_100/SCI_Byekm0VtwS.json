Neuromorphic computing chips with uncertainty can mimic the brain, but current neural networks do not consider this. A new training scheme, UATS, incorporates uncertainty, leading to improved performance on neuromorphic chips compared to CPUs/GPUs. The essence of human thinking involves uncertainty reasoning, with two types of uncertainties in intelligent systems: fuzziness and stochasticity. Fuzziness helps the brain efficiently process information by ignoring redundant details, while stochasticity enables creativity and adaptability. These characteristics are lacking in most existing AI systems, like deep neural networks. The text discusses the use of 8-bit integer for neural network applications, methods like network quantization and Bayesian network to address issues, and the development of neuromorphic computing chips based on nanotechnology and crossbar structure for efficient VMM operations. The emerging nanoscale nonvolatile memory device at each cross point provides additional storage capability and computing function in the neuromorphic computing chips, relieving memory bottleneck and improving energy efficiency. Neuromorphic computing is a promising approach for AI applications with great memory requirements and inherent uncertainty. The uncertainty in neuromorphic computing chips arises from analog to digital converters (ADCs) and stochasticity in NVM devices. The VMM result is a sum of currents, converted to digital voltages by ADC for data transfer. NVM device stochasticity is due to random particle movement affecting conductance and output current variability. In neuromorphic computing chips, the stochasticity of NVM devices, such as phase change memories and filamentary migrating oxide devices, affects conductance and output current variability. A training scheme utilizing this stochasticity can improve chip performance. The Gaussian distribution is used to model device stochasticity, although it may not fit all types of devices perfectly. The stochasticity of NVM devices in neuromorphic computing chips affects conductance variability. The Gaussian distribution models this stochasticity, with the mean representing the stable state conductance. The variance is typically correlated to the mean. A linear relationship between standard deviation and mean is assumed for simplicity. Conductances below a minimum value are cut off. The model of NVM devices in neuromorphic computing chips involves stochastic conductance represented by a Gaussian distribution. Writing the conductance of each device is crucial for AI applications, requiring mapping processes to determine target conductance based on neural network weights. Conductances are scaled into a working range, and differences between device conductances express weights. In neuromorphic computing chips, stochastic conductance is crucial for AI applications. Mapping processes determine target conductance based on neural network weights, with conductances scaled into a working range. However, accuracy is hindered by device stochasticity and circuit fuzziness, affecting the precision of conductance measurement. A model is needed to describe this fuzziness. A model using Gaussian distribution is proposed to describe fuzziness in neuromorphic computing chips. Uncertainty can decrease DNN performance, but can be alleviated with uncertainty adaptation training scheme (UATS) to improve accuracy. The uncertainty adaptation training scheme (UATS) introduces stochasticity and fuzziness models during the training process to improve neural network accuracy. Stochasticity involves using random variables in feed forward processes, while fuzziness replaces weights with random variables after every k epochs of training. The uncertainty adaptation training scheme (UATS) introduces stochasticity and fuzziness models to improve neural network accuracy by incorporating randomness in feed forward processes and replacing weights with random variables. The loss function is calculated based on the average output of multiple feed forward processes with the same input batch. The effectiveness of UATS was evaluated on various models and datasets, including the MNIST dataset with multilayer perceptron and convolutional neural network models. In the study, LeNet-5 and MLP models were trained and tested on the MNIST dataset with different levels of uncertainty. The models were evaluated using the uncertainty adaptation training scheme (UATS), which showed that higher uncertainty levels led to increased test errors. The CNN model (LeNet-5) performed the best among all models tested. The CNN model (LeNet-5) has the best performance but is most affected by uncertainty. The 'mlp2' model is more robust to uncertainty than 'mlp1'. UATS significantly improves accuracies in retraining and fine-tuning experiments. Most retraining results are better than fine-tuning using UATS. The UATS achieved comparable results to the ideal case with \u03b1 = 0.1, \u03b2 = 0.1 on CIFAR-10 dataset using ResNet-44. UATS can achieve lower error rates than ideal cases with proper hyper-parameters. It acts as a regularization method for DNN training, especially with more layers. Uncertainty is crucial in intelligent systems, and Bayesian networks can help build uncertain neural networks. However, controlling weight distributions is challenging for neuromorphic computing chips. The distribution of conductance in neuromorphic computing chips is difficult to control. Various distributions have been tried to model device stochasticity, but the performance of the network remains similar regardless of the distribution type. The VMM transforms individual device distributions into a summary of random behavior. The VMM transforms individual device distributions into a summary of random behavior by using various methods to reduce the requirement of random numbers, such as sampling weights for every input or batch and using the uncertainty model of VMM results. This accelerates simulation speed while achieving similar results."
