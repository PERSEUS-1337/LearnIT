    "content": "The NLRA, as amended, aims to improve workers' bargaining power in the private sector by allowing them to join or form labor unions and collectively bargain over wages and working conditions. It seeks to eliminate obstacles to the free flow of commerce and stabilize competitive wage rates. The NLRA grants workers the right to join or form a labor union, bargain collectively over employment terms, and protects the rights of both employers and workers. It defines unfair labor practices and applies to most industries except for certain exceptions like railroads, airlines, and government sectors. Unauthorized workers are not excluded from engaging in union activities under the NLRA, which is enforced by the independent federal agency NLRB. The NLRB oversees secret ballot elections, determines bargaining unit composition based on employees' common interests in wages and working conditions, and addresses unfair labor practice appeals. The General Counsel's office manages elections, investigates complaints, and supervises regional offices. Bargaining units consist of employees represented by a union, grouped by shared interests. Professional and nonprofessional employees can be in the same unit if the majority of professionals agree. Guards are typically excluded from bargaining units. In August 2011, the NLRB reviewed a case where CNAs at a healthcare center in Mobile, AL, petitioned to be represented by the United Steelworkers. The employer argued that the bargaining unit should include all nonprofessional service and maintenance employees, not just CNAs. The CNAs at the healthcare center in Mobile, AL assist residents with daily functions, wear nursing uniforms, and work eight-hour shifts. They are supervised by licensed practical nurses and must maintain certification. The employer argued for other employees to be included in the bargaining unit, such as resident activity assistants, a staffing coordinator, a maintenance assistant, a medical records clerk, and cooks. The board voted in favor of the CNAs, determining that their petitioned-for bargaining unit was appropriate based on shared community of interest due to distinct training, certification, supervision, uniforms, pay rates, work assignments, shifts, and work areas. The other employees, like the medical records clerk and cooks, have similar educational requirements but are not part of the nursing department and do not work the same shifts as CNAs. The board determined that the CNAs' bargaining unit was appropriate based on shared community of interest. Campaign rules vary for employers, employees, and union organizers, with exceptions to basic rules. Employers can campaign against unionization and hold \"captive audience\" meetings, but not within 24 hours of an election. Supervisors can provide written information and hold individual meetings with employees. Employees can campaign for union support from coworkers during work hours in both work and nonwork areas. They can distribute union literature in nonwork areas if not allowed in work areas. Using employer's e-mail for union activities can be restricted if not allowed for other causes. Employees can campaign for union support from coworkers during work hours in both work and nonwork areas. They can distribute union literature in nonwork areas if not allowed in work areas. If an employer allows employees to use their work e-mail for other causes, they may also use it for union activities. Union organizers have various ways to reach employees, including meeting on union property, distributing literature on public property, contacting employees at home, or visiting them. Nonemployee union organizers may be allowed in the workplace under certain conditions. The NLRA protects employees and employers' rights in union activities. Employers cannot interfere with employees' right to join a union, threaten job loss or benefits, close a plant, raise wages to discourage unionization, or discriminate against union activities. Employers must bargain in good faith on wages and working conditions. Employees have the right to organize and bargain. Employees have the right to organize and bargain collectively. A union must bargain in good faith with respect to wages, hours, and other working conditions. Unfair labor practices can be filed by employees, employers, or labor unions. The NLRB investigates these charges to determine if a violation has occurred. The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) aims to prevent and address unfair labor practices. The NLRB can issue cease-and-desist orders and remedies for violations. Employers may be required to reinstate fired employees with back pay for engaging in union activities. Unions may also be responsible for back pay if they cause a worker to be fired. In FY2011, $60.5 million in backpay or reimbursement was awarded. In FY2011, $60.5 million in backpay or reimbursement of fees, dues, and fines was awarded to workers who faced discrimination for union activities. Estimates suggest 1,000 to 3,000 workers are illegally fired for union activities annually. Kate Bronfenbrenner found that 25% of union campaigns result in workers being fired. The number of unfair labor practice charges filed peaked at 44,063 in FY1980 and stood at 21,629 in FY2012. 36.4% of charges filed in FY2012 were found to have merit. Section 9(a) of NLRA states that a union may be designated for collective bargaining by the majority of workers. Currently, there are three ways for employees to join or form a union: through a majority election conducted by the NLRB, voluntary recognition by an employer based on signed authorization cards, or NLRB ordering recognition due to unfair labor practices. Certification through a secret ballot or employer recognition is necessary for collective bargaining to begin. Certification through a secret ballot election by the NLRB is advantageous over employer recognition without an election. A petition can be filed by a union, worker, or employer to request a secret ballot election. If a majority of employees voting in the election choose to be represented by a union, the union is certified as the employees' bargaining representative. The NLRA does not specify a timeframe for holding an election. The NLRA does not provide a timetable for holding an election. Certification of a union by the NLRB does not require an initial contract agreement. If an agreement is not reached between the employer and union, a hearing may be held in the regional office of the NLRB, and the regional director may direct an election to be held. Employees choose whether to be represented by a labor union in a secret ballot election. If no choice receives a majority of the vote, a runoff election is held between the top two unions. The right to vote in an NLRB election may be challenged by either the employer or union. An individual's right to vote in an NLRB election can be challenged by the employer or union. The regional director decides if challenged ballots could impact the outcome. Objections to an election can be filed by either party, which may be appealed to the board. Secret ballot elections can be conducted by a third party, and the NLRB also holds secret ballot elections for decertifying unions. A decertification petition must be signed by at least 30% of employees in the bargaining unit. The NLRB issued a final rule in December 2011, making changes to representation procedures, which took effect in April 2012. However, implementation was suspended in response to a court decision in May 2012. The NLRB made changes to representation procedures in December 2011, but implementation was suspended due to a court decision in May 2012. The final rule allowed hearing officers to limit pre-election hearings to matters relevant to the question of representation and consolidated pre- and post-election requests for review. The NLRB's December 22, 2011 rule consolidated pre-election and post-election requests for review, allowing special permission for review of pre-election decisions only in extraordinary circumstances. The rule eliminated the 25-day waiting period for scheduling elections to consider requests for review. Under the December 22, 2011 rule, requests for review by the board of decisions on challenges and objections to elections would have been discretionary. In FY2010, the NLRB conducted 1,823 elections with unions winning 62.3% of them. Most elections were based on consent or stipulated agreements between the employer and union. In FY2010, 89.3% of elections were based on consent or stipulated agreements between the two parties. Most elections are held within two months of filing a petition. In FY2012, 93.9% of initial representation elections were conducted within 56 days of filing a petition, with a median time of 38 days to proceed to an election. Post-election objections and challenges were filed in 115 cases in FY2011, with a median of 62 days for decisions with a hearing and 21 days without a hearing. The NLRB does not track the time it takes for a union and employer to reach a first contract agreement after a union wins. The NLRB does not track the time it takes for a union and employer to reach a first contract agreement after a union wins an election. A recent study estimated that within two years of winning an NLRB election, a contract had not been reached in over two-fifths of cases. The NLRA does not require secret ballot elections and allows for voluntary recognition of a union through card check agreements. A collective bargaining contract may include a card check arrangement for unorganized branches. Employees have 45 days for decertification or election petition. Neutrality agreements involve the employer remaining neutral during union organizing. Neutrality agreements in union organizing involve employers agreeing not to criticize the union, allowing access to company property, providing employee information, and potentially engaging in corporate campaigns to gain support. The final way a union may be recognized by an employer is through a bargaining order issued by the NLRB based on employee authorization cards and employer unfair labor practices. Bargaining orders can be appealed to higher courts. Certification by the NLRB after a secret ballot election gives a union certain advantages, such as protection from decertification or representation by another union for a year. Voluntary recognition or bargaining orders do not result in NLRB certification. The Taft-Hartley Act of 1947 eliminated certification through methods other than NLRB elections. The duration of an employer's duty to bargain depends on union certification by the NLRB or voluntary recognition. If a union wins an NLRB election, bargaining is required for a year. Voluntary recognition requires bargaining for a reasonable period. An employer can withdraw recognition under certain circumstances before a contract agreement. If no agreement is reached after a year, the employer can withdraw recognition if both parties have bargained in good faith and there is doubt about majority employee support. Before the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947, only a union or employee could request a secret ballot election. Section 9(c) of the Taft-Hartley Act gave employers the right to request an election if they had \"good faith\" doubt that the union was supported by a majority of employees. An employer could withdraw recognition if no contract agreement was reached after a reasonable period of time and if there was doubt about majority employee support for the union. The \"Joy Silk doctrine\" required employers to recognize a union supported by a majority of employees or face a bargaining order. By 1969, the NLRB abandoned this doctrine, allowing employers to voluntarily recognize a union if a majority signed authorization cards. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1974 that if an employer insists on an election, the union must file an election petition. Recent NLRB cases have involved voluntary recognition, with a 2004 decision to review cases where decertification petitions were filed shortly after union recognition under a card check agreement. In 2002 and 2003, the UAW and two companies entered into card check and neutrality agreements, leading to union recognition before contract agreements were reached. Employees filed decertification petitions after recognition but before contract negotiations. The NLRB granted a request to review dismissals of decertification petitions after employees at Dana and Metaldyne Corporations filed. The issue was whether voluntary recognition should prevent employees from filing a decertification petition within a reasonable time. The board decided that employees have 45 days to file a petition to decertify after voluntary recognition. The NLRB ruled that employees have 45 days to file a petition to decertify the union after voluntary recognition. If no petition is filed within this time frame, an election petition cannot be filed during the recognition bar period. Following a voluntary recognition, a bargaining unit employee filed a petition for a decertification election 45 days later, supported by authorization cards signed by 30% of employees. The NLRB, in a 3-1 decision, established a rule that bars an election petition for a reasonable period of at least six months, but not more than a year, after the first bargaining session between the employer and union. The board will use standards from the Lee Lumber case to determine the passage of a reasonable time. The committee requested the NLRB to provide lists of cases related to election petitions under the Dana decision and dismissals due to the Lamons Gasket decision. Once a union and employer have a collective bargaining agreement, election petitions are subject to a \"contract bar\" for up to three years. In August 2007, the NLRB allowed an employer to withdraw recognition of a union after the third year of a longer-term contract. Shaw's Supermarkets entered into a five-year contract with the UFCW in January 1999. After three years, employees requested a decertification election, leading Shaw's to withdraw union recognition. The NLRB rules prevent the employer or incumbent union from initiating an election petition during the contract, but after three years, employees or another union can file for an election. The NLRB allowed Shaw's Supermarkets to withdraw union recognition during a five-year contract after evidence showed a loss of majority support. The board voted 2-1 in favor of Shaw's actions, with the dissenting member suggesting a decertification election should have been held. If a union and employer cannot agree on a collective bargaining agreement, it may lead to an impasse and potential work stoppage. When a union and employer reach an impasse in collective bargaining, they may use a neutral third party like a mediator to help them reach an agreement. Mediation involves defining issues, suggesting compromises, and finding solutions without imposing a settlement. In arbitration, an arbitrator decides on resolving disputes by hearing both sides' positions. Arbitration can take different forms, such as grievance arbitration. Interest arbitration can take different forms: voluntary or compulsory, conventional or final-offer, and binding or nonbinding. In final-offer arbitration, the arbitrator may choose between the complete final offers of the employer and union or between the final offers from each side on each issue. Voluntary interest arbitration occurs when the union and employer agree to use arbitration to resolve a bargaining impasse, while compulsory arbitration is required by law. In conventional arbitration, the arbitrator is free to decide on a final contract agreement. In final-offer arbitration, the arbitrator must choose between the complete final offers of the union and employer or between final offers on each issue. The decision can be binding or nonbinding, with the parties having the option to accept or reject the arbitrator's decision. Different forms of arbitration, such as voluntary or compulsory, can be combined. Med-Arb combines the roles of mediator and arbitrator, where a neutral third party facilitates an agreement and then decides on a settlement if no agreement is reached. Interest arbitration is mainly used in the public sector where the right to strike is limited, while in the private sector, parties may voluntarily agree to use interest arbitration. Interest arbitration in the private sector allows unions and employers to settle bargaining impasses, aiming to prevent strikes or lockouts. However, it may alter negotiating behavior and become the norm for resolving disputes. Strikes over wages, hours, or working conditions can lead to permanent replacement of workers, imposing costs on both parties. Interest arbitration in the private sector can have adverse effects on negotiations. It may lead to a \"chilling\" effect, where parties do not bargain seriously if they believe arbitration will result in a better settlement. Additionally, it can create a \"narcotic\" effect, where parties rely on arbitration and do not engage in meaningful negotiations for future contracts. Final-offer arbitration is proposed as a solution to the chilling effect of conventional arbitration, where parties may not engage in serious negotiations. By limiting the arbitrator to choosing the last offer of either the union or employer, it is believed that both sides will be more willing to compromise and reach a contract settlement on their own. The arbitrator could choose between the complete final offer of either party or between the final offers of each party. The NLRA does not have a statutory exemption for small businesses, but the NLRB does not certify bargaining units of only one employee or assert jurisdiction over employers with low revenues. Collective bargaining requires more than one employee, and the NLRB has jurisdiction over employers affecting interstate commerce. The NLRB has jurisdiction over employers affecting commerce based on annual sales or revenue thresholds. Retail businesses need $500,000 in annual sales, hotels and motels need $500,000 in gross revenues, nonretail businesses need $50,000 in sales to or purchases from other states, and private colleges and orchestras need $1 million in revenue. These standards have been in place since August 1, 1959. The Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 codified jurisdictional standards under Section 14(c)(1) of the NLRA. The Board may decline jurisdiction over a labor dispute if its impact on commerce is not substantial enough, but must assert jurisdiction if the dispute meets the standards in effect since August 1, 1959. The board may decline jurisdiction over a labor dispute without substantial impact on interstate commerce. Smaller employers can still allow unionization through alternative methods, such as voluntary recognition or third-party supervised elections. State or territorial agencies can assert jurisdiction over disputes not covered by the NLRB. GAO estimated that 5 million employees of small employers lack collective bargaining rights under the NLRA due to jurisdictional standards. 5 million employees of small employers lack collective bargaining rights under the NLRA. Recent data could change this estimate. Legislation has been proposed to alter union certification procedures, including requiring secret ballot elections or majority-signed authorization cards. Arguments for both methods are discussed. The section discusses proposed changes to union certification procedures, including secret ballot elections and card check certification. Supporters and opponents of card check certification use similar arguments regarding coercion and access to employees. Proponents of secret ballot elections emphasize privacy and confidentiality, while unions argue that employers have greater influence during election campaigns. Research suggests that card check certification may lead to higher union success rates compared to secret ballot elections, with unions undertaking more drives under this method. The cost implications for employees are debated, as unions argue for lower costs while employers highlight potential drawbacks such as dues and reduced job opportunities. The union success rate is higher under card check certification combined with a neutrality agreement. In Canada, provinces have laws governing union recognition, with some requiring secret ballot elections. Mandatory voting was repealed in 1993 but restored in 2001. Under card check recognition, a union is automatically recognized if enough employees sign authorization cards. The union success rate in Canada is higher under card check recognition, where a minimum threshold of employees signing authorization cards automatically recognizes the union. A study of 171 union organizing campaigns between 1978 and 1996 in nine provinces showed a nine percentage point increase in union success rate under card check recognition compared to secret ballots. In British Columbia, union recognition based on card checks was allowed until 1984, then required secret ballot elections until 1992, before allowing card checks again in 1993. Mandatory voting was adopted in 1984, leading to a 19 percentage point decrease in union success rate, which increased when card checks were reinstated in 1993. Since 1984, mandatory voting and card check recognition have impacted union organizing drives in Canada. After mandatory voting was adopted, there were 50% fewer organizing attempts, and the union success rate increased when card check recognition was reinstated in 1993. In Ontario, card check recognition was allowed before 1995, but secret balloting has been required since then. A study comparing certification applications found that card checks had a higher certification rate, but under secret balloting, larger bargaining units were organized. The study compared union organizing drives under card check recognition and secret balloting. It found that larger bargaining units were organized under secret balloting, with an average of 63.1 workers compared to 39.7 workers under card check recognition. Additionally, the study suggested that card check recognition may be more successful under a neutrality agreement. The study found that union success rates are higher when a card check agreement is combined with a neutrality agreement. Unions had a 78.2% success rate with both agreements, compared to 62.5% with just a card check agreement. Card check recognition may lead to higher success rates due to less employer opposition and lower costs compared to secret ballot elections. Requiring card check certification may increase union success rates by reducing employer opposition. However, the impact on reversing the decline in private sector unionization is uncertain due to factors like shrinking employment in unionized firms and decertifications. Additionally, requiring card check recognition could lead to increased employer opposition during the collection of authorization cards. Americans generally support unions, according to an annual Gallup poll. According to recent polls, Americans are supportive of unions. In August 2008, 59% approved of unions while 31% disapproved. In March 2009, 53% favored a law making it easier for unions to organize, while 39% opposed it. Another poll showed 33% agreed that Congress should change laws to facilitate union formation. Sixty-one percent believed a secret ballot is fair for union formation. According to surveys, a majority of respondents believe in the importance of a secret ballot vote for forming a union. In contrast, a small percentage prefer card check recognition. Additionally, many find it difficult to form a union. According to a 2005 survey by American Rights at Work, 22% of workers in a union organizing campaign felt pressure from management, while only 6% felt pressure from the union. The NLRA gives private sector workers the right to organize and bargain collectively, aiming to improve workers' bargaining power. Governments may intervene in labor markets to improve competition, leading to efficient resource allocation and greater output. In competitive labor markets, workers are paid based on their contribution to output, including compensation for unfavorable working conditions. The theory of compensating wage differentials recognizes individual preferences for different working conditions. Increasing the bargaining power of workers in labor markets can lead to higher wages, better benefits, and improved working conditions. However, in competitive labor markets, higher union wages may reduce employment for union workers. Unions may also increase the supply of workers in the unionized sector, potentially impacting total economic output and consumer satisfaction. If unions lower employment in the unionized sector, they may increase the supply of workers to employers in the nonunion sector, lowering the relative wages of nonunion workers. It is difficult to determine the competitiveness of labor markets due to various factors such as the difficulty in identifying the appropriate labor market, measuring competitiveness, and changes in labor markets over time. Governments may intervene in labor markets to reduce earnings inequality, with some policymakers finding the distribution of earnings in competitive labor markets unacceptable. Unionization is seen as a means of reducing earnings inequality. Unionization may reduce earnings inequality by giving workers a voice in the workplace through dispute resolution and formal grievance procedures. This can lead to higher wages, improved benefits, and better working conditions for unionized workers compared to individual bargaining. The economic impact of requiring card check certification or secret ballot elections depends on policymakers' objectives and the competitiveness of labor markets. Depending on labor market competitiveness, collective bargaining can either improve or harm resource allocation. Increasing workers' bargaining power in competitive markets may reduce output but increase equality. In non-competitive markets, it can improve resource allocation and equality. Requiring card check certification may boost organizing campaigns and union success, while secret ballot elections may decrease them. The impact on unionization levels varies based on labor market competitiveness. Requiring card check certification or secret ballot elections in labor markets can impact economic efficiency and earnings inequality. The effects may be difficult to predict or measure, but card check certification may increase unionization and reduce inequality, while secret ballot elections may have the opposite effect."
