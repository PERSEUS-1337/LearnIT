    "content": "The United States has historically relied on domestic energy sources, but growing industrialization and population led to increased dependence on foreign energy in the 20th century. Federal efforts have focused on increasing energy independence, reducing consumption, and developing renewable energy sources. Many programs have been established over the past 40 years to promote energy efficiency and conservation. Many programs promoting energy efficiency and renewable sources of energy have been established over the past 40 years. These programs have been periodically reauthorized and redesigned to meet changing economic conditions and national interests. Congress has enacted several major energy laws since 2005 to establish, expand, or modify energy efficiency and renewable initiatives. The federal government has established numerous energy efficiency and renewable energy programs through various agencies such as the Department of Energy, Department of the Treasury, and Department of Agriculture. These programs provide grants, loans, and incentives for research, development, and deployment in the energy sector. The appendixes summarize incentives from various sources such as authorizing statutes, U.S. Code, and budget request documents. Funding information is also sourced from DSIRE, Assistance Listings, and Energy Star websites, as well as executive agency budget justifications and congressional reports. For more details on agriculture-related grant programs, refer to CRS Report R43416. For information on alternative fuels and engines in transportation, see CRS Report R42566. The curr_chunk discusses federal renewable energy and energy efficiency incentives, including programs such as Clean Renewable Energy Bonds and Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grants. It also mentions expired incentive programs like the Assisted Housing Stability and Energy Program. The curr_chunk lists various federal renewable energy and energy efficiency incentives and programs, including Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grants, Energy Efficient Appliance Rebate Program, and Renewable Energy Grants."
