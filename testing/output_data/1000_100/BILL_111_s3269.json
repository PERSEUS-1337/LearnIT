    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Safe Teen and Novice Driver Uniform Protection Act of 2010\" or the \"STANDUP Act.\" Congress finds that motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for Americans aged 15-20, with a high fatality rate for drivers in this age group compared to older drivers. Teenage drivers have a higher crash rate compared to drivers aged 30-60. They account for over 1/3 of fatalities in crashes they are involved in, with nearly 2/3 of the fatalities being other drivers, passengers, and pedestrians. The chance of a crash for 16-17 year old drivers doubles with 2 peers in the vehicle and quadruples with 3 or more peers. Cognitive distraction from cell phones significantly impacts driving. The use of cell phones significantly affects teenage drivers' performance, with more fatalities occurring at night. Graduated driver licensing systems have shown a decrease in crashes among 15-18 year old drivers. Studies in Michigan and North Carolina have reported a decrease in crashes involving 16-year-old drivers. Comprehensive graduated driver licensing systems were implemented in North Carolina in 1997. California's program led to a 40% decrease in teenage passenger deaths and injuries involving 16-year-old drivers. The National Transportation Safety Board reports that over 40 states have implemented 3-stage graduated driver licensing systems. Many states have not fully implemented key safety features of graduated driver licensing laws to protect teenage and novice drivers, despite widespread support for requirements such as practice driving hours, learner's permit periods, and limits on teenage passengers in cars. Many states have not fully implemented key safety features of graduated driver licensing laws to protect teenage and novice drivers. Many states lack full implementation of graduated driver licensing laws for teenage and novice drivers, requiring compliance with a 2-stage licensing process starting at 16 years old, lasting at least 6 months, and prohibiting the use of cellular phones while driving. The intermediate stage of the graduated driver licensing laws includes a 6-month duration, prohibits cell phone use while driving, driving at night, and ends either at the commencement of the next stage or when the driver turns 18. The intermediate stage of the graduated driver licensing laws includes restrictions on passengers under 21 and requires 40 hours of behind-the-wheel training with a licensed driver who is at least 21 years old during the learner's permit stage. In the intermediate stage of graduated driver licensing laws, a driver must complete a driver training course and be supervised by a licensed driver over 21 while operating a vehicle. Additionally, any individual convicted of a driving-related offense during the learner's permit or intermediate stage will have their unrestricted driver's license issuance delayed. The Secretary of Transportation will establish regulations for implementing penalties for driving-related offenses, including driving while intoxicated, misrepresentation of age, reckless driving, not wearing a seat belt, speeding, or any other offense determined by the Secretary. Incentive grants will be provided as part of the regulations established by the Secretary of Transportation for driving-related offenses. The Secretary of Transportation will award grants to compliant States for the first 3 fiscal years after the Act's enactment. States must submit an application with the Governor's certification of compliance with section 3(a) to be eligible for the grant. The Secretary will review applications to determine compliance. Amounts appropriated for this section will be used for grants. (c) Grants.--Funds appropriated for this section will be apportioned to compliant States based on a formula. States can use the grant for enforcing a 2-stage licensing process and training law enforcement personnel. The section authorizes $25,000,000 from the Highway Trust Fund for implementing the State graduated driver licensing law, including publishing educational materials and conducting administrative activities. SEC. 5. WITHHOLDING OF FUNDS FOR NONCOMPLIANCE. During the fourth fiscal year, the Secretary will withhold 3 percent of funds from states not in compliance with section 3(a). In the fifth fiscal year, the withholding increases to 5 percent. During the sixth and subsequent fiscal years, the Secretary will withhold 10 percent of funds from states not in compliance with section 3(a) on the first day of the fiscal year. The withheld funds will be available until the last day of the sixth fiscal year. Funds withheld from states not compliant with section 3(a) will be available for distribution until the end of the third fiscal year following appropriation. Any funds withheld after the sixth fiscal year cannot be distributed. If a state complies with section 3(a) before the funds expire, the Secretary of Transportation will apportion the withheld funds. The Secretary of Transportation will distribute withheld funds to states in compliance with section 3(a) until the end of the third fiscal year following appropriation. Any unspent funds will revert back to the Treasury of the United States. If any amount withheld under subsection (a) is not distributed to the State under subsection (b), it will revert back to the Treasury of the United States."
