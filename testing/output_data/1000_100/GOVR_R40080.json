    "content": "Total nonfarm employment declined steadily between December 2007 and October 2009, falling from 137,951,000 to 129,633,000, with the majority of job losses occurring after November 2008. Despite a slight increase in employment in November 2009, the number of jobs on employer payrolls decreased the following month. The goods-producing sector, including mining, construction, and manufacturing, was most affected by job losses, while some service-providing industries like education and health services continued to add workers. The financial activities industry has been losing jobs due to the collapse of the housing market, with brokerage firms and banks being negatively affected. Despite the belief that the recession ended in 2009, the rebound in jobs is not immediate according to past recession patterns. According to a CRS analysis, job growth after recessions is not immediate. It took three to five months for sustained job growth to occur in seven recoveries. Job growth was delayed until 12 months after the 1990-1991 recession and 22 months after the 2001 recession. Congress often creates jobs by increasing federal spending on infrastructure projects. Other methods like public service employment and employment tax credits are used less frequently. Public works historically includes heavy construction activities like road and bridge building. The discussion focuses on the job-generating impact of infrastructure spending, particularly in the context of green jobs related to industries utilizing renewable resources. The section examines how job creation estimates are developed and looks at different models. The section discusses how job creation estimates are developed, focusing on models for calculating nationwide and state-specific job numbers in industries like construction. It also highlights the challenges researchers face in estimating jobs from green economic activities and emphasizes caution in using these estimates. Policymakers often seek to compare stimulus options or understand the impact of shifting expenditures between federal budget categories. The text discusses how job creation estimates are developed using an input-output model of the economy, which shows the interrelationships between industries in the production process. This model is cost-effective and reflects how the dollar value of a sale is distributed across industries. The dollar value of bricks produced by the clay product and refractory manufacturing industry is used by the construction industry for residential building construction. Employment requirements are determined based on productivity estimates for each industry, reflecting both direct and indirect employment supported by economic activity. Employment requirements tables show the number of jobs per billion dollars of expenditures in a specific year. An employment requirements table shows the number of jobs supported by one billion dollars spent in different industries. It allows estimation of the impact of expenditures on various industries and the job-generating potential of different economic activities. Input-output models freeze technology and productivity at a specific point in time, leading to potential differences in job creation compared to earlier periods. Input-output models freeze technology and productivity at a specific point in time, potentially leading to differences in job creation compared to earlier periods. Estimates of job creation may vary due to technological advancements and productivity improvements over time, as well as changes in price levels affecting the purchasing power of expenditures. Actual job creation may fall short of estimates during periods of high economic activity and resource constraints. Importantly, input-output tables do not differentiate between imported and domestically produced goods, impacting the accuracy of job creation estimates. The domestic employment impact of expenditures may be overstated if inputs are imported. Input-output tables do not differentiate between full-time and part-time jobs, potentially skewing job creation estimates. A comprehensive estimate of job creation includes direct, indirect, and induced jobs throughout the economy. The multiplier effect of job creation estimates is influenced by the spending behavior of directly and indirectly employed workers. Estimates of induced jobs are uncertain due to varying economic conditions and different multipliers used in studies. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) provides estimates on the employment impact of federal spending on roads, with $1 billion supporting 27,800 jobs if no state match is required. Job numbers have decreased over time due to increases in input prices like asphalt and diesel fuel. The FHWA estimates that $1 billion of federal spending on highways supports 27,822 jobs, with construction-oriented jobs accounting for 9,536, supporting industries for 4,324, and induced jobs for 13,962. Induced jobs make up half of the total estimate. The FHWA estimates that $1 billion of federal spending on highways supports 27,822 jobs, with construction-oriented jobs accounting for 9,536, supporting industries for 4,324, and induced jobs for 13,962. The job estimate utilizes the national average mix of construction materials and labor inputs, but specific projects and local utilization ratios can alter the estimated number of jobs supported. Highway funds spend out slowly, with only 27% of a project outlaying in the first year. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics provides free access to employment requirements for assessing the impact on employment of different policies or actions. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) provides free access to employment requirements tables developed from official I-O tables by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). These tables are updated to reflect current production and distribution technologies and labor productivity. The employment requirements table referenced in the report reflects 2006 technologies and labor productivity. The BLS employment requirements table for the construction industry, composed of three major subdivisions: construction of buildings, heavy and civil engineering construction, and specialty trade contractors. 11,768 jobs are dependent upon $1 billion of construction spending, with a majority in the construction industry itself. The BLS employment requirements table for construction expenditures is lower than the direct and indirect jobs figure for highway expenditures from the FHWA. Disparities may be due to differences in industry definition, data sources, and time period. BLS does not break out other types of construction like public school construction. Former surveys estimated full-time year-long employment for various construction activities, but the data is outdated. The BEA produces estimates by geographic area through RIMS II. The BEA utilizes Input-Output Modeling System (RIMS II) to estimate employment, earnings, and output based on additional spending in various industries. These estimates are provided at the subnational level using either the 1997 benchmark I-O or the 2006 annual I-O adjusted by regional economic data. Job creation estimates vary by state due to different industry mixes and earnings levels. The challenge in estimating jobs dependent on green infrastructure activities is due to the lack of separate identification in the NAICS for green industries utilizing renewable resources. Renewable energy sources like wind, solar, and biomass are currently grouped under the \"other\" category, making it difficult to accurately measure their impact on employment and earnings at the state level. Plant material for biofuel production requires different inputs than coal and gasoline. The conventional I-O model is not suitable for estimating jobs in green activities. The construction industry lacks a category for retrofitting, which complicates job estimation. A study by the Center for American Progress addresses this issue. The researchers addressed the problem of estimating green jobs by creating synthetic industries to account for wind, solar, biomass, building retrofitting, and mass transit. They combined parts of existing industries and assigned relative weights to each for producing biomass products. Green job estimates vary due to different assumptions and time horizons used in studies. Some reports on green job estimates include assumptions about future job growth supported by a shift from coal to wind and geothermal power generation. However, the methodologies and assumptions underlying these estimates are often unclear, making it challenging to review the results. Additionally, results from studies focused on a specific state may not be applicable to other areas due to differences in state economies and industries. The September 2008 report, Green Recovery: A Program to Create Jobs and Start Building a Low-Carbon Economy, commissioned by the Center for American Progress, proposed green economy strategies to stimulate the labor market. The report estimated almost 2 million jobs could be created, with 935,200 direct jobs and 586,000 indirect jobs. The report commissioned by the Center for American Progress proposed a $100 billion \"green economic recovery program\" that could create or preserve almost 2 million jobs. This program includes federal spending on public building retrofits, mass transit expansion, and tax credits for building retrofits. The Apollo Alliance suggested strategies that can deliver results within a year, while others may take up to two years to implement. The Apollo Economic Recovery Act, proposed by a coalition of leaders, aims to create 5 million green-collar jobs over 10 years with a $500 billion program. The initiative includes federal spending of $50 billion to create or maintain over 650,000 direct jobs and 1.3 million indirect jobs. Allocation of funds includes improving the electric grid, repairing roads and bridges, and replacing aging buses and trains with clean-energy vehicles. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) requires entities receiving funds to report on the number of direct jobs created and retained by infrastructure projects. Recipients had to submit this information starting in October 2009. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) mandated recipients to report on job creation and retention from infrastructure projects, with federal agencies required to post reports online within 30 days of each quarter. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) provided guidance for preparing reports, with the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and Government Accountability Office (GAO) tasked to review job estimates. Self-reported data showed 633,342 jobs saved or retained by September 30, 2009, leading to OMB revising guidance on job retention definitions. In response to feedback, OMB revised guidance on jobs saved under ARRA to remove subjective judgment. Recipients reported 608,311 jobs funded in Q4 2009 and 682,370 in Q1 2010. CEA was tasked with reporting on ARRA's impact on employment and the economy. The CEA's mandate extends beyond reporting requirements for ARRA provisions, focusing on direct government investment spending. The first quarterly report in September 2009 estimated ARRA may have added one million jobs in August 2009. CBO was tasked with commenting on jobs created or saved by ARRA, providing further analysis in a report on the act's impact on employment and economic output as of September 2009. The CBO estimated that ARRA's tax cuts and outlay increases created between 600,000 and 1.6 million jobs by September 2009, aligning with the CEA's estimate of 1.0-1.1 million additional jobs. The CEA's second quarterly report in January 2010 suggested that the stimulus law may have raised year-end employment by about 1.7\u20131.9 million jobs. The CEA's third quarterly report in April 2010 estimated that the ARRA law might have increased employment by 2.2\u20132.8 million jobs by the first quarter of 2010. Similarly, the CBO's report for the same period suggested that ARRA's policies could have added 1.2\u20132.8 million jobs. The fourth quarterly ARRA jobs report by the CEA in July 2010 indicated that the law may have boosted employment by 2.5 million to 3.6 million jobs in the second quarter of 2010. The CEA estimated that public investment outlays under ARRA could have increased total employment by over 627,000 jobs in the first quarter of 2010 and by over 800,000 jobs in the second quarter of the year."
