    "content": "The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include a new section on Instructional Level Assessment Pilot Program. This program aims to assess students' instructional levels. The Secretary will award grants to up to ten State educational agencies for pilot programs to assess students with disabilities below grade-level proficiency and provide quality instruction. Grants will be for a 3-year period, and States must apply to be eligible. The Secretary will award grants to State educational agencies for pilot programs assessing students with disabilities below grade-level proficiency. Agencies must demonstrate the development of alternate assessments, provide guidance to participating local education agencies, and identify a minimum of 5 districts for the pilot. The pilot program will focus on selecting students, using valid assessment tools, and collecting data. Participating agencies must have implemented a response to intervention approach and ensure monitoring and oversight. The pilot program under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act focuses on identifying students for participation, limiting participation to 0.5% of the student population, ensuring the appropriateness of the alternate assessment, and obtaining parental consent before assessment. The pilot program ensures students receive quality instruction in grade-level content and requires the IEP Team to assess if a student is performing significantly below their current grade level in reading or math. The pilot program requires the use of scientifically-valid assessments at the student's instructional level in reading and math. The IEP Team must develop interventions to address identified gaps in the student's knowledge. Data from these assessments cannot be used to determine if a student meets proficiency levels. The pilot program mandates the use of valid assessments at the student's instructional level in reading and math. Local education agencies must compile reports on student progress towards grade level proficiency using alternate or regular academic achievement standards. State education agencies also participate in the program. The pilot program requires State education agencies to submit annual reports on student participation and progress towards closing the gap between instructional and grade level proficiency. The Secretary will use the data to inform a report to Congress on student outcomes before and after participation in the pilot. $5,000,000 is authorized for grants in fiscal year 2008."
