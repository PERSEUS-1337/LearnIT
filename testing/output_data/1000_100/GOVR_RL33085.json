    "content": "\"Services\" encompass a wide range of economic activities involving human value-added like labor, advice, and entertainment. They are intangible, must be consumed at the point of production, but technology is reducing these restrictions. Examples include retail trade, transportation, information, banking, education, and professional services. The service sector in the U.S. economy includes banking, insurance, professional services, education, arts, healthcare, food services, construction, communication, and public administration. In 2010, services accounted for 83% of nonagricultural jobs and 65% of GDP. Financial services are crucial for capital flow, while delivery and distribution services ensure goods availability. Distribution services play a crucial role in making goods available to consumers, with inefficiencies in this industry potentially impacting the economy. In 2010, services accounted for a significant portion of U.S. exports and imports, with many service providers needing a presence in the consumer's country for direct contact. Hotel, restaurant, legal, accounting, and construction services are examples of industries that prefer a direct presence for access to expert knowledge of local laws and regulations. In 2008, U.S. firms sold $1,137 billion in services to foreigners through their majority-owned foreign affiliates, while foreign firms sold U.S. residents $727 billion in services through their majority-owned foreign affiliates located in the United States. These figures provide a more accurate measurement of trade in services compared to cross-border trade data. The Trade Act of 1974 instructed the Administration to promote an agreement on trade in services under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) during the Tokyo Round negotiations. Developing countries were reluctant to have services covered by the agreement. During the Uruguay Round negotiations launched in 1986, GATT members agreed to new rules for services under the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) and established the World Trade Organization (WTO) to administer the agreements. Trade scholar Geza Feketekuty identified three main challenges in creating rules for international trade in services. The challenges in creating rules for international trade in services include the need for flexibility to address technology advances like the internet, the recognition that most services transactions occur inside borders, and the importance of considering barriers to trade within customs borders. Effective trade rules must be flexible yet provide meaningful discipline to WTO members' activities. The GATS divides modes of delivery of services into four categories: Cross-border supply (mode 1), Consumption abroad (mode 2), and two other modes. For example, in mode 1, a U.S. architectural firm in Chicago designs a building for a client in Mexico and sends the blueprints. The GATS outlines different modes of service delivery, including cross-border supply, consumption abroad, commercial presence, and presence of natural persons. It is an agreement among 153 WTO members aimed at promoting economic trade expansion in services. The GATS aims to promote economic development through trade expansion and progressive liberalization while preserving governments' right to regulate services. It is divided into six parts, with Part I defining its scope and application to all services and government barriers. Part II outlines principles and obligations that apply to all service sectors, regardless of being listed in a member's commitments schedule. Part II of the GATS includes principles like most-favored-nation treatment, transparency, impartial administration of rules, and obligations for monopoly suppliers. It also allows for exceptions like temporary trade restrictions for balance of payments issues and national security concerns. The GATS Part III establishes market access and national treatment obligations for members, binding each member to its commitments. It prohibits less favorable treatment than committed, limits on foreign service suppliers, and requires national treatment for service providers. Members can negotiate further reductions in trade barriers. The GATS Part III imposes market access and national treatment obligations on members, applying only to listed services and modes of delivery in each member's schedule of commitments. This positive list approach excludes services sectors not included in the schedule. Parts IV-VI contain technical but crucial elements of the agreement. The GATS Part IV-VI contain technical elements such as requirements for new negotiations, handling conflicts, and annexes on various services. Negotiations were not completed, but signatories did not want to delay the rest of the Uruguay Round agreements. The GATS stipulated negotiations on financial services, telecommunication services, maritime services, and mode-4 delivery. Agreements were reached on basic telecommunications in February 1997 and financial services in December 1997. Negotiations on mode-4 ended in July 1995 with few results, and negotiations on maritime services ended in June 1996 without conclusion. WTO members' commitments on national treatment and market access in specific service sectors are a significant part of their obligations under the GATS and the Doha Development Agenda round. Each WTO member submits a Schedule of Commitments (SC) during negotiations, with new members required to submit one upon accession. The SC is part of the GATS and is more complex than tariff schedules, divided into four columns detailing sector commitments, market access restrictions, national treatment restrictions, and additional commitments. The Schedule of Commitments (SC) in the GATS is a detailed document submitted by WTO members during negotiations. It includes horizontal commitments for trade liberalization across all service sectors and sector-specific commitments. The SCs are lengthy due to the need to specify market access and national treatment exceptions for each service sector and subsector. The objectives of negotiations on services in the DDA are to reform GATS rules and expand commitments to include more service sectors. The GATS requires WTO members to refine and expand their commitments on service sectors, reducing limitations on national treatment and market access. Negotiations on services began after the Uruguay Round, with a focus on resolving conceptual and procedural issues, such as providing special treatment to least developed countries. The GATS mandates negotiations on government subsidies, emergency safeguard measures, and government procurement in services trade. The new services negotiations started in 2000 but progressed slowly due to political issues. In March 2001, the WTO's Council for Trade in Services approved guidelines for the current negotiations, focusing on progressive liberalization. The main objective of the GATS negotiations is the progressive liberalization of trade in services to promote economic growth and development. All service sectors and delivery modes are subject to negotiations, with a focus on special needs of developing countries. Negotiations are conducted in special sessions of the Council for Trade in Services using the \"request-offer\" format for new commitments. The WTO members adopted modalities on September 3, 2003, focusing on special needs of developing countries. Negotiations include giving credit for autonomous liberalization in trade barriers on services. The DDA round was successfully launched in November 2001 after a false start in Seattle. The Ministerial Declaration included deadlines to spur negotiators to submit initial requests for market access and national treatment commitments. The DDA negotiations faced challenges with services negotiations floundering as deadlines passed. Member countries struggled to agree on modalities for agriculture and non-agricultural market access at the September 2003 Ministerial in Cancun. A negotiating framework was established in July 2004 to put the round back on track, emphasizing the submission of initial and revised offers of \"high quality.\" The DDA negotiations emphasized the need for \"high quality\" offers in response to complaints from WTO officials. Services were mentioned briefly in the July framework, placing them on par with agriculture and market access negotiations. Working groups handle negotiations on rules, while national treatment and market access commitments are addressed by all members using the request-offer format. Each member submits a \"wish-list\" or \"request\" for commitments from other members to make, followed by responses from each member. The negotiations in the WTO for services involve members making commitment offers through a request-offer format. These negotiations consist of bilateral, plurilateral, and multilateral discussions among members. The final agreements must be accepted by all members to become part of the GATS. Despite ongoing negotiations for over five years, progress has been slow with missed deadlines and disappointing results. The WTO negotiations for market access have been slow with missed deadlines and disappointing results. In 2006, the DDA negotiations were suspended due to disagreements on agriculture trade modalities. Despite efforts to reach a consensus on negotiating objectives, major countries have not succeeded. The United States outlined its goals for the DDA Round in 2002, but progress has been challenging. The United States has outlined its goals for the DDA negotiations, aiming to secure market access commitments from trading partners and address concerns about market openness levels. Government regulation plays a significant role in services trade. Regulation in services trade is more prevalent than in goods trade in developed and developing economies. GATS rules acknowledge the need for government regulation to ensure consumer health and safety. Different agencies regulate various service sectors, leading to a lack of transparency in regulatory procedures, which is a major obstacle for U.S. service providers. The lack of transparency in regulations is a key obstacle to increasing foreign trade in services, especially in developing countries. The United States is pushing for WTO members to establish clear domestic procedures for licensing, inform the public of regulations before final approval, and allow for public input during the development and implementation of regulations. U.S. service providers emphasize the importance of having a local presence to conduct business. The United States is urging WTO members to eliminate restrictions on foreign direct investment across all sectors, including in financial services like insurance, banking, and securities. They are also requesting commitments to improve market access, transparency, and fairness in applying regulations. Specifically, the US proposed initiatives to expedite new-to-market insurance services and increase market access in telecommunications services. The United States has requested market access commitments for owning and leasing cable facilities, increased access for various services including road freight transport and express delivery services, and addressing cross-subsidization of express delivery services. They have also requested increased market access in energy-related services markets. The United States has requested trading partners to provide increased access to markets for energy services, environmental protection services, and retail, wholesale, and franchising services. This includes commitments regarding third-party access to energy transportation facilities and full market access for various environment-related areas. The United States has requested increased market access for various services, including higher education, training, testing, professional services, and computer services. This involves removing citizenship requirements for licensing, foreign ownership restrictions, restrictions on form of organization, and associations with local professionals. The United States has requested increased market access for computer and related services, audiovisual, and advertising services. Initial and revised offers were submitted in 2003 and 2005 respectively, committing to maintain national treatment and market access for foreign service providers. The United States defends its offers in trade liberalization, stating its services markets are already open and seeking WTO members to meet its standards. U.S. services industries are competitive and can withstand foreign competition. The U.S. offers include horizontal commitments for all sectors listed in its schedule, such as temporary entry of personnel. Some U.S. WTO-trading partners have concerns about the U.S. offers. The United States allows temporary entry of personnel for specific groups working for foreign firms with affiliates in the U.S., including sales persons, inter-corporate transferees, personnel establishing a business entity, fashion models, and service providers in specialty occupations. Personnel engaged in land acquisition in scheduled services sectors are also permitted entry. The United States restricts the initial acquisition of federally owned land to U.S. citizens. Foreigners providing scheduled services are taxed similarly to U.S. residents, with exceptions. The U.S. has made commitments in various sectors such as business services, market research, and management consulting, with exceptions mainly related to state restrictions on foreign service providers. WTO members must identify national treatment and market access exceptions for each sector and subsector. The United States has made commitments in various sectors such as market research, management consulting, real estate services, agriculture services, telecommunication services, wholesale and retail trade services, higher education, environmental services, financial services, health and social services, travel and tourism, transportation services, energy services, and construction services. Developing countries have criticized the U.S. for not offering broader commitments in these sectors. The United States has faced criticism for not offering to open maritime and postal services to foreign competition. Developing countries and some developed countries have focused their criticism on U.S. commitments under the mode-4 category of delivery, particularly for restricting access to business executives and personnel with ties to foreign companies. India argues for access for software specialists and IT engineers not affiliated with Indian-owned firms in the U.S. (Mode-4 is a contentious issue in the DDA negotiations). The negotiations for the DDA have faced delays, with deadlines for procedural steps being rescheduled. The \"request-offer\" format is seen as a possible obstacle, with the US and EU proposing sector-specific benchmarks for commitments. The US focused on six core sectors, while the EU suggested a smaller list for members to choose from. The EU proposed a smaller list for members to choose commitments from core sectors for all delivery modes. Developing countries opposed the \"benchmark\" proposals, arguing it deviates from the established mandate for DDA negotiations. The US services business community expressed concerns that focusing on benchmarks could cause delays. Canada, supported by the US and other developed countries, suggested alternatives. Canada, supported by the United States and other developed countries, proposed changes in the negotiating process to boost services negotiations. The proposal aimed to address frustrations with the current sequencing of negotiations. Developing countries rejected the proposal and criticized the positive list approach for market access commitments. The primary criticism of the negotiating process is that it could hinder market access liberalization by not covering sectors unless specifically identified. The \"negative list\" approach preferred by the United States has caused division between developed and developing countries, particularly regarding mode-4 delivery. Developing countries have criticized the United States on this issue. The controversy surrounding mode-4 delivery in the United States has led to tension between the U.S. business community and government, despite it accounting for less than 1% of world trade in services. Mode-4 is closely related to immigration policy and has become a point of contention following the September 11, 2001 attacks. The GATS defines mode-4 as the supply of a service by a service supplier through the presence of natural persons in another Member's territory. Several developing countries, including India, have criticized the United States for visa restrictions on temporary workers entering the country. Mode-4 issue has become a point of contention in congressional authority during the consideration of implementing bills for free trade agreements. The United States faced criticism from developing countries for visa restrictions on temporary workers. Compromises were made to separate visa policy changes from trade legislation, with warnings against including them in trade agreements. The U.S. business community advocated for more flexibility in mode-4 offers to progress negotiations. Little progress was made on establishing rules for subsidies and emergency safeguard measures for services. Developing countries, particularly in East Asia, emphasized the need for fair trade agreements. Negotiations on subsidies and emergency safeguard measures for services have been slow, with little progress made in defining countervailable subsidies and measuring import surges. A World Bank assessment found that many WTO members, especially developing countries, have not significantly improved their offers since the Uruguay Round, resulting in services markets that are more restrictive than their actual policies. Negotiations on services have been slow, with WTO members hesitant to lock in trade policies, preferring the option to apply more restrictions. The DDA was suspended in 2006 due to disagreements among key members, leading to sluggish progress in services negotiations. Developed countries are divided on the issue, contributing to the lack of advancement. The lack of progress in services negotiations at the WTO can be attributed to the division between developed and developing countries, slow agriculture and NAMA negotiations, and disagreements over reducing subsidies and market liberalization commitments. The lack of progress in services negotiations at the WTO is due to the complexity of the agenda, diverse trade barriers across sectors, and the involvement of multiple participants including regulatory agencies. Evaluating the prospects for the negotiations is challenging as participants often wait until crucial deadlines to reveal their negotiating positions. The WTO services negotiations face delays due to various factors such as political will, willingness to compromise, and unresolved issues in agriculture and market access. The sixth WTO Ministerial in Hong Kong aimed to accelerate DDA negotiations with a focus on developing countries' needs. In September 2007, the chairman of the trade in services negotiations started developing a draft text of an agreement. By the end of 2007, countries were divided on objectives, with developed countries pushing for binding commitments on trade in services while developing countries resisted without greater reductions in agriculture subsidies. WTO General Director Lamy called a ministerial meeting in July 2008 to address the impasse. In 2008, WTO General Director Lamy organized a ministerial meeting in Geneva to discuss agriculture and NAMA negotiations. A \"signaling\" conference was held in July 2008 with 32 representatives, including the US and EU, to gauge offers and expectations. Despite some areas of possible commitment, negotiations did not progress. In 2009, WTO members held \"cluster\" meetings with limited results. Little progress was made in services negotiations in 2010 due to reluctance to go beyond current levels of liberalization. Senator Charles Grassley expressed concern about the stalled Doha services negotiations and emphasized the need for a strong services package to gain his support for an agreement during Michael Punke's confirmation hearing as deputy USTR."
