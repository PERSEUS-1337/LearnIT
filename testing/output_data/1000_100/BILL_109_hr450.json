The Congress emphasizes the importance of maintaining the US's position in science and technology for advancing human understanding and improving lives. Over half of the US economic growth is attributed to research and development in science and technology. The United States emphasizes the importance of advancing human understanding and improving lives through science and technology. Applied research applies answers from basic science to everyday problems, promoting economic growth. Education is critical for developing intellectual capital, including scientists and engineers for research and development. The United States emphasizes the importance of research and development for economic growth. It requires technologically proficient workers and scientifically literate voters. Student performance in math and science shows shortcomings in K-12 education compared to other countries, calling for new teaching methods. Improved teaching methods in mathematics and science, along with enhanced curricula and teacher training, are essential. Parental involvement is crucial. Science is a process of inquiry based on observations and data, leading to understanding the universe through concepts and theories. Students should learn science by doing, with education being experiment-centered and concept-based. Early and continuous science education is important to nurture children's natural curiosity. Teachers play a vital role in students' learning by connecting them to the content. It is crucial to recruit high-quality teachers who are respected, well-trained, and motivated by incentives for career advancement. Teacher training is essential for superior results, requiring knowledge of the content, curriculum, research, and effective teaching techniques. SEC. 3.
