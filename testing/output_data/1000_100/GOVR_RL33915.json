    "content": "The Bush Administration released The Budget of the U.S. Government, Fiscal Year 2008 on February 5, 2007, as required by law. The budget documents provide detailed information on budget estimates, historical data, policy proposals, and economic forecasts for FY2007 through FY2012. Limited information is also included for FY2012 through FY2017. The documents discuss budget policies for FY2012 through FY2017, long-term fiscal issues, historical data on appropriations, outlays, and revenues. The congressional budget process begins with the Administration's budget submission to Congress. Congress adopted the FY2008 budget resolution conference report and started considering appropriation bills shortly after. The House and Senate passed various appropriations bills for FY2007, with the Senate failing to pass all bills by September 30. A continuing resolution was passed to fund the government until November 16. Congress approved the Defense bill providing $459 billion in budget authority, which the President signed after vetoing the Labor-HHS-Education bill. The President vetoed many appropriation bills due to funding levels or policy disagreements, complicating the process. Congress passed multiple funding extensions and an omnibus appropriations bill, with the President signing a continuing resolution to fund government operations through the end of the year. The President signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of FY2008, providing $555 billion in discretionary budget authority. Budget estimates for FY2008 from CBO, OMB, and Congress can vary due to different assumptions and techniques. Estimates are expected to change with new data or economic conditions. The FY2008 budget report projected a baseline deficit of $98 billion, down from $172 billion in FY2007. The CBO baseline showed a surplus of $170 billion in FY2012 and $249 billion in FY2017, based on assumptions set by law. Key assumptions include constant discretionary spending, expiration of tax cuts after 2010, and lapsing of the AMT \"patch\". The FY2008 budget projected a baseline deficit of $98 billion, decreasing from $172 billion in FY2007. The CBO baseline forecasted surpluses in FY2012 and FY2017, assuming tax cuts expire after 2010. Future deficits are expected due to the retirement of the baby boom generation and rising healthcare costs. CBO's report includes estimated budgetary effects of policies like making the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts permanent and indexing the AMT for inflation. In FY2008, CBO projected a deficit of $226 billion, lower than the President's budget estimate of $239 billion. By FY2012, CBO forecasted a deficit of $31 billion, contrasting with the Administration's expected surplus of $61 billion. The difference in forecasts is mainly due to medium-term projection uncertainties. CBO's cumulative deficit estimate for 2008-2012 based on the President's proposals was $790 billion. In 2012, CBO's deficit estimate based on the President's proposals was $790 billion, while the President's budget had a net deficit estimate of $514 billion. President Bush's FY2008 budget aimed to extend and make permanent tax cuts, reducing estimated receipts by almost $600 billion between FY2008 and FY2012. Administration proposals would reduce mandatory spending by $96 billion over five years and $309 billion over 10 years. The Administration's proposed policy changes aim to reduce mandatory spending by $309 billion over 10 years, including the introduction of personal Social Security accounts. The budget estimates savings of $59 billion over five years and increases of $359 billion over 10 years. Limited information is provided for years beyond FY2012 in the budget. The President proposed eliminating, reducing, or reforming about 141 programs, affecting both discretionary and mandatory spending. Administration estimates showed a $22 billion cut in budget authority for FY2008 compared to FY2007. The Mid-Session Review in July featured the same proposals as the President's FY2008 budget, with a $19 billion higher deficit estimate. Technical reestimates, economic changes, and minor policy differences account for the changes in the budget outlook. The increase in the cumulative five-year deficit estimate from $514 billion to $651 billion in the Mid-Session Review was mainly due to fast growth in Medicare and Medicaid spending. Rising healthcare prices and hospital patient volumes drove the spending rates. CBO analyzes FY2008 appropriations by estimating new budget authority and outlays for non-emergency and emergency spending, comparing them with 302(b) allocations. Emergency spending is treated differently in budget legislation. The FY2008 appropriations legislation provided $932,847 million in nonemergency discretionary budget authority, matching the President's request. Non-defense discretionary budget authority was slightly higher than defense discretionary budget authority. The McConnell Amendment included an additional $70 billion in emergency funding for wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Senate budget resolution specified expenditures and revenues for a FY2008 deficit estimated at $249 billion. The Senate budget resolution proposed higher discretionary spending levels than the President's proposal. It also aimed to extend expiring tax cuts if offset by lost revenues. Amendments reduced the expected FY2012 surplus to $1 billion. The House Budget resolution was expected to yield a FY2008 deficit of $213 billion and a FY2012 surplus of $153 billion. The House, Senate, and President's budget proposals all aim for a balanced budget in FY2012, with assumptions that raise skepticism among analysts. They anticipate minimal military funding post-FY2008 and increased AMT impact on middle-income taxpayers. The President's budget assumes little to no growth in discretionary spending over five years, while the House and Senate budget resolutions anticipate the expiration of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts unless offset by other revenue gains or spending reductions, leading to a significant increase in tax revenues after 2010. Budget projections are uncertain, with measures of forecast quality including statistical unbiasedness and accuracy. Budget forecasts are unique in that they estimate the costs of policy changes in a consistent manner. Budget projections are influenced by policy changes, economic conditions, and technical factors. The accuracy of forecasts is measured by OMB and CBO. Changes in economic conditions, such as growth and inflation, impact budget estimates. Budget models reflect assumptions about the economy, tax changes, and other factors. Technical components of budget models may evolve with the economy. Stable trends, like population growth, also play a role in budget estimates. Budget estimates are influenced by stable trends like population demographics, with factors such as future productivity growth and business cycles being difficult to predict. Small changes in economic conditions can have a significant impact on budget estimates, with a 0.1% decrease in real GDP growth rate leading to a $61 billion increase in the deficit over five years. Faster GDP growth would decrease the deficit or increase a surplus. Financial market trends can also affect federal revenues, with volatile changes in economic conditions producing large budget estimate variations. The President's FY2008 budget includes measures to analyze the accuracy of previous forecasts, with the accuracy of forecasts declining as the forecast window extends. OMB analyzed a quarter century of budget estimates and found that the standard deviation for the current fiscal year was $71 billion, while the five-years-ahead forecast had a standard deviation of $289 billion. The OMB analyzed budget estimates and found that the Administration's $61 billion point estimate for the FY2012 surplus is imprecise. CBO also analyzes forecast accuracy and provides explanations for differences in projections. The Senate Budget Committee reported its version of the FY2008 budget resolution. The House Budget Committee reported its version of the FY2008 budget resolution, which was debated and passed on March 29. Both the House and Senate appointed conferees in early May to resolve differences, reaching an agreement on May 16. The conference set FY2008 discretionary spending at $954 billion. The conference agreement for FY2008 set discretionary spending at $954 billion, exceeding the President's request. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees worked on drafting the appropriations bills, with most bills approved by mid-July. By the end of FY2007, the House had passed all 12 appropriations bills, while the Senate had passed four, with three more passed in October. Congress approved the Labor-HHS-Education and Defense bills in November, which the President vetoed. During FY2007, Congress passed various appropriations bills, including the Labor-HHS-Education bill and the Defense bill. The President vetoed the former but signed the latter. A continuing resolution was passed to fund government operations until November 16, which was extended multiple times until December 19. On December 19, Congress passed an omnibus appropriations bill (H.R. 2764) incorporating 10 regular appropriations bills. A fourth continuing resolution (H.J.Res. 72) was also passed, funding government operations through the end of the year. The President signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of FY2008 (P.L. 110-161) on December 26, providing $555 billion in discretionary budget authority. Administration's budget proposed FY2008 outlays of $2,902 billion, above the CBO baseline. Both Administration and CBO issued future federal outlay projections. The Administration's FY2008 budget proposed $2,902 billion in outlays, rising to $3,246 billion in FY2012. The proposals would boost funding for defense and homeland security spending, hold non-defense discretionary spending to a 1% annual increase, and slow the growth in some mandatory programs. Total mandatory spending would increase, with a $30 billion increase for Social Security in FY2012. If adopted, the proposals would raise outlays by $118 billion above the FY2007 estimate, increasing total outlays by 16.6% between FY2007 and FY2012. The proposed FY2008 budget includes a $150 billion increase in outlays, with additional funding for security activities, mainly for defense, homeland security, and foreign affairs. There is also a $8 billion increase for non-security discretionary spending and a $10 billion reduction in mandatory spending compared to baseline levels. Net interest payments are projected to increase by $7 billion in FY2008 due to increased federal borrowing. The Administration's proposals aim to reduce outlays as a percentage of GDP from 20.2% in FY2007 to 20.0% in FY2008, with projections showing a further decrease to 18.3% by FY2012. Non-defense discretionary spending is expected to decrease by 0.7% of GDP over five years, while defense spending is projected to fall by 1.1% of GDP. Mandatory programs are set to increase their share of GDP by 0.3%, and both Medicare and Medicaid are expected to grow slightly as percentages of GDP despite proposed cuts in their growth. The Administration's budget proposes to increase defense spending by 6.0% from FY2007 to FY2008, with a projected decrease to $546 billion by FY2012. Non-defense discretionary spending is set to fall from $511 billion in FY2007 to $493 billion in FY2012. The Administration aims to reduce outlays as a percentage of GDP, with defense spending projected to decrease by 1.1% of GDP. Non-defense discretionary spending is set to decrease from $511 billion in FY2007 to $493 billion in FY2012, dropping as a percentage of GDP from 3.7% to 2.8%. The Administration plans to achieve reductions in mandatory spending by slowing the growth of activities like Medicare and Medicaid, aiming to reduce total mandatory spending by almost $60 billion over five years. Mandatory spending is projected to total $1,100 billion, growing from $1,465 billion in FY2007 to $1,923 billion in FY2012. Net interest outlays are expected to rise significantly, with proposed outlays exceeding baseline estimates by billions of dollars. Higher debt levels will lead to increased net interest payments according to Administration estimates. According to Administration estimates, net interest payments as a percentage of GDP will remain stable between 1.6% and 1.8% over the next five years. CBO projections suggest that federal outlays would increase by $1.55 trillion if discretionary spending grows with the economy, but decrease by $1.65 trillion if spending remains at FY2007 levels. Defense spending is projected to rise from $547 billion in FY2007 to $599 billion in FY2008, with baseline estimates showing it increasing to $684 billion in FY2012 and $773 billion in FY2017. As a percentage of GDP, defense spending is expected to decrease gradually over the next 10 years. Alternative scenarios, such as troop withdrawals from Iraq and Afghanistan, would result in lower spending trajectories. CBO projects that withdrawing troops from Iraq and Afghanistan would significantly reduce discretionary spending and interest costs. Withdrawal of 30,000 troops by 2010 could save $1.25 trillion, while withdrawing 75,000 troops by 2013 could save $750 billion over FY2008-FY2017. Non-defense discretionary spending is expected to increase from $495 billion in FY2007 to $619 billion in FY2017, with a decrease in percentage of GDP from 3.6% in FY2007 to 2.9% in FY2017 according to CBO projections. The CBO and Administration projections show discretionary spending's relative size shrinking over time, with mandatory spending projected to increase to $2,598 billion by FY2017. Mandatory spending as a share of GDP is expected to reach 12.1% in FY2017. Net interest is projected to grow from $235 billion in FY2007 to $253 billion in FY2008 according to CBO baseline estimates. The CBO baseline projections show a growth in net interest payments from $235 billion in FY2007 to $253 billion in FY2008. Projected surpluses in FY2012 and beyond would reduce federal debt, leading to a decrease in net interest payments. The Senate Budget Committee's FY2008 budget resolution proposed increasing outlays from $2,927 billion in FY2008 to $3,229 billion in FY2012, with defense funding matching the President's request but domestic spending exceeding the Administration's proposal. The Senate passed the resolution with amendments on March 23, with outlays close to the committee's version. The House Budget Committee reported its version on March 23, and the House passed it with no changes on March 29. The resolution would provide $2,933 billion in outlays in FY2008, rising to $3,252 billion in FY2012. The conference agreement included $2,937 billion in FY2008 outlays, with projected outlays rising to $3,255 billion in FY2012. Spending by category as percentages of GDP showed little difference from previous budgets. The Administration's proposals from FY2007 through FY2012 project a decline in defense and non-defense spending as a share of GDP, with mandatory spending increasing. The President's proposed reductions in mandatory spending would keep it stable as a share of GDP, but the introduction of private Social Security accounts in FY2012 would lift mandatory spending above current levels. The President's proposed budget includes reductions in discretionary spending and moderate growth in mandatory programs, leading to a decrease in spending as a percentage of GDP by FY2012. However, the introduction of private Social Security accounts in FY2012 would increase mandatory spending above current levels. The Mid-Session Review (MSR) shows outlays slightly above the February budget due to reestimation, not policy changes. The alternative estimate assumes discretionary appropriations and troop levels will increase, leading to higher outlays, deficits, federal debt, and net interest payments. The alternative estimate projects higher outlays as a percentage of GDP over 10 years, mainly due to increased net interest payments. Forecasts for federal receipts are uncertain beyond the short term, with recent years showing unexpected growth that is not expected to continue. Receipts increased significantly from FY2003 to FY2006, following three years of decline. Receipts as a percentage of GDP rose from 16.3% in FY2004 to 18.4% in FY2006. OMB's projections showed little variation in receipts as a share of GDP from FY2008 to FY2012. CBO's baseline forecasted receipts to reach 19.8% of GDP in FY2012 after the expiration of tax cuts. The President's proposals aimed to extend and make permanent most of the expiring tax cuts, leading to a decrease in receipts as a percentage of GDP. The Administration estimated that making the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts permanent would reduce cumulative receipts by $374 billion from baseline levels between FY2008 and FY2012 and by $1,617 billion between FY2008 and FY2017. The effect of these and other Administration proposals for receipts would reduce receipts from baseline levels by an estimated $599 billion in the first five years and by $1,854 billion over 10 years. The budget included proposed relief from the expanding coverage of the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) through FY2008, but not in subsequent years. The Administration's budget proposals included extending relief from the alternative minimum tax (AMT) for FY2007 and FY2008. Receipts from FY2007 through FY2012 show stable social insurance receipts and a decline in individual income taxes compared to FY2000 levels. Corporate income taxes stabilize near 2% of GDP under the Administration's projection. Excise and other receipts remain less than 1% of GDP for all years shown. The FY2008 budget estimated that temporary AMT \"fixes\" would cost $9.1 billion in FY2007 and $47.9 billion in FY2008, with indexing AMT thresholds for inflation costing about $55 billion a year over the next 10 years. The President's budget aimed to limit the reach of the AMT but omitted cost estimates, potentially increasing federal receipts by $50 billion to $60 billion a year. Total receipts in the budget are expected to remain near their 40-year average of 18.3% of GDP. CBO's baseline revenue estimates project an increase to over 19.8% of GDP in FY2012 and 20.1% in FY2017. Extending expiring tax cuts would reduce revenues by $418 billion over five years and $1,937 billion over 10 years. Limiting the AMT expansion alone would decrease revenues by $280 billion over five years and $570 billion over 10 years. The CBO's March 2007 budget report analyzed the President's FY2008 policy proposals, showing slightly lower revenues than the President's budget over five years. The revenue differences were mainly due to economic assumptions, with CBO's estimates being $479 billion smaller than the cumulative revenue baseline estimates. The President's budget projected $14,826 billion in cumulative revenues over five years, while CBO's reestimates put it at $14,524 billion, 2% less. The March report presented revised revenue baseline estimates that differed slightly from CBO's January estimates. Modifying CBO's baseline revenue estimates by using alternative policy assumptions results in slower growth in receipts, both in dollars and as a share of GDP. The alternative estimate assumes extensions of expiring tax cuts and an annual adjustment to the AMT. This interaction effect leads to greater revenue losses, with receipts falling to approximately 17.5% of GDP by FY2012. CBO estimates $70 billion less revenue in FY2008 and $389 billion less by FY2012 compared to the baseline. The House and Senate budget resolutions require revenue changes to be offset to prevent deficit growth or surplus decline. The conference agreement allows for extending expiring tax cuts under certain conditions and offsetting revenue losses. Historical and projected federal receipts as a percentage of GDP are shown in Figure 4. Federal receipts for FY2000 through FY2006 are compared to projections from CBO and the President's budget reports for FY2008-2012. Receipts averaged 18.3% of GDP from FY1966-FY2006. Estimates for FY2009-2010 are close, with CBO projecting a rise to slightly above 19% of GDP by FY2017. The Administration's revenue estimates show little variation over five years, with OMB projecting slightly larger receipts than the February budget. Both sets of estimates assume tax cuts are extended. The OMB estimates assume tax cuts are extended and limited AMT expansion, showing receipts falling as a share of GDP after FY2008. Deficits occur when spending exceeds receipts, increasing government debt. Surpluses reduce debt and interest payments, with economists favoring surpluses during strong economic growth. The last surplus was in FY2001 at $128 billion or 1.3% of GDP. The government last ran a surplus in FY2001, amounting to $128 billion or 1.3% of GDP. The FY2007 total deficit was $163 billion, slightly below CBO's estimate. The on-budget deficit, excluding Social Security and Postal Service surpluses, was $344 billion. The President's budget proposed a deficit of $239 billion for FY2008 and a small surplus in FY2012. Surpluses were projected to appear in FY2010 according to the Administration's baseline estimates. The FY2007 deficit fell slightly compared to previous estimates. The FY2007 deficit fell slightly while the FY2008 deficit grew slightly compared to the estimates in the President's FY2008 budget. The MSR deficit estimates in subsequent years remain slightly larger than those in the original budget, reaching a small surplus in FY2012. The Administration aims to achieve deficit reduction goals through limits on discretionary spending growth and slower entitlement spending growth, without resorting to tax increases. According to CBO's January 2007 baseline estimates, the federal deficit is projected to decrease through FY2011 and surpluses are expected from FY2012 to FY2017. The baseline assumes no fix to the AMT and the expiration of tax cuts in 2010, leading to increased revenues. Discretionary spending is projected to grow at the rate of inflation, while mandatory spending will increase with eligible populations and cost-of-living adjustments. Alternative assumptions show a less optimistic fiscal outlook. The assumptions in alternative scenarios for policy outlooks differ from the CBO baseline projections, leading to a growing deficit from FY2007 to FY2017. These alternative policies include limiting the AMT coverage, extending tax cuts, and increasing discretionary spending in line with GDP growth. The deficit is projected to increase from 1.7% of GDP in FY2008 to 3.6% of GDP in FY2017 under these policies. CBO's analysis in March 2007 projected larger deficits than the Administration for subsequent years. In FY2012, CBO projected a small deficit (0.3% of GDP), while the Administration projected a surplus. The House- and Senate-passed budget resolutions included deficits similar to the President's budget. The difference in surpluses between the resolutions is due to different policy assumptions. The conference agreement on the budget resolution had a deficit of $252 billion in FY2008, becoming a surplus of $41 billion in FY2012. Figure 5 shows deficit or surplus estimates as shares of GDP for FY2007 through FY2017. The data for FY2007-FY2017 are based on estimates and projections by CBO and OMB. The President's policy proposals included increased defense spending, tight controls on domestic discretionary spending, and changes to Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. The proposed defense budget only included minimal war funding in FY2009. Projections show a rapid decline in the deficit, with a potential surplus in FY2012. The OMB and CBO projections in Figure 5 show an improving federal fiscal situation, with deficits falling in proportion to the economy. However, an alternative CBO projection based on different policy assumptions depicts a steady deterioration in fiscal conditions, with the deficit reaching 3.6% of GDP by FY2017. This outlook is less optimistic than the baseline projections. OMB, CBO, and GAO all agree that current federal fiscal policies are unsustainable in the long term. The current mix of federal fiscal policies is unsustainable due to the nation's aging population and rising healthcare costs. This leads to constantly rising deficits and a federal debt burden that spirals out of control. Keeping future federal outlays at 20% of GDP would require drastic reductions in spending, except for Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid. By 2030, spending for these programs is projected to reach roughly 15% of GDP. The CBO report on the long-term fiscal outlook warns that the United States will face challenges in managing fiscal policy due to the retirement of the baby-boom generation. The aging population, combined with rising healthcare costs, will lead to a growing demand for resources to finance mandatory programs like Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. Achieving fiscal stability in the future will likely require significant spending cuts and possibly higher taxes. The Administration is concerned about the long-term budget outlook due to the growing burden of major entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. By 2050, spending on these programs is projected to exceed 15% of GDP. Estimates show different challenges for Social Security and Medicare in terms of long-term fiscal gaps. The long-term budget outlook is sensitive to assumptions about productivity growth, interest rates, and medical inflation for Medicare and Medicaid. Unexpected events like natural disasters or economic downturns can impact short-term budget projections. The retirement of the baby boom generation will increase the population eligible for federal programs for the elderly, affecting the long-term budget outlook. The increasing population eligible for federal programs serving the elderly, coupled with rising healthcare costs, will strain the federal budget. Without policy changes, these programs could overwhelm the budget, limiting the government's flexibility and the economy's ability to support expanded programs."
