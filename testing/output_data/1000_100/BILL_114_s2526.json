    "content": "The Act titled \"Made in America Manufacturing Communities Act of 2016\" establishes a program to designate and support manufacturing communities. The Act establishes a program to improve US manufacturing competitiveness by designating and supporting manufacturing communities. The Act allows preferential consideration for financial or technical assistance to members of a manufacturing community consortium if consistent with the economic development strategy and meeting all requirements. The participating agencies for the program include the Department of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Education, Energy, Housing and Urban Development, Labor, Transportation, Appalachian Regional Commission, Delta Regional Authority, Environmental Protection Agency, and National Science Foundation. The National Science Foundation and the Small Business Administration are participating agencies in the program. The head of each agency must identify applicable programs for the established program. Multiple members of the same consortium can seek financial or technical assistance from participating agencies. The head of a participating agency can determine preference for financial or technical assistance among members of the same consortium designated as a manufacturing community. The head of a participating agency may require coordination among consortium members applying for financial or technical assistance. Each agency must submit a report on how they will prioritize assistance. The Secretary can provide a Federal point of contact for designated manufacturing communities to access funds and assistance. The program allows consortium members to access Federal funds and technical assistance for economic development purposes. Recipients can use the assistance to support investments. The program provides technical assistance for investments in infrastructure, access to capital, exports, workforce training, energy efficiency, and business incubators to enhance US manufacturing competitiveness. The program offers technical assistance for infrastructure investments, access to capital, exports, workforce training, energy efficiency, and business incubators to boost US manufacturing competitiveness. Coordination among participating agencies is required to identify programs and avoid duplication of efforts. Manufacturing communities are designated under this program. The program offers technical assistance for infrastructure investments, access to capital, exports, workforce training, energy efficiency, and business incubators to boost US manufacturing competitiveness. Manufacturing communities are designated through a competitive process involving eligible consortiums representing regions with higher education, private sector, and government entities. The program supports manufacturing competitiveness by providing technical assistance, infrastructure investments, access to capital, exports, and workforce training. Designated manufacturing communities involve consortiums with private sector partners, higher education institutions, government entities, and other community groups. The lead applicant must be a district organization or an Indian tribe. The curr_chunk describes eligible entities for a program, including Indian tribes, States, political subdivisions, and institutions of higher education. These entities can participate individually or as part of a consortium. Eligible entities for the program include Indian tribes, States, political subdivisions, and institutions of higher education. A consortium can define its region to prioritize key technologies, ensuring collaboration among members. Each designation in the consortium lasts for 2 years and can be renewed for another 2 years upon application to the Secretary. The renewal application must contain required information as specified by the Secretary. The Secretary evaluates eligible consortiums for renewal based on performance against previous designation terms. The Secretary evaluates eligible consortiums for renewal based on their progress with project-specific metrics and any changes to the consortium's composition or plan. An eligible consortium seeking a designation must submit an application to the Secretary with details on regional boundaries and any revisions to improve US manufacturing competitiveness. Other criteria may also be considered by the Secretary. The consortium applying for designation must provide details on manufacturing concentration, competitiveness ranking, and assessment of the local industrial ecosystem. The consortium applying for designation must provide an evidence-based plan for developing components of the manufacturing ecosystem, including specific investments to address gaps and make the region uniquely competitive. The consortium applying for designation must provide an evidence-based plan for developing components of the manufacturing ecosystem, including specific investments to address gaps and make the region uniquely competitive. The consortium proposes an implementation strategy to address ecosystem gaps, including outcome-based metrics, benchmarks, milestones, and evaluation methods to track performance in improving manufacturing in the region. The Secretary will evaluate applications based on these criteria. The applicant's proposal will be evaluated based on regional cooperation and manufacturing competitiveness. Previously recognized consortiums will retain their designation under certain conditions. The Secretary may accept transferred funds from another participating agency to carry out this initiative."
