    "content": "A new semi-supervised learning framework is developed using an inversion scheme for deep neural networks, applicable to various systems and problems. The approach achieves state-of-the-art results on MNIST and shows promising performance on SVHN and CIFAR10. It introduces the use of residual networks in semi-supervised tasks for the first time, demonstrating its effectiveness across different signal types. This method is simple, efficient, and does not require changes to the network architecture. Deep neural networks have advanced in machine perception tasks, but training them fully supervised with labeled data is costly. Semi-supervised learning leverages both labeled and unlabeled data to train the network parameters. Limited progress has been made on semi-supervised learning algorithms for DNNs, but current methods have drawbacks such as training instability and computational complexity. This paper introduces a new approach for semi-supervised learning in DNNs, utilizing an inverse methodology for input reconstruction and incorporating information from unlabeled data into the loss function for weight updates. The paper introduces a new approach for semi-supervised learning in DNNs by utilizing inverse guiding weight updates to incorporate information from unlabeled data into the learning process. This method aims to advance the purview of semi-supervised and unsupervised learning by minimizing errors between input signals and network outputs without additional costs or model changes. The ladder network approach BID15 uses per-layer denoising reconstruction loss to create a stacked denoising autoencoder for unsupervised tasks. It can be turned into a semi-supervised model by having the last autoencoder output class distribution. However, it is challenging to generalize to other network topologies and requires precise hyper-parameter tuning. In contrast, the probabilistic formulation in BID14 supports semi-supervised learning but requires ReLU activation functions and specific network topologies. Temporal Ensembling for Semi-Supervised Learning BID8 proposes constraining representations of the same input stimuli to be identical in the latent space despite dropout noise. This technique, similar to a siamese network, uses two different models induced by dropout to provide explicit loss for unsupervised examples, leading to the \u03a0 model and a more efficient method called temporal ensembling. Distributional Smoothing with Virtual Adversarial Training BID12 introduces a regularization term to maintain the regularity of the DNN mapping for a given sample, creating a stable DNN for unlabeled samples. This paper proposes a simple way to invert any piecewise differentiable mapping, including DNNs, without changing their structure. It introduces a new optimization framework for semisupervised learning that leverages penalty terms based on input reconstruction. Experimental results show significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods for various DNN topologies. The paper introduces a method that significantly improves on the state-of-the-art for various DNN topologies by interpreting DNNs as linear splines. This allows for the derivation of an explicit input-output mapping formula, enabling DNNs to be rewritten as linear splines. For example, a deep convolutional neural network (DCN) can be represented as a linear spline with a succession of convolutions, nonlinearities, and pooling. The paper introduces a method that significantly improves on the state-of-the-art for various DNN topologies by interpreting DNNs as linear splines. The total number of layers in a DNN is denoted as L and the output of the last layer z (L) (x) is the one before application of the softmax. The bias term results from the accumulation of per-layer biases after distribution of the following layers' templates. For a Resnet DNN, there is an extra term in \u03c3 C ( ) providing stability and a direct linear connection between the input x and all inner representations z ( ) (x), reducing information loss sensitivity to nonlinear activations. The paper introduces a method that improves DNN performance by interpreting DNNs as linear splines. The optimal templates for prediction in DNNs are proportional to the input, minimizing cross-entropy with softmax nonlinearity. Theoretical implications of optimal DNN templates are discussed, showing reconstruction is implied by the optimum. The paper proposes an inverse of a DNN for reconstruction based on the closest input hyperplane. This method provides a reconstruction based on the DNN representation of its input, different from exact input reconstruction. The bias correction has insightful meaning, especially with ReLU based nonlinearities resembling soft-thresholding denoising technique. Further details on inverting a network efficiently and semi-supervised application are provided in the next section. The paper discusses efficiently inverting a DNN for reconstruction and semi-supervised applications by modifying the objective training function with additional terms. Automatic differentiation is used to update the objective loss function, making it possible to compute the network inverse. This inversion scheme simplifies deep networks into linear mappings, allowing for the derivation of unsupervised and semi-supervised loss functions. The text discusses efficiently computing matrices on deep networks using DISPLAYFORM1, enabling the computation of reconstruction error for various frameworks like wavelet thresholding and PCA. It introduces a reconstruction loss DISPLAYFORM4 and a specialization loss DISPLAYFORM5 for semi-supervised and unsupervised learning, with the option to use differentiable reconstruction losses like mean squared error or cosine similarity. The text introduces a loss function for semi-supervised learning that combines cross entropy, reconstruction, and entropy losses with adjustable weights. The parameters control the balance between supervised and unsupervised losses to guide learning towards optimal results. Results of our approach on a semi-supervised task on the MNIST dataset show reasonable performances with different topologies. MNIST consists of 70000 grayscale images split into a training set of 60000 images and a test set of 10000 images. The case with N L = 50, representing the number of labeled samples from the training set, is presented. A search is performed over (\u03b1, \u03b2) values, and 4 different topologies are tested including mean and max pooling, as well as inhibitor DNN (IDNN) proposed in BID1 for stabilizing training and removing biases units. The Resnet topologies show the best performance, with wide Resnet outperforming previous state-of-the-art results. The proposed semi-supervised scheme on MNIST yields results in Tab. 2, using Theano and Lasagne libraries. Results on CIFAR10 with 4000 labeled data and SVHN with 500 labeled data are presented in Tabs 3 and 4, respectively, using deep CNN models. The curr_chunk discusses the use of deep CNN models for a supervised task on the Bird10 dataset, aiming to classify 10 bird species based on their songs. Results from various models are presented, showing performance metrics for different tasks. The curr_chunk presents results from training networks on raw audio using CNNs for semi-supervised learning. Varying parameters (\u03b1, \u03b2) over 10 runs shows that regularized networks learn more slowly but generalize better. The method achieves state-of-the-art results on MNIST, supporting its potential for different topologies. The results show the potential of training networks on raw audio using CNNs for semi-supervised learning. Possible extensions include developing per-layer reconstruction loss and updating weighting during training for better reconstruction. One approach to improve training involves updating weighting during learning, optimizing loss coefficients after each batch or epoch, and using adversarial training for hyper-parameter updates. Another approach involves using adversarial training to update hyper-parameters cooperatively for accelerated learning. EBGAN and BID18 are GANs where the discriminant network measures the energy of input data, with generated data having high energy and real data having lower energy. The authors suggest using a new method to reconstruct input data and compute energy, reducing the parameters needed for the discriminant network. This approach also allows for unsupervised tasks like clustering, with the possibility of producing low-entropy representations or optimal reconstructions. The proposed framework differs from a deep autoencoder due to the lack of greedy reconstruction loss per layer and the presence of \"activation\" sharing.
