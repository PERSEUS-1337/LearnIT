    "content": "Since the mid-1980s, Congress has passed legislation to support older youth in foster care through the Chafee Foster Care Independence Program (CFCIP), providing services like housing. States have developed independent living programs with funding from CFCIP to help youth attain self-sufficiency. Despite these efforts, research shows that current and former foster youth face challenges compared to their peers in the general population. Research shows that current and former foster youth struggle more than their peers in transitioning to adulthood. Former foster youth are more likely to forgo higher education, have fair or poor health, become homeless, and rely on public support. Efforts by policy makers and advocates have brought attention to these challenges, leading to initiatives to provide support beyond the age of 18. The 110th and 113th Congress passed significant laws addressing child welfare reforms, specifically focusing on older youth in foster care. The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 and the Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act provide protections and support for older youth in care. The law passed in 2014 aims to protect older youth in foster care, promote normalcy, and address sex trafficking issues. Challenges in implementing the law include extending foster care for older youth and securing funding for continued support. States may be hesitant to extend care for older foster youth despite federal assistance due to cost concerns. Transition planning is required within 90 days of exiting care, but challenges remain in providing support for emancipated youth in areas such as securing health insurance, housing, and staying connected to work and school. Policy makers and advocates are concerned about the obstacles faced by youth during the transition to adulthood. Transition planning for older foster youth is required within 90 days of exiting care, but challenges remain in providing support for emancipated youth in areas such as securing health insurance, housing, and staying connected to work and school. Little is known about youth transitioning from foster care, and concerns include vulnerability to child sex trafficking. P.L. 113-183 requires child welfare agencies to have policies in place to serve these youth, and Congress may monitor state implementation and identify best practices for serving victims. The report discusses federal child welfare policies for transitioning youth, including implementation of P.L. 110-351. The number of children in foster care has decreased over the past decade, with older children making up a larger share of the caseload. Older youth exiting care due to reaching the state's legal age of majority has followed a similar trend. In FY2002, over 20,000 children \"aged out\" of foster care, making up 7% of all children who exited care that year. This number increased each year until FY2010, when slightly over 26,000 youth aged out, accounting for 11% of all children who exited. However, in FY2012, the number of youth emancipating reached a recent low of 23,396 (10%). Research shows that youth who spend their teenage years in foster care tend to have more negative outcomes in adulthood compared to their peers. The Midwest Evaluation study is tracking outcomes of former foster youth in Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin who entered care before their 16th birthday. The Midwest Evaluation study tracked outcomes of former foster youth in Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin who entered care before age 16. Surveyed youth responded to questions about outcomes in five data collection waves, showing that former foster youth had more negative educational and employment outcomes compared to their peers in the general population. For example, they were less likely to have attained a four-year college degree (2.5% versus 23.5%). Former foster youth in the Midwest Evaluation study faced barriers to education and employment, with lower college degree attainment rates and lower current employment rates compared to their peers. They reported challenges such as affordability, employment, childcare, and transportation. Despite similar job experience, their mean annual income was significantly lower at around $13,000. The child welfare agency is responsible for the care and placement of children removed from their homes due to various reasons, aiming to reunite them successfully and safely. The child welfare agency uses federal and state funds to help children reunite with parents or find a permanent home. Title IV-E foster care is a key federal funding source. States must meet certain criteria to receive funds, including creating a case plan for each child in foster care and conducting regular reviews every 6 months. The court must review the child's permanency plan every 6 months by a judge or panel, and at least once a year by a judge. For youth aged 14 and older, the case plan must include programs for transitioning to adulthood. Foster care agencies must provide rights information for children aged 14 and older in their case plans. The case plan for children in foster care aged 14 and older must include programs for transitioning to adulthood and rights information. Children in foster care have the right to be safe, avoid exploitation, and participate in developing their case plan. They can choose members for their planning teams, including an advisor for the \"reasonable and prudent parenting standard.\" The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program prepares older youth in foster care for emancipation by providing services to help them transition to adulthood. The program aims to support youth who age out of foster care by equipping them with necessary skills and resources. The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act (P.L. 110-351) was enacted in 2008 after Congress held hearings on child welfare reforms. It made significant changes to federal child welfare statutes, including provisions for older youth in foster care. States can now extend foster care to youth aged 18 and older, up to age 21. The 113th Congress passed the Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) to address the needs of older youth in foster care and child sex trafficking. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) was signed into law in 2014 to protect older youth in care and promote normalcy for children in foster care. It requires child welfare agencies to respond to child sex trafficking. States and tribes can seek federal funds for room and board costs for eligible children in foster care under Title IV-E of the Social Security Act. Funding for the program comes from the general treasury. The Title IV-E foster care program provides federal reimbursement to states for eligible expenditures on behalf of children in state care. Eligibility criteria include citizenship, age, family structure, and a judge's determination of the child's welfare. The program aims to secure a permanent home for the child in a licensed setting. The state or tribal child welfare agency must provide a \"foster care maintenance payment\" on behalf of every Title IV-E eligible child in foster care, covering food, clothing, shelter, supervision, school supplies, personal incidentals, insurance, visitation travel, and school-related travel. This payment is made to the licensed foster family home or institution where the child is placed for care and safety. Federal reimbursement is only available for children placed in licensed child care institutions or foster care homes. Eligible young people who remain in care after turning 18 may also receive support. States and tribes receiving federal child welfare funds must promote safety, permanency, and well-being of all youth in care. Title IV-E foster care maintenance payments are available until age 18 or 19 if still in school, with the option to extend payments until age 21 starting in FY2011. Reimbursement can be sought for youth over 18 in school or post-secondary education. The law allows states and tribes to seek federal foster care reimbursement for eligible youth who are enrolled in post-secondary education, participating in employment programs, or working at least 80 hours per month. Reimbursement can also be requested for older youth with medical conditions that prevent them from participating in these activities. States can seek reimbursement for all eligible youth living in licensed foster homes or child care institutions. The law allows states to seek federal foster care reimbursement for eligible youth living in licensed foster homes or child care institutions. States may also seek reimbursement for youth ages 18 or older in foster care placed in a supervised independent living setting. HHS encourages states to extend federal foster care assistance to eligible youth until age 21. States and tribes must establish criteria for determining eligibility for youth in extended care, including education, employment, and medical conditions. They must also verify that youth continue to meet these conditions to remain in care. Examples of activities youth can pursue include finishing high school and taking classes for preparation. In extended foster care, youth can pursue activities like finishing high school, preparing for the GED exam, enrolling in college or vocational school, attending Job Corps programs, taking interview and resume-writing classes, and working part-time or full-time. States and tribes may set specific requirements for extended care, such as enrollment in post-secondary education. The guidance emphasizes providing support to older youth aged 18 and above. The program instructions address Title IV-E foster care eligibility criteria for young people reaching the state age of majority. Eligibility is based on income, assets, and living arrangements at the time of removal from home. States are not required to redetermine AFDC eligibility for youth in extended care. Eligibility for youth aged 18 or older entering or reentering care is based on the youth themselves, not their parents or guardians. The program instructions address the criteria for youth in extended care who were removed from home via court order or voluntary placement agreement. For youth over 18, a court can determine if the home is not in their best interest, or they can sign a voluntary placement agreement meeting Title IV-E requirements. This decision must be based on the child's best interest. The program instructions outline the criteria for youth in extended care, including the need for a judicial determination of the child's best interest if Title IV-E payments continue beyond 180 days. Placement options include supervised independent living or placement in a foster family home or child care institution. HHS currently lacks regulations on independent living settings for these youth. The instructions allow states and tribes to develop supervised independent living settings for youth, which may include host homes, college dormitories, shared housing, and supervised apartments. Child welfare agencies must ensure that youth in these settings have opportunities to form connections with caring adults. Title IV-E foster care maintenance payments can be used for youth in supervised independent living settings. Title IV-E foster care maintenance payments can be paid directly to young people in independent living settings. States and tribes must apply case planning and review requirements to youth in extended care, addressing their needs and independence goals. Periodic reviews should focus on the youth's safety in placement. States and tribes should make efforts to finalize plans for youth aging out of care. States and tribes must make efforts to finalize permanency plans for older youth in foster care, including those aiming for emancipation or independence. The court can determine these plans without a hearing if authorized. States and tribes extending care to ineligible youth are not bound by certain IV-E requirements. The guidance allows for the extension of Medicaid eligibility to youth in foster care who remain in care after age 18 and receive federal foster care maintenance payments. Many states have amended their Title IV-E state plans to extend the maximum age of foster care, with HHS approving plans for 18 states and the District of Columbia. States with approved plan amendments extend care until age 21, except for Indiana and Nebraska. Nebraska enacted legislation in 2013 to extend care to 21. Tennessee, Washington, and West Virginia allow youth to remain in care under certain conditions, with exemptions for medical reasons. Tennessee requires youth to be in school or a program addressing employment barriers, or unable to do so for medical reasons. States like Washington and West Virginia allow youth to extend care until age 21 for medical reasons or while completing high school. Other states need to consider factors like outcomes, costs, court oversight, and placement options for older youth. Research on youth who emancipate from care is limited, with the Midwest Evaluation being one of the few studies in this area. The study examined outcomes for former foster youth in three states: Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin. Remaining in care until age 20 was associated with higher earnings and delayed pregnancy. Each additional year in care after age 18 was linked to a $470 increase in average annual earnings. Remaining in care after age 18 was associated with increased earnings and reduced pregnancy risk for former foster youth in Illinois. Youth who stayed in care longer saw a $924 increase in average annual earnings and were 38% less likely to become pregnant between ages 17 and 19. Transitional living services were also more accessible for youth in care. However, the benefits seemed to diminish two years after leaving care. The benefits of remaining in care for former foster youth in Illinois appeared to fade two years after aging out. By age 23, they were more likely to have completed one year of college but not more likely to have earned a degree. This could be due to losing access to services and supports that helped them pursue educational goals, leading them to focus on meeting basic needs like housing. Despite assistance from programs like the Chafee ETV program, they may not have received other necessary support for school success. States struggle to extend care due to fiscal constraints and competing priorities. States face challenges in extending care due to budget constraints. The Jim Casey Youth Opportunities Initiative suggests convening a planning group of stakeholders, reviewing federal requirements, considering existing supports, and reaching agreement on key design issues. The advantages of youth remaining in foster care after age 18 are significant, as shown by studies that suggest extending care can offset costs like state prison admissions and welfare payments. Researchers have evaluated the costs and benefits of extending foster care. Researchers analyzed the costs of extending foster care for youth based on Illinois' experience, estimating an annual cost of $20,800 or $19,000 if public assistance costs were subtracted. The benefits were measured in additional wages from attending college, with an average return of $2 for every $1 spent, resulting in an average of $72,000 earned over the youth's time in care. The analysis did not consider costs to state child welfare agencies or courts, such as additional time caseworkers spend on these cases. It also did not explore potential benefits of extending care, like higher tax revenues and reduced homelessness. Providing foster care to eligible youth after age 18 may be a concern for most states, with just under half of children meeting criteria for federal foster care maintenance payments. Eligibility determination and data collection costs were exceptions. State foster care expenditures may only be partially reimbursed by the federal government for Title IV-E eligible children and youth. Eligibility is based on income/assets tests, family structure, judicial determinations, and placement in licensed settings. Reimbursement rates are tied to a state's Federal Medical Assistance Percentage, ranging from 50% to 73%. The federal government partially reimburses state foster care expenditures for Title IV-E eligible children and youth based on income/assets tests, family structure, judicial determinations, and placement in licensed settings. Reimbursement rates range from 50% to 73%. States may choose to cover only IV-E eligible youth due to expenses, leading to equity concerns if care is extended only to certain youth meeting eligibility criteria. States are expected to cover full costs for non-IV-E eligible children and youth from state or local treasuries or other federal funding sources. Federal law allows eligible youth to remain in care after age 18 by meeting certain criteria, such as attending school or working. States can set conditions for youth to stay in care, but some restrict eligibility based on specific activities, potentially raising equity concerns. This could affect youth who pursue other opportunities specified under the law, like college. Federal child welfare law allows eligible youth to remain in care after age 18 by meeting certain criteria, such as attending school or working. States can set conditions for youth to stay in care, potentially raising equity concerns for those pursuing other opportunities like college. State courts play a crucial role in overseeing the safety and appropriateness of the child's placement, regardless of IV-E eligibility or entry into care. A case review must be conducted every six months by a judge or review panel to assess the child's placement and progress. A permanency plan must be established within 12 months of foster care entry, reviewed annually, and consulted with the child. HHS program instructions state that case review system protections apply to all children under 18 and those in care over 18 who are IV-E eligible. Permanency hearings are not required for youth under voluntary placement agreements, but a case review must be conducted every six months. States can exclude youth who have reached the age of majority and are not receiving Title IV-E payments from case review and other protections. The curr_chunk discusses the potential differences in services and supports for youth in extended care based on their IV-E eligibility status. It also raises concerns about the lack of information on non-IV-E eligible youth and the jurisdiction of juvenile courts over cases involving older youth. The American Bar Association has made recommendations in this regard. The American Bar Association (ABA) recommends that states enact legislation to extend juvenile court involvement beyond age 18 for older youth in care. They also suggest that older youth be actively involved in their hearings and be the central participant, besides the judge. Stakeholders emphasize the need for different support systems for youth in foster care aged 18 and older, urging states to rethink their current models. The Jim Casey Foundation emphasizes the challenges faced by foster youth aging out of the system at 18, highlighting the need for appropriate support services to help them transition into adulthood successfully. Extended care for young adults in the child welfare system should be developmentally appropriate, taking into account trauma and loss, involving them in decision-making, and providing social support during the transition to adulthood. Research on adolescent brain development supports the need for opportunities to learn from mistakes, take on responsibilities, and maintain permanent connections. Extended care for young adults in the child welfare system focuses on helping them maintain permanent connections and develop healthy relationships. This approach involves graduated levels of supervision and support, redesigning case planning, and empowering young people to take on responsibilities at an earlier age. Research also looks at factors that help young people remain in extended care. In a study by the Chapin Hall Center for Children at the University of Chicago, researchers identified reasons why some youth in Illinois do not remain in care despite state policies. Factors influencing youth leaving care before age 21 were evaluated through data analysis, surveys, focus groups, and interviews with court personnel. The study by the Chapin Hall Center for Children at the University of Chicago identified five factors influencing youth leaving care in Illinois: juvenile courts retaining youth by keeping cases open, lack of understanding of laws and policies, limited foster care placements, stable relationships with adults, and youth attitudes towards staying in care. In Illinois, factors influencing youth leaving care include juvenile courts retaining youth, lack of understanding of laws and policies, limited foster care placements, stable relationships with adults, and youth attitudes towards staying in care. States can extend foster care assistance to youth aged 18 or older who may later want to return to care due to challenges living independently. HHS program instructions allow states to extend care up to age 19, 20, or 21, as long as the original court order remains in effect. In a 2014 report, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that 19 states allow young people to leave and re-enter foster care. Youth can stay in care under voluntary placement agreements in 12 of these states. HHS has not issued regulations on independent living settings for youth in foster care after age 18. States have not received guidance on overseeing youth in independent living settings after age 18. Advocates emphasize the importance of youth learning adult skills while still receiving state support. States with foster youth in independent living settings must consider various issues, such as purchasing units or contracting with organizations. The child welfare agency must consider various issues when overseeing youth in independent living settings, such as screening residents, rent responsibilities, visit frequency, consequences for lease violations, and financial support management. In a supervised setting, states provide supports for youth transitioning back into their parent or guardian's home. Most states offer supervised independent living settings, but face challenges in finding appropriate housing. Youth in Minnesota can live in apartments, homes, dorms, or other settings. The state is working on assisting youth pursuing postsecondary education out of state. Youth may live with roommates but not with parents or significant others. Independent living settings are not required to be licensed. The state does not require independent living settings to be licensed, and each county has discretion on handling background checks for roommates and safety concerns. Provisions of the law focus on connecting youth to caring adults through adoption or placement with relatives. Monthly federal assistance is generally not available for children who have left foster care for a permanent family after turning 18, but states can provide subsidies for eligible children who leave foster care after 16 and are under 21, enrolled in school, employed, or participating in an activity. States and tribes may provide assistance to older youth with medical conditions preventing employment or education, up to age 21. Assistance can also be extended for children with disabilities. Kinship guardianship requires the child to have lived with the relative guardian for at least six months. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program (CFCIP) funds services to assist youth in foster care beyond age 18, providing adoption and kinship guardianship subsidies. States and tribes can establish conditions for guardianship, including requiring a child to be in care for more than six months and targeting certain age groups for guardianship. The term \"relative\" for kinship guardianship assistance can include biological and legal familial ties, tribal kin, extended family, friends, or other \"fictive\" kin. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program (CFCIP) provides support services for youth expected to emancipate from foster care, assisting with employment, education, and personal development. The program aims to help youth transition to self-sufficiency and achieve success in adulthood. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program (CFCIP) supports youth transitioning from foster care to adulthood by providing independent living services. P.L. 110-351 allows states and tribes to offer these services to youth leaving foster care at age 16. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) added a purpose area to the program to ensure children in foster care until 18 have opportunities for age-appropriate activities. The CFCIP has a capped entitlement of $140 million annually, allocated based on states' foster care populations. States and tribes must describe in their five-year Child and Family Services Plan how they will carry out their independent living program, ensuring statewide coverage and serving children of various ages and stages of independence. They must also certify that they meet certain requirements to be eligible for Chafee Foster Care Independence Program (CFCIP) funds. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program (CFCIP) requires states and tribes to certify in their plans that they meet specific requirements for serving youth and spending funds. The program authorizes vouchers worth up to $5,000 annually per eligible youth for education and training expenses. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program (CFCIP) provides vouchers up to $5,000 annually for higher education expenses. Eligible youth must be in good academic standing and making progress towards completion. Independent living services are also available for youth who have left foster care under a permanent arrangement before age 18. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program (CFCIP) provides independent living services to youth aging out of foster care, with a focus on connecting them to school, work, and resources until age 21. States have discretion in defining eligibility for CFCIP services, and may need to assess capacity to serve additional youth. Child welfare law requires caseworker support for youth participating in age-appropriate activities. The transition plan for youth aging out of foster care includes options on housing, health insurance, education, mentors, workforce supports, and employment services. It must be implemented 90 days before the youth's 18th birthday. The plan also addresses designating someone to make healthcare decisions if the youth becomes unable to. The transition plan for youth aging out of foster care includes options for housing, health insurance, education, mentors, workforce supports, and employment services. It must be implemented 90 days before the youth's 18th birthday and includes designating someone to make healthcare decisions if the youth becomes unable to participate. The transition plan is separate from the case plan, which outlines the youth's placement and care while in foster care. The transition plan for youth aging out of foster care includes options for housing, health insurance, education, mentors, workforce supports, and employment services. It must be implemented 90 days before the youth's 18th birthday and includes designating someone to make healthcare decisions if the youth becomes unable to participate. The transition plan is separate from the case plan and must address programs and services for successful transition to adulthood, including specific options for independent living. The plan is directed by the youth in consultation with others and reviewed annually by the court. The transition plan for youth aging out of foster care includes options for housing, health insurance, education, mentors, workforce supports, and employment services. It must be implemented 90 days before the youth's 18th birthday and includes designating someone to make healthcare decisions if the youth becomes unable to participate. The plan is directed by the youth in consultation with others and reviewed annually by the court. The July 2010 program instructions issued by HHS on P.L. 110-351 provide additional guidance on the transition plan, encouraging child welfare agencies to engage youth in the process well in advance. This raises questions about youth who emancipate at an earlier age. Thousands of youth emancipate from care at age 17, potentially leaving them less prepared than their peers who emancipate at 18 or older. States and tribes may not develop transition plans for youth who remain in care beyond age 18 but leave before reaching age 19, 20, or 21. Social work professionals are working on guidance for transition plans that focus on engaging youth and stakeholders in the process to achieve permanency. The transition planning process for youth aging out of foster care focuses on achieving permanency with caring adults, involving the youth in the planning, and ensuring essential supports are provided. States have adopted policies to engage youth in the process and require documentation of youth input in the plan, as well as ensuring key documents are included. Several jurisdictions require a separate transition plan for youth aging out of foster care, with over half mandating a transition planning specialist to assist. Challenges include staff training, engaging supportive adults, and finding appropriate housing. Some states, like Hawaii and Nebraska, have detailed transition planning processes involving youth and others in \"circles\" to celebrate the young person becoming an adult. Transition planning \"circles\" are conferences driven by the youth to assist in planning for their future. Foster Club has developed a transition planning kit for older youth in Nebraska, outlining roles and including a transition proposal checklist. This kit also includes a \"permanency pact\" to identify individuals who can support the youth during their transition. Policy makers and child welfare advocates are concerned about the challenges faced by older foster youth transitioning to adulthood. Research shows difficulties in forming permanent connections, securing health insurance and housing, and staying connected to work and school. A new national database may provide insight into outcomes in education, employment, and other areas for youth transitioning from foster care. The Midwest Evaluation study provides insight into outcomes for youth aging out of foster care, including challenges in forming permanent relationships and staying connected to biological families. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act aims to address issues faced by vulnerable youth in foster care. The study on the Adult Functioning of Former Foster Youth at age 26 shows they are more likely to be married and less likely to live with their parents compared to their peers. Many alumni reported not having strong relationships with their biological family members. Despite federal protections, there is a need for additional policies to improve the transition to adulthood for youth in care. Advocates push for policies to support youth in care by promoting lasting connections with caring adults for successful outcomes. Child welfare agencies in some areas actively work to secure permanent adult relationships for youth aging out of foster care. Permanency involves a stable, secure, and committed adult providing emotional and financial support, with a focus on developing relationships rather than pursuing alternative living arrangements. Child welfare agencies aim to help foster youth establish lasting connections with caring adults for successful outcomes. Researchers caution against fostering unsustainable relationships with adults due to past negative experiences. Limited research exists on facilitating healthy relationships between foster youth and their biological family members. Advocates push for permanency planning before foster youth leave care, determined at annual hearings with goals like returning home, adoption, guardianship, or APPLA if other options aren't suitable. APPLA requires a compelling reason if traditional goals aren't in the child's best interest, added in the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997. The Adoption and Safe Families Act (ASFA) of 1997 introduced the concept of Another Planned Permanent Living Arrangement (APPLA) as a permanent option for children in foster care. Advocates emphasize that APPLA should involve a specific adult or couple who will provide a stable and caring environment for the child, rather than being used as a default permanency goal. Concerns have been raised that APPLA is sometimes used as a long-term replacement for foster care, which may not be in the child's best interest. The Senate Caucus on Foster Youth issued a white paper in December 2010, discussing policy changes to improve outcomes for children in foster care. One suggestion was to eliminate or restrict APPLA as a case plan goal, especially for older teenagers in care. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) incorporates recommendations to restrict APPLA as a case plan goal for children under 16. Additional requirements must be met for children with a permanency plan of APPLA during annual hearings and periodic reviews. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act restricts APPLA as a case plan goal for children under 16 and includes additional requirements for children with an APPLA permanency plan during hearings and reviews. The transition plan requirement aims to help youth establish permanent connections in adulthood by considering local mentoring opportunities. Proposed changes to federal child welfare law could further assist in this goal. Proposed changes to federal child welfare law aim to assist youth in achieving permanency by amending case plan requirements to include steps for ensuring a permanent living arrangement. The transition planning process includes intensive efforts to establish adult connections for young people. During the transition process in Texas, youth are assisted in identifying caring adults for support when they leave care. Foster Club's Permanency Pact helps connect youth with adults for lifelong support. Efforts also focus on adoption for older youth. Efforts to support permanency include Adoption Opportunity Grants funded by HHS to demonstrate effective strategies for adoption for older youth. Federal grants could also provide mentoring for current and former foster youth. Legislation has been introduced in Congress to address permanency for youth in care. Legislation in Congress aims to authorize funding for grants providing mentoring to foster children, supporting state and local child welfare agencies in promoting safety and well-being. Child victims of sex trafficking may be identified through child protective services, with foster care youth at risk. Runaway foster youth are particularly vulnerable to trafficking. The capacity of state and local child welfare agencies to respond to sex trafficking victims is limited due to various factors. The National Academy of Sciences recommends improving collaboration across multiple sectors to address child sex trafficking. In the 113th Congress, hearings were held on child sex trafficking and the challenges for child welfare agencies. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) requires state child welfare agencies to develop procedures to identify and assist child victims of sex trafficking. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) mandates state child welfare agencies to establish procedures for identifying and aiding child victims of sex trafficking. These procedures must be developed in consultation with various stakeholders and include training for caseworkers. State agencies must report cases to law enforcement within 24 hours of receiving information, and annually report the total number of child and youth victims to HHS. HHS is required to report annually to Congress and the public the total number of children and youth identified as sex trafficking victims by state child welfare agencies. Additionally, HHS must submit a report to Congress summarizing demographic information and state efforts to provide specialized services for these victims. The National Advisory Committee on Domestic Sex Trafficking must be established within 180 days of the bill's enactment. The National Advisory Committee on Domestic Sex Trafficking, established within 180 days of the bill's enactment, advises the HHS Secretary and the Attorney General on policies to improve the nation's response to domestic sex trafficking of minors from the child welfare system. It develops recommended best practices for states to combat domestic sex trafficking of minors. Congress should monitor states' implementation of these requirements, including HHS guidance to make states aware of the child welfare agency's role, serving youth not in foster care, reporting victims to the federal government, and identifying best practices for victim services. State child welfare agencies are required to serve only children and youth victims who are already in the system, not those who may come to their attention as victims. Congress may consider if these agencies should screen in victims. Pending legislation would require agencies to identify and assess reports involving child sex trafficking victims and train CPS workers to identify and assess victims. Children removed from their parents and placed in foster care are affected. Children in foster care may go missing due to abuse and neglect, with limited federal guidance on serving them. Stakeholders seek a more uniform response to missing children. States have policies to prevent and recover missing foster care children, but the extent of implementation is unclear. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) directs state child welfare agencies on locating and responding to children missing from foster care. It requires agencies to develop protocols for finding missing children, addressing factors contributing to their disappearance, and learning about their experiences while absent. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) mandates state child welfare agencies to develop protocols for locating and responding to children missing from foster care. This includes addressing factors contributing to their disappearance, determining if they are potential victims of sex trafficking, and reporting relevant information to authorities and the National Center on Missing and Exploited Children. The Child Welfare League of America recommends state child welfare agencies to have procedures in place to prevent children from going missing, including workforce training, involving family in decision making, examining foster care facilities, and defining missing children. States are also urged to report all missing children to law enforcement. States may have different definitions of \"missing\" children and whether to report them to law enforcement. Some states include children not at their foster care placements as missing. Reporting missing children to law enforcement could be limited to cases where they can be most helpful due to competing demands and limited resources. Law enforcement agencies may not respond as vigorously to certain types of missing incidents. The challenges of coordinating between child welfare agencies, law enforcement, and courts to prevent children from going missing are addressed in federal child welfare policy. Guidelines from CWLA and NCMEC encourage clear roles and definitions for collaboration. Currently, state child welfare agencies report to HHS on children who run away from foster care placements via AFCARS. However, AFCARS does not have a separate category for children missing due to reasons like abductions or negligence. States may need to track these children more comprehensively to locate them, including those who were abducted. Child welfare stakeholders have concerns about restrictions foster youth face in participating in normal activities like sleepovers, dating, driving, working, and sports. Witnesses testified at a House hearing on balancing safety with opportunities for foster youth. Prior to the Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act, few federal child welfare provisions addressed promoting normalcy for youth in foster care. Witnesses explained that teenagers exhibit more risk-taking behaviors due to changes in brain development during adolescence. Congress will likely monitor the implementation of the new provisions in the Act. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act established a \"reasonable and prudent parenting\" standard for foster parents and caregivers to make decisions for children in care. Child welfare agencies must provide training on developmental stages and applying the standard for foster children's activities. States are required to revise their licensing requirements. Several studies have shown high rates of homelessness among former foster youth, ranging from 11% to 36%. The Midwest Evaluation found that 24% of 23-year-olds reported being homeless at least once since exiting care. Additionally, many emancipated youth couch surf, with estimates ranging from one-quarter to one-half. Former foster youth face challenges in securing stable housing due to individual characteristics, involvement with the child welfare system, and the housing market. Lack of housing can impact their education and employment. While states can allocate funds for room and board, it may not be sufficient to cover housing costs for many former foster youth. Former foster youth often struggle to afford stable housing, but nonprofit organizations offer housing programs in collaboration with developers or property management agencies. These programs, found in 21 states and the District of Columbia, provide various housing options like single-site locations, scattered-site locations, and host homes. Most programs focus on independent living support and require participants to be employed or in school. However, none of these programs have been rigorously evaluated for their effectiveness in preventing homelessness or improving housing stability for young people. Former foster youth face challenges in finding stable housing, but nonprofit organizations offer housing programs in collaboration with developers. These programs, available in 21 states and the District of Columbia, provide various housing options and focus on independent living support. Some states require public universities to provide housing for current and former foster youth in college during school breaks. The Higher Education Act addresses housing concerns for youth in foster care or recently emancipated youth by authorizing services, including temporary housing during breaks in the academic year. It also allows for demonstration projects to provide comprehensive support services, including housing, for students who were in foster care or homeless before age 13. The Higher Education Act authorizes projects to offer housing to youth when educational institution housing is unavailable. Federal law allows Low-Income Housing Tax Credit properties to designate units for low-income students who were in foster care. The law does not specify the length of time students must have spent in foster care or require emancipation for eligibility. In a February 2008 report, the U.S. Government Accountability Office defined disconnected youth as individuals aged 14 to 24 not in school or working, lacking support networks. Youth in care and other groups are at higher risk of disconnection. Those aging out of care have low employment rates and earnings. A study in California, Minnesota, and North Carolina found that at age 24, three out of five youth who aged out were employed, earning less than their counterparts nationally and from low-income families. Emancipated youth from foster care face challenges in education and employment. Their average monthly earnings are lower than national averages, and they are less likely to attend college. By age 26, only about 7% of foster care alumni in three states have attained a degree, compared to one-third of the general youth population. This suggests the need for additional support for young foster care alumni. Young foster care alumni may require extra support to complete their education, including academic, social/emotional, and logistical assistance such as year-round housing. Federal child welfare law addresses the educational needs of youth in foster care, requiring state agencies to consider proximity to the child's school when placing them in foster care and include education-related records in the child's case plan. State agencies must collaborate with education authorities to provide necessary support. State child welfare agencies must collaborate with state and local education authorities to ensure children in foster care remain in their current school or are promptly enrolled in a new one. Federal funding is available for transporting children to their \"school of origin.\" Additionally, states must ensure that children receiving foster care payments are enrolled in school or have completed high school, and educational records must be updated and provided. Federal agencies are collaborating to address the education needs of current foster youth. A summit in November 2011 brought together state teams to promote educational stability and improve outcomes for children in foster care. Despite this collaboration, federal education law does not address the educational needs of children in foster care. Recent legislation aims to improve access to education for children in foster care. Recent legislation, such as S. 1094, aims to improve education access for children in foster care by amending federal education law. It requires state education agencies to ensure continuity in schooling for foster children or facilitate immediate enrollment in a new school if necessary. Additionally, the bill mandates policies for transferring school credits and receiving partial credit for children in care changing schools. The Higher Education Act provides supportive educational services for foster youth and homeless children. These youth are eligible for federal Trio programs, which offer mentoring, tutoring, and other support services to prepare them for higher education. Talent Search and Upward Bound are part of the Trio programs designed to identify and support disadvantaged students for college. The Higher Education Act provides supportive educational services for foster youth and homeless children through federal Trio programs like Talent Search, Upward Bound, Student Support Services, and Educational Opportunity Centers. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program funds independent living services for youth in care or who have aged out, but little is known about their effectiveness or outcomes after leaving care. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program is the main source of funding for independent living services for youth transitioning out of foster care. A national database called the National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD) will provide insight into the lives of former foster youth, but full implementation may take several years. States receive $140 million annually for the program, with a 20% match requirement. States receive funding for independent living services through the Chafee Foster Care Independence Program, with a 20% match requirement. A 2008 survey found that most states spend additional funds to support eligible youth, indicating that federal funding alone may not be sufficient. Research on effective independent living programs is limited, but evaluations of innovative programs are conducted by HHS as required by law. The HHS contracted with the Urban Institute to evaluate independent living programs funded by the CFCIP for foster youth. The evaluation aimed to assess the programs' impact on key outcomes like education, employment, interpersonal skills, pregnancy rates, and delinquency. 1,400 foster youth were randomly assigned to programs in California and Massachusetts, including employment services, life skills training, and tutoring/mentoring programs. The evaluation of independent living programs for foster youth in Los Angeles and Kern County, CA found no significant impacts, while the life skills program in Massachusetts showed positive effects on education. The evaluation included surveys, interviews, focus groups, and state administrative data analysis. The Massachusetts Adolescent Outreach Program for Youth in Intensive Foster Care, known as Outreach, assists youth in preparing for independent living and forming permanent connections with caring adults. The program aims to help youth achieve education, employment, and behavioral outcomes through tailored services and a youth development approach. Social workers oversee small caseloads to provide individualized support. The program workers oversee a small caseload of youth, aiming to develop a close relationship and act as advocates. They assist with tasks like obtaining driver's licenses, applying for college, and gaining employment. The evaluation showed that Outreach youth had better educational and employment outcomes compared to the control group, including higher college enrollment rates and staying enrolled. Additionally, they were more likely to remain in foster care and receive more help in certain educational areas. The study found that youth in the Outreach program had better educational outcomes, including higher college enrollment rates and staying enrolled. However, they did not report better outcomes in employment, economic well-being, housing, delinquency, pregnancy, or preparedness for independent living tasks. This raises questions about the effectiveness of independent living programs and classroom-based instruction in helping youth transition to independent living. The Outreach program for transitioning youth showed better educational outcomes, but not in other areas like employment, housing, and independent living tasks. The National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD) tracks demographic and outcome information of foster youth, providing insight into their outcomes nationwide. States have reported information to the database as required by the Chafee Foster Care Independence Act (P.L. 106-169). The National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD) was established to develop outcome measures for assessing the performance of states in operating independent living programs for foster youth. The rule required states to collect data on youth starting in FY2011, with a focus on educational attainment, avoidance of dependency, homelessness, non-marital childbirth, incarceration, and high-risk behaviors. HHS uses NYTD for data collection on eligible youth receiving independent living services, tracking outcomes at ages 17, 19, and 21. States can track a sample to reduce burden, with financial penalties for non-compliance. The rule imposes financial penalties on states that do not meet data and data submission requirements for youth receiving independent living services at ages 17, 19, and 21."
