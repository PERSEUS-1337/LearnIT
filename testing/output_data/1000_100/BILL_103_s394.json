    "content": "Credit for payments or contributions to certain cooperative research organizations. The amendment allows for a 50 percent credit on qualified cooperative research expenditures. Qualified cooperative research expenditures are defined as the total amount of qualified expenses for collaborative research activities. The amendment allows for a 50 percent credit on qualified cooperative research expenditures, which are the aggregate amount of qualified contributions to qualified cooperative research consortia for qualified research. Qualified contributions are all contributions to such consortia for research, subject to certain limitations. The private source funding ratio is determined based on the organization's gross receipts without governmental support for the preceding taxable year. It includes 50 percent of the ratio for the current year and 30 percent of the ratio for the second preceding year. The private source funding ratio is calculated using the organization's gross receipts without governmental support from the preceding taxable year. It involves 50 percent of the ratio for the current year and 30 percent of the ratio for the second preceding year. Contributions exceeding certain limits are not considered qualified contributions. Contributions to a qualified cooperative research consortium exceeding one-third of the consortium's total nongovernmental support for the taxable year may be eligible for tax benefits. If the consortium has fewer than 5 participants making nongovernmental contributions, each person's qualified contributions will be reduced by 20 percent if there are 4 participants. The term 'qualified cooperative research consortium' refers to an organization registered under the National Cooperative Research Act of 1984 with at least 5 contributors, where no 3 members can contribute more than 80 percent of the total. A qualified cooperative research consortium must have at least 5 contributors, with no single member contributing more than 50 percent of total nongovernmental contributions. If there are 3 or 4 contributors, no single member can contribute more than 50 percent (and no 2 members can contribute more than 85 percent) of the total nongovernmental contributions, and the contributors must be engaged in the same trade or business. Special rules apply for this subsection. Special rules apply for noncash contributions in qualified cooperative research expenditures, including services provided by taxpayer's employees at their cost. Overhead costs must be included in the services provided. Amounts considered in this subsection cannot be double-counted in other sections. Contributions paid or incurred during the taxable year to qualified cooperative research are subject to specific rules. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after the date of enactment of this Act. Qualified cooperative research consortia must provide reports to the Secretary containing certification, private source funding ratio, and other required information. Each consortium must also provide a copy of the report to each contributor."
