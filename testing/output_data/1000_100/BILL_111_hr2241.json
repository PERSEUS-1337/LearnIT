The Congress finds that during the Gulf War in 1991, Americans serving in the Armed Forces were captured, tortured, and subjected to horrendous acts by Saddam Hussein's regime. CBS News reporter Bob Simon and cameraman Roberto Alvarez were also kidnapped and tortured. Many US citizens detained by Iraq were subjected to cruel treatment and used as \"human shields.\" During the Gulf War in 1991, American POWs and civilian hostages suffered long-term physical, emotional, and mental damage due to brutal state-sponsored torture by Iraq, classified as a state sponsor of terrorism. Upon their return, they were welcomed as heroes by Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney. Congress unanimously condemned Iraq's treatment of captured US service members. In 1996, Congress passed an amendment allowing torture victims like American POWs to seek compensation from terrorist countries. In 2002, Gulf War POWs filed claims seeking compensation for torture and abuse by Iraq. In 2003, American POWs, including Colonel Clifford Acree, Lieutenant Colonel Craig Berryman, and others, sought compensation for torture and abuse by the Government of Iraq. In 2003, American POWs sought compensation for torture by Iraq. Despite a judgment in their favor, they have not received payment due to a waiver granted by the President. In 2003, American POWs sought compensation for torture by Iraq. Despite a judgment in their favor, the President directed payment from blocked Iraqi accounts for former hostages and their spouses. Additionally, all remaining blocked assets of Iraq were confiscated for Iraq reconstruction. Over 200 US citizens held hostage in Iraqi-occupied territory also had claims. The plaintiffs in Vine v. Republic of Iraq, who were held hostage in Iraqi-occupied territory, have not been compensated due to a waiver granted by the President under the National Defense Authorization Act. Article 131 of the Third Geneva Convention prohibits the US from absolving Iraq of liability for torture of prisoners of war. The United States has a moral obligation to protect its Armed Forces and citizens from torture and hostage-taking. Congress is committed to holding state sponsors of terrorism accountable for such acts. If certain cases against Iraq are not settled within 30 days, the President has waiver authority under the National Defense Authorization Act. The Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 will terminate any waivers granted for certain cases against Iraq if not settled within 30 days. Adequate settlement involves payment by Iraq or a US depository institution to specified persons. The Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 will provide compensation to individuals whose claims arise from hostage taking or being held hostage, with a maximum amount of $900,000. The Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 provides compensation to hostages who were tortured, with a maximum amount of $2,500,000 plus $6,000 for each day held captive. Spouses, children, and individuals with prior compensatory damages judgments may also receive payments. Compensatory damages in a case involving hostages include payment of the unsatisfied judgment amount, capped at $1,000,000 or the award amount, and one-third of any excess over $1,000,000. Definitions include \"hostage\" as an individual in hostage status or seized during hostage taking, and \"hostage status\" as the status of being a hostage. Definitions related to hostage situations include \"hostage status,\" \"hostage taking,\" \"person,\" \"torture,\" and \"United States.\" These terms are defined in specific sections of relevant laws. The term \"United States depository institution\" refers to a depository institution organized under the laws of any State, the District of Columbia, or the United States. Additionally, Section 1503 of the Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2003, was not intended to allow for the removal of certain provisions. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 did not intend to remove jurisdiction over cases under section 1605(a)(7) of title 28, United States Code. Section 1083 of the NDAA applies to specific cases, starting from the enactment of this Act.
