The \"Child Care Quality Incentive Act of 2001\" highlights findings on early brain development, emphasizing the importance of quality early care and education for children's cognitive abilities and long-term success. Research shows that many child care centers do not promote healthy development or ensure the safety of children. Full-day child care can be costly, ranging from $4,000 to $10,000. Full-day child care costs $4,000 to $10,000 per year, with limited Federal assistance available. Families with low income struggle to afford child care, as it can consume 25% of their monthly income. Low reimbursement rates impact the quality of care and accessibility for families, forcing providers to cut corners. The Act aims to enhance child care quality and accessibility by increasing payment rates, which can help providers maintain staff, offer training, ensure safety, and provide educational materials. Low-quality child care can lead to delayed skills and increased aggression in children. Incentive grants are provided to improve the quality of child care. Funding for grants to improve the quality of child care is authorized under the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990. $500,000,000 is appropriated for fiscal year 2002, with additional funds for subsequent years. The Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 is amended to establish a program and provide grants to improve the quality of child care. \"Grants are provided to improve the quality of child care under SEC. 658H.\" The Secretary will use appropriated funds to make grants to eligible States for child care services based on market rates surveys conducted within 2 years. Eligible States must submit an application to receive annual payments. To be eligible for a grant under this section, a State must submit an application to the Secretary with details of the market rates survey methodology, results, and a plan to increase payment rates from the initial baseline. The State must submit an application with market rates survey details and a plan to increase payment rates to be eligible for a grant. The Secretary may make annual payments if the State shows progress in maintaining increased payment rates and conducts a survey update every two years. Matching funds are required for eligibility. To be eligible for a grant, the State must provide at least 25% of the costs from State sources. State contributions must be in cash and cannot include Federal funds. Allotments to eligible States are based on a formula similar to other allocations. Funds must be used according to priority use guidelines. An eligible State receiving a grant must increase child care assistance payment rates up to the 100th percentile of the market rate survey. Once reaching this rate, the State can use the funds for activities enhancing child care quality. Amounts paid should supplement, not supplant, existing funds. The State must use grant funds to increase child care payment rates and enhance quality, with reports submitted to the Secretary and Congress on these efforts. The funds should supplement existing funds, not replace them. The amendments to the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 focus on using grant funds to increase child care payment rates and maintain progress in subsidized child care reimbursement. The term 'payment rate' refers to the reimbursement rate to providers. Amendments also specify the allocation of funds appropriated under section 658B(a) for child care services.
