    "content": "The Act titled \"Lifespan Respite Care Act of 2002\" amends the Public Health Service Act by adding a new section on Lifespan Respite Care. This section includes findings and purposes related to respite care. Congress finds that millions of individuals in the United States provide care for family members with various health conditions, including children with special needs and those living with relatives due to parental inability. Nearly 4 million individuals in the United States with mental retardation or developmental disabilities live with their families. Around 25% of the elderly population have multiple chronic conditions requiring assistance. Approximately 600,000 Americans die at home each year, often relying on family caregivers. 42% of those needing daily living assistance in the U.S. are under 65. There is a lack of resources to replace family caregivers with paid workers, which would cost $200 billion annually. Approximately 75 percent of family caregivers are women and face substantial emotional, physical, and financial hardship. They often struggle to find information about available respite care programs, which are insufficient and primarily cater to lower-income populations and the elderly. There is a limited number of respite care programs that have difficulty recruiting trained workers. The purposes of this title are to encourage States to establish respite care programs, improve dissemination of information to family caregivers, provide respite care services, promote innovative approaches to delivery and training, and support evaluative research. The purpose of this section is to support evaluative research on effective respite care services and promote the dissemination of results and findings related to respite care delivery and family caregiver training. \"Definitions are provided in Section 2802.\" The term 'condition' in this title includes Alzheimer's disease, developmental disabilities, mental retardation, physical disabilities, chronic illness (including cancer), behavioral and emotional conditions, cognitive impairments, situations at high risk of abuse or neglect, situations where a child's parent is unavailable, traumatic brain injury, and other conditions determined by the Secretary. The term 'eligible recipient' includes State agencies, public entities operating statewide, nonprofit organizations operating statewide, political subdivisions with a population of at least 3,000,000 individuals, and recognized State respite coordinating agencies with demonstrated abilities in respite care and family caregiver issues. Family caregiver issues are important for ensuring meaningful involvement of family members, caregivers, and care recipients. A family caregiver is an unpaid individual who provides in-home care for a child or adult with special needs. Lifespan respite care is a system of accessible respite services for family caregivers regardless of age, race, or special needs. Respite care is planned or emergency care for individuals with special needs. The term 'special need' refers to the particular needs of an individual requiring care or supervision due to a condition to meet basic needs or prevent harm. The term 'Secretary' refers to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. \"SEC. 2803. LIFESPAN RESPITE CARE GRANTS AND COOPERATIVE AGREEMENTS.\" The section aims to expand respite care services for family caregivers, improve dissemination and coordination, and enhance access and quality of services to reduce caregiver strain. The Secretary is authorized to award grants to eligible recipients for this purpose, in collaboration with relevant agencies. The Administration for Children and Families, the Administration on Developmental Disabilities, and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration must coordinate respite care services for family caregivers of individuals with special needs. Eligible recipients must submit an application to the Secretary for a grant or cooperative agreement, including a description of their understanding of respite care and family caregiver issues. The eligible recipients must coordinate respite care services for family caregivers of individuals with special needs. They need to ensure meaningful involvement of family members, caregivers, and care recipients, as well as collaborate with other agencies. The description should include the population of family caregivers, their respite care needs, and existing services available. The curr_chunk discusses the coordination of respite care information and services for family caregivers at the State and local level, including methods, unmet needs, and utilization of grant funds for various programs. The curr_chunk outlines a plan for collaboration and coordination of respite care activities with other related services, involving the participation of family caregivers, care recipients, and relevant agencies. It also emphasizes maximizing the use of Federal, State, and local resources for the proposed respite care activities. The curr_chunk discusses the availability of respite care services for family caregivers, criteria for eligibility, and ensuring the quality and safety of the services provided. The respite care services provided will be monitored to ensure workers and volunteers are screened and possess necessary skills. Expectations and evaluation procedures for respite care activities will be outlined, along with assurances of maintaining confidentiality of care recipient and family caregiver records. The Secretary will establish a panel to review applications for grants or cooperative agreements. The panel will meet as needed to evaluate applications and make recommendations for approval. Grants will be awarded based on the panel's recommendations, with priority given by the Secretary. The Secretary prioritizes applicants showing the greatest likelihood of implementing or enhancing lifespan respite care statewide. Grant or cooperative agreement funds must be used for developing respite care, providing services to meet unmet needs, and evaluating effectiveness. The Secretary awards grants for developing respite care services, allowing subcontracting with public or nonprofit agencies. Grants last up to 5 years and can be renewed. Funds should supplement, not replace, other available funds for respite care. The Secretary awards grants to establish a National Resource Center on Lifespan Respite Care. The Center will maintain a national database, provide training and assistance to respite care programs, and offer information and educational programs to the public. Authorization of appropriations is provided for the implementation of this title."
