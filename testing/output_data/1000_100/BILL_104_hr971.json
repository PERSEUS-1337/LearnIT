    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Homeowners Empowerment and Protection Act of 1995\". The Congress recognizes the strong interest of 65,000,000 homeowners in the US to preserve and enhance their property value. The value of a home is closely tied to the quality of the neighborhood and environment, including water, air, flood risk, and scenic beauty. The value of homes in the United States can be reduced by certain types of land development and industrial activities on neighboring properties. Protecting homeowners from irresponsible actions that harm property values is important for individuals, communities, and society as a whole. Public information and participation procedures may be insufficient for individual homeowners. Public information and participation procedures may be inadequate for individual homeowners to be informed and involved in decision-making processes that could impact the value of their homes. Homeowners have the right to access information about activities that may reduce the value of their homes. Within 90 days of this Act's enactment, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget must establish uniform Federal procedures for agencies. These procedures will require any person seeking approval for property impacting activities to provide a notice. The term \"application to conduct property impacting activity\" refers to permits, licenses, contracts, or leases. The notice requirement applies to applicants seeking approval for property impacting activities that generate pollutants or adverse impacts near private homes. Homeowners within 1/4 mile must receive individual written notice, and notice must also be published in local newspapers. The notice requirement under this subsection involves providing detailed information about the proposed property impacting activity to homeowners likely to suffer a reduction in property value. This includes describing the nature of the application, potential impacts on private homes, opportunities for public comment, and contact information for further inquiries. Additionally, the public response should identify alternatives to minimize property impacts. Property impacts are addressed by establishing a toll-free telephone number for homeowners to register concerns about potential effects on property values. Agencies must thoroughly investigate the impact of proposed activities on private homes and seek alternatives to minimize adverse effects on property values. SEC. 4. HOMEOWNER RIGHT OF ACTION. (a) Right of Action.--Any person who has conducted an activity authorized by a permit, license, or other approval that generates pollutants causing a significant reduction in the value of a private home may be sued by the homeowner. Prior to filing a lawsuit, the homeowner must provide a 30-day notice of intent to sue to the defendant and the relevant agency. The homeowner must provide a 30-day notice of intent to sue to the defendant and relevant agency. The agency head may convene a meeting to resolve the claim, but the homeowner retains the right to bring an action under this section. In any action, the burden of proof is on the homeowner to demonstrate that the defendant's activity caused a reduction in the home's value. Similarly affected homeowners are authorized to file class actions. (d) Class Actions - Homeowners can file suit under this section in Federal district court where their home is located. \n(e) Remedy - Homeowners can recover the reduction in their home's value caused by the activity, not exceeding the median value of nearby homes. \n(f) Attorneys Fees - Homeowners receiving compensation are entitled to reasonable attorney's fees and costs. \n(g) Injunction - Compensation may be provided along with an injunction. (g) In addition to compensation, the court may enjoin activities that violate Federal laws. (h) The US district court has jurisdiction over actions under this section. (i) Frivolous lawsuits may result in the plaintiff paying the defendant's attorney fees. The court may order the plaintiff to pay the defendant's attorney fees and other expenses. No action can be brought after 5 years and $10,000 in value reduction for private homes. The Act does not limit other legal claims or make filing a suit a condition for compensation. Compensation under this Act is not required for any other legal claims. The Act applies to permits, licenses, approvals issued by agencies and contracts, leases, or arrangements entered into after 180 days from the enactment. The Act defines key terms such as \"agency,\" \"potential to reduce the value,\" and \"private home,\" emphasizing the impact of activities on private homes. The term \"value\" refers to the difference in fair market value of a home with and without certain activities. \"Person\" includes individuals, corporations, partnerships, or other entities, excluding government agencies."
