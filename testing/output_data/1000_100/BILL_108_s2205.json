    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS. The Congress finds that Ukraine allows its citizens the right to emigrate with minimal taxes, has been compliant with freedom of emigration requirements since 1997, and has made progress towards democracy and a free-market economy since 1991. The OSCE is committed to developing governance in Europe based on human rights principles. Ukraine has made progress in meeting international standards in recent elections, but challenges remain such as illegal interference and intimidation. Ukraine, as an OSCE participating state, is dedicated to addressing national issues. Ukraine has enacted legislation to protect against discrimination and incitement to violence based on national, racial, ethnic, or religious grounds. It has also committed to ensuring freedom of religion and combating intolerance and hatred. Ukraine is cooperating with US NGOs to combat ethnic and religious intolerance. Ukraine is progressing in the restitution of religious properties confiscated during the Soviet era, facilitating the revival of minority groups, and developing a legislative framework for this process. It has normal trade relations with the US and is working towards accession to the World Trade Organization, addressing issues like access for US agricultural products and intellectual property protection. Ukraine has enacted protections for labor rights, committed to respecting freedom of the press as an OSCE member, and established positive relations with neighboring countries. Ukraine aims for European integration, democracy, and prosperity for its citizens. It has cooperated with the US in peacekeeping operations in Europe and the fight against international terrorism. The President may determine that Title IV of the Trade Act of 1974 should no longer apply to Ukraine and extend permanent normal trade relations treatment to the country's products. This would cease the application of Title IV to Ukraine. The Congress urges Ukraine to fulfill its commitments as an OSCE member, including promoting free emigration, safeguarding religious liberty, combating discrimination and violence, restoring religious properties, and upholding media freedoms. The Congress urges Ukraine to work on improving various areas, including respecting media freedoms, protecting intellectual property rights, resolving trade disputes quickly, and monitoring human rights and rule of law issues. The Congress urges Ukraine to engage in annual discussions with the United States and Ukrainian nongovernmental organizations on activities in Ukraine. SEC. 4. REPORTING REQUIREMENT. The reports required by sections 102(b) and 203 of the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 shall include an assessment of certain issues. SEC. 5. CONTINUED ENJOYMENT OF RIGHTS UNDER THE JUNE 23, 1992, BILATERAL TRADE AGREEMENT. The trade agreement between the United States and Ukraine remains in force, providing specific safeguard rules for import surges. Section 421 of the Trade Act of 1974 applies to Ukraine, similar to China. Congressional oversight is required for WTO accession negotiations. The President must notify Congress within 5 days of a bilateral agreement with Ukraine on WTO accession terms. A report must be transmitted within 15 days of the agreement. If a resolution of disapproval is introduced within 30 days, it will be considered. The resolution of disapproval for the agreement between the United States and Ukraine on WTO accession terms must be considered by Congress. It is a joint resolution that expresses Congress's view that the agreement does not sufficiently benefit the United States. Procedures for considering resolutions of disapproval are outlined, including introduction and referral in the House of Representatives. In the House of Representatives, a resolution of disapproval can be introduced by any Member, referred to the Committee on Ways and Means and the Committee on Rules, and cannot be amended by either committee. In the Senate, a resolution of disapproval can be introduced by any Member, referred to the Committee on Finance, and may not be amended. The provisions of subsections (c) through (f) of section 152 of the Trade Act of 1974 apply to a resolution of disapproval to the same extent as such subsections apply to resolutions under such section. Subsection (b) is enacted by Congress as part of the rules of each House and supersedes other rules to the extent necessary. The rules of each House can be changed at any time, superseding other rules if inconsistent, while still respecting constitutional rights."
