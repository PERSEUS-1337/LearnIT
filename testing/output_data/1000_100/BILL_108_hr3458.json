    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Diabetic Retinopathy Prevention Act of 2003\". The Congress finds that type 2 diabetes affects millions of Americans, leading to diabetic retinopathy which can cause blindness. The risk of diabetic retinopathy increases with the duration of diabetes, and early detection is crucial as clinical trials have shown. Clinical trials have shown that early detection and treatment of diabetic retinopathy can reduce vision loss by 90 percent. Remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy has the potential to reach diabetic patients in rural or underserved areas without access to in-office eye examinations. Medicare coverage will now include remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy, allowing for early detection and treatment to reach diabetic patients in rural or underserved areas. The new Medicare coverage includes remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy, allowing for early detection through annual diagnostic examinations of the retina provided via a telecommunications system by qualified healthcare professionals. The new Medicare coverage allows for remote assessments of diabetic retinopathy using store-and-forward technologies for asynchronous transmission of health care information. Interim payment will be provided until a final regulation is published by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will conduct a study on the costs of remote assessments for diabetic retinopathy services, including per-patient and start-up costs. A report with recommendations will be submitted to Congress within two years of the enactment of the Act. The study conducted by the Secretary of Health and Human Services will include recommendations on the adequacy of reimbursements for remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy under Medicare and whether the study should be repeated and how frequently. The amendments made by subsection (a) will apply to assessments performed 30 days after the enactment of the Act. \"Medicaid coverage for remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy.\" The amendment to the Social Security Act now includes remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy. The effective date for these changes is upon the enactment of the Act. States needing legislation to comply with this requirement will not be penalized for not meeting it immediately. States must comply with the new requirement for remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy by the first day of the first calendar quarter after the first regular session of the State legislature following the enactment of the Act. Each year of a 2-year legislative session is considered a separate regular session. SEC. 5. MOBILE DIABETIC RETINOPATHY SCREENING PILOT PROGRAM. Amends Title III of the Public Health Service Act to establish a pilot program for mobile diabetic retinopathy screening. The Secretary will establish a grant program called the \"Mobile Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Pilot Program\" to fund 5 eligible entities for mobile diabetic retinopathy screening programs. Grants cannot exceed $1,000,000 per year, and entities must use the funds for project implementation. Applications must be submitted within 90 days of funding availability. The Secretary will publish a notice for grant applications specifying required information. Eligible entities must submit applications with required information. Priority will be given to applicants with experience in diabetic retinopathy evaluation using telecommunications equipment and proposing to serve rural, impoverished, minority, and remote populations. The Secretary must notify Congress before granting funds for the Mobile Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Pilot Program. An advisory committee will evaluate the program's effectiveness in detecting diabetic retinopathy early. The advisory committee will evaluate the effectiveness of preventative measures in decreasing diabetic retinopathy prevalence and severity. The program may serve as a model for similar screening programs for diabetes complications and other chronic conditions. A report will be submitted to Congress within 42 months of the first grant. The advisory committee, eligible entities, and mobile diabetic retinopathy screening program are defined terms in the legislation. The Mobile Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Pilot Program, established under the Social Security Act, is for eligible entities serving patients in rural, underserved, and remote areas. The Program is mobile and authorized appropriations of $5,000,000 for fiscal years 2005 through 2009."
