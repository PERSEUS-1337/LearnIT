    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Alternative Energy Refueling System Act of 2006\" and pertains to alternative energy refueling systems. The Solid Waste Disposal Act is amended to include definitions for alternative energy refueling systems, which are used to refuel vehicles with compressed natural gas, E-85 ethanol, or other specified fuels. The Administrator will establish a program to provide reimbursement to eligible entities from the Trust Fund for purchasing and installing alternative energy refueling systems at service stations or facilities. The program will reimburse eligible entities for purchasing and installing alternative energy refueling systems, with specific application requirements and timing for reimbursement verification. The Administrator will provide reimbursement to eligible entities for installing operational alternative energy refueling systems, with limitations on receiving dual benefits. The Administrator will reimburse eligible entities for installing up to 2 alternative energy refueling systems per facility, with restrictions on receiving reimbursement if the system cost was factored into tax credit calculations. The reimbursement for alternative energy refueling systems is capped at 30% of the system cost or $30,000, with no impact on other trust fund projects or activities. The Administrator shall not use Trust Fund funds obligated for other projects. Responsibilities of owners/operators remain unaffected. Amendment to the Internal Revenue Code is specified."
