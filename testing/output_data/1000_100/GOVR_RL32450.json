    "content": "More than 53,000 commercial vessels travel the world's waters, regulated by international protocols and U.S. laws to prevent pollution. Concerns exist about enforcement adequacy and jurisdictional differences, with a focus on the environmental impact of the cruise industry. The cruise industry, representing a small fraction of the global shipping industry, contributes significantly to the U.S. economy. In 2010, there were 14.3 million cruise passengers worldwide, with a fleet of over 230 ships, mostly foreign-flagged. Six companies own nearly 95% of passenger ships in U.S. waters, raising concerns about environmental impacts. The cruise ship industry in the U.S. is dominated by six companies owning 95% of passenger ships. New ships are added each year, increasing in size and luxury. The average ship size has been growing by 90 feet every five years, with ships over 1,050 feet long and weighing 130,000 tons entering the market. Safety and environmental concerns arise due to the large volume of waste generated by these \"floating cities\" carrying thousands of passengers and crew. The cruise ship industry, dominated by six companies, generates a significant amount of waste including sewage, graywater, hazardous wastes, solid waste, and oily bilge water. Environmental advocates are concerned about the adequacy of laws for managing these wastes, citing weak enforcement. A 2000 GAO report highlighted illegal discharge cases by foreign-flag cruise ships in U.S. waters between 1993 and 1998. The GAO reviewed illegal discharge cases by foreign-flag ships, including cruise ships, over a six-year period. 83% of cases involved oil or oil-based products, with volumes ranging from a few drops to hundreds of gallons. 72% of discharges were accidental, 15% intentional, and 13% undetermined. Cruise ships accounted for 4% of the cases, leading to criminal prosecutions and fines. In 2000, environmental groups petitioned the EPA to address pollution by cruise ships, leading to a study on cruise ship discharges and waste management. In December 2008, the EPA released a report summarizing findings on cruise ship waste streams and options to address ship discharges. This report discusses cruise ship pollution, including various waste streams and contaminants generated by cruise ships. It highlights the complex body of international and domestic laws addressing this issue, with some gaps in regulation. The report also mentions legislative activities in Alaskan waters and other states, as well as efforts by cruise ship companies to prevent illegal waste discharges through waste management plans. Environmental critics have acknowledged these initiatives while petitioning for further government action. Environmental groups have endorsed legislation to regulate cruise ship waste discharges, including sewage, graywater, hazardous wastes, and air pollutants. Despite efforts to control these waste streams, stricter standards are needed to protect human health and aquatic life. Cruise ships have the potential to threaten human health and damage aquatic life with their waste discharges, particularly sewage, graywater, and solid waste. While they represent a small portion of the shipping industry, their concentrated activities in specific coastal areas could have a significant local impact. Sewage and graywater from cruise ships can contain harmful bacteria, viruses, and nutrients that can contaminate fisheries and shellfish beds, posing risks to public health. Cruise ships generate large volumes of sewage and graywater daily, which can lead to oxygen depletion in water and harm aquatic life. Graywater from cruise ships contains various pollutants, including fecal coliform bacteria, detergents, oil, grease, metals, organics, petroleum hydrocarbons, nutrients, and medical waste. EPA and Alaska state sampling found untreated graywater can have high pollutant levels, with fecal coliform bacteria concentrations 1-3 times higher than in domestic wastewater. Cruise ships produce an average of 67 gallons/day/person of graywater, significantly more than residential generation. Graywater poses environmental risks due to nutrient concentrations and oxygen-demanding materials, being the primary liquid waste source on cruise ships. Solid waste generated on cruise ships includes glass, paper, cardboard, aluminum, steel cans, and plastics, which can be hazardous. Cruise ships manage solid waste through source reduction, waste minimization, and recycling, but up to 75% is incinerated on board. The ash is typically discharged at sea, posing a threat to marine life. Marine organisms can be injured or killed by entanglement with plastics and other solid waste from cruise ships. Each cruise ship passenger generates at least two pounds of non-hazardous waste. Cruise ships generate large amounts of solid waste, with each passenger producing two pounds of non-hazardous waste per day. A large cruise ship can generate 8 tons of solid waste during a one-week cruise. Approximately 24% of the solid waste from vessels worldwide comes from cruise ships. Most cruise ship garbage is treated on board, but hazardous waste is also produced from various activities on board. Port reception facilities can be strained by the off-loading of cruise ship waste. Hazardous wastes on cruise ships come from activities like photo processing, dry-cleaning, and equipment cleaning, leading to the generation of discarded chemicals, medical waste, batteries, fluorescent lights, and paints. These wastes contain substances like hydrocarbons, heavy metals, and solvents, posing a threat to marine organisms if not managed properly. Oil leaks from engine spaces mix with water in the bilge, creating a potential environmental hazard. Oil, gasoline, and byproducts from the breakdown of petroleum products in the bilge of ships can harm marine life and human health. Chemicals in bilge water, including oil, detergents, and degreasers, are toxic to marine organisms. Large vessels can generate significant amounts of oily bilge water, posing a threat to the environment. Bilge water on ships needs to be extracted of oil before discharge to prevent environmental damage. Faulty separators or bypassing them can lead to untreated oily bilge water being released into the ocean, causing harm to marine life. Cruise ships have faced environmental violations due to this issue. Large tankers and bulk cargo carriers use ballast water to stabilize the vessel during transport. This water is taken on in coastal waters and discharged at the next port, containing biological materials that can harm aquatic ecosystems. Ballast water discharge is a major source of invasive species in U.S. marine waters. Cruise ships are a leading source of invasive species in U.S. marine waters, causing public health, environmental, and economic risks. The economic cost from pest mollusks introduction alone is about $2.2 billion per year. Air pollution from cruise ships comes from diesel engines burning high sulfur fuel, emitting harmful pollutants. Further study is needed to understand the role of cruise ships in introducing non-native species. EPA classifies diesel exhaust as a likely human carcinogen due to emissions from marine diesel engines contributing to air pollution, visibility degradation, and water pollution. Ocean-going vessels account for a significant portion of nitrogen oxide, particulate, and sulfur dioxide emissions in the United States. International shipping is estimated to contribute 2.7% of global carbon dioxide emissions. Maritime vessels contribute to global carbon dioxide emissions, as well as black carbon and nitrogen oxides. Environmental pressures on ships come from states and localities assessing their impact on regional air quality. Cruise ship emissions can have significant local impacts, especially in coastal areas. Shipboard incinerators burn waste and may release toxic emissions. The waste streams generated by cruise ships are governed by international protocols and U.S. domestic laws. The International Maritime Organization sets maritime vessel safety and pollution standards under MARPOL 73/78. Cruise ships flagged under MARPOL signatory countries must adhere to its requirements. Ships flagged under MARPOL signatory countries must comply with its regulations, covering pollution prevention by oil, control of noxious liquid substances, packaging standards, sewage control, and garbage disposal. Member nations are responsible for vessels registered under their nationalities, but international objectives require ratification and implementation by sovereign states. MARPOL Annexes cover pollution control measures for ships, including regulations on sewage, garbage disposal, emissions limits, and ozone-depleting substances. Compliance with Annexes is voluntary, requiring ratification by member countries representing at least 50% of the world's gross tonnage. Amendments can be proposed and adopted following specified procedures. All six Annexes have been ratified, with the most recent, Annex VI, taking effect in May 2005. The United States has ratified multiple Annexes. The United States has ratified Annexes I, II, III, V, and VI of MARPOL, with no action taken on Annex IV. The country where a ship is registered is responsible for certifying compliance with pollution prevention standards. IMO has established conventions on various issues like ballast water management and safety codes. Each nation must enact domestic laws to implement the convention and comply with related laws. In the US, the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships implements MARPOL provisions. The United States ratified Annexes I, II, III, V, and VI of MARPOL. In April 2006, the Senate ratified Annex VI, regulating air pollution. In July 2008, Congress approved legislation to implement Annex VI standards through EPA regulations. The Coast Guard enforces regulations for U.S.-flagged and foreign-flagged vessels in U.S. waters. The United States enforces regulations to implement MARPOL in its waters, separate from other environmental laws. International nature of maritime shipping poses challenges in compliance verification. US can take enforcement action against foreign-flagged ships for pollution incidents within its jurisdiction. Coordination with flag states is required for incidents outside US jurisdiction. The United States enforces MARPOL regulations in its waters, requiring coordination with flag states for incidents outside its jurisdiction. Various federal agencies have jurisdiction over cruise ships, with the Coast Guard, EPA, and Department of Justice playing key roles. The Department of State represents the US at international meetings and pursues foreign-flag violations. NOAA also has a limited role in working with the Coast Guard. The NOAA, Coast Guard, and EPA collaborate to report on marine debris effects. The APHIS ensures quarantine inspection and disposal of food-contaminated garbage. U.S. laws like the Clean Water Act regulate cruise ship discharges through the NPDES program. In accordance with the Clean Water Act, pollutant discharges from vessels are prohibited without an NPDES permit. Sewage discharges from cruise ships are exempt but prohibited from dumping untreated sewage within 3 miles of shore. Section 312 of the act mandates marine sanitation devices on vessels to prevent untreated sewage discharge, enforced by EPA and the Coast Guard. EPA sets performance standards for these devices. The EPA and Coast Guard regulate marine sanitation devices (MSDs) on vessels to prevent untreated sewage discharge. MSDs are designed to either hold sewage for shore-based disposal or treat sewage before discharge. Type II MSDs treat waste before discharge, while Type III MSDs store waste for later treatment onshore or outside U.S. waters. Type I MSDs disinfect raw sewage before discharge. Type I MSDs disinfect raw sewage on recreational vessels or those under 65 feet in length to meet fecal coliform bacteria standards. Regulations, unchanged since 1976, lack monitoring requirements for effluent discharges, criticized for only covering bacterial contaminants and suspended solids. Critics note NPDES permits for other sources regulate a wider range of pollutants like chemicals, heavy metals, and oil, with stricter monitoring and reporting obligations. The Coast Guard, responsible for inspecting cruise ships and other vessels for compliance with MSD rules, has been criticized for poor enforcement of Section 312 requirements. GAO reported limitations in inspectors' ability to detect violations, including focus on safety, limited time for inspections, and lack of surprise element. Since the September 11 terrorist attacks, the Coast Guard has shifted focus to homeland security activities, reducing resources for vessel inspections for MSD and environmental compliance. Annex IV of MARPOL regulates sewage discharges from ships, requiring sewage treatment plants, comminuting systems, or holding tanks on cruise ships. Annex IV of MARPOL regulates sewage discharges from ships, requiring sewage treatment systems or holding tanks. Vessels must comply with specific discharge regulations within certain distances from shore, with less stringent requirements allowed in some jurisdictions. The United States has not ratified Annex IV, making it optional for ships in U.S. waters to follow these regulations. In U.S. waters, cruise ships must comply with regulations implementing Section 312 of the Clean Water Act. Some ships use Advanced Wastewater Treatment systems for sewage treatment, which are effective in removing various substances. No-discharge zones can also be established to prohibit sewage discharges from vessels. The state can create a no-discharge zone to prevent sewage discharges from vessels by applying to the EPA under specific categories based on environmental protection needs. This includes ensuring pumpout facilities are available for safe sewage removal. Special waters with environmental importance may also be designated as no-discharge zones without the need to show pumpout availability. The EPA can designate no-discharge zones to prevent sewage discharges from vessels in specific environmental protection categories. This designation has been used to protect areas like the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary and the Hudson River in New York. Options to address sewage from cruise ships include revising discharge standards, restricting discharge distances, and requiring testing of wastewater treatment equipment. Under current federal law, graywater is not defined as a pollutant and is not considered sewage. The Clean Water Act includes graywater in its definition of sewage for regulating commercial vessels in the Great Lakes. Alaska requires graywater treatment before discharge, and EPA issued a general permit for large commercial vessels with restrictions on graywater discharges. The National Marine Sanctuaries Act authorizes NOAA to designate areas where graywater discharges may be restricted to protect sensitive ecosystems. EPA identified options for addressing graywater discharges from cruise ships, including establishing standards, geographic restrictions, monitoring, and penalties. Cruise ship solid waste discharges are governed by two laws. The Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA) and the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS) regulate waste disposal from cruise ships and other vessels. MPRSA requires permits for dumping garbage into ocean waters, but exempts routine effluent discharge. EPA issues permits for sea disposal, while the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers handles dredged material. No MPRSA permit is needed for solid waste discharge beyond U.S. jurisdiction. The Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS) regulates waste disposal from cruise ships, prohibiting discharge of garbage within certain distances from shore and plastic anywhere. It applies to all vessels in U.S. navigable waters and the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), enforced by the Coast Guard. EPA has identified discharges of solid waste and plastic from cruise ships, prompting evaluation by the IMO to amend MARPOL Annex V. EPA has suggested options to address solid waste from cruise ships in the 2008 Discharge Assessment Report. Several options to address solid waste from cruise ships include increasing on-board garbage handling technologies, implementing stronger waste management plans, prohibiting discharge of incinerator ash into U.S. waters, expanding port reception facilities, and enforcing no discharge of solid waste into the marine environment through monitoring and sanctions. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) governs hazardous waste management, imposing requirements on generators, transporters, and disposal facilities. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) regulates hazardous waste management for generators, transporters, and disposal facilities, including treatment, storage, and disposal facilities. Cruise ships may be subject to RCRA rules as generators and/or transporters of hazardous waste, facing challenges in waste identification, proper party identification, and compliance with RCRA requirements. Hazardous wastes generated onboard cruise ships are stored until offloaded for recycling or disposal. Cruise ships generate hazardous wastes from various activities like cleaning, painting, and passenger services. It is unclear which regulations apply to manage and dispose of these wastes. RCRA rules for small-quantity generators are less strict than those for large-quantity generators. The management of hazardous wastes on cruise ships poses challenges in waste identification and compliance with RCRA requirements. Some cruise companies argue they should be classified as \"conditionally exempt small-quantity generators\" due to generating less than 100 kilograms of hazardous waste per month. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) could be triggered by a release of hazardous substances from cruise ships, but it has not been used in response to such incidents. Notification is required for releases of hazardous substances into waters of the United States or the contiguous zone that may present substantial danger. EPA has identified 500 wastes as hazardous substances and issued rules on reportable quantities, covering releases as small as 1 pound of some substances. CERCLA authorizes the President to remove and provide remedial action for releases, including hazardous waste discharges from cruise ships. Additionally, hazardous waste discharges from cruise ships are subject to Section 311 of the Clean Water Act, which prohibits the discharge of harmful quantities of hazardous substances into navigable waters. In the 2008 Discharge Assessment Report, EPA proposed options to address hazardous wastes, including establishing standards to reduce contaminants in hazardous wastes on cruise ships and increasing inspections of authorized facilities. Section 311 of the Clean Water Act prohibits the discharge of oil or hazardous substances into U.S. navigable waters or the contiguous zone. Coast Guard regulations prohibit oil discharge within 12 miles from shore unless passed through an oil water separator. Beyond 12 miles, oil can be discharged if the content is less than 100 ppm. Vessels must maintain an Oil Record Book to record oily residue disposal. The Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships applies to all U.S. and foreign flagged vessels operating in U.S. navigable waters. The Coast Guard regulations prohibit oil discharge within 12 miles from shore unless passed through an oil water separator. Beyond 12 miles, oil can be discharged if the content is less than 100 ppm. The Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS) applies to all U.S. and foreign flagged vessels operating in U.S. navigable waters. However, most cruise lines, which are foreign registered, have limited applicability to APPS regulations due to their operations outside U.S. navigable waters. Cruise lines have policies restricting discharges of machinery space waste within three miles from shore. EPA identified options for addressing oily bilge water from cruise ships in the 2008 Discharge Assessment Report. In January 1999, various groups petitioned EPA to regulate ballast water discharge under the Clean Water Act due to the introduction of invasive species. EPA rejected the petition in September 2003, citing the long-standing \"normal operation\" exclusion. EPA rejected a petition in September 2003 to regulate ballast water discharge under the Clean Water Act, citing the \"normal operation\" exclusion as long-standing agency policy. Congress did not alter EPA's interpretation in 1979 and 1996. Efforts to limit ballast water discharges became mandatory in 2004, with all vessels required to have a management plan. Environmental groups filed a lawsuit in 2005 to rescind the regulation exempting ballast water discharges from CWA permitting, leading to a federal court ruling in their favor in 2006. In 2005, environmental groups filed a lawsuit challenging EPA's permitting exemption for ballast water discharges. The court ruled in their favor in 2006, ordering EPA to rescind the exemption by September 30, 2008. This ruling also applies to other vessel discharges like graywater and bilge water. In response, EPA issued the Vessel General Permit (VGP) in December 2008, covering around 69,000 large recreational and commercial vessels. The VGP applies to pollutant discharges from non-recreational vessels over 79 feet in length, including tankers, freighters, barges, and cruise ships. It covers discharges into U.S. waters and includes 26 types of waste streams such as aquatic nuisance species, nutrients, pathogens, oil, metals, and toxic pollutants. The VGP regulates pollutant discharges from non-recreational vessels over 79 feet in length, including tankers, freighters, barges, and cruise ships. It covers 26 types of waste streams such as aquatic nuisance species, nutrients, pathogens, oil, metals, and toxic pollutants. Best management practices (BMPs) are used to control most waste streams, with specific requirements for ballast water and bilge water discharges. Monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting are required, but sewage discharges are regulated separately under CWA Section 312. The VGP regulates pollutant discharges from non-recreational vessels over 79 feet in length, including cruise ships. It includes detailed requirements for certain discharges like graywater and pool water, with BMPs and effluent limits for fecal coliform and chlorine. Operational limits are also set for graywater discharges in nutrient-impaired waters. Legislation was considered by the 110th Congress for a national approach to ballast water discharge issues. The 110th Congress considered legislation to regulate species in ballast water, but some groups opposed it due to concerns about preempting state programs and lack of citizen suit provisions. The Clean Air Act addresses air quality concerns by setting health-based standards and national emission standards. In February 2003, EPA established emission standards for new marine diesel engines on large vessels, including cruise ships. The standards were a result of litigation by the environmental group Bluewater Network. The rule aligns with international standards for nitrogen oxides. Large vessels, such as container ships and tankers, were not previously regulated by EPA. The EPA established emission standards for new marine diesel engines on large vessels, including cruise ships, in 2003. This rule was part of several EPA regulations under the Clean Air Act for nonroad engines and vehicles. The EPA planned to review and implement more stringent emission standards for very large marine engines and vessels in the future to align with international efforts through the IMO. Environmental groups criticized the EPA for excluding foreign-flagged vessels from the regulations. The EPA faced criticism for excluding foreign-flagged vessels from marine diesel engine rules in 2003, which were upheld in June 2004. The 110th Congress enacted legislation to implement MARPOL Annex VI, and in October 2008, the IMO adopted amendments to establish new global nitrogen oxide and fuel sulfur standards. In December 2009, EPA made changes to the 2003 CAA rules. In December 2009, EPA revised the 2003 CAA rules for Category 3 marine engines to align with IMO requirements, setting emissions standards for hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide. The rule applies to newly built engines on U.S.-flagged vessels. In October 2010, the IMO approved the designation of U.S. Caribbean waters as an ECA, subjecting ships to stricter emission limits for sulfur. Operating in designated areas would be subject to stricter emission limitations for sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter starting in 2014. Various laws and regulations apply to different geographic areas, such as the Clean Water Act's definition of navigable waters and territorial seas. President Reagan's 1988 proclamation extended the territorial sea of the United States to 12 nautical miles from the baseline. The Clean Water Act's definition of the contiguous zone extends from the baseline to not beyond 12 miles. In 1999, President Clinton doubled the width of the contiguous zone to 24 nautical miles for enforcing customs, immigration, or sanitary laws at sea. This proclamation did not amend any statutory definitions. The Clean Water Act defines the territorial sea as 3 miles wide and the contiguous zone from 3 to 12 miles. CERCLA includes the territorial seas in its definition of \"navigable waters.\" Limits of jurisdiction are crucial as they determine where specific laws apply. The MPRSA defines \"ocean waters\" as the open seas beyond the baseline of the territorial sea. The Clean Water Act and other related regulations govern discharges into navigable waters, including sewage, oil, hazardous substances, and garbage. The MPRSA regulates ocean dumping within 12 nautical miles from the baseline. In Alaska, cruise ship pollution has raised concerns due to a significant increase in passengers during the 1990s. The Clean Water Act and MPRSA regulate discharges into ocean waters, with differences in measurement units between nautical miles and statute miles. In July 1999, Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines pleaded guilty to environmental violations in Alaska, including discharging oil and hazardous substances. They were fined $6.5 million as part of an $18 million federal plea agreement for violations in multiple locations. Concerns over cruise ship pollution led to a program in Alaska to monitor waste streams, revealing that most ships' waste treatment systems were not functioning well. In 2000, a study found that waste treatment systems on most ships did not meet standards, with fecal coliform levels in blackwater and graywater far exceeding Coast Guard limits. Legislation was passed in December 2000 to address these issues, setting standards for large vessels and prohibiting untreated sewage and graywater discharge in Alaskan waters. EPA was authorized to enforce these regulations. The legislation passed in December 2000 set standards for sewage and graywater discharges from cruise ships in Alaskan waters. Until EPA issues regulations, ships can only discharge treated sewage while traveling at least 6 knots and 1 nautical mile from shore, with specific limits on fecal coliforms and total suspended solids. Vessels with advanced treatment systems can discharge closer to shore and at slower speeds, but must meet stricter effluent standards. The legislation passed in December 2000 set standards for sewage and graywater discharges from cruise ships in Alaskan waters. The Coast Guard issued regulations in 2001, stipulating minimum effluent standards and sampling requirements for vessel operators. EPA conducted a project to evaluate treatment systems for cruise ships in Alaska. The EPA conducted sampling of wastewater from cruise ships in Alaska to assess graywater and sewage treatment systems' performance. Results showed that advanced treatment systems effectively treat various contaminants. EPA collaborated with Alaska on plume tracking surveys and studies to estimate dilution of discharges from docked cruise ships. The state of Alaska enacted its own law in 2001 to regulate the discharge of blackwater and graywater from ships. The law sets standards and sampling requirements, with effluent standards for large cruise ships implemented in 2001 and for large vessels in 2003. The state of Alaska enacted a law in 2001 to regulate ship discharge, with effluent standards for large cruise ships implemented in 2001 and for large vessels in 2003. Small ships were given three years to comply with effluent standards. Large ships have improved wastewater discharge by installing advanced treatment systems or holding wastewater for discharge outside Alaskan waters. The state of Alaska has seen a dramatic improvement in wastewater discharge from large cruise ships, but small ships have not installed new treatment systems, leading to discharge levels of pollutants exceeding water quality standards. Test results show risks to aquatic life and human health. In 2006, Alaska voters approved a citizen initiative for cruise lines to pay taxes and fines for violations, with revenues benefiting local communities affected by tourism. Revenues from taxes on cruise ships in Alaska will support local communities and public services. The initiative aims to address environmental harm caused by the cruise industry. Legal challenges have been filed against the tax. Some cruise lines have stopped operating in Alaskan waters due to the initiative. Alaska enacted legislation in 2009 to improve wastewater treatment standards for cruise ships. Other states are also taking action to regulate cruise ship discharges. In April 2004, Maine enacted legislation regulating cruise ship discharges into coastal waters, applying to large ships with accommodations for 250+ passengers. Vessels must have advanced wastewater treatment systems, comply with federal laws, and obtain a permit from the state Department of Environmental Protection to enter state waters after January 1, 2006. Maine also required EPA designation of up to 50 No Discharge Zones. Maine applied to EPA for up to 50 No Discharge Zones to prohibit blackwater discharges. California passed laws banning cruise ship discharges, graywater releases, waste incinerators, sewage sludge, oil bilge water, hazardous wastes, and set ballast water standards. California S.B. 497 mandates ballast water performance standards by January 2008, requiring removal of invasive species by 2020. States like Florida, Washington, and Hawaii have agreements with the cruise industry for waste management practices. For instance, a 2001 agreement in Florida requires cruise lines to stop wastewater discharges within 4 nautical miles, report hazardous waste annually, and undergo environmental inspections by the U.S. Coast Guard. In April 2004, Washington Department of Ecology, Northwest Cruise Ship Association, and Port of Seattle signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) allowing cruise ships to discharge treated wastewater into state waters, with restrictions on untreated wastewater and sludge. Environmental advocates criticize voluntary agreements for lacking enforcement, but states argue that federal law permits such agreements with stricter requirements. In June 2009, the Department of Ecology reported that most cruise ships visiting the state in 2008 complied with the MOU. The cruise ship industry has mostly complied with the MOU to stop discharging untreated wastewater in Washington during the 2008 sailing season. Wastewater treatment systems produce high-quality effluent, and pressure from environmental advocates has led to initiatives for waste management practices by members of the Cruise Lines International Association. The cruise ship industry has implemented guidelines for wastewater discharge, hazardous waste disposal, and safety management systems certified by the IMO. They are also collaborating with manufacturers and regulators to develop eco-friendly technologies. Environmental groups appreciate the industry's efforts but prefer enforceable standards over voluntary ones. The cruise ship industry, in collaboration with Conservation International, formed the Ocean Conservation and Tourism Alliance to address conservation issues. Efforts include improving wastewater management, protecting cruise destinations, raising awareness among passengers and crew, and educating vendors on environmental impacts. A joint initiative in 2006 focused on developing a map integrating sensitive marine areas into cruise line routes, particularly in the Caribbean and Mediterranean regions. Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. announced plans to retrofit its fleet with advanced wastewater treatment technology in 2004, becoming the first cruise line to do so. This initiative was in response to environmental violations in the 1990s, resulting in $27 million in criminal fines. Concerns about cruise ship pollution raise issues for Congress in laws and regulations, research needs, and oversight and enforcement. The curr_chunk discusses the adequacy of laws and regulations, research needs, and oversight and enforcement of existing programs related to cruise ship pollution. It highlights the need for further assessment of existing conditions and whether current measures are sufficient. The key issue is whether current laws and regulations adequately address cruise ship pollution management or if legislative changes are necessary to address gaps and strengthen requirements. EPA's 2000 white paper noted that certain waste streams from cruise ships are regulated, but others like graywater are excluded or not adequately addressed. Graywater contamination on cruise ships, including fecal coliform, bacteria, heavy metals, and dissolved plastics, has raised concerns. State officials found higher fecal coliform levels in graywater than in sewage lines. The U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy recommended clear, uniform requirements for controlling wastewater discharge from large passenger vessels, advocating for new statutory regulations. The Clean Cruise Ship Act proposed uniform discharge standards and waste management procedures for cruise vessels, with required sampling, testing, and monitoring. It aimed to prohibit cruise ships from discharging sewage, graywater, or bilge water into U.S. waters without meeting prescribed effluent limits and management standards. The legislation did not progress in Congress. The Clean Cruise Ship Act proposed strict effluent limits for sewage, graywater, and bilge water discharges from cruise vessels, requiring wastewater treatment and federal enforcement. Passenger fees would fund EPA and Coast Guard implementation. Industry argues existing standards are sufficient, while environmental advocates support the legislation. Congress may need to develop federal legislation to harmonize state-level regulations on cruise ship discharges. EPA has been assessing the need for additional standards for sewage and graywater discharges from large cruise ships, but has not yet proposed any rules. EPA's Cruise Ship Discharge Assessment Report examines five waste streams and their management. The report discusses waste streams management and federal actions to address cruise ship discharges. Possible options are identified, but EPA has not determined their necessity or feasibility. Issues include harmonizing jurisdictional terms, defining \"cruise ship,\" and updating regulations for improved technology. Research can help improve understanding of waste generated by cruise ships, impacts of discharges, and new control technologies. The U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy highlighted the importance of research in identifying harm from vessel pollution and prioritizing resources. Research directions include transport of pollutants in the marine environment, small passenger vessel practices, and disposal options for concentrated sludge from sewage treatment. Disposal options for concentrated sludge from advanced sewage treatment on large passenger vessels and the cumulative impacts of vessel pollution on sensitive ecosystems, including coastal areas and coral reefs. EPA's 2008 Cruise Ship Assessment Report suggested research options to address air emissions in ports and inland waterways, focusing on nationwide sampling, human health effects, and potential cumulative impacts from multiple cruise ships. The 2000 GAO report highlighted the need for better enforcement of laws and regulations regarding cruise ship pollution. It emphasized the importance of monitoring discharges, increasing federal oversight, and ensuring proper maintenance of pollution prevention equipment. The Coast Guard plays a key role in enforcing federal programs related to cruise ship pollution. The Coast Guard's resources for homeland security missions, including vessel inspections, have been questioned since before 9/11. Possible enforcement options include improving monitoring, rewarding passengers for detecting illegal activities, and charging a fee for onboard marine engineers to observe ship waste treatment practices. EPA and GAO have raised concerns about cruise ship pollution control and enforcement. In its 2000 report, GAO found issues with the process for referring cruise ship violations to other countries, recommending that the Coast Guard collaborate with the IMO to ensure member countries respond to pollution cases and follow up on alleged pollution cases outside U.S. jurisdiction."
