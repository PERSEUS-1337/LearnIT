Congress finds the United States needs a robust scientific and technical enterprise, more scientists and engineers, improved education in science and mathematics, and a recommitment to research and development. The United States needs to prioritize leadership in science, mathematics, and engineering, particularly in areas like nanotechnology. Implementing a loan forgiveness program to attract students to careers in these fields, including teaching, can help maintain technological leadership. Establishment of program for loan forgiveness to attract students to careers in science, mathematics, and engineering, including teaching. The Secretary will implement a program to cover interest on loans for undergraduate students who meet specific criteria outlined in the Act. The Act covers interest on loans for undergraduate students who meet specific criteria, including being a teacher of STEM subjects or a STEM professional, and committing to 5 years of service in that role.
