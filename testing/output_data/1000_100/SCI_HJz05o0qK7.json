    "content": "Many machine learning algorithms use vector embeddings or discrete codes to represent input data. The assessment of compositionality in languages has been extensively studied, but there is a lack of tools in machine learning for measuring compositional structure in vector-valued representation spaces. A procedure is described for evaluating compositionality by approximating the true representation-producing model with a model that composes inferred representational primitives. This method is used to characterize compositional structure in various settings. The text discusses the exploration of compositional structure in various settings using representation learning techniques. It focuses on the relationship between compositionality and learning dynamics, human judgments, representational similarity, and generalization. The success of modern representation learning techniques has sparked interest in understanding the structure of learned representations, particularly in the context of complex concepts. The text explores the emergence of compositional structure in learning problems, particularly in representation learning techniques. It questions the extent to which learned encoding schemes are compositional and discusses the analysis of messages built from smaller pieces. This topic has been studied extensively, from early language evolution experiments to recent deep learning models. The text discusses the need for a standardized, formal, and quantitative technique to evaluate claims about compositional structure in learned representations. It introduces a formal framework for measuring how well representations reflect the compositional structure of model inputs in an oracle evaluation paradigm. The text introduces a formal framework called TRE to evaluate the compositional structure of model inputs through graded judgments. It optimizes over primitive meaning representations to find a compositional model that approximates the true model effectively. The paper introduces a tool called TRE to assess the compositionality of representations and presents experiments to explore the relationship between compositionality and learning. It aims to answer questions about how compositionality evolves during the learning process, how well it aligns with human judgments, its impact on distances between representations, and its role in generalization to out-of-distribution inputs. The paper concludes with a discussion on possible applications and generalizations of TRE-based analysis. The discussion in the curr_chunk focuses on the debate surrounding distributed representations and compositional phenomena, as well as the implementation of a compositional encoding scheme. Various approaches for compositional representation learning have been proposed, with the main experimental question being how compositionality arises in models without explicit composition operations. The need to determine the presence of compositional structure is highlighted, with existing proposals mainly coming from linguistics and philosophy. The curr_chunk discusses existing proposals from linguistics and philosophy for evaluating compositionality in formal and natural languages, focusing on linguistic representations and grammars. Machine learning research has responded to the absence of general procedures for answering questions about compositionality in various ways, including manual analyses of representation spaces and task-specific evaluations. Our work aims to provide a standard and scalable alternative to model-and task-specific evaluations for measuring compositionality in natural language processing. Other authors use surrogate measures like correlation between representation similarity and oracle compositional analyses, and generalization to structurally novel inputs. Our approach examines how these measures track stricter notions of compositionality. A long line of work in natural language processing focuses on learning composition functions to produce distributed representations of phrases and sentences for modeling purposes. This work is complementary to the framework presented here, which is agnostic to the choice of composition function. The approach demonstrates that existing NLP techniques for compositional representation learning can be applied to representations produced by other models, even in non-linguistic settings. The curr_chunk discusses the evaluation of the compositionality of representation systems in a communication task. It proposes an automated procedure to determine if the representations produced by a speaker model are compositional based on the structure of the input objects. This analysis is crucial for understanding how well the representations capture the input structure. The curr_chunk proposes an automated procedure to evaluate the compositionality of representation systems based on the structure of input objects. It defines a representation learning problem with dataset X, representations \u0398, and model f. The technique assumes prior knowledge of the compositional structure of inputs labeled with tree-structured derivations. The goal is to determine if the representations computed by f are compositional. The curr_chunk discusses how the compositionality of a model f is determined by the structure of D(x). It defines a composition operation \u03b8 a * \u03b8 b \u2192 \u03b8 in the space of representations and states that a model f is compositional if it is a homomorphism from inputs to representations. In linguistic contexts, it is shown that a fragment of language is compositional by exhibiting a lexicon D 0 mapping words to their meaning representations and a grammar for composing meanings. The curr_chunk discusses challenges in identifying lexicon entries and handling languages with irregular structures in semantic parsing. It highlights the need to identify primitive representations and compose them in language understanding tasks. The curr_chunk discusses the compositional nature of speaker models in language understanding tasks, emphasizing the need to assign primitive representations to produce accurate predictions. The quality of the approximation of predictions serves as a measure of compositionality, with well-approximated predictors being mostly compositional with a few exceptions. The curr_chunk discusses evaluating compositionality in models by measuring Tree Reconstruction Error (TRE) using parameters \u03b7 i to construct representations from parts. This evaluation metric captures the intuition behind the compositional nature of speaker models in language understanding tasks. The curr_chunk discusses optimizing over parts to measure how well compositional predictions match true model predictions. The choice of composition function is left to the evaluator, with caution needed to avoid trivial solutions. If D is injective, there is always a composition function that achieves TRE. The curr_chunk discusses the implementation details for models with continuous and differentiable parameters, including the use of gradient descent for solving equations. It also mentions the possibility of finding a continuous relaxation for discrete parameters. An SGD-based TRE solver is provided in the accompanying software release. The implementation of an SGD-based TRE solver is discussed in the accompanying software release. Task-specific optimizers can be used for different problems, such as machine translation alignment models. The paper explores using TRE to address compositionality in machine learning, focusing on the information bottleneck theory of representation learning proposed by BID45. This theory suggests that learning in deep models involves an error minimization phase followed by a compression phase, leading to a decrease in mutual information between inputs and their representations. The hypothesis is that the compression phase discovers a compositional representation of the input distribution. The compression phase isolates decision-relevant attributes from input distribution in a meta-learning framework. The model predicts classifiers for compositional visual concepts by minimizing logistic loss between logits and ground-truth labels. Visual concepts used are single attributes or conjunctions of attributes. The model predicts classifiers for compositional visual concepts by isolating decision-relevant attributes and minimizing logistic loss. Attributes include background color, digit color, digit identity, and stroke type. The training dataset consists of 9000 image triplets with a validation set of 500 examples. The model achieves a validation accuracy of 75.2% on average. The relationship between the information bottleneck and compositionality is explored by comparing TRE(X) to the mutual information I(\u03b8; x) between representations and inputs during training. The relationship between TRE(X) and mutual information I(\u03b8; X) is explored during training. Small TRE indicates high compositionality. Both mutual information and reconstruction error increase initially and decrease together after reaching a maximum. Compression in the information bottleneck framework is linked to discovering compositional representations. The text discusses the use of high-dimensional embeddings for natural language processing tasks and the exploration of compositional representations in phrase vectors. The focus is on identifying bigrams with low reconstruction error as compositional and well-explained by constituent words, while bigrams with high error are seen as non-compositional expressions. The analysis uses Total Reconstruction Error (TRE) to search for atomic representations. The text discusses the use of high-dimensional embeddings for natural language processing tasks and explores compositional representations in phrase vectors. It focuses on identifying compositional bigrams with low reconstruction error and non-compositional ones with high error using Total Reconstruction Error (TRE). The approach validates the use of TRE to search for atomic representations in a language processing context. The text discusses the use of high-dimensional embeddings for natural language processing tasks and explores compositional representations in phrase vectors. It focuses on identifying compositional bigrams with low reconstruction error using Total Reconstruction Error (TRE) and compares them with human judgments of compositionality. Results show an anticorrelation between TRE and human ratings, with specific collocations rated as most or least compositional. The text discusses the relationship between Total Reconstruction Error (TRE) and human judgments of compositionality in phrase vectors. It introduces the concept of topographic similarity and oracle derivations to analyze representations. The goal is to clarify the connection between the two evaluations by examining the correlation between distances in learned representations and their associated derivations. The text introduces a distance function for derivations in tree-structured representations. It claims that the tree edit distance is an approximate upper bound on the distance between representations. The proof is provided in the appendix. The text discusses the relationship between compositionality and generalization in communication games, focusing on the constraints imposed by compositionality on similarity judgments between representations. It empirically evaluates the claim that agents need compositional communication protocols to generalize to unseen referents. The experiment focuses on a reference game BID20 where a speaker and a listener are trained to communicate about target objects using discrete codes. The listener reconstructs the targets based on the speaker's message, with rewards given for correct predictions. The speaker and listener receive rewards for correct communication in a reference game using discrete codes. Policies are jointly trained with a policy gradient objective. Target referents consist of two objects with two attributes each. Some object pairs are held out during training for evaluation of generalization. Representations are fixed-length discrete codes with more complex semantics where order matters. The curr_chunk discusses the need for a different class of composition and distance operations in communication. It introduces a sequence of one-hot vectors to represent agent messages and a composition function with free parameters. It also mentions the limitations of compositional languages in achieving high performance. The curr_chunk discusses training runs with successful agents achieving rewards > 0.5 on held-out referents. Two languages with different TRE but similar listener performance are shown. By allowing arbitrary vectors in D0, both \u03b4 and * can be optimized. 100 speaker-listener pairs were trained with random initial parameters. Our results show a nuanced relationship between compositionality and generalization in training 100 speaker-listener pairs. TRE is correlated with generalization error and absolute model reward, indicating that \"compositional\" languages often stem from poor communication strategies. However, low TRE is not a necessary condition for good generalization. The technique can mine training runs for languages achieving good generalization at different levels of compositionality. A new evaluation method called TRE generates graded judgments on compositional structure in representation learning. TRE infers primitive meaning representations that approximate observed representations and measures the quality of this approximation. The analysis relates compositionality to learning dynamics, linguistic compositionality, similarity, and generalization, leaving many questions open. The author discusses the challenges in generalizing TRE without oracle derivations and hopes to inspire new research on understanding machine learning models and data distributions. Code and data for experiments are available online. The author, supported by a Facebook Graduate Fellowship, discusses few-shot classification using a CNN model trained with ADAM. Word embeddings are trained on NYT Gigaword data. Communication involves encoder and decoder RNNs with gated recurrent units. The model is trained with a policy gradient objective using ADAM with a learning rate of .001 and a batch size of 256. Each model is trained for 500 steps, sampling from the decoder's output distribution. Definitions for derivation size and tree edit distance are provided."
