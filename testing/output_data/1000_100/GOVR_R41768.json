    "content": "The federal parity law aims to ensure that coverage terms for mental health and substance use disorder services are no more restrictive than those for medical and surgical services. It consists of two laws: the Mental Health Parity Act of 1996 and the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008. These laws establish coverage terms that must be equal between mental health services and medical services, including limits, treatment restrictions, financial requirements, and covered benefits. The health reform law did not alter these requirements. The ACA did not change federal mental health parity requirements, which ensure equal coverage for mental health and substance use disorder services. It applies to certain plan types, including Qualified Health Plans. The ACA requires compliance with federal parity law for three types of plans: Qualified Health Plans (QHPs), plans in the individual market, and Medicaid benchmark plans. QHPs must meet requirements for parity with federal law in both small group and individual markets. Medicaid benchmark and benchmark-equivalent plans must partially comply with federal parity law, ensuring equal treatment for mental health and substance use disorder services. Fully insured and self-insured small plans are exempt from federal parity law compliance. Federal parity law does not apply to traditional fee-for-service Medicaid or Medicare. Small employer group health plans are exempt from federal parity law, including \"groups of one\" in some states. The ACA did not change the small employer exemption. Traditional fee-for-service Medicaid may not be subject to federal parity law due to certain coverage structures. Federal parity law does not apply to traditional fee-for-service Medicare. Copayments for covered Medicare Part B outpatient mental health services and other medical services must be 20% of the Medicare-approved amount by 2014. Disparities in coverage terms between mental health and substance use disorder services and medical and surgical services have historically existed. Federal parity law aims to address these coverage disparities, although it does not mandate the coverage of mental health and substance use disorder services. The ACA did not change the mandated offering parity approach in federal parity law, but it did introduce broader changes requiring coverage of mental health and substance use disorder services. This includes the establishment of Exchanges where Qualified Health Plans must offer a minimum set of benefits. The Essential Health Benefits Package (EHBP) under the ACA includes Essential Health Benefits (EHB), cost-sharing arrangements, and coverage tiers. The Secretary of HHS defines the EHB, which must include 10 categories of services, including mental health and substance use disorder services. Benefits in the EHB must be comparable to those in a typical employer plan, as determined by a survey conducted by the DOL. The Department of Labor released a report on employer-sponsored coverage for mental health and substance use disorder treatment. The ACA does not specify the services to be included in the Essential Health Benefits Package (EHBP), which will be determined through the rulemaking process. The HHS Secretary has discretion to add benefits beyond the 10 required categories. In December 2011, HHS released a bulletin outlining a proposal for states to define Essential Health Benefits (EHB) using benchmark health insurance plans. States can choose from four options: the largest HMO, one of the three largest federal employee health plans, one of the three largest state employee health plans, or one of the three largest small group plans. These designated plans would offer services comparable to a typical employer plan. The HHS Secretary requested the Institute of Medicine to determine Essential Health Benefits (EHB). The IOM released a report on the criteria for EHB. The ACA mandates plans to offer either the EHBP or EHB, including mental health and substance use disorder services. The ACA requires certain types of plans to offer either the Essential Health Benefits Package (EHBP) or Essential Health Benefits (EHB) by January 1, 2014. This includes new plans in the individual and small group markets, Qualified Health Plans (QHPs), and Medicaid benchmark plans. Grandfathered and large group plans outside of the Exchanges are not required to offer the EHBP. The health reform law made changes likely to impact access to mental health and substance use disorder services. Many plans will now be required to cover these services on par with medical and surgical services, leading to potential voluntary offerings or compliance with federal parity law to stay competitive in the private market."
