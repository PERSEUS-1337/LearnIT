For each calendar quarter with an FMAP increase, affected jurisdictions must report total compact migrant expenditures to the Secretary of the Interior. The Secretary reviews and adjusts the accounting before submitting a final report for each jurisdiction. The Secretary of Health and Human Services reviews and adjusts the FMAP increase for affected jurisdictions based on compact migrant expenditures reported, making appropriate adjustments subject to limitations.
