    "content": "The \"Neutral Cost Recovery Act for Small Business\" may be cited as the Act. It includes increased expensing for small businesses. The \"Neutral Cost Recovery Act for Small Business\" increases expensing limits for small businesses under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The dollar limitation for aggregate costs is set at $75,000, with a phaseout threshold of $325,000. Certain computer software is also included as section 179 property. The definition of \"section 179 property\" is amended to include tangible property, computer software, and section 1245 property acquired for use in a trade or business, excluding certain types of property like air conditioning or heating units. The dollar limitation and phaseout threshold for section 179 property are subject to inflation adjustments starting from 2003. The dollar amounts in paragraphs (1) and (2) will be increased based on the cost-of-living adjustment for the calendar year in which the taxable year begins. The dollar limitation and phaseout threshold for section 179 property are subject to inflation adjustments. Amounts in paragraphs (1) and (2) will be rounded to the nearest multiple of $1,000 and $10,000, respectively. Taxpayers can revoke an election under section 179(c)(2). The taxpayer can revoke an election under section 179(c)(2) for any property, and once revoked, it is irrevocable. These amendments apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 2002. SEC. 3. NEUTRAL COST RECOVERY DEPRECIATION ADJUSTMENT FOR CERTAIN PROPERTY PLACED IN SERVICE AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2003. Section 168 of the Internal Revenue Code is amended to allow for a deduction adjustment for certain property placed in service after December 31, 2003. The deduction is determined by substituting '150 percent' for '200 percent' in the case of property eligible for full expensing under section 179. The deduction for property placed in service after December 31, 2003, is determined by multiplying the amount under section 168 without regard to certain factors by the applicable neutral cost recovery ratio for the taxable year. The applicable ratio is calculated by dividing the gross domestic product deflator for the calendar quarter. The deduction for property placed in service is calculated by multiplying the deflator for the quarter when the property was placed in service by the GDP deflator for the same quarter, and then multiplying by 1.035 to the power of the number of full years in the period. The applicable neutral cost recovery ratio for property placed in service is calculated based on the GDP deflator for the corresponding quarter, rounded to the nearest \\1/1000\\. The gross domestic product deflator is used to calculate the applicable neutral cost recovery ratio for property placed in service. Taxpayers can elect not to have this subsection apply to their property, and once the election is made, it is irrevocable. Churning transactions are exempt from this subsection if certain conditions are met. Additionally, any additional deduction will not affect the basis or recapture of the property. The additional amount determined under this section shall not affect the adjusted basis of property held by pass-thru entities like regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, S corporations, partnerships, estates, trusts, and common trust funds. Minimum Tax Treatment for common trust funds under section 168(k) applies to property placed in service after December 31, 2003. The deduction allowable for such property in any taxable year is calculated using a neutral cost recovery ratio. The neutral cost recovery ratio for taxable year is determined under section 168(k). This does not apply to property with an election not to have section 168(k) apply. Additionally, the deduction allowable by section 168(k) does not apply to clause (i) of section 280F(a)(1)(B) of the Code. The amendments made by this section, effective for taxable years ending after December 31, 2003, include treating the unrecovered basis of a passenger automobile as including additional amounts determined under section 168(k) not allowed as a deduction in the recovery period."
