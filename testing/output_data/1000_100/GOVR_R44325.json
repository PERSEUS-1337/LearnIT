    "content": "The level of pay for congressional staff is determined by Senate committees, with job titles, pay rates, and resources set by the chair and ranking Member. Congressional pay data is sought for various reasons, such as assessing costs, setting pay levels, and comparing with other federal government systems. Official Senate reports provide consistent data on congressional staff pay. The Senate's Report of the Secretary of the Senate, published semiannually, provides pay data for 13 staff position titles in Senate committees since FY2001. Position titles were identified through a two-step process, with 91.7% of titles filled by only one staff member. In FY2014, 277 titles in Senate committees were filled by only one staff member and excluded. 25 titles were assessed for staff employment across 20 Senate committees. 12 position titles used by six or fewer panels were excluded, and pay data was collected for the remaining 13 positions. Annual pay data needed to be available from at least five committees for each position to be included. Data for no more than two staff per committee were collected if committees had multiple staff with the same title. Staff had to hold the same position in the same committee for the entire fiscal year and not receive pay from any other congressional authority for their data to be included. The LegiStorm data tabulates every payment recorded for congressional staff in the fiscal year, including overtime, bonuses, and other payments in addition to base salary. Pay data for staff in House committee offices can be found in CRS Report R44322, while data for staff in Senators' and House Members' personal offices are available in CRS Report R44324 and CRS Report R44323, respectively. The data presented may have challenges that could impact findings or interpretation. Some challenges may affect the interpretation of findings presented. Concerns include the large number of positions held by one Senate employee, which may not represent all committee staff jobs. Data on staff titles could impact data representativeness. Two categories of positions emerge: one with titles usually held by one staff member per committee, providing highly representative pay information, and another with positions where committees may hire multiple staff members, resulting in less representative pay data. The pay data collected for staff positions in congressional committees may not be fully representative due to potential differences in job duties, education, and work experience. The aggregation of pay by job title assumes similar tasks are carried out, but variations in duties and employment terms set by congressional authorities can impact pay levels. The Senate Handbook acknowledges the variability in job duties among individuals with the same job title in Congress. Tables provide data on Senate committee staff pay rates, cumulative pay changes, and tabular pay data for each position. Constant dollar calculations are based on the CPI-U for various years. Between FY2011 and FY2015, Senate committee staff saw a range of pay changes, with median pay increasing by 16.93% for professional staff members and decreasing by -16.48% for others. Various graphic displays show pay data from different perspectives, including comparisons to Members of Congress and federal civilian workers. Between FY2011 and FY2015, Senate committee staff experienced varying pay changes. Median pay increased by 16.93% for professional staff members and decreased by -16.48% for staff assistants. Comparisons to Members of Congress and federal civilian workers show different trends in pay changes over the same period. Between FY2001 and FY2015, median pay changes ranged from a 30.88% increase for systems administrators to a -26.67% decrease for staff assistants. Five out of seven staff positions saw pay increases while two saw declines. Comparisons to Members of Congress and General Schedule, DC, show different trends in pay changes over the same period."
