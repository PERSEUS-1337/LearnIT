    "content": "The \"Faith-Based Drug Treatment Enhancement Act\" is cited as the short title. It amends Title V of the Public Health Service Act to include services provided through religious organizations for the prevention and treatment of substance abuse. This new section, Part G, specifies the applicability to designated programs. This part of the \"Faith-Based Drug Treatment Enhancement Act\" applies to programs providing federal financial assistance for substance abuse prevention or treatment. It excludes awards for other purposes and defines a \"designated award recipient\" as an entity receiving such an award. The \"Faith-Based Drug Treatment Enhancement Act\" applies to programs offering federal financial assistance for substance abuse prevention or treatment. It defines terms like designated direct award, designated subaward, designated program, financial assistance, and program beneficiary. The \"Faith-Based Drug Treatment Enhancement Act\" defines key terms such as program participant, program services, religious organization, and voucherized assistance. Program services refer to substance abuse treatment or preventive services provided under a designated program. The \"Faith-Based Drug Treatment Enhancement Act\" allows program beneficiaries to choose the organization providing services and be reimbursed for program services, or allocate program funds by selecting a service provider from alternatives. SEC. 582. RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS AS PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS. Religious organizations have the authority to be designated award recipients, make subawards to other entities, provide program services through voucherized assistance, and be service providers under designated programs. The term 'program participant' refers to entities that have received a direct award. Religious organizations can participate in programs as award recipients, subawarding entities, and service providers without discrimination. The establishment clause does not require social-welfare programs to discriminate against religious organizations. Religious organizations can participate in social-welfare programs without discrimination based on their faith-based nature. The Federal Government and States receiving funds must not discriminate against organizations with religious characteristics. Religious organizations participating in social-welfare programs must maintain independence from government control over their religious beliefs and practices. They cannot be required to change their internal governance or remove religious symbols. Additionally, nondiscrimination in employment is upheld, except where specified by other laws. Religious organizations in social-welfare programs can require employees to adhere to their religious beliefs and rules on drugs/alcohol. Program beneficiaries objecting to a religious organization must be accommodated if the organization received a designated direct award. If the organization received a direct award, arrangements must be made for the individual to receive program services through an alternative entity. If a designated subaward was received, the non-Federal entity that made the subaward should arrange for program services through an alternative program participant. For services provided under voucherized assistance, the designated award recipient operating the program should arrange for services through an alternative provider. A religious organization participating in a program must not discriminate against beneficiaries based on religion. If the organization cannot provide services, they must ensure the individual receives equivalent services through an alternative entity. Religious organizations participating in programs must allow beneficiaries to actively engage in religious activities and follow religious-based rules. They are also required to adhere to fiscal accountability regulations similar to other recipients of federal financial assistance. Limited audits may be conducted for specific awards. Limited audit requirement for religious organizations participating in programs only applies to Federal funds held separately from non-Federal funds. Religious organizations can seek judicial review of agency actions regarding compliance with this section. SEC. 583 prohibits the use of funds for sectarian worship or instruction, except when the beneficiary can choose where the assistance is redeemed. SEC. 584 addresses the administration of the program and treatment of funds. Federal financial assistance provided to program beneficiaries is considered aid to the beneficiary, not to the organization offering the services. States cannot prohibit the use of Federal funds in religious facilities or by religious organizations participating in designated programs. If State laws prevent the use of public funds in such facilities, Federal funds must be segregated for program purposes. \"SEC. 585. EDUCATIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR PERSONNEL IN DRUG TREATMENT PROGRAMS.\" The Congress finds that formal educational qualifications for counselors in drug treatment programs may hinder the provision of services. States must recognize the importance of religious education and training for personnel in program services. In applying educational qualifications for personnel in religious organizations, State or local government shall give credit for religious education equivalent to secular course work in drug treatment. State or local government may establish formal educational qualifications for personnel in organizations providing program services that contribute to reducing drug use among beneficiaries. The Secretary may waive any imposed educational qualification. The Secretary may waive educational qualifications for personnel in religious organizations if certain conditions are met, including a successful drug treatment record, barriers to becoming a program provider, a waiver application, and a lack of empirical evidence supporting the qualifications. The educational qualifications required for a drug treatment program are deemed necessary for its successful operation."
