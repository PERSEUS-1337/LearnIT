In August 2013, Islamist-led mobs burned and destroyed Christian properties in Egypt after the government led by the Muslim Brotherhood was removed. The succeeding government, under President Sisi, announced that the army would rebuild the damaged churches at government expense. President Sisi also made an appearance at a Coptic Christian Christmas liturgy in January 2015. President Sisi attended a Coptic Christian Christmas liturgy in January 2016 at St. Mark's Cathedral in Cairo, Egypt. He apologized for the delay in renovating churches damaged in the August 2013 violence and promised that all buildings would be restored by the following year. The Egyptian military has already restored 26 out of 78 churches and Christian buildings damaged in the violence. In August 2013, sectarian violence damaged buildings in Egypt. Private citizens have restored 23 buildings, with 29 buildings in 24 locations still needing restoration as of September 6, 2016. A new law in August 2016 imposed burdens on church construction. Government approval for building or repairing churches has led to violence against Christians. In El-`Our, Minya, protests occurred in March 2015 over the construction of a church honoring Christians beheaded by militants in Libya. President Sisi approved the church's construction in response to calls by Coptic Orthodox Church leaders. Protestors armed with Molotov cocktails besieged a village church in Egypt, targeting a Coptic Orthodox clergyman and his family. Human rights groups criticize government-led reconciliation sessions for favoring the majority and hindering legal recourse for religious minorities. The Coptic Christians, indigenous to Egypt for over 2,000 years, have the largest Christian community in the Middle East. The US plays a significant role in protecting religious minorities globally through diplomatic efforts and legislation like the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998, which promotes freedom of religion as a fundamental right essential for democracy and individual liberty. The United States prioritizes promoting democracy, individual liberty, and stability in its engagement with other countries.
