    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Faster Access to Specialized Treatments Act\" or \"FAST Act\". The FDA plays a crucial role in ensuring the safety and effectiveness of new medicines. Advances in medical sciences have led to the development of targeted treatments for serious diseases. The FDA should implement more effective processes for expedited development and review of innovative medicines for serious or life-threatening diseases, including rare conditions, using modern scientific tools earlier in the drug development cycle. This could lead to fewer, smaller, or shorter clinical trials for the intended patient population. The FDA should enhance its authority to expedite the approval of innovative therapies for serious or life-threatening diseases, ensuring access to safe and effective treatments for patients in need. The FDA should utilize accelerated approval and fast track provisions to expedite the development and availability of treatments for serious or life-threatening diseases while maintaining safety and effectiveness standards. SEC. 3. EXPEDITED APPROVAL OF DRUGS FOR SERIOUS OR LIFE-THREATENING DISEASES OR CONDITIONS. Amends Section 506 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to expedite approval of drugs for serious or life-threatening diseases. The Secretary can expedite the review of a new drug designated as a fast track product if it is intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease and addresses unmet medical needs. The sponsor of the drug can request this designation at any time after submitting an application for investigation under specific sections. The Secretary can designate a drug as a fast track product within 60 days of receiving a request if it meets certain criteria. This designation allows for expedited development and review of the drug application for approval. Additionally, the Secretary can approve a drug for a serious or life-threatening disease through accelerated approval, including fast track products. The Secretary can approve a product for a serious or life-threatening disease under certain criteria, including fast track products, based on evidence of clinical benefit prediction. The evidence supporting an endpoint's ability to predict clinical benefit may include various scientific methods or tools. Approval under this subsection may require post-approval studies to confirm the product's effects on clinical benefit and submission of promotional materials for review prior to dissemination. Prior to dissemination, materials must be reviewed 30 days before and after approval. The Secretary can expedite withdrawal of approval if post-approval studies are not conducted diligently or if a study fails to verify predicted clinical benefits. The Secretary can expedite withdrawal of approval if post-approval studies are not conducted diligently, or if a study fails to verify predicted clinical benefits, demonstrate product safety, or if false promotional materials are disseminated. If a fast track product shows potential effectiveness, the Secretary may begin reviewing parts of the application before it is complete. The Secretary can expedite withdrawal of approval if post-approval studies are not conducted diligently or if false promotional materials are disseminated. An application submitted must include a schedule for information submission and payment of required fees. Time periods for review agreed upon by the Secretary do not apply until the application is complete. The Secretary is also responsible for developing and disseminating awareness efforts to physicians and patients. The Secretary is responsible for developing and disseminating awareness efforts to physicians and patients, as well as establishing a program to encourage the development of surrogate and clinical endpoints for accelerated approval and fast track products. SEC. 4. GUIDANCE; AMENDED REGULATIONS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must issue draft guidance within one year of the enactment of the Act, followed by final guidance after public comment. Regulations on accelerated approval will be amended to align with the amendments made by section 3. The Secretary will consider issues related to accelerated approval and fast track processes for drugs designated for rare diseases, and how to incorporate novel approaches for reviewing surrogate endpoints based on pathophysiologic and pharmacologic evidence. The issuance of guidance or regulations implementing the amendments shall not delay the review or approval of requests or applications. \"Designation or approval application under section 506 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.\" The Secretary will contract an independent entity to review the FDA's application of new drug review processes and their impact on innovative treatments for serious conditions. Evaluation will involve consultation with industries, patient advocacy groups, and medical centers. The amendments to section 506(b) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act encourage innovative approaches for product assessment under accelerated approval while maintaining safety and effectiveness standards."
