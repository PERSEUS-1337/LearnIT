    "content": "The renewable electricity Production Tax Credit (PTC) is a per-kilowatt-hour tax credit for electricity generated using qualified energy resources. The credit can be claimed for a 10-year period once a qualifying facility is in service, with maximum credit amounts varying by year. Wind, closed-loop biomass, and geothermal energy qualify for the maximum credit amount, while other technologies receive a reduced credit amount. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) provides a tax credit for electricity generated using qualified energy resources. The credit amount varies by year and technology, with wind, closed-loop biomass, and geothermal energy qualifying for the maximum credit amount. The credit is reduced for other technologies. Construction start dates determine eligibility for the PTC, with reductions in the credit amount for facilities starting construction after specific dates. The PTC is set to phase out once market electricity prices exceed threshold levels. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) has not been phased out and is unlikely to be under current law. Before 2018, the PTC was limited by the corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT). The corporate AMT was eliminated in the 2017 tax revision. PTC-eligible taxpayers had the option of claiming the 30% energy investment tax credit (ITC) from 2009 through 2017. Indian coal and refined coal production facilities placed in service before specific dates are eligible for production tax credits. The base rate for Indian coal is $2.00 per ton, with an inflation-adjusted credit of $2.4 in 2017. Refined coal facilities have a base credit amount of $4.375 per ton, with a 2018 credit of $7.307 per ton after inflation adjustment. Credits are not available for coal produced after 2017. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) was first enacted in 1992 as part of the Energy Policy Act of 1992. Since then, it has been extended 11 times, with the credit allowed for production over a 10-year period. Initially available for wind and closed-loop biomass systems, the PTC has been extended to include poultry waste as a qualifying technology. The PTC has lapsed and been reinstated multiple times, with various extensions through different legislative acts. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) was extended through various legislative acts, with the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 adding new qualifying resources like open-loop biomass, geothermal energy, solar energy, small irrigation power, and municipal solid waste. These new resources had a five-year PTC period and reduced credit amounts for some facilities. Additionally, the AJCA introduced a PTC for refined coal at a rate of $4.375 per ton. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) was extended through legislative acts, with the Energy Policy Act of 2005 adding hydropower and Indian coal as qualifying resources. Indian coal could qualify for a credit over a seven-year period, with the credit amount set at $1.50 per ton for the first four years, and $2.00 per ton for the last three years. The Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 extended the PTC for one year, through 2008, for qualifying facilities. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) was extended through legislative acts, with the Energy Policy Act of 2005 adding hydropower and Indian coal as qualifying resources. The PTC was further extended and modified by the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, with various renewable energy sources qualifying for credits through 2010. Marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy were also added as qualifying resources, along with a new credit for steel industry fuel. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) was extended through legislative acts, with the Energy Policy Act of 2005 adding hydropower and Indian coal as qualifying resources. The PTC was further extended by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, allowing for a longer-term extension of the PTC for wind through 2012 and other renewable energy technologies through 2013. The Act also introduced the Section 1603 grant program for PTC- and ITC-eligible taxpayers to receive a one-time payment from the Treasury in lieu of tax credits for property placed in service or under construction in 2009 or 2010. The PTC for wind was extended through various legislative acts, with the expiration date changing from a placed-in-service deadline to a construction start date. The PTC, along with the ITC option, was retroactively extended through 2014. The PATH Act of 2015 extended the PTC expiration date for nonwind facilities through the end of 2016. The PTC for wind was extended through 2019, with reduced credits for facilities starting construction in 2017, 2018, and 2019. The PTC for nonwind technologies and Indian coal was extended through 2016, with retroactive extension for tax year 2017 in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. The PTC for nonwind technologies and Indian coal was extended through 2016, with retroactive extension for tax year 2017 in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. Estimates of the cost associated with tax expenditure provisions can be found in the Joint Committee on Taxation annual tables. Estimated revenue losses associated with the PTC between 2018 and 2022 are $25.8 billion, with most of it attributed to wind energy. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that between 2018 and 2022, the revenue losses associated with the production tax credits (PTCs) for various energy sources amount to $25.8 billion. In 2013, 230 corporate taxpayers claimed PTCs totaling $2.8 billion, with most credits claimed for renewable electricity production. The PTC is paid out over 10 years, with credits awarded in a given year resulting from previous-year investments. In 2010, nearly $1.2 billion in PTCs were carried forward from previous tax years, highlighting the impact of policy actions on renewable energy tax credit claims. The number of taxpayers claiming the PTC increased between 2008 and 2009 but decreased after 2009, with fewer taxpayers claiming the PTC due to the availability of Section 1603 grants. $15.5 billion in grants was claimed for technologies that would have been PTC-eligible. The economic downturn led to a significant increase in tax credit carry forwards, with taxpayers facing challenges in offsetting net income with tax credits. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that a permanent PTC for nonwind technologies would reduce revenues by $1.4 billion between 2019 and 2028. Extending the Indian Coal Production Credit would further reduce revenues by $0.4 billion. Extending the wind construction start date beyond 2019 would reduce federal revenues by $6.9 billion between 2018 and 2027. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) was enacted in 1992 to promote renewable energy sources, with recent extensions reflecting a belief in its contribution to renewable energy infrastructure development. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) drives investment and growth in the wind industry, but short-term extensions have limited potential. Retroactive extensions provide windfall benefits to taxpayers. Research on the PTC's impact on reducing greenhouse gas emissions is mixed. Removing tax credits for renewable electricity could result in a small increase in power-sector emissions. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory found that tax credits for wind and solar help reduce emissions, especially when natural gas prices are low. Government intervention in energy markets is justified by externalities and market failures caused by pollution. Tax subsidies for clean energy are one way to address these inefficiencies, although not the most efficient method. Tax subsidies for clean energy in the energy sector may not be the most efficient way to achieve policy objectives. They can encourage energy consumption, counter conservation efforts, and offset emissions reductions. Tax subsidies do not provide equal incentives for all emissions reduction alternatives and can favor costly reductions over cheaper ones. These subsidies also reduce tax revenues and economic efficiency. A more direct and efficient approach would be a carbon tax, which could generate revenue to offset other taxes, achieve distributional goals, or reduce the deficit. A carbon tax approach would be \"technology neutral,\" not requiring Congress to select which technologies to subsidize. Tax incentives are not the most efficient mechanism for delivering federal financial support directly to renewable energy developers and investors. Project developers often seek outside investors to \"monetize\" tax benefits using \"tax-equity\" financing arrangements, reducing federal financial support for renewable energy. Tax incentives that reward production, as opposed to investment, are likely to lead to more renewable electricity per dollar of federal subsidy. The PTC, along with other renewable energy policies, supports the development of renewable electricity resources. Many states have RPS policies in place. Federal subsidies, including the PTC, help reduce costs for complying with state mandates. Options for the PTC include allowing it to expire as scheduled or providing a temporary extension. The PTC expiration dates differ for wind projects due to the enactment of P.L. 114-113. With the enactment of P.L. 114-113, the expiration date for the PTC for wind differs from other technologies. Congress may extend the PTC for nonwind technologies retroactively for 2018. Options include applying the phaseout to other technologies or removing it for wind to have all PTC-eligible technologies qualify at the same rate. In 2014, a proposal to eliminate the PTC inflation adjustment factor would reduce the value of the PTC for renewable electricity to 1.5 cents per kWh. The proposal in 2014 aimed to reduce the value of the PTC for renewable electricity to 1.5 cents per kWh for eligible properties within the 10-year window. This would have resulted in additional federal revenues of $9.6 billion between 2014 and 2023. President Obama's FY2017 budget suggested a permanent extension of the PTC, making it refundable and including solar facilities as qualifying properties. The PTC and ITC would be made permanent, with solar facilities added as qualifying property. Renewable electricity consumed by the producer could qualify for tax credits, and the cost of these changes is estimated at $19.8 billion between 2016 and 2026."
