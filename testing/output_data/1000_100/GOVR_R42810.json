    "content": "The Honoring America's Veterans and Caring for Camp Lejeune Families Act of 2012 (H.R. 1627, P.L. 112-154) is an omnibus bill impacting various veterans programs. It reflects a compromise agreement by the House and Senate Committees on Veterans Affairs on multiple provisions from different bills. The Department of Veterans Affairs operates the nation's largest integrated health care system. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) operates the largest integrated health care system for veterans. Eligibility for VA medical care is based on factors like veteran status, disabilities, income, and special treatment authority granted by Congress. In 1981, the Veterans' Health Care, Training, and Small Business Loan Act provided authority to treat veterans for disorders possibly related to Agent Orange and ionizing radiation exposure, despite lack of definitive scientific evidence. In 1993, Congress passed P.L. 103-210 to authorize VA healthcare for Persian Gulf War veterans with medical conditions possibly linked to toxic exposure during their service. P.L. 112-154 addressed chemical exposure at Camp Lejeune, providing VA healthcare eligibility for affected veterans and their families stationed there. The VA provides medical care for veterans and eligible family members who were stationed at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina from 1957 to 1987 and were exposed to contaminated well water. Eligible individuals can receive care for fifteen specified illnesses, with the VA being the final payer for eligible family members. The VA partners with states to build nursing homes and provides grants and per diem for veteran care. State laws govern management and admission criteria for State Veterans' Homes. VA pays full care costs for veterans with 70%+ service-connected disability or related nursing home needs in VA facilities. The Veterans Benefits, Health Care, and Information Technology Act of 2006 equalized nursing home care costs for veterans, regardless of the setting. It allowed higher per diem rates for veterans with a 70% service-connected disability or unemployability. However, some state veterans' nursing homes reported receiving smaller reimbursements that did not cover the actual cost of care. The VA is required to contract with state veterans' homes for nursing home care for veterans with service-connected conditions or a disability rating of 70% or higher. The reimbursement methodology will be developed in consultation with the homes, and the VA must replicate previous reimbursement methods if requested. In 2011, the GAO reported around 300 sexual assault incidents at VA facilities from 2007 to 2010, including rape and other forms of assault. The GAO reported numerous sexual assault incidents at VA facilities, including rape and other forms of assault. Many incidents were not reported to VA leadership or the VA Office of the Inspector General due to a lack of centralized reporting system. Section 106 of P.L. 112-154 mandates the VA to establish a policy for reporting and tracking sexual assault and safety incidents, with a report due 60 days after implementation and annually thereafter. The policy should consider the impact on veterans' mental health and substance abuse treatments. The VA is required to develop a comprehensive policy on traumatic brain injury (TBI) within 30 days of P.L. 112-154 enactment. TBI is a common injury in OEF/OIF due to blast injuries, improved survival rates, and increased awareness among healthcare professionals. The VA is mandated to provide comprehensive care for veterans with traumatic brain injury (TBI) to maximize independence and improve behavioral and mental health functioning. Concerns have been raised about limited rehabilitative services, potentially hindering progress in physical and cognitive abilities. The VA is mandated to provide comprehensive care for veterans with traumatic brain injury (TBI) to improve their behavioral and mental health functioning. This includes the inclusion of rehabilitative services in long-term care programs. Telemedicine and telehealth are used for medical diagnostic, monitoring, and therapeutic purposes, as well as to support long-distance clinical health care and health education. Telemental health refers to behavioral health services provided using communication technology, including clinical assessment, psychotherapy, and psychiatry. The VA has been a leader in telehealth development since 1977. The VA is a leader in telehealth development, frequently using it to deliver care to veterans in rural areas. Telehealth offers benefits as an alternative to in-person treatment and can be cost-effective. VA is required to carry out a teleconsultation program for mental health and TBI assessments in facilities lacking resources. Training opportunities in telemedicine are also offered to medical residents in VA facilities. Veterans enrolled in the VA health care system do not pay copayments for treatment related to service-connected conditions. Those with 50% or more disability are exempt from copayments for all conditions. Additionally, veterans do not pay copayments for various outpatient services including health fairs, screenings, counseling, and hospice care. Veterans without service-connected conditions or receiving care for nonservice-connected conditions may be required to pay copayments. Veterans receiving care for nonservice-connected conditions may have to pay copayments for primary and specialty care visits. However, copayments for telehealth or telemedicine consultations can be waived. The VA is authorized to provide service dogs to veterans with hearing, mobility, or mental health issues, including PTSD. The National Defense Authorization Act authorized the VA to study the use of service dogs for veterans with physical or mental injuries, including PTSD. A service dog trained by an accredited entity may access VA facilities. Congress mandated the establishment of an Office of Rural Health within the VHA to address disparities in service between rural and non-rural veterans. The VHA established the Office of Rural Health (ORH) in 2006 to address disparities in service between rural and non-rural veterans. Three Veterans Rural Health Resource Centers (VRHRCs) were opened in FY2009 to develop special practices for veterans in rural areas. These Centers serve as field-based clinical laboratories experimenting with new outreach and care models. Section 110 of P.L. 112-154 requires VRHRCs to improve understanding of challenges faced by rural veterans and identify disparities in healthcare availability. The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (P.L. 99-272) gave the VHA authority to bill veterans and insurers for nonservice-connected care to help with medical service costs. However, it did not allow the VA to keep the third-party payments collected, requiring them to deposit the funds into the U.S. Treasury. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 authorized the VHA to retain third-party collections in the VA's Medical Care Collections Fund for providing medical services to veterans. The Act also allowed the VA to change its billing basis to \"reasonable charges\" to increase collections. In FY2004, there was a proposal to consolidate various medical collections accounts into the MCCF. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 authorized the VHA to retain third-party collections in the VA's Medical Care Collections Fund for providing medical services to veterans. In FY2004, there was a proposal to consolidate various medical collections accounts into the MCCF. The conference report for the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2005 provided the VA with permanent authority to deposit funds from specific accounts into the MCCF for medical services for veterans. Section 111 of P.L. 112-154 requires the VA to develop a plan to identify and collect billable third-party revenue for deposit into the MCCF. The VA is required to develop an effective plan for identifying billable fee claims, implementing policies for billing and collection, training employees, setting fee revenue goals, and monitoring progress. Additionally, there is a three-year initiative to assess the feasibility of treating Vet Centers as VA facilities for beneficiary travel reimbursement in highly rural areas. The VA is authorized to provide eligible veterans and beneficiaries with mileage reimbursement, special mode transport, and common carrier transport for medical appointments. Pre-authorization is required for ambulance and common carrier expenses, except in emergencies. VA is required to issue a report to Congress on the initiative within 180 days of enactment. In FY2012, VA proposed using Medicare ambulance rates to reimburse providers for cost savings. The Vow to Hire Heroes Act allowed VA to pay the lesser of the actual amount charged or the Medicare rate for ambulance services. However, the change in law did not have the desired effect as it only applied in situations where VA pays before determining veteran eligibility for transport. The Vow to Hire Heroes Act in FY2012 allowed VA to reimburse ambulance providers at the lesser of the actual charge or the local Medicare rate. A technical correction in P.L. 112-154 authorized VA to reimburse ambulance providers when no contract is in place. This new reimbursement method applies to all ambulance transportation except for unauthorized non-VA emergency care. The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 established means testing for veterans seeking care for nonservice-connected conditions. Veterans report household income to determine eligibility for VA health care. P.L. 112-154 authorizes VA to use the veteran's household income for eligibility. Changes were made to the VA's Specially Adapted Housing Program to assist veterans and servicemembers with service-connected disabilities in purchasing or remodeling homes. The Specially Adapted Housing Program offers grants for veterans with mobility impairments or severe burn injuries. There are two types of grants: the \u00a72101(a) grant for mobility impairments and the \u00a72101(b) grant for blindness or loss of hand use. The dollar limit for the \u00a72101(a) grant is higher, and both grants can be used to adapt a family member's home. Section 202 of P.L. 112-154 expanded eligibility for the \u00a72101(a) grant to include veterans with lower extremity disabilities affecting balance and propulsion. The Specially Adapted Housing Program offers grants for veterans with mobility impairments or severe burn injuries, including grants for blindness or loss of hand use. Changes in P.L. 112-154 include expanding eligibility for lower extremity disabilities affecting balance and propulsion, adjusting the visual acuity standard for blindness, and increasing the maximum grant amounts. The VA Secretary annually adjusts statutory award limits based on a cost-of-construction index. P.L. 112-154 raises the limits to $63,780 and $12,756 for FY2012. The law also allows veterans to use grants to modify family members' homes temporarily. Section 205 of P.L. 112-154 increases TRA grants to $28,000 and $5,000, effective upon enactment. The TRA grants are now subject to annual adjustment using the cost-of-construction index. The authority for TRA grants has been extended from December 31, 2012, to December 31, 2022. The SAH law limits grant funding for adaptations to a veteran's or servicemember's home, with exceptions for homes substantially damaged in disasters. The VA Loan Guaranty Program provides mortgage insurance for eligible veterans, guaranteeing lenders a portion of losses in case of borrower default. Unlike the FHA program, the VA only guarantees a portion of the loan amount. To be eligible, veterans must occupy the property as their home. The program allows veterans to acquire another suitable home and offers assistance that does not count towards their maximum benefit. The VA Loan Guaranty Program requires veterans to occupy the property as their home and pay a one-time fee based on factors like down payment amount and military service history. Fees may be waived for certain individuals, including surviving spouses of veterans with service-connected disabilities. Amendments have expanded eligibility to include surviving spouses of veterans who die while receiving disability compensation. The VA Loan Guaranty Program has specific duration requirements for disabilities, including continuous total disability ratings for a certain period before death. Surviving spouses qualifying under this provision are exempt from paying the guaranteed loan fee. Amendments have also been made to the housing occupancy requirement for loan guaranty eligibility. The VA Loan Guaranty Program has specific duration requirements for disabilities, including continuous total disability ratings for a certain period before death. Surviving spouses exempt from paying the guaranteed loan fee. P.L. 112-154 allows dependent child of a veteran called for active duty to satisfy occupancy requirement. Sections 208 and 209 make adjustable rate mortgage programs permanent. Section 210 modifies law for veterans with service-connected disabilities to waive loan guaranty fee based on disability determination. The change in Section 702 of P.L. 112-154 aims to expedite the loan process by utilizing existing medical records for determinations. It extends current loan fees until October 1, 2017, reinstates higher loan guaranty amounts for high-cost areas, and aligns the VA guaranty limit with the Freddie Mac statute at $417,000. The Freddie Mac statute sets the conforming loan limit at $417,000 for single-family homes, with the possibility of higher limits in high-cost areas. Temporary increases in the maximum guaranty amount were made through P.L. 110-389 and P.L. 112-154, setting the maximum guaranty amount at 25% of the higher of the conforming loan limit or 125% of the area median home price, not exceeding 175% of the limit determined under the Freddie Mac statute. In certain high-cost areas, the VA can guarantee loans up to $1,094,625. The VA's authority to bundle and sell vendee loans has been extended through December 31, 2016. Prior to this extension, the VA used the Enhanced Use Lease process to lease unused property for VA-related purposes. As of December 31, 2011, Enhanced Use Leases (EULs) with the VA were used for various purposes such as child development centers, parking facilities, golf courses, senior housing, assisted living facilities, and nursing homes. However, Section 211 of P.L. 112-154 now limits EUL properties to be used only for \"supportive housing\" for homeless or at-risk veterans and their families, including transitional, permanent, and single room occupancy housing. Leases entered into before January 1, 2012, are exempt from this change. The VA's Enhanced Use Leases (EULs) are now limited to supportive housing for homeless or at-risk veterans and their families. Leases entered into before January 1, 2012, are exempt from this change. The VA also releases an annual report on consideration received for EULs and grants funds for transitional housing for homeless veterans through the Grant and Per Diem program. The VA Grant and Per Diem program reimburses grant recipients for providing housing and services to homeless veterans, with a current per diem rate of $38.90 per day. Grants can be used for construction, acquisition, and rehabilitation of facilities, and grantees can also utilize Low Income Housing Tax Credits. Funding can come from other sources as long as the project is operated by a private nonprofit organization. The VA Grant and Per Diem program, operated by a private nonprofit organization, has expanded eligibility to include male veterans with dependent children. Funding for the program is authorized at $250 million for FY2013 and $150 million for subsequent fiscal years. The program targets homeless veterans with special needs and provides housing and services with a per diem rate of $38.90. The VA Grant and Per Diem program has expanded eligibility to include male veterans with dependent children, eliminates certain requirements for grantees, allows funds to be used for services to dependents of homeless veterans, and extends the authorization level for the Special Needs grant. The Health Care for Homeless Veterans program now includes homeless veterans, regardless of mental illness. HUD-VASH is a collaborative program between the VA. The HCHV program, HUD-VASH, is a collaboration between the VA and HUD to provide housing vouchers for homeless veterans. Section 304 of P.L. 112-154 allows the VA to contract with other entities to help veterans find suitable housing and connect them with services. This is especially useful when there is a shortage of affordable housing or a veteran lives far from a VA facility. Section 305 of P.L. 112-154 extends authorization for programs assisting homeless veterans, including the Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program (HVRP) and Supportive Services for Veteran Families (SSVF). HVRP helps veterans find employment, while SSVF assists low-income veterans transitioning from homelessness to housing. The authorization levels for these programs are $50 million per year for HVRP and $300 million for SSVF in FY2013. The Survivors' and Dependents' Educational Assistance Program (DEA) provides educational assistance to dependents of disabled or deceased servicemembers. Participants are entitled to 45 months of benefits, with an option to combine programs for up to 81 months. The Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act offers educational support to eligible servicemembers and veterans. The All-Volunteer Force Educational Assistance Program provides educational assistance to eligible members of the Armed Forces. Section 402 of P.L. 112-154 requires reports on the Post-9/11 GI Bill and DEA to be submitted annually until January 1, 2021. The reports must include information on benefit levels, recruitment, retention, and the necessity of benefits for future recruitment. The VA report must include information on the usage of Post-9/11 GI Bill and DEA benefits, program expenditures, student outcomes, and recommendations for administrative and legislative changes. Section 402 repeals the requirement for biennial reports on the MGIB-AD. Claimants appealing a decision on benefits can submit additional evidence to support their claim. Under Section 501 of P.L. 112-154, the local VA office's initial review of newly submitted evidence will be automatically waived unless the claimant requests it. If no request is made, the BVA will review the evidence. Section 502 of P.L. 112-154 now allows court-appointed representatives or caregivers to sign applications on behalf of claimants for benefits adjudication. Section 502 of P.L. 112-154 allows court-appointed representatives, caregivers, or authorized individuals to sign benefit claim applications on behalf of claimants. It also permits the VA to waive its duty to assist requirement in certain cases where there is sufficient evidence for maximum benefit award. The Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA; P.L. 106-475) requires the VA to notify claimants of evidence needed to substantiate claims and encourages submission of relevant private medical records to prevent burdening claimants. Section 507 of P.L. 112-154 states that if a veteran receiving benefits dies, the surviving spouse is entitled to the benefits for the month of death. If a pending claim is granted posthumously, the spouse can receive additional benefits for that month. Section 504 of P.L. 112-154 removes the requirement for VCAA notice to be sent only after a claim is filed, allowing it to be printed on claims forms. It also eliminates the need to send the notice on subsequent claims if an issue was covered in a previous claim within the past year. The VA has developed the Fully Developed Claim (FDC) process to expedite disability claims, with the effective date generally being the date the claim is received. Section 506 of P.L. 112-154 allows for waiver of VCAA notification requirements for FDC disability claims, granting the highest evaluation possible at the earliest effective date. Section 506 of P.L. 112-154 allows veterans to establish an effective date for their FDC disability claim up to one year before the VA receives the application. This change is only available for original claims received before August 7, 2015. Additionally, joint application forms for VA survivor benefits and Social Security are required, and filing with either agency constitutes an application with both. Section 503 of P.L. 112-154 permits, rather than requires, this joint application process. Section 503 of P.L. 112-154 allows for a joint form to apply for survivor benefits with both the VA and SSA. Any document filed with either agency indicating an intent to apply for survivor benefits is considered an application with both agencies. The Improved Disability Pension program provides monthly cash benefits to low-income elderly or disabled veterans. Section 508 of P.L. 112-154 increases the maximum annual benefit for married couples who are veterans and require regular aid and attendance. The maximum annual benefit is raised from $30,480 to $32,433. The maximum cash benefit amount for the Improved Disability Pension and Improved Death Pension is reduced by income received by the veteran or surviving spouse. Section 509 of P.L. 112-154 expands the exclusion for calculating income to include reimbursements for expenses for replacement or repair of equipment, vehicles, items, money, or property. Disabled veterans and servicemembers may be eligible for financial assistance from the VA to purchase an automobile or adaptive equipment. Section 701 of P.L. 112-154 allows the VA Secretary to provide assistance to a veteran for the purchase of a second automobile. The VA Secretary can assist a veteran in purchasing a second automobile if the first one bought with VA help was destroyed due to a disaster and the veteran is not compensated by insurance. The VR&E Program offers employment services for disabled veterans, with provisions expanded for those affected by disasters. Section 701 of the VA Secretary's provisions extends subsistence allowances for veterans in the VR&E employment program by an additional two months after completion, totaling four months for those displaced by disasters. The limit on annual participation in IL services for veterans is waived in cases of displacement due to disasters. Public demonstrations at veterans' funerals were restricted prior to P.L. 112-154, requiring demonstrators to stay a certain distance away during the service. Section 601 of P.L. 112-154 increases time, place, and manner restrictions on demonstrations during funerals of servicemembers and veterans at Arlington National Cemetery and other VA-controlled cemeteries. Demonstrations are now restricted 120 minutes before and after a funeral, with an increased minimum distance requirement. Statutory damages for violations of restrictions at Arlington National Cemetery range from $25,000 to $50,000. Section 602 of P.L. 112-154 prohibits reserving gravesites before death, with the President able to waive this rule. The Secretary of the Army can establish monuments to honor missing veterans. Section 604 of P.L. 112-154 sets requirements for monuments at Arlington National Cemetery. Monuments at Arlington National Cemetery must wait 25 years after service or event. The Secretary of the Army can waive this requirement. A nongovernmental entity can establish a monument after providing an independent study and consulting with relevant committees. Congressional notification is required for any proposed monument placement. The VA provides a Presidential Memorial Certificate to eligible survivors of deceased veterans discharged under honorable conditions. Section 603 of P.L. 112-154 expands eligibility to include those who die in active military service. The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act offers protections for servicemembers facing financial challenges due to their military service. The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) provides protections for servicemembers facing financial challenges due to their military service, including suspending civil claims, protecting against eviction, capping interest rates, and safeguarding insurance policies. The SCRA, enacted in 2003, protects servicemembers from taxation in multiple jurisdictions and forced property sales to pay overdue taxes. Section 710 of P.L. 112-154 extended mortgage and foreclosure protections until December 31, 2014, amending Section 303 of the SCRA. This section covers servicemembers unable to make loan payments due to military service, preventing vendors from taking action without court approval. The SCRA protects servicemembers from property sales during military service and for one year after, unless under a court order. Section 701 requires a report on SCRA protections, while Section 703 mandates a plan to evaluate VBA employees processing disability compensation. Section 502 of the Veterans Benefits, Health Care, and Information Technology Act of 2006 grants the VA special authority to conduct competitions for small businesses owned by service-disabled and other veterans. Eligibility for contracting preferences is limited to firms listed in a VA database, and misrepresentation of status can result in penalties. Section 502 of the 2006 Veterans Benefits Act allows the VA to give contracting preferences to veteran-owned businesses. Misrepresentation of status can lead to debarment from government contracting. Amendment in P.L. 112-154 clarifies that debarment is only for willful misrepresentation, not inadvertent errors. The law authorizes debarment for willful misrepresentation of status in government contracting, with a minimum period of five years. Debarment actions must be initiated within 30 days of a determination and completed within 90 days. Debarment applies to all principals of the firm for a minimum of five years. Section 707 of P.L. 112-154 requires the VA Secretary to report on conferences attended by 50 or more people costing $20,000 or more. Section 708 requires federal contractors to report employment information to the DOL Secretary for public disclosure on a website. The VA Secretary is directed to establish a VetStar program to recognize businesses' contributions to veterans' employment annually."
