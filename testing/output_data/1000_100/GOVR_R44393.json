    "content": "Standards of identity for food, established by Congress, act as \"recipes\" to ensure the composition and labeling accuracy of food products. The FDA is authorized under Section 401 of the FFDCA to regulate and enforce these standards to promote honesty and fair dealing for consumers. The FDA establishes standards of identity for food products to ensure labeling accuracy and composition. These standards promote honesty and fair dealing for consumers by defining the requirements for a particular food product. If a product deviates from the standard of identity, it is considered misbranded under the FFDCA. The NLEA allows for the addition of safe ingredients to standardized foods. The FDA regulations allow for the modification of standardized foods to achieve nutritional goals while maintaining a descriptive name meaningful to consumers. This flexibility promotes oversight without affecting food characteristics or requiring frequent amendments to standards. The FDA adopts food standards from the Codex Alimentarius Commission to promote food safety. These standards are published in the Federal Register for public review before acceptance. Congress authorized the promulgation of food standards in 1938 to address oversight of \"imitation\" products. During the 1920s and 1930s, the U.S. government brought claims against a product called \"Bred Spred\" for misbranding under the 1906 act due to its low fruit content. The courts ruled in favor of the manufacturer, stating that the product was not misbranded as it did not falsely claim to be jam. Congress, concerned about similar products like Bred Spred, passed the 1938 act to address fraud and consumer confidence issues. Congress passed the 1938 act to establish standards of identity for food products to maintain integrity and address fraud issues, following cases like Bred Spred where courts ruled in favor of manufacturers due to the absence of authoritative definitions. The government faced challenges in holding products to traditional standards, leading to a loss of consumer confidence. The FDA promulgates standards of identity for food through the rulemaking process, following Congress's intent to prevent fraudulent practices and ensure fair dealing for consumers. The Supreme Court has recognized the need for these standards due to consumers' inability to determine product quality based solely on labeling information. A citizen petition proposing a standard of identity must provide \"reasonable grounds\" for the FDA to consider. The petitioner must present provable facts showing that the proposal would benefit consumers. If the proposal meets this requirement, it is published in the Federal Register for public comment. The FDA can then accept or reject the proposal after reviewing the comments. After a citizen petition proposing a standard of identity is published for public comment, the FDA may issue an order establishing the standard. The order becomes effective on a specified date, and within 30 days, the agency enters the second stage of the rulemaking process. During this stage, objections can be submitted, leading to a public evidentiary hearing to resolve disputed issues. The filing of objections results in a stay of the disputed provisions until final FDA action. The public hearing allows for the presentation of evidence and testimony, with the agency issuing a tentative order in the final stage. The FDA issues a tentative order with detailed findings and conclusions, followed by a final order setting the standard of identity. Parties can object and request an oral argument before the FDA. The final standard of identity can be judicially reviewed in the U.S. Court of Appeals. Adverse parties can seek review, but standing must be direct. The court can affirm, set aside, or modify the order. The court can set aside the FDA's standard of identity order based on substantial evidence. Judicial review is appropriate for regulations of general application adopted by an administrative agency. The Supreme Court reviewed the FDA's authority to set standards of identity in Federal Security Administrator v. Quaker Oats Co. The Quaker Oats Company petitioned for review of standards for farina and other flour mill products. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit set aside the standards of identity for farina and enriched farina, stating that the evidence was speculative. The Supreme Court disagreed, upholding the standards based on the judgment of the Administrator. The Supreme Court upheld the standards of identity for farina and enriched farina, stating that the Administrator's judgment was supported by sufficient evidence to prevent consumer confusion. The agency follows formal rulemaking procedures to amend or remove existing standards, allowing for new ingredients or manufacturing methods through a petition process. The FDA enforces standards of identity through the misbranding provision in the FFDCA. If a food is deemed misbranded, the agency can take enforcement actions. A food is considered misbranded if it does not conform to the standard of identity and its label does not bear the specified name. The FDA has not provided formal guidance on when a product is considered to \"purport\" to meet a standard. The FDA enforces standards of identity through the misbranding provision in the FFDCA. A court generally does not require evidence of consumer deception under this misbranding provision. For example, the U.S. government took enforcement action against food sold as \"tomato catsup with preservative\" that did not conform to the standard of identity for catsup. The Second Circuit found that a product labeled as \"tomato catsup\" but containing sodium benzoate was misbranded as it did not meet the standard of identity for catsup. The court emphasized that the product's appearance, taste, and use as a substitute for catsup were sufficient evidence of misbranding, without needing to prove consumer deception. The FDA has discretion in enforcing misbranding provisions for standards of identity. The FDA may issue warning letters for misbranded food products under the FFDCA, allowing recipients to take corrective actions before formal enforcement. These letters are informal and advisory, not qualifying as final agency actions subject to judicial review. The FDA may issue warning letters for misbranded food products under the FFDCA, allowing recipients to take corrective actions before formal enforcement. The agency may prefer a warning letter as a more efficient enforcement option, expecting prompt corrective action. Seizure of misbranded food in interstate commerce is a civil action to protect public health, involving physical seizure followed by a judicial condemnation proceeding in the U.S. district court. The FDA has jurisdiction over seizure proceedings and may decree the condemnation of seized food, ordering its destruction, sale, reconditioning, or export. Congress has introduced legislation to encourage the FDA to establish specific standards of identity for food products, such as honey, to ensure accurate classification and safety for consumers. Senator Gillibrand supports adopting a national standard of identity for honey to protect consumers and prevent misbranded imports that could harm their health or safety. This provision could lead to the FDA establishing a standard of identity for honey through the rulemaking process."
