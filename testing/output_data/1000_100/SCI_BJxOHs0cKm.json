It introduces metrics to measure generalization capability and proposes an optimization algorithm. Deep models with millions of parameters have demonstrated strong generalization in computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing applications. The text discusses different metrics to measure the sharpness of solutions and their connection to generalization. It highlights issues with Hessian-based sharpness measures and re-parameterization effects on parameter geometry. Bayesian analysis is also mentioned, with the use of Taylor expansion to evaluate model simplicity. Additionally, the text mentions penalizing sharp minima and determining optimal batch size based on the Occam factor. The PAC-Bayes bound and Bayesian marginal likelihood are used to analyze generalization behavior of deep models. Different metrics for measuring solution sharpness are discussed, with a focus on incorporating local properties into generalization analysis. BID28 suggests using the difference between perturbed loss and empirical loss as a sharpness metric. BID3 aims to optimize the PAC-Bayes bound for improved model generalization. In this paper, BID3 aims to optimize the PAC-Bayes bound for better model generalization by exploring the relationship between model generalization and the local \"smoothness\" of a solution. The analysis shows that the generalization error is related to the Hessian of the loss function, the Lipschitz constant of the Hessian, parameter scales, and the number of training samples. A new metric for generalization is introduced, allowing for the selection of an optimal perturbation level to improve generalization, which is also related to the Hessian. An algorithm based on perturbation and Hessian estimation is proposed to enhance model generalization. The PAC-Bayes paradigm involves probability measures over a function class F, with a posterior distribution D f and a prior distribution \u03c0 f. The empirical loss is minimized by drawing functions from the posterior, with the gap between expected and empirical loss bounded by the KL divergence between D f and \u03c0 f. The function f is parameterized as f (w) with w \u2208 W, and perturbing D w around any point is considered. The PAC-Bayes paradigm involves probability measures over a function class F, with a posterior distribution D f and a prior distribution \u03c0 f. The function f is parameterized as f (w) with w \u2208 W, and perturbing D w around any point is considered. For any \u03b4 > 0 and \u03b7 > 0, with probability at least 1 \u2212 \u03b4 over the draw of n samples, an optimal perturbation level for u needs to be found to minimize the bound. In this section, the focus is on finding an optimal perturbation level for u to minimize the bound by connecting the Hessian matrix with model generalization. The local smoothness assumption is introduced along with the main theorem, emphasizing the importance of local neighborhood properties for deep models. The neighborhood set is defined with a particular type of radius, but the argument applies to other radius types as well. The text discusses the importance of the Hessian Lipschitz condition in modeling the smoothness of second-order gradients in numeric optimization. The focus is on finding an optimal perturbation level to minimize the bound by connecting the Hessian matrix with model generalization. Theorem 2 states that with careful perturbation levels, the expected loss can be minimized. Theorem 2 states that by choosing perturbation levels carefully, the expected loss of a uniformly perturbed model can be controlled. The bound is related to the diagonal element of the Hessian, Lipschitz constant \u03c1, neighborhood scales characterized by \u03ba, number of parameters m, and number of samples n. Perturbation level is inversely related to \u2207 2 i,iL, suggesting perturbing more along \"flat\" coordinates. Truncated Gaussian perturbation is discussed in Appendix B. If the empirical loss function satisfies the local Hessian Lipschitz condition, perturbation around a fixed point can be bounded up to the third-order. The linear and second-order terms in perturbations with zero expectation are simplified due to independence of perturbations for different parameters. The \"posterior\" distribution of model parameters is uniform, with varying support. Assuming bounded perturbed parameters, the KL divergence is bounded. The third-order term is also bounded. The bound in theorem 2 does not explain over-parameterization when m n. Choosing the same perturbation level for all parameters simplifies the argument. The proof procedure involves solving for \u03c3 to minimize the right hand side, with lemma 3 stating conditions for loss function and bounded model weights. The experiment treats \u03b7 as a hyper-parameter, while theorem 2 discusses re-parameterization of ReLU-MLP and the spectrum of \u2207 2L for generalization power. For a multi-layer perceptron with RELU activation, re-parameterization can scale the Hessian spectrum without affecting generalization. The bound changes approximately with a logarithmic factor during re-parameterization, with optimal perturbation levels scaling inversely with parameters. The bound remains behind a logarithmic function for RELU-MLP. The text discusses heuristic-based approximations and empirical observations related to a metric called pacGen, which is based on PAC-Bayes theory. It also mentions the need to estimate the Hessian matrix and Lipschitz constant for real-world data analysis. To estimate the diagonal elements of the Hessian and Lipschitz constant, we follow Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2014) and approximate \u2207. Using a neighborhood radius \u03ba with \u03b3 = 0.1, we observe that as batch size increases, the gap between test and training loss widens. Our metric \u03a8 \u03ba (L, w * ) shows the same trend. We do not use LR annealing heuristics for large batch training. The experiment involved fixing the training batch size at 256 and varying the learning rate. Decreasing the learning rate led to an increase in the gap between test and training loss. The proposed metric \u03a8 \u03ba (L, w * ) showed a similar trend. Adding noise to the model for better generalization has been successful both empirically and theoretically. It is suggested to optimize the perturbed empirical loss E u [L(w + u)] for better model generalization. The experiment involved fixing the training batch size at 256 and varying the learning rate, which resulted in an increased gap between test and training loss. To improve model generalization, it is recommended to optimize the perturbed empirical loss E u [L(w + u)] using a systematic perturbation method based on the PAC-Bayes bound. The algorithm presented in Algorithm 1 perturbs model weights with small gradients below a certain threshold for efficiency. The perturbation level decreases logarithmically as epochs progress. The perturbed algorithm decreases perturbation level with a log factor as epochs progress. Results are compared on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 BID17, and Tiny ImageNet 8 using Wide-ResNet BID36 model. Parameters include learning rates, batch sizes, and perturbation values for different datasets. The perturbed algorithm decreases perturbation level with a log factor as epochs progress. Results are compared on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 BID17, and Tiny ImageNet 8 using Wide-ResNet BID36 model. Parameters include learning rates, batch sizes, and perturbation values for different datasets. Gradients w.r.t. perturbed loss are updated using off-the-shell algorithms. Different optimizers and learning rates are used for CIFAR and Tiny ImageNet datasets. Perturbation effect is similar to regularization, improving validation set accuracy while decreasing training set accuracy. PerturbedOPT outperforms dropout by applying varying levels of perturbation based on local smoothness structures. The generalization power of a model is linked to the Hessian and the smoothness of the solution, as well as the scales of the parameters and the number of training samples. The best perturbation level scales inversely with the square root of the Hessian, which mitigates the scaling effect in re-parameterization. This is the first work to rigorously integrate the Hessian in the model generalization bound. A new metric and perturbation algorithm are proposed based on this generalization bound. The algorithm adjusts perturbation levels based on the Hessian. A toy example with a 2-dimensional sample set from 3 Gaussians is discussed. A 5-layer MLP model with sigmoid activation and cross entropy loss is used. The model has two free parameters w1 and w2. Training is done with 100 samples, and the loss function is plotted with respect to the model variables. The loss function is plotted with respect to model variables w1 and w2 in a 2-dimensional toy example. Local optima are observed, with a sharp one marked by a green line and a flat one marked by a red line. The colors on the loss surface represent generalization metric scores, with a smaller score indicating better generalization power. The figure shows that the global optimum has a high metric score, suggesting poor generalization capability compared to a local optimum with a lower score. A plane at the bottom of the figure indicates an approximated generalization bound, which considers both the loss and the generalization metric. The local optimum with the red bar, despite slightly higher loss, has a similar overall bound. The sharp minimum and flat minimum local optima are compared in a toy example. The sharp minimum approximates true labels better but has complex structures in predictions, while the flat minimum produces a simpler classification boundary. Truncation of the Gaussian distribution is done to meet bounded perturbation requirements. The event is analyzed using the union bound with coefficients bounded by a constant \u03c4. The coefficients are bounded by \u03c4, with a prior \u03c0 as N(0, \u03c4 I). The variance decreases after truncation, and for convex L(w) around w*, the best \u03c3i is found. With bounded model weights, a lemma is derived for loss function l(f, x, y) \u2208 [0, 1]. The algorithm treats \u03b7 as a hyper-parameter for optimization. The algorithm treats \u03b7 as a hyper-parameter for optimization by building a grid. The proof involves minimizing a term related to \u03c3i and showing monotonically increasing behavior. The lemma discusses eigenvalues of Hessian and generalization. The lemma discusses the eigenvalues of the Hessian and their relation to the generalization ability of the model. It also introduces a new lemma about correlated perturbations and the local \u03c1-Hessian Lipschitz condition. The proof of Lemma 5 shows that the first order term is zero at the local optimal point, and the quadratic term is bounded by a certain inequality. A comparison between dropout and a perturbation algorithm is presented, with results on accuracy for different dropout rates on various datasets. The study compares dropout and perturbation algorithms, showing improved accuracy with added dropout. Dropout rate of 0.3 works best for CIFAR-10, while for CIFAR-100 and Tiny ImageNet, dropout also enhances performance. In comparison to dropout configurations, perturbedOPT algorithm shows better performance on validation/test datasets. Perturbed algorithm adjusts perturbation levels based on local smoothness structures, while dropout uses a single rate for all parameters."
