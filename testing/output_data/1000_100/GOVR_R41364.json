    "content": "The Bush tax cuts, enacted in 2001 and 2003, were set to expire at the end of 2010. This included lower rates for long-term capital gains and dividends, with a 0% tax rate for certain taxpayers. Without legislative action, capital gains tax rates would have increased to 20% and dividends would be taxed at ordinary rates. President Obama proposed retaining lower rates for middle-income taxpayers but increasing rates for higher-income individuals. The tax rates were extended through 2012 by the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance. The Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 extended tax rates through 2012. The final resolution in 2013 taxed capital gains for higher-income individuals at higher rates. Revenue gain from increasing capital gains taxes is influenced by behavioral responses assumed by JCT and Treasury. Obama Administration estimated $16 billion revenue from allowing Bush tax cuts for capital gains to expire in FY2019. The Congressional Budget Office projected an increase in the effective capital gains tax rate from 13.3% in 2008 to 17.9% in 2019, resulting in a potential revenue difference of $40 billion. To address behavioral responses to tax increases on capital gains, some have proposed applying mark-to-market rules to tax capital gains as accrued. The Congressional Budget Office projected a potential revenue difference of $40 billion due to an increase in the effective capital gains tax rate. Some have proposed applying mark-to-market rules to tax capital gains as accrued, which could impact revenue projections. The Obama Administration's projections and those of the JCT may be affected by realizations responses, with implications for revenue effects. The potential revenue gains from allowing lower capital gains tax rates to expire may be understated due to taxpayers delaying realizations to avoid taxes. Tax increases could potentially lose revenue if realizations are postponed until death, escaping taxation entirely. Elasticities of capital gains realizations responses are typically negative, indicating a decrease in realizations with a percentage change in taxes. The elasticity of capital gains realizations determines the impact of tax rate changes on revenue gain or loss. A higher elasticity value results in a smaller revenue change. If elasticity is less than one, a tax increase gains revenue; if greater than one, it loses revenue. The ratio of revenue gain projected to static gain is one minus the elasticity. For example, with an elasticity of 0.25, 75% of the static revenue gain will be realized. The three types of elasticities relevant to capital gains realizations and revenues are permanent, short-run, and transitory. Permanent elasticity measures the longer-term response to a permanent tax rate change, while short-run elasticity measures the short-term response. Transitory elasticity accounts for temporary tax changes due to varying incomes and tax planning strategies. The discussion focuses on the short-term effects of tax rate changes on capital gains realizations. Taxpayers may accelerate realizations to take advantage of lower tax rates before they increase. Short-term responses can be influenced by recent changes in realizations and tax rates. The discussion focuses on short-term effects of tax rate changes on capital gains realizations. Unbeknownst to revenue estimators in the late 1980s, there was a surge in realizations in 1986 due to pre-announced increase in capital gains taxes for 1987. Short-run responses to tax cuts may unleash significant realizations, but an increase should not cause a contraction as unrealized gains will remain unaffected. The transitory response, distinct from short-term response, occurs due to temporary changes in tax rates. Significant transitory responses occurred in 1986 and 2012 due to tax legislation changes. Even without law changes, high-income taxpayers with capital gains can experience fluctuations leading to transitory responses. Prior to 1987, when capital gains were subject to graduated rates, transitory responses were more pronounced. Statistical estimates of realizations responses are based on various functional forms, with elasticity being a common factor. The elasticity of capital gains realizations is expected to rise proportionally with the tax rate, with elasticities reported in absolute value. This leads to a revenue-maximizing tax rate, typically around the 22% rate. The underlying equations for this are presented in Appendix A. The 22% tax rate is considered appropriate for tax increases. Current law includes rates of 0%, 15%, and 20%, along with a 3.8% net investment income tax for high-income taxpayers. The Congressional Budget Office estimates a 21.2% marginal tax rate for long-term capital gains. The George H. W. Bush Administration proposed reducing the capital gains tax rate in 1990. In 1990, legislation increased the top rate on capital gains from 20% to 28% by taxing capital gains as ordinary income. Revenue-estimating agencies began investigating behavioral responses in realizations elasticities. The issue of revenue cost was crucial due to strict budget constraints. Different elasticities were used by the Administration and the Joint Committee on Taxation. Data from aggregate time series and micro-data studies were used to estimate the realizations response. Estimates of realizations response varied from 0.3 to almost 4, with implications for revenue gains or losses based on different elasticities. Aggregate time series estimates ranged from 0.3 to 0.9. Estimates of realizations response varied from 0.3 to 3.8, with implications for revenue gains or losses based on different elasticities. The range of estimated responses highlighted serious issues with estimation methods, particularly for individual taxpayer data. The JCT favored time series results for reliability, while the Treasury's methodology remained unspecified. Researchers faced challenges in estimating realizations response, with individual data preferred over aggregation to avoid bias and information loss. Individual data is preferred over aggregation to avoid bias and information loss. However, distinguishing between permanent and transitory responses is a challenge, as income and tax rates fluctuate over time. This complicates estimating realizations response, with concerns about individuals timing realizations to coincide with low tax rates. Panel data following individuals over several years was suggested to separate elasticities, but relying on simple cross-section results for permanent responses was not feasible. Revenue-estimating entities did not rely on larger elasticities close to 4 produced by some micro-data studies. The studies used individual tax rates over several years to determine elasticities, reporting smaller but still significant results. Panel studies attempted to address transitory effects but may not fully correct for them due to income fluctuations over time. The Treasury may have chosen a larger elasticity based on panel results, despite some studies suggesting lower elasticities. The proposed tax cuts were not enacted at that time, but were eventually reduced in 1997 and again in 2003. Researchers focused on producing more precise estimates for evaluating capital gains taxes. Researchers focused on producing more precise estimates for evaluating capital gains taxes, with attention to the sharp spike in realizations in 1986. This spike, occurring alongside a tax increase, raised concerns about transitory responses in econometric studies. Multiple academic studies on realizations response since 1990 have contributed to this discussion. The table in Table 1 includes estimates of practices by CBO, JCT, and Treasury, cautioning that its realizations estimate is not for estimating revenues but part of a statistical study projecting capital gains realizations. The coefficient in the second column produces the elasticity when multiplied by the tax rate. Gravelle's study highlighted a limit to the realizations response, noting that realizations cannot exceed accruals. The study found that the upper limit of the realizations elasticity is 0.5, indicating that in the absence of taxes and transaction costs, individuals would sell every asset every year. However, this limit is likely lower in reality due to investors being satisfied with their investments and some assets being unlikely to be sold, such as controlling shares of corporations held by individuals and families. The study conducted in 1991 analyzed data from 1954 to 1989, estimating a 46% realization to accruals level and an 18.4% tax rate. Recent evidence from 1989-2013 shows similar ratios of 48% and 17.3%, supporting the initial findings. The highest coefficient suggests that without taxes and costs, realizations could increase by 4.25 times their current value. The study in 1991 found that realizations could increase by 4.25 times their current value, with an elasticity of 3.2. Panel studies were unable to address transitory issues observed in cross-section studies. Burman and Randolph's study used state tax rates to estimate elasticity, finding a small permanent response and a large transitory elasticity. The studies by Auerbach and Siegel, as well as subsequent research, confirmed findings below the upper limit of elasticities. Studies incorporating state tax rates like Auten and Joulfaian and Dowd, McClelland, and Muthitacharoen had the highest elasticities. These studies added state tax rates and had longer panels, affecting their estimates to reflect timing responses. The Dowd, McClelland, and Muthitacharoen study provided sensitivity analysis with a wide range of estimates based on different specifications, variables, and time periods. Studies using aggregate time series data showed varying elasticities, with more years leading to lower elasticities. The elasticities in the time series studies vary, with more years leading to lower values. Some studies fall within the range of eight studies from the 1980s, while others show larger results. State studies also show differences in elasticities, with the importance of controlling for state fixed effects highlighted. The elasticities in Table 1 are lower and closer together compared to studies from the 1980s. Both JCT and Treasury estimates appear high and likely understate the revenue from increasing the tax rate on capital gains. Table 2 compares revenue estimates for a five percentage point increase in the tax rate based on CBO projections and elasticities from Table 1. The CBO estimates a revenue gain of $30.4 billion per year from a five-percentage-point tax rate increase on capital gains for 2019. This increase ranges from $31.4 billion to $1 billion, based on different elasticities. There is interest in adopting measures like accrual-based taxation with a look-back method. The CBO estimates a revenue gain of $30.4 billion per year from a five-percentage-point tax rate increase on capital gains for 2019. Interest lies in adopting measures like accrual-based taxation with a look-back method to increase capital gains revenues significantly. The Auten and Joulfaian panel study is considered reliable but may overstate the permanent elasticity, while the Dowd, McClellan, and Muthitacharoen study produced the largest elasticity. The elasticity of capital gains tax rate increases is likely below 0.5 based on various studies, suggesting that revenue gains may be understated. Post-1980s econometric studies and limit calculations indicate there will be revenue gains from a five-percentage-point tax rate increase, although these gains are relatively small compared to the highest elasticity estimates. Based on studies, increasing capital gains tax rates could result in significant revenue gains, potentially three times higher than projected by the JCT. The Gravelle upper limit suggests revenues could be 45% larger. The JCT's projections may underestimate the actual revenue gains without a change in realization response. The appendix details the method of calculating taxes and modeling realizations and revenues based on the elasticity of realizations with respect to taxes. The relationship between capital gains tax rates and revenue gains is analyzed through various equations, including the elasticity of gains with respect to tax rates. By manipulating equations, it is shown that revenue gains can be estimated using different forms of the tax rate equation. If the elasticity is 1, there is no revenue gain. The revenue maximizing tax rate can be calculated by setting (1-bt) equal to zero, resulting in a rate of 1/b. Using the look-back method for calculating taxes involves adjusting basis to achieve the same net on a sale as accrual taxation. The growth rate can be determined using the equation (1) g = (S/B) (1/T) -1, and finding a new basis value B* to match accrual taxation returns. The gain on realization with the new basis is S-t(S-B*). Equating it with the gain on accrual, we can solve for B* using the formula provided. Appendix B discusses econometric studies on elasticities in the 1980s, which influenced the debate in the 1990s on realizations response to tax rates. Relating capital gains realizations to tax rates presents challenges, with debate over using aggregate time series or individual taxpayer data. Aggregate results range from 0.3 to 0.9, while individual data estimates vary from 0.55 to almost 4. Individual data is preferred due to loss of information in aggregate data. The challenges of relating capital gains realizations to tax rates include biases in aggregated results and difficulties in controlling for changes over time. Problems with individual data sets led many researchers to believe that aggregate time series results were more reliable. The effective capital gains tax rate, used as an explanatory variable, is actually influenced by realizations themselves, posing a significant issue. Different techniques can be used to address the endogeneity of the explanatory variable in econometric analysis, such as using different tax rate measures or instrumental variables methods. The issue is more severe in individual cross-section data compared to aggregate time series data. Another important issue is distinguishing between permanent and transitory responses in individual data, especially for high-income individuals who realize most gains. Tax rates vary over time due to fluctuating income, leading individuals to time realizations to coincide with low rates. Attempts to address this issue with panel studies have limitations. Studies since the 1980s have examined realizations, with some using various specifications. Results from two studies were excluded, and references to these studies are provided in Appendix C. Slemrod and Shobe (1990) conducted a study using a six-year small panel to replicate previous studies on elasticities. They found large elasticities, confirming potential issues with previous studies. Their results varied over time periods, with some not statistically significant. The study by Gillingham and Greenlees (1992) extends a previous analysis on tax rates from 1954-1985 to 1989. They made changes in their approach, including using an instrumental variables technique that increased the coefficient and elasticity at a 22% tax rate. The study by Gillingham and Greenlees (1992) extended the analysis on tax rates to 1989. They increased the coefficient to 5.8 and elasticity to 1.28 using the maximum tax rate as an instrument. Differencing the data produced higher elasticities but were not statistically significant. Excluding 1986, the estimated coefficient was 3.4 with predicted gains instrument and 3.5 when data were differenced. The study by Gillingham and Greenlees (1992) extended the analysis on tax rates to 1989, with elasticities ranging from 0.75 to 1.28. Using the maximum tax rate as an instrument raised the coefficient to 5.8. However, using the maximum rate as an instrument for time-series regression poses challenges due to changes in the law over the period, affecting the relationship between maximum and average rates. The Burman and Randolph study from 1994 innovatively separated permanent and transitory effects in tax rates using state variations. They estimated an elasticity of 0.18 at an 18% tax rate, implying a coefficient of one. The study by Bogart and Gentry (1995) utilized state tax rate differentials to identify permanent responses, reporting an elasticity of 0.65 at their reported tax rate, reflecting a coefficient of 2.5. The study also found an elasticity of 0.55 at a 22% tax rate. The study by Auerbach and Siegel (2000) used panel data from 1985 to 1994 to replicate Burman and Randolph's results for a different time period. They found a permanent elasticity of 0.33 at the mean tax rate, with a transitory elasticity of 4.9. Auerbach and Siegel also reported a higher permanent elasticity of 1.75 when adding additional instruments to the tax rate regression. The study by Auerbach and Siegel (2000) found a higher permanent elasticity of 1.75, compared to the previous 0.33. They used panel data from 1985 to 1994 and added additional instruments to the tax rate regression. Their findings suggest that the inclusion of the current first dollar rate may introduce a transitory element to the permanent tax rate, leading to a significantly larger elasticity. The coefficient changes when excluding certain years in the semi-log specification, with elasticities ranging from 0.5 to 1.13. Different specifications and methods, such as instrumental variables and changes in tax rates, were used to estimate elasticities. The analysis explored different specifications and methods to estimate elasticities, with coefficients ranging from 0.83 to 1.46. However, many tax rate coefficients were not statistically significant, indicating potential transitory elements. Auten and Joulfaian (2004) used a longer panel to estimate permanent and transitory effects, with a lower elasticity estimate possibly reflecting time series elements. The elasticity estimates from various studies in the 1980s range from 0.72 to 0.79 at different tax rates. Evans (2009) conducted a cross-section regression with elasticities typically between 2 and 5, but the study has limitations due to data issues. Bakija and Gentry (2014) used a 50-year panel for their study. The study by Bakija and Gentry (2014) utilizes a 50-year panel of state data on combined federal and state tax rates, with state- and time-fixed effects to control for unobserved differences. The effects are identified through changes in effective state marginal tax rates. Dowd, McClelland, and Muthitacharoen (2015) use standard panel methods with a 10-year panel, but their estimates of transitory elasticities may be affected by adjacent years. The study by Minas, Lim, and Evans (2018) analyzes Australian data from 1988 to 2015, considering capital gains tax changes and marginal tax rates. It includes controls for GDP, inflation, and the stock market index, with sensitivity analysis in different time periods. The study by Auten, Burman, and Randolph (1980, 1989) examines capital gains realization behavior using panel data. They also discuss the effects of the 1981 Act on income distribution and taxes paid. Other studies by Clotfelter (1982), Congressional Budget Office (1986, 1988), and Darby et al. (Treasury Bulletin) reconsider the revenue effects of capital gains taxation. The curr_chunk discusses various studies on the effects of taxation on capital gains realization behavior, including research by Feldstein, Slemrod, Yitzhaki, Gillingham, Greenlees, Zieschang, Jones, Lindsey, and Minarik. These studies provide insights into the impact of taxation on the selling of corporate stock and the realization of capital gains. Studies since the 1980s have examined the capital gains realization behavior of the rich and sophisticated, as well as the impact of taxes on capital gains realizations. Jon M. and William M. Gentry conducted a study on capital gains realizations using state-level data. Other studies have also explored the relationship between capital gains taxes and realizations, as well as the elasticity of capital gains. The Institute for Research on the Economics of Taxation has published various studies on capital gains tax realizations and tax rates, including works by Eichner and Sinai, Gillingham and Greenlees, Minas, Lim, and Evans, and Slemrod and Shobe. These studies provide new evidence on the impact of tax rates on capital gains revenue."
