    "content": "The \"After School Education and Anti-Crime Act of 2001\" aims to improve academic and social outcomes for students, reduce juvenile crime, and decrease the risk of youth becoming victims of crime by providing productive activities during after school hours. Congress finds that today's youth face increased social risks, spend more time unsupervised, and are most at risk of violence between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. Academic failure consequences are more severe in 2001. After school programs help address youth social problems, and many governors support increasing them through a Federal/State partnership. Over 450 police chiefs, sheriffs, and prosecutors, along with police officer associations, have urged public officials to provide after school programs for children and teens in the US, emphasizing the importance of safe and positive learning environments during those hours. The goals of the Act include increasing academic success, promoting safe after-school environments, providing alternatives to negative activities, and reducing juvenile crime. The Act also amends the 21st Century Community Learning Centers Act to increase program authorization from 3 to 5, and outlines application procedures. Section 10904 of the Century Community Learning Centers Act is amended to include requirements for recipients to provide a percentage of the annual cost of activities from sources other than funds provided under the Act.
