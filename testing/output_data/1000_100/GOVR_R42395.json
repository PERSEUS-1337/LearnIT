Each new House adopts changes to the rules, a feature unique to the House compared to the Senate. The report is part of a series that examines rules changes in different Congresses. The 109th Congress saw extensive rules changes when Republicans took control of the House after 40 years of Democratic rule. The changes were grouped into five broad areas and further subdivided. The report also covers the Democratic critique of Republican management. The subsequent report focuses on the 110th and 111th Congresses under Democratic majority and the 112th to 115th Congresses under Republican majority. The report analyzes the critique by Democrats of Republican management of the House from the 104th through the 109th Congresses, and Democratic amendments proposed to Republican rules packages in the 112th through the 115th Congresses.

This report supplements the House Rules and Manual by Congress, containing provisions of House rules with notes on changes and decisions. Rules are arranged by number, with stable rule and clause numbers. The report does not cover all actions taken during each Congress for organizational, procedural, and administrative changes.

Another controversial change involved a standing order affecting budgetary legislation.
