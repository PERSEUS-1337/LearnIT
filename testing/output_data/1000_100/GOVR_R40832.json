    "content": "This report summarizes the USDA's efforts to establish a national animal traceability system for rapid disease outbreak response. Despite economic benefits, federal proposals face controversy within the U.S. cattle industry. The report discusses the background of animal ID and traceability, reviews arguments for and against a national system, and highlights unresolved issues. Appendices provide a timeline of the U.S. National Animal Identification System (NAIS) development and a program description. On February 5, 2010, Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack announced the abandonment of the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) in favor of a new approach called Animal Disease Traceability. This new program allows states and tribal nations to choose their own level of animal identification and traceability for livestock populations, providing flexibility to meet producer needs and interests. Under the new Animal Disease Traceability framework, USDA will require all animals moving in interstate commerce to have a form of ID for traceability back to their originating state. The Secretary of Agriculture has the authority to regulate interstate movement of farm-raised livestock. USDA has been collaborating with state and tribal officials to develop a proposed rule for traceability regulations. APHIS held a forum in March 2010 for animal health officials to discuss the new framework for animal disease traceability. USDA released publications in August 2010 outlining recommendations for a proposed rule. Follow-up public forums were held to gather feedback on the framework. USDA's traceability framework is still evolving, with a key principle being the need for animal ID for traceability in interstate commerce. The framework for animal disease traceability emphasizes that states and tribal nations are responsible for managing traceability programs. States can choose to have no mandatory animal ID, rely on existing systems, or develop their own detailed ID system. Data collection and storage will be done by states, not the federal government. Federal rules will apply to livestock moving in interstate commerce, requiring official identification and an Interstate Certificate of Veterinary Inspection. The Traceability Regulation Working Group, in collaboration with state and tribal animal health officials, will establish performance standards for animal disease traceability. States and tribal nations will have detailed traceability cooperative agreements with APHIS. Federal funding will be provided annually. The USDA will implement a program for animal disease traceability through federal regulations and rulemaking process. Federal funding for this initiative will be provided through annual cooperative agreements, with potential funding from the Senate Committee on Appropriations after needs are identified. A proposed rule defining animal disease traceability is expected to be published in April 2011, with a final rule likely 12 to 15 months later. The proposed rule for animal disease traceability is expected to be published, with the final rule likely 12 to 15 months later. Major outbreaks of harmful animal diseases have caused economic damages and disruptions in domestic and international markets. The United States has been fortunate in avoiding catastrophic disease outbreaks, but the economic consequences of a potential outbreak could be severe. The economic consequences of major animal disease outbreaks in the 1990s and early 2000s led to the development of animal identification and traceability systems in many countries. These programs vary from voluntary in the United States to mandatory in the EU, Japan, and South Korea. The potential cost of a Foot-and-Mouth Disease outbreak in the US could range from $30 billion to $100 billion. Some major importers like Japan and South Korea are considering requiring traceability on imported meat products, which could impact market access. Developments in animal health, food safety, and import standards globally can significantly affect the U.S. livestock industry, as the U.S. is a major producer and exporter of livestock and animal products. The U.S. leads in beef and poultry production and ranks third in pork production. In terms of trade, the U.S. is the top exporter of pork, second in poultry (after Brazil), and third in beef. The U.S. is a major producer and exporter of livestock and animal products, ranking second in poultry exports and third in beef exports. U.S. exports of animal products make up a significant portion of domestic production, with 17% for pork and poultry, and 6% for beef. Animal identification involves keeping records on individual farm animals for tracking purposes, including information on origins and traceability through the marketing chain. A national database of animal ID combined with traceability is essential for quick response to disease outbreaks or tainted food, minimizing threats to human and animal health. Different countries have varying animal ID systems, collecting information on birthplace, owner, movements, and slaughter details. Elaborate systems include data on sex, breed, and parentage. The animal ID systems include details on sex, breed, parentage, feeds, pharmaceuticals, and product movement. Reasons for tracking animals and products include rapid response to health and safety concerns. In the US, focus is on animal health traceability from birth to processing. Other countries like the EU, Japan, and South Korea have more comprehensive systems for both animal health and food safety. The national animal ID and traceability system in the United States responds to demands for better information on animal products' history, including where and how animals were raised, product preparation, and marketing chain details. Proponents argue that the system enhances animal health surveillance and disease control. The national animal ID and traceability system in the United States aims to enhance animal health surveillance and disease control by facilitating early detection of disease outbreaks and minimizing the economic impact through regionalization or compartmentalization. This system would reduce producers' disease testing costs and help contain outbreaks at both regional and national levels. The national animal ID and traceability system in the United States aims to enhance animal health surveillance and disease control by facilitating early detection of disease outbreaks and minimizing economic impact. Rapid identification and compartmentalization of disease outbreaks limit spread and economic damage, while also increasing domestic marketing opportunities for farmers and ranchers. Food, including meats, is used by processors and retailers for inventory management and adding value to products. ID and traceability help verify production methods for organic, humane treatment, and environmental standards. Government-coordinated programs, like USDA's Process Verification program, allow livestock and meat producers to assure customers of consistent quality products through independent audits. This voluntary program enables suppliers to make marketing claims about breeds and feeding practices. A traceability program for animal products provides valuable management tools for producers, offering post-mortem information on cattle production techniques and tracking performance history of racing or show animals. It increases transparency in the supply chain, reducing the risk of unfounded liability claims against livestock producers. An animal ID and traceability program helps livestock producers maintain records on animal movements, health, and breed registries. It addresses food safety and national security concerns by collaborating with federal and state agencies to protect the food supply from threats like tuberculosis and foodborne illnesses. A more rigorous traceback and animal ID system could facilitate food recalls and contain the spread of foodborne illnesses. Enhancing foreign marketing opportunities for animal products through traceability systems is crucial in reassuring buyers about the health of U.S. animals and meeting foreign veterinary and food safety requirements. This also helps in certifying production processes for value-added niche markets, especially after the appearance of BSE in North America in 2003. After the appearance of BSE in North America in 2003, the USDA's AMS developed an export verification program for U.S. plants to meet beef import specifications of countries like Japan. The program is voluntary but necessary for access to foreign markets like Japan and Korea. Establishing a traceability system is crucial for enhancing U.S. exports of animals and animal products, as it was a factor preventing the U.S. from receiving the best status for BSE from the OIE. Implementing an animal ID and traceability system could enhance the United States' ability to compete internationally and support domestic price structures. It could also improve animal welfare during natural disasters by aiding in locating and rescuing at-risk animal populations. Opponents argue that such a system invades privacy. Critics of production methods argue that government invasion of privacy and potential disclosure of proprietary information are major concerns. They also highlight increased costs and technical complexity, with the majority of expenses falling on the cattle sector. The technology requirements could exceed operators' capabilities, leading to operational challenges. The implementation of a national ID program in the cattle industry is expected to increase costs and complexity, disadvantaging family farms with a lack of market power in price structure. Critics argue that small operators will struggle to absorb these new costs, eroding profit margins. Large retailers and meat packers may shift compliance costs onto producers, further impacting the industry. Large retailers and meat packers may shift compliance costs to farms and ranches, making it harder for smaller, independent operators to survive. Some producers object to a national animal ID program on religious grounds, while others fear increased transparency could lead to higher tax liabilities. The USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) oversees animal health programs for disease eradication and control, including animal identification components. Brucellosis ID tags were used successfully in a eradication program, leading to a decrease in animal ID requirements as the program ended. Certain classes of livestock have official identification requirements for interstate commerce. The USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) oversees animal health programs for disease eradication and control, including animal identification components. Official disease programs for pseudorabies in swine and scrapie in sheep require animals to be officially identified before entering interstate commerce. Various state laws and breed association rules also require animal identification for shows or races. U.S. animal ID limitations were highlighted after the discovery of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in 2003, leading to difficulties in tracing infected cattle and impacting trade relationships. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) program, proposed in 2002, aimed to improve animal traceability in the U.S. However, it faced criticism and was replaced in 2010 with a more flexible, state-based program for livestock moving in interstate commerce. This change was in response to concerns from the U.S. cattle sector. The NAIS program aimed to improve animal traceability in the U.S. but faced criticism from the cattle sector due to cost burdens. It covered major livestock species but excluded household pets. The new system replacing NAIS is still relevant to livestock traceability. The USDA focused on popularizing the voluntary NAIS program, ensuring information availability, and addressing issues like prioritizing implementation by species, harmonizing animal ID programs, and collaborating with industry and states. The USDA focused on popularizing the voluntary NAIS program by collaborating with states, tribes, and territories, and advancing ID technologies. They published reports with participant guidance, technical standards, and implementation strategies to provide information to stakeholders. A Business Plan to Advance Animal Disease Traceability recommended strategies to enhance animal disease traceability through harmonizing various animal identification techniques. The NAIS User Guide detailed how to participate in the program and its future direction. The NAIS User Guide, published in November 2006, provided guidance on participating in NAIS and its benefits. The Program Standards and Technical Reference document established data standards for NAIS, including formats for identification numbers and official devices. These standards were utilized by states, tribes, industry organizations, and identification device manufacturers. The primary goal of NAIS was to protect U.S. agriculture from the harm of animal disease outbreaks. USDA aimed to increase disease response capabilities, limit disease spread, minimize economic impact, protect producers' livelihoods, and maintain market access. The long-term goal was to identify and trace animals within 48 hours of a disease problem. NAIS was designed to provide rapid access to reliable data on animal ID and movement history during disease outbreaks. It aimed to facilitate quick traceback of infected animals and those exposed to the disease, through premises registration, animal identification, and tracking components. The first phase of NAIS involved registering the geographic location where livestock or poultry were raised, housed, or boarded. States and tribes had to collect specific information for premises registration, including a premises identification number (PIN), contact details, operation type, and dates of activation and retirement. The PIN, a unique seven-digit number, would not change with ownership transfer, and producers could have multiple PINs for different operations. The USDA required premises registration for animal health purposes, with information stored in a national repository to protect privacy. This would help in quickly notifying producers of disease outbreaks and locating at-risk animals in emergencies. The goal was to have all premises registered by 2009, but as of September 2009, only about 37% were registered. The USDA aimed to have all premises registered by 2009, but only 37% were registered by September 6, 2009. Higher participation levels were needed for successful implementation of the National Animal Identification System (NAIS). The second phase involved assigning unique numbers to individual animals or groups, with a 15-digit Animal Identification Number (AIN) starting with 840 in the United States. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) required animals to have 15-digit AIN numbers starting with 840. These AIN devices include visual ear-tags, RFID tags, and injectable transponders for electronic reading. The use of RFID devices and injectable transponders is increasing due to faster access to information stored in computer databases. The use of RFID and electronic transponder devices in animal identification is becoming more common, allowing for faster access to information. Some animals are exempt from identification under NAIS if they pose a low risk of disease spread or exposure. However, USDA encourages all animal owners to register their premises to prevent the spread of diseases like avian influenza and foot-and-mouth disease. The USDA encourages animal owners to register their premises to prevent disease spread. Animals should have an ID attached before moving to another location, such as a livestock market or feedlot. Producers can choose when to attach ID devices, either shortly after birth or later. Tagging services are available at auction markets for animals ready to be marketed. Animals in the production chain can be identified by group/lot identification numbers (GINs) instead of individual numbers, commonly used in poultry and pork industries. The GIN is a 15-character number generated by the producer, consisting of a seven-character PIN, a six-digit date, and a two-digit number reflecting the count of groups assembled at the same premises on the same day. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) involves maintaining GINs for groups of animals, linking them to their birthplace or premises. The protocol is tailored to different species and their management. The third phase focuses on timely animal movement records to locate at-risk animals during disease outbreaks. Producers can report movements to NAIS-compliant databases maintained by states and private industry. Under NAIS, producers could report animal movements with minimum tracing information required, including national premises ID, animal ID, date, and event type. Additional animal-specific data was standardized but not mandatory. Movements within a production unit were not required to be reported. NAIS's voluntary tracing component was a public/private partnership. The voluntary animal tracing component of NAIS was a public/private partnership where states and private entities would maintain ATDs containing animal location and movement records. USDA would operate the Animal Trace Processing System (ATPS) to enable animal health officials to request information during disease outbreaks. The USDA defines optimal retrieval of traceback data within a 48-hour window for disease containment. State and federal animal health officials use the system in specific situations like confirmed positive tests for foreign animal diseases or disease emergencies. As of September 2008, about 40% of potential premises in the US had been registered, with varying participation across species and states. APHIS reported that 531,284 animal premises had been registered in one of the available databases, representing 36.9% of the estimated 1.4 million livestock and poultry farms in the United States. USDA estimated that 70% of animals in a specific species and/or sector would need to be identified and traceable to achieve the necessary \"critical mass\" for a 48-hour traceback in case of an animal disease outbreak. Dr. John Clifford, USDA's Chief Veterinary Officer, emphasized the need for a 70-90% participation rate in animal identification programs to ensure effective traceability. Critics have faulted USDA for slow progress and lack of clarity in implementing universal ID. The Government Accountability Office identified obstacles such as prioritization of species, integration with existing requirements, and data provision issues. The USDA's National Animal Identification System (NAIS) faced criticism for slow progress and lack of clarity in implementing universal ID. Concerns were raised about low participation rates hindering the program's effectiveness in achieving a 48-hour traceback window. Calls were made for Congress to address the issue by increasing incentives or making the program mandatory. The American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) supported these efforts. In October 2006, various groups including veterinarians, state animal health officials, and livestock industry organizations expressed support for mandatory participation in the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) to ensure a national system for animal ID. Congressional leaders like Collin Peterson and Rosa DeLauro also showed interest in making NAIS mandatory to improve effectiveness and avoid potential issues. Groups supporting mandatory NAIS implementation cite the need to prevent losses from diseases, while opponents, mainly from the cattle industry, fear high costs and industry concentration. Congressional members from cattle-heavy areas share these concerns about USDA confidentiality and authority. In August 2006, then-Secretary of Agriculture Mike Johanns announced that USDA would implement NAIS as a voluntary program, despite calls for it to be mandatory. The costs of an animal ID system, including tags and data systems, increase with traceability. Cost estimates for a national system vary widely due to different assumptions. The USDA's ideas for sharing expenses in a national animal ID system have raised questions about who should pay - the industry, government, or both. As more tracing requirements are imposed, there are concerns that large retailers and meat packers will shift compliance costs to farms and ranches, potentially impacting smaller, independent operations. On the other hand, some argue that larger, vertically integrated operations may have the resources to survive. If traceability costs lead big meat plants to reduce line speeds, smaller plants with slower fabrication speeds may be better equipped to implement traceability to the retail level. On April 29, 2009, APHIS released the KSU Benefit-Cost Study (2009) on the economic benefits and costs of adopting USDA's NAIS. The study was conducted by economists from Kansas State University, Colorado State University, Michigan State University, and Montana State University. Key assumptions included individual versus group ID tagging for cattle, swine, and poultry. The results for a 100%-participation scenario are summarized in Table 5. The KSU Benefit-Cost Study (2009) estimated annual costs for implementing NAIS in the livestock industry at approximately $228 million for full pre-harvest traceability with 100% participation. Costs increase to $304.2 million when horses are included. The majority of costs are associated with the cattle sector, at $5.97 per animal marketed, mainly due to individual animal ID requirements. Tagging cattle accounted for 75% of the cattle sector's adoption costs. The estimated tag and tagging costs for cattle producers ranged from $3.30 to $5.22 per animal, with an average cost of $5.97 per marketed animal in the cattle industry. Other livestock sectors had lower costs per animal: $0.059 per swine, $1.39 per sheep, $0.0007 per broiler, $0.002 per turkey, and $0.0195 per layer. The study showed that the economic benefits of NAIS with full participation outweighed the costs, including savings in government administration, market access, and avoiding significant losses from disease outbreaks. The study found that implementing NAIS could result in economic benefits of up to $1.32 billion per year over 10 years, mainly from lost export market access and increased consumer demand. Producers may face concerns about liability for contamination, but documenting management practices can help protect against this. There is also debate about whether producers should be shielded from public scrutiny of their records under the Freedom of Information Act. Some producers have concerns about public scrutiny of their records under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), fearing misuse by animal rights extremists or revealing proprietary information. FOIA exempts certain business information like trade secrets or confidential material. In the 110th Congress, a provision addressing protection of trade secrets in an animal ID system was deleted from the omnibus 2008 farm bill. South Korea plans to impose traceability requirements on imported beef by December 2010. Japan currently does not require traceability for imported beef but has age limitations. The Democratic Party of Japan aims to pass laws for traceability on imported beef. The DPJ is focused on setting up its new administration and prioritizing its agenda, making it unlikely that the issue of traceability on imported meat will be addressed early. The implementation of traceability measures for imports must meet specific requirements under the WTO's Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures. The USDA invested $142 million in the development of NAIS, but only 40% of livestock producers participated by 2009. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack addressed concerns and slow growth in participation rates through public listening sessions. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack conducted public listening sessions from April to June 2009 to gather feedback on the National Animal Identification System (NAIS). The information obtained from these sessions led to the decision to abandon NAIS in favor of a state-based system in 2010. Approximately $142 million was allocated for NAIS from FY2004 to FY2009, but Congress was frustrated with the slow implementation progress. The FY2009 USDA appropriation directed APHIS to make progress in implementing the NAIS program, with specific objectives outlined in the agency's 2008 traceability business plan. Despite the Administration's proposal to increase funding slightly to $14.6 million in FY2010, the House Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee voted to eliminate funding for NAIS from the FY2010 appropriations bill. Subcommittee members expressed frustration with the slow pace of national sign-up for NAIS. The House Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee expressed frustration with the slow pace of national sign-up for NAIS despite receiving $142 million in funding since FY2004. The Senate reduced FY2010 funding for NAIS to $7.3 million and restricted its use to ongoing activities and purposes. The Senate version of H.R. 2997, as amended, was passed with a final FY2010 funding level for NAIS set at $5.3 million. The FY2010 Agriculture appropriations bill was signed into law as P.L. 111-80 by President Obama on October 21, 2009, with USDA claiming existing authority to implement an animal ID program. In the 110th Congress, bills were proposed to clarify USDA's authority and establish a program, including H.R. 1018 and H.R. 2301. In the 111th Congress, various bills were introduced to establish comprehensive traceability systems for meat, poultry, and other foods. These bills aimed to trace animals and products from slaughter through processing and distribution to the consumer, with provisions for record-keeping and privacy protection. The 111th Congress introduced bills for traceability systems for meat, poultry, and other foods. The bills would authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to require record-keeping for traceability purposes. Hearings were held on the national animal ID system in the House committees. The Subcommittee on Emerging Threats, Cybersecurity, and Science and Technology is reviewing the National Animal Identification System. The history of animal ID in the United States dates back to the 1800s with hot iron brands used for identification. In the 1940s, the USDA initiated a program to identify cattle vaccinated for brucellosis. The system of tagging and ID has been phased out as brucellosis nears eradication. Individuals in animal industries recognized the importance of animal ID from the 1950s to the 1980s. In the 1980s, the USDA started planning for a national animal identification system. The UK faced a BSE outbreak in cattle in the late 1980s, leading to the slaughter of millions of infected animals. In 1997, Taiwan experienced a costly foot and mouth disease outbreak in swine, resulting in significant economic losses and the slaughter of millions of pigs. In the early 2000s, outbreaks of Classical Swine Fever in the Netherlands and Foot and Mouth Disease in the United Kingdom led to the destruction of millions of animals and billions of dollars in economic losses. In 2003, a draft of the U.S. Animal Identification Plan was published, calling for the recording of individual animal movements. The USAIP called for recording animal movements in a central database, with APHIS designing an ID numbering system and coordinating data collection. States were to have an animal premises ID system by July 2004, and all major species identified by July 2006. The first case of BSE in the US was detected in December 2003, prompting accelerated implementation of a national animal ID system. In April 2004, Secretary Ann Veneman transferred $18.8 million from CCC funds to APHIS for the National Animal Identification System (NAIS). The program's framework was announced, with periodic revisions made in response to industry feedback. By May 2005, a \"Draft Strategic Plan\" outlined timelines for a mandatory program by January 2009. In August 2005, new \"Draft Program Standards\" were introduced, and in April 2006, \"Implementation Strategies\" set a timeline for full implementation by 2009, with voluntary participation and potential regulations for non-compliance. In August 2006, the NAIS program was initially designed as voluntary but with a vision of becoming mandatory. However, in November 2006, it was announced that NAIS would remain entirely voluntary at the federal level. The USDA distributed a draft \"user guide\" outlining a three-step approach to implementing a national animal ID program, reassuring producers that participation would remain voluntary. The USDA's National Animal Identification System (NAIS) program remains voluntary and is legally required to protect private information. In December 2007, a User Guide was released, followed by a Business Plan in April 2008 to advance animal disease traceability. The plan aimed to clarify implementation strategies and set benchmarks for achieving a 48-hour traceback goal in case of disease outbreaks, prioritizing species into Tier 1 (commercial food animals and horses) and Tier 2 (other livestock and poultry). The USDA's National Animal Identification System (NAIS) program is voluntary and aims to protect private information. In January 2009, a proposed rule was published to establish a standard location identifier for animal identification. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack held public listening sessions from April to June 2009 to gather feedback on the future direction of animal identification and traceability in the United States. APHIS released the results of a comprehensive benefit-cost analysis of the NAIS in 2009. In February 2010, Secretary of Agriculture Vilsack announced a new approach for animal disease traceability, allowing states to choose their own level of animal identification. USDA will require all animals moving in interstate commerce to have traceable ID back to their originating state. Public meetings were held from March to August 2010 to discuss the Animal Disease Traceability framework. APHIS released two documents on August 13 outlining the proposed rule on traceability, including international organizations and standards related to animal health and trade. The WTO sets international trade rules for harmonizing commerce and resolving disputes. The CODEX alimentarius and OIE provide guidelines, not laws, for food safety and animal health. WTO's Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures limits traceability requirements to scientifically justified measures for human, animal, or plant health. The Codex Alimentarius Commission and the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) were established to develop food standards and improve animal health globally. The main goals are to protect consumer health, ensure fair trade practices, and coordinate international food standards efforts. The OIE is an intergovernmental organization focused on improving animal health globally through animal identification and traceability systems. They established guidelines in 2006, which were adopted as official standards in 2007. Chapter four of the OIE's Terrestrial Code includes sections on animal identification and tracing. In April 2008, the OIE Director General called for global implementation of animal identification and traceability systems from \"farm to fork\" to facilitate trade during disease outbreaks. The OIE's Terrestrial Code includes sections on zoning, compartmentalization, and export certification for animal products. In the United States, certification for beef imports is managed by USDA's FSIS, ensuring compliance with importing countries' standards. The OIE works to harmonize international certification standards and promotes transparency and reliance on scientific information. Certification involves sanitary sampling, plant inspection, and adherence to animal health and sanitary standards. Chapter 5 of the OIE's Terrestrial Code outlines general obligations and procedures for certification. Many international trading partners have national animal identification systems with traceability capabilities, such as Canada's Canadian Cattle Identification Agency (CCIA) managing a system for the Canadian cattle and bison industry. The CCIA works closely with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) and Agri-Food and Agriculture Canada (AAFC) to ensure funding for development initiatives. The Canadian Cattle Identification Agency (CCIA) manages a national animal identification system for the Canadian cattle industry. Initially voluntary, the program became mandatory in 2002, transitioning to Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) in 2003. All cattle leaving their farm of origin must have a CCIA-approved RFID tag for tracking purposes. The compliance rate for Canadian cattle ID was estimated to be between 99-100% in 2009. The Canadian Cattle Identification Agency (CCIA) manages a national animal identification system for the Canadian cattle industry, with a compliance rate of 99-100%. Personal information associated with ear tag numbers is securely maintained in the national database. The Canadian Livestock Traceability System (CLTS) houses ID and traceback systems for various industry and species groups. Mandatory sheep and hog identification programs were established in 2004 and 2008. In Australia, the National Livestock Identification System (NLIS) tracks livestock from birth to slaughter, with a mandatory system for cattle since 2005. Australia implemented an animal identification system in the early 1960s to eradicate bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis. A mandatory property identification system for cattle was established in 1967, using Property Identification Codes (PICs) to trace cattle back to their last property of residence. In the mid-1990s, the system was upgraded to electronic whole-of-life individual cattle identification using Radio Frequency Identification Devices (RFIDs). Similar tracing systems are being developed for other livestock like sheep, goats, pigs, and alpacas. In response to market demands, Australia implemented the NLIS in 1999, requiring individual cattle identification for biosecurity and food safety. The system ensures traceability of cattle within 24 hours, with mandatory identification for all cattle leaving their property of birth. Australia's NLIS requires individual animal ID numbers attached to barcodes at slaughter, linking information to live animals, carcasses, hides, and byproducts. Animals are typically grouped into lots, limiting access to individual carcass data unless specific agreements are made. The NLIS is a partnership between the Australian Government and industry, with the Federal government coordinating policy and funding, while state governments oversee livestock movement and health. Joint management committees develop legislation to support the system. The animal identification program in Australia is managed by joint committees between the government and industry. State governments coordinate education programs and manage the registry of PICs. Meat and Livestock Australia administers the database for NLIS, ensuring data protection from FOI requests. The European Union (EU) has mandatory programs for animal identification as part of its food safety initiatives. The objectives include localizing and tracing animals for veterinary purposes to control infectious diseases. Species-specific ID systems have evolved in response to disease outbreaks like swine fever and foot-and-mouth disease. The EU implemented a mandatory system for permanent identification of individual bovine in 1997 due to the BSE crisis. The European Union implemented a mandatory system of permanent identification for individual bovine animals, requiring double ear tags for identification, maintaining registers at each location, issuing cattle passports, and maintaining a national database. A regulation passed on July 17, 2000, made the system mandatory, including tracking animals from birth to harvest and labeling meat products with reference numbers linking them to the animals of origin. Since 2005, the EU has required food traceability, including passports for equidae and identification systems for porcine, ovine, and caprine animals. Japan also has a mandatory bovine ID and traceability system in place since 2004. Imported beef in Japan is not subject to the same traceability requirements as domestically produced beef. In response to food safety crises, Japan implemented animal traceability regulations and oversight, starting in 2002 with the Law Relating to Special BSE Countermeasures. This included traceability laws for domestically produced beef from farms to slaughterhouses by December 2003. The Food Safety Basic Law and Beef Traceability Law were also enacted in 2003 to extend traceability to processors. A law enacted in Japan required traceability to be extended to processors, distributors, and retailers by December 1, 2004. This led to retailers and restaurants displaying animal identification numbers for consumers to reference information about domestic beef. Japan also introduced a Japan Agricultural Standard program to certify traceability of imported beef, requiring exporters to provide detailed information. South Korea has a mandatory Beef Traceability System initiated in 2004. The Beef Traceability System (BTS) in South Korea, initiated in 2004 as voluntary and made mandatory for domestically produced beef in 2009, requires individual identification and registration in a central database. It tracks each animal from birth to consumer, providing detailed information such as sex, breed, location of birth, feed, medications, slaughter date, and processing location. South Korea plans to impose traceability requirements on imported beef by December 2010. New Zealand lacks a fully functioning national animal ID system. The NAIT project was established in 2006 to improve animal traceability, but as of 2009, it is still under development. Current systems provide traceability at herd levels but not for individual animals, with gaps at the national level. The focus is on developing traceability for cattle and deer populations. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) in New Zealand is focusing on developing traceability for cattle and deer populations. The existing animal ID systems in the country include the Management Information System for Dairy Administration (MINDA) and the National Bovine Tuberculosis Identification Program (NBTIP). MINDA is a voluntary system with high dairy herd participation, while NBTIP is mandatory for identifying cattle and deer before movement. A new mandatory animal identification system for cattle and possibly deer is proposed to be in place by June 2011 in Brazil. Initially intended as mandatory, the Brazilian Bovine and Buffalo Identification and Certification System (SISBOV) was extended to include the entire beef chain in 2006. However, domestic market demand and resistance from cattle producers delayed national participation. The SISBOV program in Brazil, initially intended as mandatory, remains voluntary due to resistance from cattle producers. It focuses on providing origination information for animals destined for foreign markets, particularly the EU. Instead of individual animal identification, group lots are classified under SISBOV. The EU has found severe shortcomings in Brazil's animal traceability system, leading to a near-total ban on beef imports from Brazil in 2008. The EU imposed a near-total ban on beef imports from Brazil due to concerns about the lack of robust information and the risk of foot-and-mouth disease. Argentina established a limited mandatory system of animal identification and traceability for exports to the EU, focusing on farm-of-origin information and cattle movements. Argentina implemented mandatory ID tagging for calves born after September 2007 to track cattle from birth to slaughter, aiming to improve disease control and beef exports. Uruguay heavily relies on foreign markets, with 68% of its beef production sold abroad from 2004-2008, incentivizing a strong animal traceability system. Uruguay implemented a mandatory animal identification system called the National Livestock Information System (SNIG) in 2006, requiring all cattle to be tagged before six months of age or transport. The system aims to track cattle from birth to slaughter, with plans to have all herds registered and tagged by 2010. Uruguay's National Livestock Information System (SNIG) requires all cattle to be tagged by 2010 for traceability from birth to slaughter. SNIG includes premises identification, movement notification, and termination records. The government currently covers the cost of ID tags but plans to shift this to producers in the future. Further traceability to consumers is being considered. Not all countries with large animal populations have ongoing animal ID programs, such as Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, and Russia. Reasons for the absence of these programs include technological limitations, lack of national distribution chains, and financial constraints of consumers in poorer countries."
