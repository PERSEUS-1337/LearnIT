    "content": "The \"Civil Rights History Project Act of 2009\" recognizes the importance of individuals standing up for their rights and beliefs, citing the actions of those involved in the Civil Rights movement as examples of this principle. The Act highlights events such as the Montgomery Bus Boycott, sit-ins, Freedom Rides, March on Washington, drive for voting rights in Mississippi, and March to Selma, emphasizing the contributions of both well-known leaders like Thurgood Marshall and lesser-known individuals to the cause. The Civil Rights movement participants hold valuable first-hand memories that can provide a detailed history of the nation during a significant period. Collecting oral histories from these individuals is crucial for future generations to learn about their struggle and sacrifice through primary-source material. A coordinated Federal project would focus on gathering and interpreting articles related to the Civil Rights movement, serving as a model for similar projects in museums, libraries, and universities. The purpose of this Act is to create a federally sponsored project to collect video and audio recordings of personal histories from individuals who participated in the American Civil Rights movement. The Library of Congress and the Smithsonian Institution will preserve and make these oral histories available to the public. This project aims to complement existing documentary work and support local efforts to preserve memories of the movement. The Act aims to establish a joint project between the Library of Congress and the National Museum of African American History and Culture to collect video and audio recordings of participants in the American Civil Rights Movement. The project will preserve these oral histories for future generations to better appreciate the sacrifices made. The Act establishes a project to collect audio and video recordings of Civil Rights movement participants' reminiscences, along with personal histories, testimonials, and relevant materials. The goal is to create a collection, catalog, and index these materials for preservation and future appreciation. The Act aims to collect audio and video recordings of Civil Rights movement participants' reminiscences, personal histories, and testimonials. The collection will be made available for public use through the Library of Congress and the National Museum of African American History and Culture. The Secretary will oversee these duties through the Director of the National Museum. Partnerships with other entities may be utilized for carrying out these activities. The Act aims to collect audio and video recordings of Civil Rights movement participants' reminiscences, personal histories, and testimonials. The Librarian and the Secretary will develop guidelines for acquiring and making available recordings. They may procure services, accept volunteer help, and make advance payments for these activities. The collection of video recordings will begin promptly after the Act's enactment. The Act directs the Librarian and Secretary to collect video and audio recordings from Civil Rights movement participants, starting with the oldest individuals. Private donations are encouraged to support these activities. The Act authorizes funds donated to the Librarian of Congress to support specific activities to be deposited into a dedicated account and used solely for those activities. The Librarian cannot deposit funds not intended for this purpose into the account. Additionally, appropriations of $500,000 for fiscal year 2010 and necessary sums for fiscal years 2011 through 2014 are authorized to carry out the Act. The curr_chunk is about the roles of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Vice President of the United States as President of the Senate."
