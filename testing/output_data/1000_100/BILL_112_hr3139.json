The term 'qualified contribution' refers to a contribution made by a qualified insurance company to a fund established for covering qualified losses, limited to the total of net premiums received during a taxable year.

The Secretary is authorized to issue further regulations on these matters. The Secretary will prescribe regulations for the purposes of this subsection. An additional tax on certain distributions from a Natural Disaster Protection Fund is imposed on qualified insurance companies. The tax is increased by 20 percent of nonqualified distributions made from the fund during the year. Definitions are provided for clarity.
