    "content": "In a well-studied approach for machine learning on relational data, entities and relations are represented in an embedding space. Our approach proposes a multimodal embedding using different neural encoders to incorporate various data types like text, images, and numerical values. We introduce two new benchmarks, YAGO-10-plus and MovieLens-100k-plus, with additional relations such as textual descriptions and images. The model effectively utilizes this extra information to improve accuracy and predict missing multimodal attributes. Knowledge bases (KB) are crucial for various computational systems, but often suffer from incompleteness and noise. Research focuses on learning relational knowledge representation by estimating low-dimensional representations for entities and relations to infer missing facts efficiently. Real-world knowledge bases are diverse, requiring accurate prediction of missing attributes. Real-world knowledge bases contain various data types such as numerical attributes, textual descriptions, and images, which are crucial for knowledge base completion. This additional information, like conventional link data, can be missing or noisy and may need to be predicted to address queries effectively. In this paper, a multimodal embedding approach is introduced for modeling knowledge bases with various data types. The approach extends the DistMult method by incorporating neural encoders for different evidence data types, such as images and textual attributes. The approach extends the DistMult method by incorporating neural encoders for different evidence data types, such as images and textual attributes. The unified model encodes data into fixed-length vectors using a CNN and sequential embedding approaches like LSTMs. The scoring module produces a score indicating the probability that a triple is correct, allowing for information flow across different relation types. Evaluation on relational databases shows gains in link-prediction accuracy by utilizing additional information effectively. The approach extends the DistMult method by incorporating neural encoders for different evidence data types, such as images and textual attributes, to improve link-prediction accuracy. It introduces a model that utilizes various types of information in knowledge bases, including links, textual descriptions, categorical attributes, numerical values, and images, to predict object entities based on similarity. The goal is to train a machine learning model for scoring the truth value of factual information in a multimodal setting. The modeling approach involves training a machine learning model to score the truth value of factual statements using subject, relation, and object triplets. The link prediction problem aims to learn a scoring function based on observed facts from a knowledge base, despite potential incompleteness and noise. Successful methods utilize fixed-length vectors, matrices, or tensors for entities and relations, with varying operators applied to these representations. The proposed framework can be used with existing relational models, with a focus on the DistMult approach. The DistMult approach in link prediction involves mapping entities and relations to vectors and matrices, respectively, to compute scores for triples. A pairwise ranking loss is used to differentiate between existing and non-existing triples during training, with negative samples generated by replacing entities. This method learns representations that encode entity and relation information. The proposed work aims to enhance existing relational models like DistMult by learning embeddings for various types of data such as numerical, categorical, images, and text. This allows for the incorporation of diverse object types in knowledge bases, enabling more accurate completion, queries, and cleaning tasks. The model enhances relational models like DistMult by learning embeddings for different data types such as numerical, categorical, images, and text. Encoders are used to represent objects, and the goal is to estimate the truth value of triples in a knowledge base. An example is provided for movie details, where subjects and relations are embedded using direct lookup, and objects are encoded based on their data type. The model enhances relational models like DistMult by learning embeddings for different data types such as numerical, categorical, images, and text. Encoders are used to represent objects, and the goal is to estimate the truth value of triples in a knowledge base. Training the model involves using appropriate encoders for each data type, such as CNNs for images and LSTMs for text. Negative sampling involves replacing the object entity with a random entity from the same domain. Structured knowledge representation involves using dense layers for subject entity and relation embeddings, and embedding categorical object entities using selu activation. Numerical objects are embedded through dense layers with the same number of nodes as the embedding space dimension. The model enhances relational models by learning embeddings for different data types such as numerical, categorical, images, and text. Encoders are used to represent objects, with different encoders for varying string lengths. Numerical objects are embedded into a higher-dimensional space using a feed forward layer after basic normalization. Text is encoded using character-based stacked, bidirectional LSTMs for short attributes like names and titles. The model uses bidirectional LSTM and CNN encoders to represent strings and images, providing accurate semantic representations for various tasks. Images can offer valuable information about entities, such as person details or location information. The model utilizes bidirectional LSTM and CNN encoders for representing strings and images, capturing semantic information accurately. Various data types like speech/audio, time series, and geospatial coordinates can also be encoded using appropriate encoders. The model incorporates different types of information such as text, numerical values, and images in the encoding component, treating them as relational triples of information. Various methods merge, concatenate, or average entity features like numerical values, images, and text to compute embeddings. The model integrates various types of information like text, numerical values, and images as relational triples in the encoding component, representing uncertainty and supporting missing values. This approach differs from previous methods by treating different types of information as structured knowledge rather than predetermined features. Our model incorporates various types of information as relational triples, supporting missing values and facilitating information recovery. Two new benchmarks are introduced by extending existing datasets, including MovieLens 100k with posters and YAGO-10 with image, textual, and numerical data. The MovieLens-100k dataset is a popular benchmark for recommendation systems, containing user ratings and contextual features for movies and users.

Additionally, it assesses the model's capability in link prediction by calculating MRR and Hits@ metric for recovering missing entities from triples in the test dataset. The evaluation focuses on link prediction in MovieLens dataset using various models for different relations. The model is trained with Rating as the relation between users and movies, using different networks for encoding other relations. The evaluation includes ranking triples in the test data against those not in the train or test datasets, with metrics calculated based on the five relations representing the ratings.
