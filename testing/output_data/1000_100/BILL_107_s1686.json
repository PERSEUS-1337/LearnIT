    "content": "The Act titled \"Safe Nursing and Patient Care Act of 2001\" is cited in Section 1. Section 2 contains findings related to the Act. The Federal Government has a significant interest in ensuring adequate and safe healthcare services for patients in healthcare facilities. Research shows that higher nurse staffing levels lead to better patient outcomes, but there are challenges in recruiting and retaining enough nursing staff. Job dissatisfaction and mandatory overtime contribute to nurses leaving the profession. The widespread practice of mandatory overtime for nurses leads to fatigue, medical errors, and compromises patient safety. Limiting mandatory overtime will ensure public safety, quality healthcare services, and aid in nurse retention and recruitment. Limitations on mandatory overtime for nurses are necessary to prevent fatigue, medical errors, and ensure patient safety. Provider agreements under the Social Security Act are amended to include compliance with limitations on mandatory overtime for nurses. This amendment prohibits mandatory overtime for nurses to prevent fatigue, medical errors, and ensure patient safety. A provider of services is prohibited from requiring a nurse to work beyond certain limits, including not exceeding 12 hours in a 24-hour period or 80 hours in a consecutive 14-day period. Exceptions apply during declared states of emergency for providing emergency medical services. During declared states of emergency, a nurse can only be required to work beyond set limits if the provider has tried to fill staffing needs through other means. The work requirement must end when the state of emergency or the provider's direct role in emergency response ends. The Secretary allows nurses to report violations by providers of services, investigates complaints, and takes action if violations are found. The Secretary requires providers to establish a plan to address violations and may impose civil penalties. Nurses are protected from discrimination for refusing mandatory overtime or reporting violations. Employees are protected from discrimination for reporting violations to regulatory agencies, accreditation bodies, or management personnel. They are also protected if they participate in investigations or discussions regarding violations of regulations. Employees are protected from retaliation for reporting violations, including refusing to work mandatory overtime. Nurses are deemed to be acting in good faith if they believe the reported information is true and a violation has occurred or may occur. Providers of services must post notice of these protections. Providers of services must post a sign specifying nurses' rights, including the right to file complaints with the Secretary. They must also post nurse schedules in a conspicuous manner and make them available upon request. Providers of services must post nurse schedules in a conspicuous manner and make them available upon request.

The Secretary will submit a report to Congress on the study conducted regarding appropriate standards of maximum work hours for nurses in federally operated medical facilities. The study aims to determine if these facilities have practices inconsistent with the Social Security Act. The term \"federally operated medical facilities\" includes hospitals, clinics, and home health care facilities run by government departments. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget must report to Congress within 6 months with recommendations for implementing policies on nurse overtime consistent with section 1866(j) of the Social Security Act."
