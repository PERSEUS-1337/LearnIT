Congress has funded programs to improve STEM skills, encourage students to pursue science and engineering degrees, and provide research experiences at universities. The 115th Congress is considering legislation to promote STEM. The 115th Congress is considering legislation to promote STEM education and address U.S. S&E workforce needs through changes to immigration policies. Labor economists examine employment growth, wage growth, and unemployment rates for evidence of shortages in key S&E occupations. This report provides employment, wage, and unemployment information for various S&E occupations. The section on \"Current Employment, Wages, and Unemployment\" offers data on S&E workforce in 2016. The section on \"Recent Trends in Employment, Wages, and Unemployment\" shows changes from 2012-2016. The section on \"Employment Projections, 2016-2026\" analyzes future projections. \"Concluding Observations\" provides stakeholder perspectives for Congress to consider ensuring an adequate S&E workforce. The United States aims to have a sufficient S&E workforce for the 21st century, with varying definitions of STEM occupations. The size of the workforce depends on the occupations included, as stated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the National Science Board. The National Science Board's 2016 report highlighted the size of the Science and Engineering (S&E) workforce in the U.S., ranging from 6 million to over 21 million depending on the definition used. The focus of the debate on the adequacy of the S&E workforce has been on computer, mathematical, engineering, and physical science occupations. The S&E workforce includes life scientists but excludes social scientists. The S&E workforce in 2016 was approximately 6.9 million, categorized into six occupational groups including computer occupations and mathematical occupations. The S&E workforce in 2016 was approximately 6.9 million, categorized into six occupational groups including computer occupations, mathematical occupations, engineers, life scientists, and physical scientists. This includes a wide range of specialized roles such as actuaries, statisticians, engineers in various fields, life scientists like microbiologists and zoologists, and physical scientists like astronomers and physicists. The S&E workforce in 2016 consisted of approximately 6.9 million individuals in various specialized roles such as computer occupations, mathematical occupations, engineers, life scientists, and physical scientists. The report provides detailed descriptions of occupations and educational compositions for each S&E occupation. Data sources include the Occupational Employment Statistics survey conducted by the U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) provides employment and wage data for the 2012-2016 period for over 800 occupations. The survey covers all part-time and full-time employees, excluding self-employed individuals. The wage statistic used is the occupational \"mean wage,\" calculated by averaging the wages of all employees in a given occupation. Unemployment data is sourced from the Current Population Survey (CPS) conducted by the Department of Commerce's Bureau of the Census. BLS's Employment Projections supplement OES data for employment forecasts. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) provides occupational and industry employment projection data for 10-year periods. The latest projections cover the 2016-2026 period and include data from the OES survey and CES data. The projections also incorporate agricultural industry employment and self-employed data to determine base year employment levels for each occupation. The \"Employment Projections, 2016-2026\" section relies on Bureau of Labor Statistics data for projections. Various factors impact the U.S. S&E workforce, including economic conditions, technology development, funding, and workforce skills. The report does not assign causation. The report examines the impact of various factors on the U.S. science and engineering workforce. It highlights challenges in comparing OES data over time due to changes in classification systems, data collection methods, and wage estimation. The analysis focuses on trends from 2012-2016 to enhance data comparability. The Bureau of Labor Statistics made estimates for employment projections based on population size, labor force participation rates, economic growth, technological innovation, and other factors. The OES survey used consistent occupational categories from 2012-2016 to improve data comparability and provide current trends in science and engineering occupations. The Bureau of Labor Statistics updated its methodology for estimating occupational separations in its 2016-2026 projections, replacing the previous method due to accuracy issues. Various factors like immigration laws, trade practices, and social patterns can also impact occupational projections. In 2016, the BLS evaluated the accuracy of its projections for the S&E workforce, with 6.9 million people employed in the United States as scientists and engineers, mainly in computer occupations and engineering. Other S&E jobs included science and engineering managers, life scientists, physical scientists, and mathematical occupations. In 2016, scientists and engineers in the United States had a mean annual wage of $94,450, higher than the mean annual wage for all occupations. S&E managers had the highest mean annual wage at $144,270, followed by engineers, mathematical occupations, computer occupations, physical scientists, and life scientists. Scientists and engineers earned less than physicians, dentists, and lawyers. In 2016, scientists and engineers in the United States had a mean annual wage of $94,450, higher than all occupations. S&E managers had the highest mean annual wage at $144,270, followed by engineers, mathematical occupations, computer occupations, physical scientists, and life scientists. Dentists, physicians, and lawyers earned more than scientists and engineers. The 2016 annual average unemployment rate for S&E occupations ranged from 0.2% for biological scientists to 5.2% for web developers. Unemployment rates for most S&E occupations were below the overall rate of 4.9%, but higher than some professional occupations like dentists, physicians, and lawyers. Aggregate S&E employment increased by 747,040 jobs from 2012 to 2016. During 2012-2016, Science and Engineering (S&E) employment grew by 747,040 jobs, reaching 6.9 million with a 2.9% annual growth rate.

S&E management occupations like computer and information systems managers and natural sciences managers saw growth, while architectural and engineering managers declined. The list includes five computer occupations, three engineering occupations, one mathematics occupation, and one S&E management occupation. The occupation with the greatest employment loss is computer programmers, with speculation that some losses may be due to reclassification as other computer occupations. The occupation with the fastest growth rate was mathematical science occupations, followed by operations research analysts and computer occupations. Between 2012 and 2016, S&E occupations experienced growth in employment, with mathematical occupations showing the fastest growth rate at 8.5% CAGR. Mean wages for S&E occupational groups grew at a similar pace to overall mean wages, slightly outpacing inflation. The 10 S&E occupations with the slowest growth rates all had negative growth rates, representing various fields such as engineering, physical sciences, life sciences, mathematics, and computer occupations. Between 2012 and 2016, S&E occupational groups experienced varying growth rates in mean wages, with S&E managers and computer occupations showing the fastest growth rates. Mathematical occupations saw a small decline in wages, while other S&E groups grew by less than 1.4% CAGR. Unemployment rates for S&E occupations were provided in Table 9, comparing them to overall rates and selected professional occupations. During the 2012-2016 period, S&E occupational groups had lower unemployment rates compared to the overall workforce, but were comparable to other selected professional occupations like lawyers and physicians. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projected employment for 2016-2026, showing that S&E occupations had varying growth rates in mean wages. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects a growth in the science and engineering workforce from 7.3 million to 8.2 million jobs between 2016 and 2026, with an increase of 853,600 jobs. Additionally, 1.439 million scientists and engineers are expected to exit the workforce, creating a total of nearly 2.3 million job openings. Another 3.7 million openings are projected due to occupational transfers in S&E positions during this period. The BLS projections do not provide quantitative data on the number of new workers needed for job openings in science and engineering occupations. The methodology allows for multiple occupational transfers over a 10-year period, with only one transfer per year. Employment projections for science and engineering occupational groups are provided in Table 10, showing actual and projected employment numbers, annual job growth rates, occupational separations, and job openings. Computer occupations are expected to have the largest increase in employed individuals, labor force exits, and occupational transfers. Computer occupations are projected to account for 64.0% of the total growth in S&E occupations between 2016 and 2026, increasing their share of all S&E jobs to 58.6% in 2026. Mathematical occupations will have the fastest employment growth, reaching 2.8% of total S&E employment by 2026. S&E Managers are expected to contribute 7.0% to total job growth, Engineers 16.2%, both lower than their 2016 employment shares. Life Scientists, Physical Scientists, and other occupations are projected to have a lower share of S&E employment in 2026 compared to 2016. The number of new jobs created in S&E occupations is expected to be less than twice the number needed to replace those exiting the workforce. The number of new jobs created in S&E occupations is expected to be less than twice the number of those exiting the workforce. Labor force exits greatly exceed projected new jobs in nearly all S&E occupational groups. For example, in engineering occupations, there are 385,000 labor force exits and 138,900 new job openings projected. However, in mathematical occupations, job growth is expected to exceed labor force exits. Figure 6 and Figure 7 illustrate the composition of projected job openings by job growth, labor force exits, and occupational transfers for each S&E occupational group for the 2016-2026 period. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects job growth and labor force exits for S&E occupations from 2016-2026. The top 10 S&E occupations with the highest job growth include computer occupations, civil engineers, and mechanical engineers. The 10 occupations with the smallest job growth come from various fields like computer, physical and life sciences, mathematics, and engineering. Labor force exits exceed new job openings in most S&E occupational groups. The list of Science and Engineering (S&E) occupations includes various fields such as computer, physical and life sciences, mathematics, and engineering. Computer programmers are the only S&E occupation projected to see a reduction in jobs, possibly due to reclassification to software developers. The fastest-growing S&E occupations are statisticians, software developers (applications), and mathematicians. The list also includes four mathematical occupations, three computer occupations, two physical sciences occupations, and one engineering occupation. The projected job growth rates range from 1.3% to 2.9% CAGR, higher than the overall job growth rate for all occupations. Additionally, the five non-S&E occupations with the highest growth rates are provided for context. Table 14 displays the 10 S&E occupations with the slowest projected job growth rates, ranging from -0.8% to 0.6% CAGR, below the overall projected job growth rate of 0.7% CAGR. The list includes engineering occupations, architectural and engineering managers, life sciences occupations, and a computer occupation. Table 15 shows the 10 S&E occupations with the most projected job openings, including computer occupations, computer and information systems managers, engineering occupations, and a mathematical occupation. These 10 occupations account for 60.8% of all projected job openings in S&E occupations. The 10 S&E occupations with the fewest projected job openings, accounting for less than 1% of all S&E job openings, include occupations from life sciences, physical sciences, engineering, and mathematics. Scientists and engineers are crucial for U.S. technological leadership, innovation, and national defense. Congress has been concerned about the adequacy of the science and engineering workforce for over 60 years, enacting programs to support education and development in STEM fields. Some policymakers aim to increase foreign scientists and engineers in the US through visa changes. Views vary on the adequacy of the S&E workforce and related policy issues, including whether there is a shortage of scientists and engineers in the US and if the federal government should intervene. Some policymakers debate whether there is a shortage of scientists and engineers in the US and if the federal government should intervene. Views vary on the issue, with some arguing for a shortage while others believe more scientists and engineers are needed regardless. Increasing the number of U.S. scientists and engineers can boost innovation, economic performance, and job creation, even if there is no shortage currently. S&E degrees provide valuable skills for various occupations, and government interventions to address shortages may lead to inefficiencies. Government efforts to increase scientists and engineers may lead to inefficiencies in the labor market, such as an oversupply of S&E graduates and lower salaries for job seekers. Long-term workforce projections are unreliable, resulting in mismatches between education and market needs due to unexpected changes in technology, prices, and retirement behavior. Shortages in certain industries or occupations, including new and emerging S&E fields like nanotechnology, may exist due to various factors such as changes in prices, retirement behavior, and government policies. The labor market will resolve these needs through wage adjustments, increased labor supply from students earning S&E degrees, and substitution of alternative inputs. Shortages in industries like nanotechnology may lead to adverse consequences and require government intervention to increase supply. Industry claims of shortages are driven by a desire to lower labor costs and replace older workers with younger, lower-cost ones. The real issue is a skills mismatch, not a shortage of people. Expanding immigration to address shortages in the S&E workforce, particularly in information technology, can help by matching the specific skills needed by employers with those held by workers. This can benefit the U.S. economy by utilizing foreign scientists and engineers, reducing the loss of U.S.-educated foreign nationals, and dampening market signals that would otherwise drive more U.S. students into science and engineering. Policies to increase foreign scientists and engineers in the US may depress wages, increase unemployment, and discourage American students from pursuing STEM careers. Federal efforts are needed to improve STEM education for US students to compete globally. The adequacy of U.S. student STEM knowledge is not accurately reflected in standardized tests compared to other nations. This leads to differing opinions on federal government roles in fostering the S&E workforce, including increasing students pursuing S&E degrees, admitting foreign scientists, promoting diversity in science and engineering, improving K-12 STEM education, and enhancing career counseling for high school students. Congress is considering ways to enhance U.S. competitiveness. Congress is considering approaches to bolster U.S. competitiveness in scientific, engineering, technological, and industrial leadership. Appendix A provides S&E occupational descriptions and entry-level education requirements, while Appendix B shows the composition of S&E occupations by education level. BLS uses data from the American Community Survey to illustrate the occupational composition of S&E occupations. The composition of S&E occupations by education level is shown in charts, with educational levels below associate's degrees grouped as \"Less than an Associate's degree.\" This category includes individuals with less than a high school diploma, a high school diploma or equivalent, and some college but no degree."
