    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Attorney-Client Privilege Protection Act of 2008\". Congress finds that justice is served when all parties have experienced counsel, protecting attorney-client privilege promotes compliance with the law, and clarity on privilege enhances compliance programs and internal investigations. Despite the availability of investigative tools that do not impact attorney-client relationships, the Department of Justice and other agencies have implemented policies that undermine these protections. Congress recognized this issue when it banned demands for privileged materials in the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. Policies implemented by government agencies are undermining legal protections like attorney-client privilege and work product doctrine, potentially leading to devastating consequences for organizations. These actions encroach on constitutional rights and the ability to dispute charges, using legal protections to conceal wrongdoing. The purpose of this Act is to set clear limits on agencies to protect attorney-client privilege and work product protections for organizations and legal rights for employees. SEC. 3. DISCLOSURE OF ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE OR ADVANCEMENT OF COUNSEL FEES AS ELEMENTS OF COOPERATION. Sec. 3014 of Chapter 201 of title 18, United States Code, defines attorney-client privilege and attorney work product in the context of investigations and enforcement matters regarding organizations. The attorney-client privilege and attorney work product are defined in federal investigations and enforcement matters involving organizations. The term 'organization' excludes criminal enterprises, groups seeking money through illegal means, and terrorist organizations. An agent or attorney of the United States is prohibited from disclosing materials prepared by an attorney in anticipation of litigation that contain mental impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal theories. The attorney-client privilege and attorney work product protections prohibit the United States from demanding, rewarding, or penalizing organizations or their employees for waiving these privileges. Additionally, charging decisions are subject to these protections. The attorney work product doctrine prohibits considering certain conduct in making charging decisions in Federal investigations or enforcement matters. The conduct described in this subparagraph includes the assertion of attorney-client privilege, provision of legal counsel or financial support for defense fees, and the existence of joint defense agreements between organizations and their employees. The sharing of relevant information in anticipation of or in response to an investigation or enforcement matter between an organization and current or former employees, or among its employees, is allowed. In any Federal investigation or enforcement matter, an agent or attorney of the United States cannot demand an organization or its employees to refrain from certain conduct. This section does not prevent the request for communication or material that an ordinary agent or attorney would not know is privileged. An agent or attorney may believe certain information is not protected by attorney-client privilege or attorney work product doctrine, or would not be privileged if demanded by a court subpoena. Organizations can voluntarily waive these protections, and such waivers should not influence charging decisions by the United States. The material provided may be subject to attorney-client privilege or work-product protection when making charging decisions or assessing cooperation with the Government. An agent or attorney can also consider voluntary disclosures for lawful purposes. This does not affect access to examination or inspection otherwise. This section clarifies that it does not impact access to attorney-client privileged material during examinations or inspections. It also specifies that charging decisions can still be made under independent prohibitions. Preservation of fundamental legal protections and rights in investigations and enforcement matters regarding organizations."
