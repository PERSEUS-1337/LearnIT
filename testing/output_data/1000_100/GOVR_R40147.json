    "content": "The environmental impacts of human activity, particularly related to buildings, have become a major concern in recent decades. Buildings, including residential, commercial, and government structures, are recognized as a significant source of environmental impact due to their construction, operation, and demolition processes. This impact includes resource depletion, greenhouse gas emissions, and effects on human health. U.S. buildings consume vast amounts of resources annually, especially in terms of electricity for lighting. Buildings in the U.S. consume significant resources for lighting, water, and construction, leading to high environmental and financial costs. They account for 40% of energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, costing consumers over $430 billion annually. The location and design of buildings also impact stormwater management and human health. Green building addresses environmental and health impacts in construction, renovation, and operations of buildings. Proximity to public transportation affects energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions. Indoor air quality impacts occupant health and productivity. Green building transforms building design, construction, operation, and demolition practices. Green building has gained substantial interest since the 1990s, with various stakeholders involved. This report discusses the concept, federal policies, and programs related to green building, including its definition, environmental impacts, tools for compliance, and implementation issues. The modern practice of green building emerged in the 1990s, with key organizations like the American Institute of Architects (AIA) and the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) playing significant roles. The concept has expanded to encompass environmentally conscious design principles and strategies to reduce harmful impacts. Green building encompasses practices to reduce harmful impacts of the built environment, with varying levels of ambition. Some aim for zero or even negative environmental impacts, while others have less ambitious goals. Green building is an integrated approach to design, construction, and operations that reduces the environmental footprint of buildings compared to standard practices. It is not limited to one factor like energy consumption but involves integration across several. Green builders aim to improve environmental performance through various techniques and strategies, applicable to any type of building. Green building techniques aim to improve environmental performance through innovative technologies and design features that influence occupant behavior. These decisions are typically made during the design phase and can impact a building's environmental footprint throughout its lifecycle. Green building is often used interchangeably with sustainable building, although the terms may not be exactly synonymous. Sustainable building, also known as green building, aims to maintain small environmental footprints to support future human activity and ecosystem functioning. High-performance building, on the other hand, includes factors like security in addition to environmental aspects. Federal statutory definitions highlight the integration and optimization of various attributes such as energy efficiency, durability, occupant productivity, and sustainability. High-performance buildings consider security, durability, accessibility, cost-benefit, productivity, sustainability, and functionality. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 defined high-performance green buildings, focusing on elements like energy, water, materials, waste, and health, as well as siting considerations. High-performance buildings prioritize serviceability, productivity, and functionality, along with disaster and climate resilience. Objectives for green building projects vary based on stakeholder needs and expected occupants, leading to different priorities in each project. Local factors such as climate zone also influence design considerations. Reduced energy footprint is a key element of green building, focusing on energy efficiency, conservation, and use of renewable energy sources like solar or geothermal power. Energy storage technologies and smart-grid innovations are also important for reducing economic costs and environmental impacts associated with energy use. A 2010 study by the National Academies found that energy savings from energy efficiency measures in buildings are higher than in transportation and industry. The Department of Energy estimated in 2015 that buildings using the best energy efficiency technologies would consume half as much energy as current buildings. Federal law mandates energy use reductions in federal buildings, with a 22% decline in energy intensity from 2003 to 2015. However, energy consumption in 2015 still exceeded the federal goal. Energy is a key element in green building, but a building focused solely on energy may not be considered green. Reducing water usage in buildings can provide cost savings and aid in managing water resources, especially in arid areas and during droughts. Measures like reduced-flow plumbing fixtures, wastewater recycling, and water-efficient landscaping can achieve these reductions. Water management also involves handling rain, on-site water, and run-off, with low-impact development focusing on natural and engineered techniques to control stormwater. This approach includes reducing impervious surfaces through landscaping and using porous materials. The choice and use of materials in a building can significantly impact its environmental footprint. Environmentally preferable products, such as those with recycled content or made from renewable resources, can reduce resource depletion, pollution, and energy consumption. These materials are designed to minimize health risks and environmental impact, contributing to a more sustainable construction industry. The environmental impacts of a building's waste stream can be reduced through waste-reduction efforts like source reduction, reuse, recycling, and waste-to-energy. Efficient use of materials and recycling in construction processes can help minimize waste. Landscaping can also be planned to reduce chemical pollutants from grounds. Indoor air quality (IAQ) is crucial for occupant health, with factors like mold, radon, carbon monoxide, asbestos, and VOCs affecting it. Techniques to maintain high IAQ include ventilation, air filtration, and using materials without toxic substances. The overall indoor environmental quality (IEQ) includes factors like lighting, climate control, acoustics, and ergonomic design, in addition to IAQ. Building siting can impact its environmental footprint, with considerations for transportation hubs, ecological sensitivity, and climate-related risks. Orientation, proximity to trees, and plantings affect heating and cooling requirements. Factors influencing building siting decisions include risks from sea-level rise, flooding, and extreme weather events, which are increasingly concerning for builders, especially in coastal areas. Productivity and utility are important aspects of green building, with studies showing that indoor environmental quality (IEQ) can impact worker comfort and productivity. While green buildings can improve productivity, trade-offs between serviceability and other elements like acoustic performance may occur. Resistance to hazards such as earthquakes, hurricanes, flooding, and forest fires can increase the useful life of a building and permit it to function when services are not available. Approaches to resilience include resistant construction, on-site power generation, rainwater harvesting, and water recycling capabilities. Climate-resilient design is defined as assets prepared for extreme conditions. Climate-resilient design, as defined in Executive Order 13693, focuses on assets prepared to withstand severe weather events and climate change. Green building emphasizes integration across elements and stages to improve performance and minimize environmental impacts throughout the building's lifecycle. This approach allows for better assessment of environmental impact, balance of competing goals, and development of an integrated strategy. The appropriate use of information technology in building operations can enhance integration and performance across various elements. Focusing solely on energy efficiency without considering other factors like air exchange can lead to issues such as increased pollutants and mold development. A green building approach forces an examination of how actions impact each element to achieve overall optimization. In building operations, a green building approach requires considering various factors for overall optimization. Prioritizing certain elements over others may be necessary due to constraints or priorities. Choices made during construction can impact energy usage and environmental impacts over the building's life cycle. A green building approach considers factors for overall optimization in building operations. Choices made during construction can impact energy usage and environmental impacts over the building's life cycle. Elements like environmentally preferable products and on-site renewable energy generation can have interdependent effects on occupant health, productivity, and resilience during power outages. Systems and tools have been developed to set criteria for green and sustainable buildings. In the 1990s, professional organizations in the building sector developed rating and certification systems to standardize green building practices. Rating systems assign points to buildings for meeting established criteria, with well-known systems like LEED combining both rating and certification. Rating systems assign points to buildings for meeting green building design criteria, resulting in an overall score and certification. Independent third parties conduct assessments for certification, with LEED being the most prevalent system in the United States. LEED, launched in 1998, is a widely recognized benchmark for green building design. Over 37,300 commercial buildings worldwide have been certified by LEED as of April 2017. USGBC offers certifications for various building categories and focuses on six green building elements. Operations and maintenance certification is also available with a five-year recertification cycle. LEED certification is based on six green building elements: transportation, sustainable sites, water efficiency, energy and atmosphere, materials and resources, and indoor environmental quality. Buildings must meet mandatory requirements and earn a certain number of points to achieve certification levels: Certified, Silver, Gold, or Platinum. The checklist approach allows for simple compliance assessment and integrated consideration of elements. LEED v4, the most recent version, was released in November 2013. The Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM) is a British system developed in 1990. BREEAM In-Use certification has been introduced in the United States since 2017, offering an online rating system for existing commercial building performance. Unlike LEED, BREEAM In-Use has no prerequisites and uses a star rating system based on nine impact categories. Green Globes certification, developed in Canada by the Green Building Initiative, is based on BREEAM and offers one to four Globes based on points earned out of 1000. Points are distributed across six elements, with no mandatory provisions. The Living Building Challenge by the International Living Future Institute offers three certifications: Living Building, Petal, and Zero Energy Building. The Living Building Challenge offers three certifications: Living Building, Petal, and Zero Energy Building. Certification criteria include seven performance areas known as \"Petals\": place, water, energy, health and happiness, materials, equity, and beauty. Living Building Certification requires meeting requirements in all seven areas, Petal Certification requires compliance with at least three Petals including water, energy, or materials, and Zero Energy Certification requires generating all energy needs on site without combustion. Certification under the Living Building Challenge also includes a 12-month assessment of actual building performance. Different ratings systems emphasize various aspects of green building. Different green certification systems offer guidelines and certification for various types of buildings. Some focus on new construction, while others are geared towards existing buildings. In addition to comprehensive green certification systems, there are additional programs like Energy Star, Indoor airPLUS, WaterSense, Zero Energy Ready Home, and Passive House/ PHIUS+ that certify buildings for specific environmental performance areas. Federal statutes and policies also impose green building requirements on federal offices. Several federal statutes and policies require green building standards for federal offices and agencies. The General Services Administration (GSA) recommends using third-party green certification systems to simplify compliance with guidelines, reduce the need for additional staff, and communicate sustainability efforts. Some agencies have established internal policies on certification under available rating systems. EISA mandated the Secretary of Energy, in consultation with GSA and the Department of Defense (DOD), to identify a third-party certification system. The Secretary of Energy, in consultation with GSA and DOD, recommends using either LEED or Green Globes for green building certification. Agencies should aim for a LEED Silver rating or Two Globes under Green Globes for new construction and major renovation projects. The 2014 Department of Energy rule sets minimum criteria for a rating system instead of specifying a particular system. The Department of Energy rulemaking on green building certification establishes minimum criteria for federal agencies to use a rating system. States and local jurisdictions also require green building certification for government and commercial buildings, with some offering incentives. Green building certification systems have influenced building codes and standards, with codes being mandatory and standards potentially becoming mandatory through incorporation. Building codes set minimum requirements for design and construction, covering various aspects beyond health and safety. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 established a baseline for energy efficiency in building codes. State and local governments adopt national model codes for regulating buildings. Green building codes, also known as \"beyond-code\" options, exceed minimum building code requirements and focus on environmental design and performance. Governments can choose to adopt these codes as mandatory or voluntary measures for meeting green building objectives. Technical standards for specific components are often incorporated into both model codes and mandatory building codes, created by recognized standards development organizations. Some organizations have developed more general green building standards through the standards-development process. Green building standards provide guidelines and criteria for certifying buildings that meet specific requirements through prescriptive, performance, or outcome-based pathways. These standards are often described as code-intended and can be adopted by jurisdictions for mandatory enforcement. The International Code Council (ICC) and ASHRAE are the main developers of national green building model codes and standards in the United States. The ICC is responsible for the widely used International Building Code (IBC) and released the International Green Building Code in 2012. The International Green Construction Code (IgCC) was released by the ICC in 2012 as the first model code to include sustainability measures for construction projects. It functions as an overlay code that can be adopted alongside other ICC codes. Municipalities can choose from various compliance pathways to adjust requirements based on local factors. The IgCC covers most building types except for low-rise residential buildings, which are referred to the ICC 700 National Green Building Standard. The NGBS and Standard 189.1 are green building standards developed in partnership with ASHRAE, NAHB, USGBC, and IES. Standard 189.1 focuses on site sustainability, energy efficiency, water-use efficiency, indoor environmental quality, and building impacts. Elements of Standard 189.1 have been incorporated into Department of Defense properties. In 2015, the ICC and ASHRAE partnered to integrate Standard 189.1 into the 2018 IgCC, aligning it with the LEED rating system. Federal laws and policies have provisions for green building, such as the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act requiring recycled content in products. Various state, local, and tribal authorities have their own green building codes. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT 1992) and the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT 2005) included incentives and requirements for energy and water efficiency in federal, commercial, and residential buildings. EPACT 2005 aimed to reduce energy consumption in federal buildings by 20% by 2015. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 aimed to reduce energy consumption in federal buildings by 20% by 2015 through various measures such as promoting energy-efficient products, setting energy consumption targets for new buildings, and establishing energy efficiency programs for states. EPACT 2005 established Energy Star labeling program for energy conservation, set standards for products, required agencies to purchase energy-efficient products, set energy-efficiency standards for public housing, provided tax incentives for energy and water efficiency. EISA 2007 provided a legislative framework for federal green building efforts and defined high-performance green building. Title III of EPACT 2005 set efficiency standards for appliances and lighting, while Title IV increased funding for DOE's program to assist low-income families with weatherization and energy efficiency. It also established energy-efficiency standards for manufactured housing. The Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) of 2007 established energy-efficiency standards for commercial buildings, including zero-net-energy buildings. It increased the required reduction in total energy consumption of federal buildings to 30% by 2015 and set more stringent energy goals for new construction and renovations. EISA also mandated the use of a green building certification system for new structures and included water-conservation guidelines and stormwater runoff requirements for property development. The Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) of 2007 set energy-efficiency standards for commercial buildings, including federal buildings. It mandated a 30% reduction in total energy consumption by 2015, required green building certification for new structures, and included water-conservation guidelines for property development. Federal agencies must commission new building equipment to operate at design specifications, install advanced metering devices, and report energy use data. Regular evaluations of energy and water use are required, with the Office of Management and Budget issuing performance scorecards twice a year. Energy costs are assessed over a 40-year lifecycle, and new major equipment must be energy efficient. The act also accelerated the use of energy-efficient lighting and cost-saving technologies in GSA facilities. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 mandated energy-efficiency standards for federal buildings, requiring a 30% reduction in energy consumption by 2015. It established the Office of Federal High-Performance Green Buildings to oversee green building development in the federal sector. The act also promoted energy efficiency in schools, public facilities, and housing, and funded green building research projects. Additionally, it included provisions for energy efficiency in the U.S. Capitol complex. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 mandated energy-efficiency standards for federal buildings, including a 30% reduction in energy consumption by 2015. It established the Office of Federal High-Performance Green Buildings and promoted energy efficiency in schools, public facilities, and housing. The act also funded green building research projects and included provisions for energy efficiency in the U.S. Capitol complex. Additionally, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provided funding for converting GSA facilities to high-performance green buildings and green retrofits of housing. The Energy Efficiency Improvement Act of 2015 (P.L. 114-11) directs GSA to develop model leasing provisions for energy and water efficiency in commercial buildings. It also amends EISA to include provisions for improving energy efficiency in tenant spaces. The Energy Efficiency Improvement Act of 2015 directs GSA to develop model leasing provisions for energy and water efficiency in commercial buildings. It also includes provisions for improving energy efficiency in tenant spaces and establishes energy conservation standards for grid-enabled water heaters. E.O. 13693 expanded on previous orders, setting new sustainability targets for federal agencies by FY2025. Targets include reducing building energy intensity, water consumption, and increasing clean energy production. It also mandates climate-resilient design elements in federal buildings. E.O. 13693 mandated federal agencies to comply with revised Guiding Principles for sustainable buildings, aiming for 15% compliance by FY2025. Agency efforts led to an 18% increase in sustainable federal buildings between FY2014 and FY2015. In 2006, a memorandum of understanding was signed by 19 federal agencies, outlining core principles for high performance and sustainable buildings. The federal government mandates compliance with revised Guiding Principles for sustainable buildings, aiming for 15% compliance by FY2025. These principles include integrated design, energy optimization, water conservation, indoor air quality enhancement, and material environmental impact reduction. The government owns or leases about 273,000 buildings in the US, costing nearly $6.1 billion in energy bills. Various policy instruments require federal agencies to implement green building practices for buildings they control. The General Services Administration (GSA) manages 425 million square feet of space in over 8,500 buildings, requiring LEED certification for new construction and major renovations. Other federal agencies also have programs focusing on reducing environmental impacts. GSA manages a large portfolio of buildings, requiring LEED certification for new construction and renovations. By 2020, all new buildings will aim for net-zero energy, water, or waste. The Green Proving Ground program evaluates new building technologies for deployment. Various GSA offices contribute to green building efforts, including the Office of Federal High-Performance Green Buildings. The Office of Federal High-Performance Green Buildings within GSA provides actionable information and assessments to improve building performance. It maintains the Sustainable Facilities Tool website, offering resources for green construction and operations. The Facility Management Institute assists agencies in managing federal buildings, and collaborations with other agencies result in green-building programs and projects. EISA directs recommendations on rating and certification to the Secretary of Energy. The Office of Federal High-Performance Green Buildings within GSA collaborates with the Department of Energy on green building activities and provides recommendations on rating and certification systems. GSA also participates in climate adaptation planning and sustainable design principles development for federal buildings. The GSA collaborates with the Department of Health and Human Services and New York City agencies to develop FITWEL, a voluntary certification program promoting occupant health and wellness through workplace design. The Department of Energy's green building activities focus on energy efficiency through various programs like the Building Technologies Office and Federal Energy Management Program. The Building Technologies Office (BTO) aims to achieve a 50% reduction in energy use intensity in U.S. buildings by 2020. They focus on developing cost-effective net-zero energy buildings for residential and commercial sectors through programs like Building America and Commercial Buildings Integration. The Better Buildings Alliance, Energy Star, and Zero Energy Ready Home are programs promoting energy efficiency in commercial and residential buildings. The Building Performance Database and Federal Energy Management Program assist in providing data and implementing energy savings measures. The Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) assists agencies in procurement, construction, operations, and maintenance of sustainable buildings. FEMP also chairs the Interagency Sustainability Working Group with the GSA to implement sustainable building design requirements. FEMP collects data on energy consumption and issues annual reports. DOE entities like the Energy Information Administration and national laboratories gather data on energy usage in buildings. ARPA-E funds R&D for energy-efficient technologies. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has various programs for green building, such as Energy Star for energy efficiency and WaterSense for water efficiency. EPA also supports the procurement of renewable power through the Green Power Partnership. The Green Infrastructure Collaborative promotes community adoption of green infrastructure for stormwater management, while the Sustainable Materials Management Program encourages a life-cycle approach to reduce environmental impacts of materials use. The WasteWise program is a public/private partnership focused on waste prevention, recycling, and purchasing recycled materials. The Federal Green Challenge aims to reduce waste and water usage in government agencies. The Environmentally Preferable Purchasing Program helps federal agencies meet green purchasing requirements. EPA supports R&D for safer chemicals and green chemistry technologies. The Indoor Air Quality Program ensures indoor environmental quality in various buildings. airPLUS is a voluntary program that sets air quality design features for homes. The Smart Location Database measures neighborhood characteristics for siting efficiency. EPA offers resources for green building policies, while DOD has its own requirements for buildings under the UFC program. DOD has a large building footprint worldwide. The UFC program sets technical criteria and standards for DOD facilities. Two recent UFC documents focus on green building requirements: UFC 1-200-02 for high performance and sustainable buildings, and UFC 3-210-10 for low impact development. These documents provide guidance on complying with federal building requirements and EISA provisions for stormwater management using LID techniques. The DOD sets and reports on green building goals through its Strategic Sustainability Performance Plan (SSPP) for reducing energy and water use, managing stormwater, waste diversion, and increasing sustainable buildings. The Army and Air Force have their own green building initiatives, with the Army expanding a Net Zero Installations project and the Air Force using Sustainability Development Indicators. In 2016, DOD and EPA signed a Memorandum of Understanding to work towards environmental goals. In 2016, DOD and EPA signed a Memorandum of Understanding to implement sustainable military installations and promote innovative technologies. The position of Federal Chief Sustainability Officer was established in 1993 and expanded to include green building requirements and advising the Council on Environmental Quality. The green building efforts of NIST are housed in NIST's Engineering Laboratory. The Sustainable and Energy-Efficient Manufacturing, Materials, and Infrastructure Program at NIST's Engineering Laboratory focuses on improving measurement science and data for intelligent building systems, sustainably engineered materials, and achieving net-zero energy buildings with high indoor air quality. The Net-Zero Energy High-Performance Buildings Program under this focuses on developing building metrics for sustainability and reducing energy usage. NIST also developed the Net-Zero Energy Residential Test Facility (NZERTF) for research on achieving net-zero energy homes. Building for Environmental and Economic Sustainability (BEES) is a software tool that aids in selecting environmentally preferable building products. NIST contributes resources on climate resiliency for buildings to the U.S. Climate Resilience Toolkit. HUD administers mortgage insurance programs encouraging green building elements in public housing, including the Mark-to-Market program offering incentives for green building measures. FHA oversees the Energy Efficient Mortgage Program. The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) administers the Energy Efficient Mortgage Program to finance energy-efficiency improvements. HUD also oversees the Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes Program to reduce home health hazards. Green building's impact and questions about market penetration and performance have been raised since the 1990s. The building industry in the U.S. is a significant part of the economy, with construction and renovation work exceeding $1 trillion in 2016. The percentage of green building in the construction market has grown substantially, from 2% in 2005 to an estimated 20% in 2013, driven by various factors like government requirements and environmental concerns. Green construction spending in the United States has been growing rapidly, more than tripling from $39 billion in 2008 to $129 billion in 2014. It is projected to generate $303.4 billion in GDP between 2015 and 2018. New institutional construction, driven by certification requirements, is expected to boost green building growth. The percentage of certified-green floorspace is increasing, with 38% of office space in the 30 largest U.S. markets certified by LEED or Energy Star in 2016. Green building efforts impact financial performance by affecting construction costs, operating expenses, rental rates, and property values. Information barriers can distort perceptions about the economic benefits of green building, making it difficult to generalize cost performance for the market segment as a whole. The financial performance of green building investments is limited due to perceived higher initial costs compared to conventional buildings. Higher costs can stem from various sources such as expensive features, design costs, and certification processes. However, some evidence suggests that constructing green buildings may not be substantially more expensive than standard construction. The DOE review found that green buildings have comparable construction costs to conventional buildings. Integrated design can lead to initial cost reductions. Proponents argue that operational savings will offset higher investment, with utility resource reduction and selling renewable energy back to the grid contributing to cost savings. GSA saved $340 million in energy and water costs from FY2008 to FY2015. Studies show green certification is linked to lower utility expenses. Green certification may not significantly reduce overall operating expenses, but green-labeled buildings can command price premiums in the real estate market. However, some factors like frequent ownership changes or leasing arrangements can hinder the financial return on green building investments. Owners' return on investment would rely on the premium they can charge tenants. The return on green building investments for owners depends on premium charged to tenants, while tenants' return relies on tenure length. Constraints on capital availability limit potential beneficiaries, including educational institutions, hospitals, and municipalities. Cost barriers may decrease as green building practices become more widespread, with financial incentives helping to offset initial costs. The \"triple bottom line\" concept in green building considers social and environmental returns alongside financial ones. Green building efforts focus on design and construction specifications, with a need to assess actual environmental performance. Certification requirements historically did not incorporate post-construction building operations. Green building efforts may not always guarantee improved performance post-construction due to factors like inadequate maintenance, alterations to building controls, and changes in use. Even certified green buildings can be resource-intensive after occupancy. Studies show that while some green buildings demonstrate greater resource-use efficiency, savings may be offset by other factors. Initiatives have helped reduce energy-use intensity in newer U.S. homes, but they use more total energy due to their larger size and increased electronic devices. Green building performance has a \"performance gap\" between predicted and actual energy use, leading to a focus on postoccupancy assessment in rating systems like LEED. Building certification programs like LEED are evolving to include performance parameters and outcome-based compliance pathways. Commissioning building systems can improve environmental performance, especially for energy use, for both new and existing buildings. Data from energy and water meters are required to be reported to USGBC for the first five years following certification. Other systems like BREEAM In-Use and Living Building Certification also incorporate performance criteria. Building codes are moving towards incorporating performance outcomes into requirements. Building certification programs like LEED and BREEAM In-Use are evolving to include performance parameters and outcome-based compliance pathways. Commissioning building systems can improve environmental performance, especially for energy use in new and existing buildings. Organizations can develop an environmental management system (EMS) with international standards to certify their environmental policy, improve performance, and prevent pollution. Networked building monitoring tools allow for early fault detection and resource use analytics to help building managers respond effectively to changing patterns in real time. Building managers can use tools like GSAlink for real-time monitoring of building performance. Studies on green building performance show mixed results, with some buildings not meeting design expectations. LEED ratings are commonly used as criteria for evaluating green buildings. The performance of more than 100 LEED-certified buildings was studied, showing they performed 24% better on average than other buildings. However, about one in seven performed worse than average. A follow-up assessment found that primary energy savings from LEED certification were nonexistent for lower levels of certification and 13% better than average for Gold and Platinum-certified buildings. The study found that LEED-certified buildings generally outperformed the national average in energy use, water use, operating costs, occupant satisfaction, and carbon emissions. However, some buildings did not meet federal energy consumption requirements and consumed more electricity than the national average. Arizona's LEED-certified new construction buildings also underperformed in energy efficiency compared to design and baseline simulations, indicating a disconnect between strategies employed and modeling results. The findings from studies on LEED certification do not consistently show reduced building energy consumption. Limited sample sizes and proprietary performance data hinder comprehensive assessments. Improved access to building performance data is crucial for evaluating environmental targets and enhancing green building performance measurement methods. The difficulty in quantifying certain elements like energy and water use, along with disagreements on relevant metrics, poses challenges in evaluating building performance. The Green Building Advisory Committee has proposed alternative methodologies for measuring energy use intensity (EUI), including energy use per occupant and area-based EUI measuring energy used in commuter transportation. The Advisory Committee notes challenges in evaluating building performance due to varying energy use metrics. A study by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory warns of inaccurate occupancy data affecting occupancy-adjusted EUI calculations. Commonly accepted metrics like Energy Star scores may not correlate well with intended outcomes. Regular measurement and adjustment of building performance are crucial for long-term environmental sustainability. Eventually, a standard life-cycle assessment for whole buildings may be feasible. EISA mandates federal agencies to measure building performance. EISA mandates federal agencies to measure building performance against specified targets, especially for energy use. Challenges exist in determining accurate baseline consumption levels, obtaining reliable data, and consensus on measurement goals. Measurement science for green building is an active area of research. The National Institute of Standards and Technology prioritizes developing metrics and tools for measuring building sustainability. Agency progress towards federally mandated green building goals varies widely, with annual sustainability and energy scorecards released by OMB during the Obama Administration. Scorecards track agency progress in areas such as GHG emission reductions, energy intensity, renewable energy use, water intensity, fleet petroleum use, and green buildings. Scorecards include numeric reports and color scores indicating progress levels. The color score of green, yellow, or red indicates agency progress towards federally mandated green building goals. A green score means the agency has met or is on track to meet the target, yellow shows some progress, and red indicates lack of progress. Some agencies have surpassed the 15% compliance target for buildings over 5,000 square feet, while others are still working towards it. Several agencies have achieved compliance in fewer than 2% of buildings, with some receiving a red score in the green buildings category from OMB for FY2015. EISA set a goal for federal facilities to reduce energy intensity by 30% from 2003 levels by 2015, but many agencies did not meet this goal. Government-wide energy intensity only declined 22% during this period. E.O. 13693 directs agencies to reduce energy intensity by 2.5% per year relative to 2015, with progress starting to be reported for FY2016. E.O. 13514 set a goal for a 26% reduction in potable water intensity between 2007 and 2020, which was replaced by E.O. 13693 in 2015 with a 36% reduction from 2007 levels by 2025. OMB scorecards for 2015 scored agencies on their progress towards achieving the earlier goal from E.O. 13514, with many agencies already meeting it and making progress towards the 36% reduction goal. Some critics have concerns about green building rating and certification systems, noting that they lack caps on performance metrics like energy use, leading to relative sustainability claims. They argue for more integrative design criteria and new approaches focused on maintenance or enhancement of environmental impacts. Some observers worry that new builders may not fully understand the importance of an integrative approach to green building design, viewing green building measures as add-ons rather than integral parts of a project. The limited scientific and technological knowledge base in green building makes it challenging to identify the most appropriate approaches, necessitating substantial research to improve understanding. The challenges in green building include differences in goals and perspectives among proponents, difficulty in identifying objective criteria, and lack of quantitative evaluation for certain elements like siting. Congress may face questions on the effectiveness of federal green building programs, coordination methods, extension of efforts nationwide, and prioritization of elements like siting. Congress may need to take action to facilitate the growth of scientific and technical knowledge relating to green building, including through appropriations, new statutory requirements, and tax law. GAO reports have identified numerous federal initiatives related to green building, but few focus on the integrative approach discussed in this report. Coordination among agencies to assess the performance of these initiatives is recommended. Congress may need to examine how federal agencies are implementing green building programs and their impact on adoption nationwide. It is recommended that agencies coordinate to assess the performance of these initiatives, including mortgage programs that promote energy efficiency. If necessary, Congress could consider providing stronger incentives to support green building practices. Congress could consider providing stronger mortgage and tax incentives, broadening the scope to include elements of green building, funding rebate programs, and specific appropriations to speed adoption of green building. Regulatory actions may be complicated by federalism issues and regional requirements. Congress could also enhance current green building efforts in federal agencies and ensure integration and harmonization of activities. The report highlights the need for balanced federal efforts in green building, with a focus on energy efficiency. Congress is urged to assess if existing programs adequately cover all elements of green building and consider potential modifications or accelerations. Additionally, the effectiveness of the incremental approach in addressing national needs is questioned. The development of the scientific and technological knowledge base for green building is supported by R&D funded by federal and private-sector sources, but funding levels may be insufficient. Studies have shown that green building receives minimal federal nondefense R&D funding and construction sector investment in R&D is below industry average. Funding for different elements of green building varies, with energy being a higher priority. There is a need for improved knowledge about all green building elements and the importance of integration. Congress may need to consider modifying federal funding levels and priorities to support green building efforts, create incentives for private-sector R&D funding, and ensure sufficient training and education for a knowledgeable workforce in construction, certification, and operation of green buildings."
