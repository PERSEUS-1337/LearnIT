    "content": "The Act titled \"National Death Penalty Moratorium Act of 2000\" establishes a moratorium on the death penalty. Congress finds that death sentences are disproportionately imposed on the poor and certain racial and ethnic groups, with evidence showing disparities in legal representation and execution rates. The House Judiciary Subcommittee found that 89 percent of defendants selected for capital prosecution under the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 were African-American or Hispanic American. Additionally, a 1990 report by the General Accounting Office highlighted racial disparities in charging, sentencing, and imposition of the death penalty. Prisoner appeals have also been significantly limited. Prisoner appeals have been severely curtailed, increasing the risk of imprisonment and execution of innocent people. The Supreme Court has restricted death row prisoners' rights to appeal convictions and sentences in Federal courts, even when presenting compelling evidence of innocence. Legislation in 1996 limited Federal court review of death penalty appeals and reduced public funding for legal aid services for death row prisoners. The Federal and State death penalty is on hold until Congress reviews the final findings of the National Commission on the Death Penalty and enacts legislation based on their recommendations. The National Commission on the Death Penalty has been established. The National Commission on the Death Penalty is established with 15 members appointed by the President, including prosecutors, defense attorneys, and judges.
