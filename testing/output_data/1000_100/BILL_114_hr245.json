    "content": "The text chunk is about the codification of effective dates for claims under the laws administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. The text chunk provides definitions related to claims for benefits under the laws administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. It defines terms such as claimant, claim, formal claim, and informal claim. The text chunk outlines the requirements for a claim to be considered a \"reasonably raised claim\" for benefits under the laws administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. It specifies that the claim must be submitted in a specific format, indicate intent to apply for benefits, identify the benefit sought, be made by an authorized representative, and may include relevant medical reports. The term 'reasonably raised claim' refers to evidence of entitlement to a benefit under laws administered by the Secretary, not explicitly raised in a claim but logically placed at issue. Section 5100 of the title defines informal claims and outlines the process for submitting a formal claim. Informal requests for claim increase or reopening are treated the same as formal claims. Effective dates for applications are specified in Section 5110. In determining the receipt date of an application for benefits, the Secretary considers informal communication as the filing date if the application is submitted within 180 days of receiving necessary forms. If not, the completed application form submission date is considered. The Secretary will address and adjudicate reasonably raised claims that arise during the process of handling any claim, including evidence related to separate conditions not previously identified. The Secretary will handle reasonably raised claims, including evidence for separate conditions not previously identified, with amendments taking effect on the enactment date of the Act for claims submitted thereafter."
