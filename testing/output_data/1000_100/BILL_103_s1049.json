    "content": "The Act titled \"Lechuguilla Cave Protection Act of 1993\" recognizes the scientific and environmental significance of Lechuguilla Cave and other caves in Carlsbad Caverns National Park. It aims to protect these caves from adverse effects of mineral exploration and development. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS\n\nCave protection area refers to lands within a specified map area. Secretary refers to the Secretary of the Interior. Other terms have the same meaning as in the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976.\n\nSEC. 4. LAND WITHDRAWAL. The approximately 6,280 acres of public lands within the cave protection area are withdrawn from all forms of appropriation or disposal under public land laws. The lands are described in a map filed in April 1993. The Secretary will publish a notice with the legal description in the Federal Register. The Federal Register will contain the legal description of the withdrawn lands, along with a detailed map filed with the House and Senate committees. The map and legal description will have the same legal force as the Act, with the Secretary allowed to correct errors. Copies will be available for public inspection at the Bureau of Land Management offices. The public lands withdrawn under subsection (a) shall be managed by the Secretary through the Director of the Bureau of Land Management, in accordance with the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 and other relevant laws. SEC. 5. MANAGEMENT OF EXISTING LEASES. The Secretary is prohibited from allowing new drilling on certain mineral or geothermal leases within withdrawn lands to protect cave resources. Activities on existing leases may be suspended if necessary to prevent adverse impacts. During the prohibition period, new drilling is not allowed on certain mineral or geothermal leases within withdrawn lands to protect cave resources. The Secretary may suspend activities on existing leases if needed to prevent adverse impacts. The Secretary will seek agreements for termination of leases during this period. The Secretary may seek agreements for termination of geothermal leases on public lands to protect cave resources, with consideration for the value of oil and gas resources that owners will not be able to recover. If no agreement is reached, the Secretary will take appropriate steps to address the lease. The Secretary may take steps to protect Lechuguilla Cave and other significant cave resources in Carlsbad Caverns National Park, including acquiring lands or interests. Cooperation with the State of New Mexico and other parties may be sought as desired. The Secretary may seek cooperation from the State of New Mexico and other parties to implement restrictions on land use within the cave protection area to protect Lechuguilla Cave and other significant resources in Carlsbad Caverns National Park. SEC. 6. ADDITIONAL PROTECTION AND RELATION TO OTHER LAWS. The Secretary will take additional steps to protect Lechuguilla Cave and other significant cave resources in Carlsbad Caverns National Park, including limiting access and prohibiting removal of resources for scientific purposes. The Secretary may inform relevant committees if existing laws do not provide enough authority to protect Lechuguilla Cave or other significant cave resources in Carlsbad Caverns National Park. This Act does not affect the ability to seek compensation under other laws. The Tucker Act, also known as title 28, United States Code, does not prevent the United States from using any defense or claim in actions seeking compensation."
