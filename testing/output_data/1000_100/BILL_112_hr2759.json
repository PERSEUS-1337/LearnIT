SHORT TITLE, ETC.\" The \"Business Transparency on Trafficking and Slavery Act\" requires disclosure of human rights impact of products in the US market, following California's lead in 2010. The Act aims to eradicate slavery and forced labor in supply chains, building on existing laws like the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930. The Tariff Act has exceptions for goods not produced in the US in sufficient quantities, limiting consumer enforcement actions. Other mechanisms related to slavery and trafficking also face challenges in providing information on tainted goods. The Tariff Act has exceptions for goods not produced in the US in sufficient quantities, limiting consumer enforcement actions. Other mechanisms related to slavery and trafficking also face challenges in providing information on tainted goods. It is the sense of Congress that forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor are egregious forms of abuse for profit, and legislation is needed to address the inadequate framework for preventing these goods from entering the US market. Businesses can help by providing transparent information to consumers and investors. Businesses should respond to consumer and investor demands for business reasons, rather than just following government regulations. SEC. 2.
