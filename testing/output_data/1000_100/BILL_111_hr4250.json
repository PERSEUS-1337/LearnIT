    "content": "The text chunk \"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\" is a concise section header indicating the beginning of the document and the findings that will be presented. The \"Medicaid DSH Integrity Act\" serves as a critical source of funding for safety net hospitals that cater to the poor and uninsured. The Act emphasizes the importance of reporting and auditing requirements to ensure DSH funds are used as intended. Medicaid DSH auditing and reporting regulations have been issued by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. The Medicaid DSH auditing and reporting regulations implemented changes that narrow the scope of DSH payments for many States. Congress did not intend to alter the definition of DSH-eligible costs or the substantive standards for DSH payments. These policy changes could lead to significant reductions in DSH payments to safety net providers. SEC. 2. REVISION OF MEDICAID DSH AUDITING AND REPORTING REGULATIONS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with States and disproportionate share hospitals, will not enforce changes in policy related to the calculation of limits under the Social Security Act. An interim final rule will be published to revise the Medicaid DSH auditing and reporting regulations as necessary. The new interim final rule will include regulatory changes allowing hospitals to include all costs related to services provided to uninsured patients, even if the patient has insurance for other services. The interim final rule permits states to define allowable costs in their Medicaid plans as long as they do not exceed Medicare cost reimbursement principles. CMS interprets the audit requirement for hospital services to align with the term \"hospital services\" in the Social Security Act. CMS will revise the General DSH Audit and Reporting Protocol to allow for alternative methodologies in determining actual costs, including trending forward costs from prior years. Additionally, the initiation of requirements under Section 1923(j) of the Social Security Act will be moved from 2004 to 2008. The amendment to Section 1923(j) of the Social Security Act, moving the initiation of requirements from 2004 to 2008, will be effective as if included in the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003. Definitions in the Act include CMS as Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Medicaid DSH auditing and reporting regulations as the final regulation issued on December 19, 2008, Medicaid DSH program as payment adjustments under section 1923, and Secretary as the Secretary of Health and Human Services."
