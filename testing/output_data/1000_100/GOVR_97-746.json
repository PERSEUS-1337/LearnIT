However, a 2009 report showed a significant 8.0% increase in foreign-born students for the academic year 2008-2009, with a notable rise in students from China. New foreign student enrollment also increased by 16.0% from the previous year, attributed to recruitment efforts and improved visa processing. The international student enrollment changes are reflected differently by types of institutions, levels of study, and disciplines. India, China, South Korea, Canada, Japan, Taiwan, Mexico, Turkey, Vietnam, and Saudi Arabia were the top countries of origin for foreign students in the US. The top fields of study for foreign students were business, engineering, physical and life sciences, social sciences, mathematics, health professions, fine arts, English language, humanities, education, and agriculture. In 2006, foreign students earned a significant percentage of doctorate degrees in sciences and engineering, with temporary resident visa holders leading in both fields. Permanent resident status students also earned a small percentage of doctorates. Trend data from 1996-2005 show that temporary resident status students consistently earned the majority of doctorate degrees in science and engineering. In 2006, foreign students earned a significant percentage of doctorate degrees in various science fields, with temporary resident visa holders leading in physical sciences, mathematics, and computer sciences. The earth, atmospheric, and ocean sciences, as well as agricultural and biological sciences, also awarded a notable percentage of degrees to foreign-born students. The social sciences and psychology awarded a smaller percentage of doctorates to foreign students. In 2006, foreign students earned a significant percentage of science and engineering doctorate degrees, with China leading at 33.5%, followed by India at 11.9%. Foreign graduate students in the US face restrictions on employment and financial aid. Foreign and U.S. science and engineering graduate students receive financial support from various sources such as personal, university, foreign government, and employer. While temporary resident foreign students are ineligible for direct federal aid, they often receive support through research assistantships and teaching assistantships funded by federally funded research grants. The 2007 report shows that institutions of higher education provide significant financial support to foreign doctoral students through teaching assistantships, research assistantships, and fellowships. Non-U.S. citizen doctoral recipients receive more financial assistance from universities than U.S. doctoral recipients, with Native Americans/Alaska Natives relying most on their own resources for funding. In the physical sciences, Asians receive the least financial support. In the physical sciences, universities provide primary financial support for a high percentage of temporary resident students, permanent residents, and U.S. citizens. Foreign doctoral students in various disciplines receive more financial assistance from universities compared to U.S. students. In education, a significant number of temporary resident doctoral students rely on universities for financial support. In the social sciences, universities provide financial support to a high percentage of temporary resident doctoral students, permanent residents, and U.S. citizens. There are differing opinions in the academic community about the impact of foreign student enrollment in science and engineering programs. Foreign students contribute to the workforce and economy, with some staying in the U.S. permanently. Foreign students, enrolled in schools, play a significant role in the workforce of large research universities by assisting in teaching, research, and scientific labs. Their tuition fees also contribute to the institutions' income. However, their prominent presence in graduate programs has sparked concerns among minority communities who feel that there is unequal access to education, scholarships, research opportunities, and collaborations for U.S. minorities compared to foreign students. Frank L. Morris criticized colleges and universities for favoring foreign doctoral students over American minority students, especially African Americans, in terms of research funds and support. This unequal treatment jeopardizes the economic well-being of the African American community. The inadequate doctoral training for American students is putting the community at risk in the increasingly technologically driven U.S. economy. Some criticize foreign teaching assistants for poor communication with American students due to language barriers. Despite efforts to set English-language standards, issues persist. However, some view scientific migration as beneficial for the U.S. economy. Proponents argue that international knowledge and personnel flow has kept the U.S. economy at the forefront of science and technology. A 2005 report by the National Academies highlights the importance of international graduate students and scholars in research. The presence of these individuals is crucial for research and teaching activities in various sectors. Immigrant scientists and engineers entering the U.S. saw a significant increase in admissions in 1992. In 1992, admissions of scientists and engineers increased due to changes in immigration laws, reaching 23,534 on permanent visas by 1993. The proportion of foreign-born scientists and engineers in the U.S. labor force peaked in 2000, with high levels of entry through permanent and temporary visas during the 1990s. Administrative changes at USCIS, immigration legislation, and post-9/11 impacts have influenced the issuance of permanent visas in recent years. Foreign scientists and engineers on temporary work visas have sparked debate. Recent legislation has increased the annual quota for the H-1B program, allowing foreign-born workers to obtain visas to work in various occupations for up to six years. The program is not limited to technology workers and is also used to hire other skilled workers. Some argue that the influx of immigrant scientists and engineers has led to decreased job opportunities, lower wages, and declining working conditions for U.S. scientific personnel. Data on selected occupations for which companies have been given permission to hire H-1B visa workers are available in Table 4. The federal government issued thousands of H-1B visas to foreign workers as businesses downsized, especially high-tech companies. Critics argue that hiring foreign workers at lower salaries weakens opportunities for U.S. workers. Advocates of the H-1B program claim it is necessary to fill needed positions, even during slow economic growth. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) report highlighted limitations in Labor's review of H-1B applications, leading to increased complaints and violations from fiscal year 2000 to 2005. USCIS lacks a formal mechanism to report information to Labor, hindering investigations by the Wage and Hour Division (WHD). The Department of Labor (DOL) enforces policies on temporary employment of nonimmigrant foreign workers under H-1B visas, penalizing violators. Concerns exist about lower salaries for foreign-born computer professionals compared to U.S. counterparts, undermining the status of American workers. Many in the scientific community believe the US needs foreign talent to compete globally in science and technology. They argue for stricter monitoring of foreign talent entering US colleges and universities. Some suggest that the issue is not too many foreign students but not enough native-born students in STEM fields. The National Science Board emphasizes the importance of attracting and retaining foreign-born talent in STEM. The importance of attracting and retaining foreign-born talent in STEM fields is emphasized, with a focus on developing domestic human capital. The debate on foreign students in science and engineering programs intensified after 9/11, with concerns about an inhospitable environment for foreign students in the US. The United States is losing its status as the top choice for international students, with concerns about foreign students in sensitive areas and access to R&D related to weapons. There is increased scrutiny on students from terrorism-sponsoring countries, leading to potential impacts on enrollments in colleges and universities. The academic community fears that stricter requirements for foreign students could harm U.S. industry competitiveness and international agreements. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act authorized the SEVP/CIPRIS program to track foreign students attending U.S. institutions. Colleges and universities were required to monitor and report data on foreign students, including enrollment date, field of study, credits earned, and financial support source. This electronic reporting system aimed to replace the paper-based format and was implemented following the September 11th terrorist attacks. The USA Patriot Act and the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act led to the development of the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) by the INS. SEVIS is a web-based system designed to track and monitor foreign students and exchange visitors in the United States to ensure they maintain their visa status. The Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) was created to track foreign students and exchange visitors in the US. SEVIS faced delays and technical issues, leading to a proposal for SEVIS II to address these issues. The House Subcommittee discussed improvements needed to correct gaps in the system. Relations held a hearing to examine procedures to strengthen the visa process for antiterrorism purposes and facilitate legitimate travel. Witnesses highlighted increased consular workloads, lack of strategic direction, resources, and training in visa-processing offices. They emphasized the need for clear procedures to ensure consistent visa adjudication worldwide. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has released reports on visa processing improvements and recommended changes. A 2006 report highlighted the need for clarifying visa policies, providing consular officers with necessary tools for national security, and promoting legitimate travel. Comprehensive immigration reform legislation was also under consideration during the 110th Congress. Comprehensive federal immigration reform legislation, including H.R. 4321, has been reintroduced in the 111th Congress. The bill aims to exempt certain U.S.-educated immigrants from employment-based immigration limits and make changes to H-1B visa employer application requirements. Other bills in the 111th Congress focus on attracting foreign students in scientific and technical fields while protecting American scientists' interests. H.R. 1736, S. 887, and H.R. 1791 are bills in the 111th Congress addressing issues related to U.S. scientists collaborating with foreign counterparts, H-1B visa reforms, and retaining Ph.D. graduates in the U.S. These bills aim to protect American scientists' interests and regulate the hiring of foreign workers in scientific fields. The bill proposes H-1B visa restrictions for immigrants with a doctorate in a scientific field, requiring this education for employment."
