    "content": "The Energy Efficient Government Technology Act, also known as the Energy Efficient and Energy-Saving Information and Communications Technologies Act, aims to promote energy-efficient technologies in government operations. The Energy Efficient Government Technology Act promotes energy-efficient technologies in government operations by requiring Federal agencies to develop an implementation strategy for energy-efficient information and communications technologies. The implementation strategy for energy-efficient information and communications technologies must be flexible, cost-effective, and tailored to the agency's operating requirements and statutory mission. Federal agencies developing this strategy must consider advanced metering infrastructure, ICT services and products, efficient data center strategies, ICT power management, and related infrastructure utilization methods. The Director, in consultation with the Secretary, shall establish performance goals for evaluating Federal agencies' efforts in improving energy-efficient information and communications technology systems and practices within 180 days of enactment. The Director will establish performance goals for Federal data centers to improve energy efficiency and cost savings, including specifications, benchmarks, asset utilization, and best practices. The Director will establish performance goals for Federal data centers to improve energy efficiency and cost savings, including requirements for agencies to evaluate energy savings performance contracting and utility energy services contracting as preferred acquisition methods. Performance goals will measure IT costs and cost savings from energy-efficient solutions over a 3 to 5-year period. The Director will establish performance goals for Federal data centers to improve energy efficiency and cost savings. A Governmentwide Data Center Task Force will be maintained to share progress towards agency goals and exchange best practices for increased energy efficiency. The Federal agencies are required to regularly exchange best practices and strategic information related to energy efficiency with the private sector. Each agency must report their efforts and results under this requirement. The Director will also include this information in the annual report and scorecard starting from October 1, 2013. Federal agencies must provide a description of their efforts and results under section 528 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. SEC. 3. ENERGY EFFICIENT DATA CENTERS. Section 453 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 is amended to designate an information technology industry organization for coordinating a program and conducting a study by the Secretary and the Administrator. The Administrator is required to update the Report to Congress on Server and Data Center Energy Efficiency by December 31, 2013. The update should include a comparison of estimates from 2007 to 2012, an analysis of technology solutions like virtualization and cloud computing, and updated projections and best practices recommendations. The Secretary, in collaboration with the designated organization and the Federal Chief Information Officer, will maintain a data center energy practitioner program for certifying professionals to assess energy usage in data centers. Federal agencies must have their data centers evaluated every 4 years by certified practitioners. The Secretary, in collaboration with the designated organization and the Federal Chief Information Officer, will establish an open data initiative for Federal data center energy usage data to promote innovation while safeguarding national security interests. The initiative may utilize the online Data Center Maturity Model and consider international specifications and metrics. The Secretary, in collaboration with the designated organization, will work on harmonizing global specifications and metrics for data center energy efficiency. They will also assist in developing an efficiency metric for measuring the energy efficiency of data centers."
