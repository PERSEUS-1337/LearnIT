These medications are used to treat various mental health conditions, but there is limited evidence on their safety and efficacy in children. Congress is concerned about how states are monitoring and regulating the use of these medications for foster children, as federal law requires states to oversee prescription drug use, including psychotropic medications. Children in foster care have higher rates of mental health care needs and are more likely to be prescribed psychotropic medications. The report discusses congressional oversight and efforts by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to ensure appropriate use of these medications for children in care. State monitoring of psychotropic medication use for foster children is also briefly mentioned. Child welfare agencies get involved when investigating abuse or neglect, with some children remaining at home and others placed in foster care for round-the-clock care. Foster care is a temporary placement for children removed from their homes due to neglect or abuse. It is intended for round-the-clock care until reunification with parents or a permanent placement is found. States must ensure the safety and well-being of children while working towards finding them permanent homes. During FY2015, 671,000 children spent time in foster care, with 243,000 leaving the system. Nearly 428,000 children remained in care by the end of the fiscal year. The national foster care caseload has been declining for over a decade, with about 77,000 fewer children in care compared to FY2006. Children in foster care have higher mental health needs due to abuse or neglect before entering care, which can impact brain development. Placing children in foster care following abuse or neglect can lead to difficulties in emotional regulation and socialization, increasing the risk of behavioral problems. A national survey found that a significant percentage of children in foster care were at risk of behavioral or emotional issues, with higher rates in group homes or institutions compared to the general population. Children in foster care, including those with Medicaid eligibility, are increasingly diagnosed with mental health disorders such as attention disorders, anxiety, autism, bipolar disorders, conduct disorders, depression, and schizophrenia. This trend is also observed in the general child population. The prevalence of mental health diagnoses among children in foster care increased for various conditions, with older children more likely to be diagnosed. In 2007, children ages 3 to 5 had conduct disorder (7.4%) and attention disorders (6.7%); ages 6 to 11 had attention disorders (52.5%) and conduct disorders (26.8%); ages 12 to 18 had conduct disorders (67.3%) and depression (44.4%). Rates of major mental health diagnoses by age group increased from 2002 to 2007, except for depression among children ages 6 to 11 and schizophrenia in both age groups. National standards for mental health care recommend mental health screenings and assessments for children in foster care, with Medicaid providing diagnostic and treatment services. Each state designs its own Medicaid plan for medical assistance, including primary and acute care, and long-term services, meeting federal requirements for reimbursement. Children in foster care are eligible for Medicaid, receiving necessary services through the EPSDT program, including health screenings, assessments, immunizations, and dental services at regular intervals. Under EPSDT, states must provide treatment to meet children's identified health needs, including mental health needs, using Medicaid financing for services like case management, psychiatry, psychology, and prescription drugs. Children with mental health challenges may benefit from psychosocial treatments like counseling and cognitive-behavioral therapy. Psychosocial treatments like CBT have been found effective for children with antisocial behaviors or trauma. Psychotropic medications may be prescribed when psychosocial treatment alone is not effective. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have noted an over-reliance on medication for children in care due to a lack of access to effective behavioral health care and evidence-based psychosocial therapies. Data analysis shows that children entering foster care are more likely to receive these treatments. Children entering foster care are more likely to receive mental health supports compared to children with mental health needs who remain in their own homes following an investigation. Research shows an increased use of psychosocial mental health interventions among foster children on antipsychotic medication. However, studies indicate that not all foster children in need of mental health services receive them. Research shows that a significant number of children in foster care with mental health needs do not receive specialty mental health services or psychotropic medication. Rates of psychotropic medication use among foster children are much higher than the general population, with factors such as age, placement setting, and length of involvement with the child welfare agency influencing the rate of use. Children in foster care receiving Medicaid have a much higher rate of psychotropic medication use compared to other children on Medicaid. Children in foster care, especially those receiving Medicaid, are prescribed psychotropic medication at a higher rate compared to other children on Medicaid or older children with mental disorders. Rates of medication use vary by state and over time, with children in group settings or residential facilities having higher rates. The prescription of psychotropic medication for children in foster care shows great variation across states, with state practices playing a significant role. A study of Medicaid claims data from 2002 to 2007 revealed an increase in the use of psychotropic medications, particularly antipsychotic drugs, among children in foster care. A study of Medicaid claims data from 2002 to 2007 showed an increase in antipsychotic medication use among children in foster care across 45 states. In 2007, the rate ranged from 2.8% to 21.7% in each state. A more recent review of 20 states from 2005 to 2010 indicated a slight decrease in antipsychotic use among foster care children. Non-foster care children with Medicaid or private insurance had lower levels of antipsychotic use. The use of antipsychotics among privately insured children increased slightly from 2005 to 2009, remaining steady through 2013. Data from the NSCAW II survey examined psychotropic medication use among children in foster care, funded by HHS. The survey included children who were prescribed psychotropic medications and those who were removed from their homes. Children in the NSCAW II survey included those living with their own parents or in foster care, with ages ranging from 2 months to 20 years. The data showed that children may have entered and re-entered care during the 18- or 36-month period. The NSCAW II data revealed that children in foster care were more likely to be using psychotropic medication compared to those living with their own parents following an investigation of child abuse or neglect. Living in congregate care and being school age were factors associated with higher chances of psychotropic medication use among children in foster care. There was no significant difference in medication use between children in foster care and those who remained at home at four to six months post-investigation, but at 18 months, children in foster care were significantly more likely to be taking psychotropic medications. By the 36-month follow-up, one-third of children in care were using psychotropics. Among children in foster care, 32.8% were taking psychotropic medication, compared to 12.9% of children remaining at home. Children in foster group homes or residential treatment programs had higher medication use than those in foster family homes or kin care. In group foster care, 48.2% of children used psychotropics within six months of initial abuse or neglect investigation. After 18 months, approximately 18% of children in foster care were on psychotropic medication. Children in group settings were most likely to be prescribed psychotropics (67.4%) compared to other foster care settings, children at home, and informal kin care. 52% of children in group settings were taking psychotropics 36 months after the investigation, with lower rates for other placements. About 18 months after the initial investigation, children in the child welfare system were taking multiple psychotropic medications. Children in foster care group homes or residential settings were most likely to be taking multiple psychotropic medications, with about half of them taking two or more drugs. At 36 months following the initial investigation, children in group settings were significantly more likely to be using three or more psychotropic medications compared to children in other placement settings. Children in foster care, especially those in group homes or residential settings, were more likely to be using psychotropic medication, with older youth aged 11 to 17 being the most common age group prescribed these medications. The research literature has criticized the prescribing patterns for foster children as \"too many, too much, and too young,\" highlighting concerns about polypharmacy and the use of psychotropic drugs in younger children. Data from 2002 through 2007 showed that polypharmacy, defined as using three or more psychotropic medication classes concurrently for at least 30 days in a year, was consistent at 5.2% to 5.9% annually among children in foster care. In 2011, Medicaid claims data for 20 states indicated similar rates of polypharmacy with antipsychotic drugs for children in foster care (2.8%) and non-foster care (3.1%) statuses. The NSCAW II study revealed that foster children prescribed psychotropics had an average of 1.9 medications per child per day. The difference in psychotropic medication prescriptions for children in group or residential settings is statistically significant compared to other groups. Concerns exist about using multiple antipsychotic medications concurrently, as it can lead to greater adverse effects with minimal benefits. Overprescribing, particularly in dosages exceeding recommendations, is a concern for foster children due to limited research on safety and efficacy. Additionally, there are worries about very young children being prescribed psychotropics. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) examined Medicaid data from 2008 to understand the use of psychotropic drugs among foster children in five states. They found that 0.3% to 2.1% of children under age 1 in foster care were prescribed psychotropics, compared to a lower rate (0.1% to 1.2%) for infants not in foster care. Research shows that prescribing rates for ADHD and antipsychotic medication increase with age among children ages 3 to 6 in foster care, raising concerns about the lack of mental health indications for psychotropic drug use in infants and young children. Children in foster care may benefit from psychotropic medications due to greater mental health service needs. However, the effectiveness of these medications varies, and the lack of psychosocial services may lead to increased use of psychotropics. Factors such as a shortage of mental health providers and clinical understanding of trauma in foster children contribute to this issue. While the prescribing rate of psychotropics has decreased, certain classes like antipsychotics are still used off-label for conditions like bipolar disorder and schizophrenia in children. The use of psychotropic medications, including antipsychotics, has increased among children in foster care. This trend may be influenced by limited research on their efficacy in children, marketing strategies by pharmaceutical companies, and a general rise in psychotropic prescriptions for children. Policymakers and stakeholders are increasingly scrutinizing the use of psychotropics in children, especially those in foster care. Few studies on psychotropic use in children with mental health disorders show safety and effectiveness. Research on antipsychotics found insufficient evidence for their safety in addressing child mental health disorders, including disruptive behavior disorders and eating disorders. Studies had a high risk of bias due to mishandling of data and funding from pharmaceutical companies. Some children in foster care may benefit from psychotropic medication for managing symptoms related to mental health and behavior concerns stemming from exposure to trauma. Stimulants are well-researched for treating ADHD and have been found effective in reducing core symptoms like hyperactivity. Some stimulants effectively reduce core symptoms of ADHD in children, including hyperactivity, impulsivity, inattention, and aggression. Children in foster care have higher rates of mental health diagnoses, potentially leading to increased use of psychotropic medications. Congressional interest in oversight of prescription medications for children in foster care has been noted. In 2005, the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources held a hearing to examine the enrollment of children in foster care in clinical drug trials, following media reports on the use of foster children in clinical AIDS drug trials. Congress later required state child welfare agencies to consult with medical professionals in assessing and treating children in foster care as part of the Child and Family Services Improvement Act of 2006. The oversight of psychotropic medication use for children in foster care was briefly discussed at a 2007 congressional hearing on health care oversight for children in foster care. In 2008, Congress expanded requirements for states to consult with medical professionals on the health and well-being of children in foster care. States must develop a coordinated strategy and oversight plan to ensure access to health care, including mental health services, for each child in foster care. The law also directed states to oversee drugs prescribed to children in foster care. In 2011, the Child and Family Services Improvement and Innovation Act amended provisions for children in foster care, requiring a coordinated strategy with protocols for psychotropic medication use. A Senate hearing in December 2011 focused on a study by the Government Accountability Office, which reviewed state policies on prescribing psychotropic medications for foster children. The study compared state policies against best practice guidelines developed by the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) developed guidelines for oversight of psychotropic medications for children in foster care, with support from HHS's SAMHSA. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that six state programs lacked comprehensive oversight, with only Texas fully implementing consent procedures. GAO recommended that HHS endorse guidance for monitoring psychotropic medications in foster care. Witnesses at a hearing discussed the role of HHS and state Medicaid programs in improving cooperation and communication for oversight of psychotropic medications. A former foster youth shared his experience with multiple mental health diagnoses and side effects from medications while in care. The Senate Finance Committee also held a roundtable to address issues with psychotropic medication use in foster care. At a roundtable, current and former foster youth shared their experiences with psychotropic medication, noting that therapy helped them transition from medications. The importance of an invested caregiver or knowledgeable professional in mental health treatment was highlighted. Child welfare stakeholders discussed the prevalence of psychotropic medication use among youth and the role of the federal government in promoting alternatives. Tools for determining medication necessity and the roles of schools, mental health systems, and foster parents in decision-making were also discussed. The House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources held a hearing in May 2014 on the use of psychotropic medications among children in foster care. Witnesses included officials from HHS, GAO, a researcher, and Dr. Phil McGraw. GAO focused on their work from 2011 to 2014 related to psychotropic medication prescription among children in care. The GAO contracted child psychiatrists to examine documentation supporting the use of psychotropics in a sample of 24 children in care. Varying quality was found in the documentation, particularly in dosage amounts and concurrent use of multiple medications. GAO recommended HHS issue guidance to states regarding oversight of medication for children in foster care. The GAO found varying quality in documentation supporting psychotropic medication use for children in foster care. State agencies developed practices to support mental health diagnoses and treatment, including guidelines on prescribing medications and promoting psychosocial services. However, HHS guidance did not address the role of third-party MCOs in oversight of psychotropic use among foster children. State officials in seven states reported critical factors in implementing oversight work on prescribing psychotropic medications and promoting psychosocial services. These factors included strong collaboration among child welfare, Medicaid, or other partnering agencies, state outreach to stakeholders, and gradual rollout of new practices. GAO did not assess the effectiveness of state practices or compliance with policies. State officials use various measures to gauge results, such as physician prescribing practices, state oversight practices, and monitoring child outcomes. The GAO recommended that HHS convene state stakeholders to collaborate on psychotropic medication oversight. HHS has implemented federal requirements for monitoring psychotropic medication use and various federal agencies are working to understand its use among children in foster care. The Obama Administration proposed expanding funding for oversight of psychotropic medications for children, especially those in foster care. States must develop a coordinated strategy and oversight plan to ensure access to healthcare, including mental health services, for children in foster care. The coordinated strategy for oversight of psychotropic medications for children in foster care must be developed collaboratively by the state child welfare agency and the state Medicaid agency, in consultation with health care experts. It should include a schedule for health screenings, monitoring and treatment of health needs, updating and sharing medical information, ensuring continuity of care, and oversight of prescription medicines. The oversight of prescription medicines for children in foster care includes protocols for appropriate use and monitoring of psychotropic medications. The state consults with medical professionals to assess and treat the health needs of children in care. Transition plans for children aging out of foster care must address their healthcare needs. Federal law mandates written plans for each child in care, including health-related records like immunizations and medication information. The oversight of psychotropic medications for children in foster care includes reviewing, updating, and providing health records to foster care parents or providers. States report their policies on medication oversight through the Child and Family Services Plan and Annual Progress and Services Reports. This reporting is required for jurisdictions seeking federal funds under various child welfare programs. The APSR instructions following the 2011 law require state oversight protocols to address mental health needs identification, treatment consent, medication monitoring, mental health expertise availability, and information sharing mechanisms. The most recent CFSP for FY2015-FY2019 focuses on oversight of prescription medicines, including protocols for psychotropic medications. HHS convened a working group in 2011 to address psychotropic medication use among foster care children. The working group led by the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) developed a plan to expand evidence-based screening, diagnosis, and interventions for children in foster care. It aims to strengthen oversight of psychotropic medications and expand research on medications and psychosocial treatments. The group includes representatives from HHS agencies like CMS and SAMHSA. SAMHSA administers block grant funding to support non-Medicaid covered treatment services for children with complex trauma needs. In November 2011, ACF, SAMHSA, and CMS released a letter addressing effective management of prescription medication use for children in foster care. State Medicaid/CHIP agencies and mental health authorities play a significant role in providing quality mental health services for children in out-of-home care. State child welfare, Medicaid, and mental health authorities must collaborate to improve health, including medication use and prescription monitoring for children in foster care. ACF, SAMHSA, and CMS provided guidance through webinars and information memoranda on oversight of psychotropic medication use among children in foster care. In March through June 2012, state child welfare and mental health leaders participated in question and answer sessions to enhance oversight and monitoring. In August 2012, HHS convened state directors to address the use of psychotropic medications for children in foster care and mental health needs. The summit aimed to improve collaboration on medication use, oversight, and implementation of changes. States outlined activities, challenges, partners, and timelines for implementation. In April 2012, ACF provided guidance to state child welfare agencies on monitoring the use of psychotropic medication, emphasizing coordinated planning, shared decision-making, medication monitoring, mental health expertise, and information sharing. This followed the \"Because Minds Matter\" summit where HHS staff and state teams discussed psychotropic oversight. ACF issued guidance in April 2012 to state child welfare agencies on improving outcomes for children who have experienced abuse or neglect, focusing on brain development and social-emotional impacts. They also published guides on medication questions for youth in foster care and mental health issues for child welfare staff and foster parents. ACF awarded FY2012 funds to nine entities for these initiatives. ACF awarded FY2012 funds to nine entities to support projects for youth in child welfare with mental and behavioral health needs using evidence-based intervention models. FY2013 funds were awarded to six entities to promote well-being after trauma. SAMHSA provided funding to AACAP for guidelines on prescribing medications for children and youth. SAMHSA also funds a medical director position at the University of Maryland's School of Social Work. The University of Maryland's School of Social Work has a medical director who collaborates with child and adolescent psychiatrists in state and county governments to address issues related to psychotropic medications. The network utilizes a community listerv and webinars to disseminate best practices, including for children on Medicaid. States are required to have Drug Utilization Review programs in place to oversee the prescribing of drugs for Medicaid beneficiaries, with examples provided on how some states have used this review for oversight of psychotropic medication use. In 2015, CMS assisted state Medicaid agencies in improving the appropriate use of antipsychotic medications for children on Medicaid. CMS also added a new measure to core measures for states to voluntarily use in improving healthcare delivery to children on Medicaid. The guidance issued in July 2013 emphasized the importance of providing psychosocial interventions to children who have experienced \"complex trauma\" and highlighted how states can utilize existing federal funding to offer these interventions. It also addressed the overprescription of psychotropic medication to children in foster care due to the complexity of their symptoms and lack of proper screening and treatment. The guidance recommended the use of functional assessments and trauma screening for better evaluation and care. President Obama's FY2017 budget proposed a five-year joint initiative between CMS and ACF to reduce reliance on psychotropic medications for children in foster care and improve their well-being through performance-based incentive payments to state Medicaid agencies. This initiative aims to enhance care coordination and deliver evidence-based psychosocial interventions to children in foster care. The initiative aims to improve care coordination and deliver evidence-based psychosocial interventions to Medicaid-eligible children in foster care. Incentive payments would be provided annually over a five-year period, with additional grant funding available for states to build capacity for alternative interventions. ACF would support child welfare agencies in implementing and evaluating these interventions. Researchers have surveyed states to understand their policies on overseeing psychotropic medication use for children in foster care, including challenges and solutions identified. Information was collected from 48 states in 2009 and 2010, but none of the surveys addressed how states have responded to the federal provision added in September 2011. Researchers collected information from 48 states on psychotropic medication use for children in foster care. Over half of the states rated it as a high concern, with some having written policies in place. About half of the states used \"red flag\" markers to identify issues with medication use. Researchers found that various approaches were being used in states regarding psychotropic medication use for children in foster care, including the use of multiple medications and dosages exceeding recommendations. However, there was little systematic implementation or study of these approaches to determine their effectiveness in improving outcomes. Concerns have also been raised about the availability of policies and procedures to oversee psychotropic drug use in this population. States have made efforts to address oversight of psychotropic medication use among children in foster care, with some policies being underdeveloped. Collaborative initiatives, such as the Psychotropic Medication Quality Improvement Collaborative, have been implemented to improve oversight. In 2015, the Psychotropic Medication Quality Improvement Collaborative was formed by representatives from state child welfare, mental health, and Medicaid agencies to define common terms and measures for psychotropic medication use among foster youth. They developed best practices for oversight and monitoring, with states implementing protocols for gaining consent, obtaining real-time data, reviewing \"red flags,\" and tailoring monitoring processes to local needs. The Center for Health Care Strategies, with support from SAMSHA, is providing technical assistance to states on oversight of psychotropic medications. The National Survey of Child and Adolescent Wellbeing (NSCAW) II examined psychotropic medication use among children investigated for abuse or neglect. Data was collected at baseline in 2008-2009 and follow-up surveys were conducted at 18 and 36 months post-investigation. The National Survey of Child and Adolescent Wellbeing (NSCAW) II investigated psychotropic medication use among children involved in abuse or neglect cases. Data was collected at baseline in 2008-2009, with follow-up surveys at 18 and 36 months post-investigation. The analysis compared medication use between children in foster care and those not in foster care, showing no statistically significant differences overall or by specific age group. Children in foster care were more likely to be using psychotropic medications at the 18-month and 36-month follow-up, with statistically significant differences shown. For children under age 6, no statistical significance was found in medication use between foster care and in-home groups. Children ages 6 to 10 showed significant differences at the 18-month follow-up but not at the initial survey or 36-month follow-up. Children ages 11 through 17 had no significant differences at the initial survey, but significant differences were found at the 18-month and 36-month follow-up."
