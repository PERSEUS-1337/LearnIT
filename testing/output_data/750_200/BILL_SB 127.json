    "title": "SB 127",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature acknowledges that many areas in California are disproportionately affected by drought due to heavy reliance on overdrafted or contaminated groundwater basins. There are state grant and loan programs to help communities with water needs, but individual homeowners with groundwater wells lack similar assistance for vital water improvements. The program created by this act aims to provide low-interest loans, grants, or both to individual homeowners for safer, cleaner, and more reliable drinking water and wastewater treatment. Actions may include digging deeper wells, improving existing wells, addressing water contaminants, or connecting to a local water system. Chapter 6.6 of the Water Code establishes a Water and Wastewater Loan and Grant Program to provide low-interest loans and grants to local agencies for various purposes such as extending service lines, connecting to water systems, and closing abandoned septic tanks and water wells for health and safety reasons. The Water and Wastewater Loan and Grant Program under Chapter 6.6 of the Water Code covers costs for closing abandoned septic tanks and water wells, deepening or improving groundwater wells, and installing water treatment systems if needed to meet drinking standards. The board has the authority to adopt regulations necessary for program implementation. The Water and Wastewater Loan and Grant Fund is established in the State Treasury for expenditure by the board in accordance with Chapter 6.6 of the Water Code. Eligible loan applicants must meet specific criteria. An eligible applicant for a loan from the Water and Wastewater Loan and Grant Fund must have a household income below the statewide median, own the residence, be unable to obtain financial assistance from private lenders, and demonstrate an ability to repay the loan. To qualify for a loan from the Water and Wastewater Loan and Grant Fund, applicants must have a household income below the statewide median, own the residence, and show the ability to repay the loan. The loan must be secured by a mortgage on the residence, repaid within 20 years at a 1 percent interest rate, and maintain homeowner's insurance on the property. The board may contract with a private financial institution to provide loans under certain criteria. Eligible applicants must have a household income below 60% of the statewide median, own the residence, and be unable to obtain financial assistance from private lenders. SEC. 3. Ten million dollars ($10,000,000) is transferred from the General Fund to the Water and Wastewater Loan and Grant Fund. SEC. 4. A grant recipient must repay the full amount if they sell the residence within five years of signing the agreement or return any unused funds to the board. Ten million dollars is transferred from the General Fund to the Water and Wastewater Loan and Grant Fund to provide eligible households with access to safer, cleaner, and more reliable drinking water and wastewater treatment during California's prolonged drought. This act is an urgency statute necessary for the immediate preservation of public peace, health, or safety. Section 21168.6.7 of the Public Resources Code defines a \"water project\" as one funded by bonds from the Water Quality, Supply and Infrastructure Improvement Act of 2014. The procedures outlined in subdivision (c) apply to legal actions challenging the certification of environmental impact reports or approvals for water projects. The Judicial Council must establish procedures for resolving legal actions challenging the certification of environmental impact reports for water projects within 270 days.

The court may stay construction of a water project if it poses a threat to public health and safety or if it impacts important Native American artifacts, historical, archaeological, or ecological values. The court may enjoin specific activities of a water project that pose a threat to public health, safety, or important cultural and ecological values.
