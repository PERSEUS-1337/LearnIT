In 2016, foreign direct investment (FDI) in the United States increased by $876 billion at market value, reaching a total cumulative FDI position of $7.4 trillion.

The United States addresses these concerns through a multiagency process for reviewing foreign acquisitions of U.S. firms. The United States addresses national security concerns related to foreign acquisitions through the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which reviews transactions to determine threats to national security, foreign government control, and critical infrastructure control. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) reviews foreign investment transactions that could threaten national security, foreign government control, or critical infrastructure. The President can block transactions that pose a risk to national security. The CFIUS process is voluntary but firms risk future review and possible divestiture if they do not notify CFIUS. In a 2016 report to Congress, CFIUS stated that 42% of notified foreign investment transactions from 2008 to 2014 were in manufacturing.

According to the OECD, 22% of the world's largest firms are now effectively under state control, raising concerns about preferential treatment given to state-owned enterprises that may create anticompetitive effects in the global marketplace. This could provide firms with market protection and access to below-market financing, giving them a competitive advantage over other market-driven firms. Some policymakers are concerned that state-owned enterprises (SOEs) may engage in foreign investment activities compromising national security objectives, blurring the line between commercial firms and those operating for a foreign government's public policy goals.

They also have larger plant sizes, pay higher wages, have higher productivity and output per worker, and display higher capital intensity. Foreign-owned manufacturing plants in the US have 58% greater output per worker compared to U.S.-owned plants. These differences should be viewed with caution due to varying sizes and additional factors. Foreign firms investing in the United States are typically large with proven technologies, opting for larger-scale and higher-capital-intensity plants to offset risks and generate higher profits.

Concerns in the 1980s arose from potential job losses due to mergers and acquisitions, regardless of the acquiring company's origin. These concerns are balanced by perceived benefits of capital inflow and job creation. Opposition to foreign direct investment also stems from worries about its impact on U.S. economic and national security interests, especially post-9/11. Certain foreign investments have raised national security concerns. Foreign direct investment in the U.S. continues to grow despite national security concerns post-9/11. The U.S. economy remains a top choice for foreign investors, with the potential for increased investments as the nation's economic growth outpaces foreign economies."
