    "content": "Eligibility for health benefits under CHIP is available to different groups through various federal authorities and mechanisms, including children, pregnant women, parents, and childless adults. Title XXI defines a targeted low-income child as someone under 19 without health insurance and not eligible for Medicaid before March 31, 1997. States can set the income level for these children up to 200% of the federal poverty level. CHIPRA allows states to expand eligibility for children up to 19 years old to any level they choose. For states seeking CMS approval to expand eligibility, federal CHIP payments are reduced for higher-income children. The regular Medicaid FMAP will be used for CHIP enrollees with family income exceeding 300% of poverty. States can expand eligibility for children up to 19 years old under CHIPRA. Federal CHIP payments are reduced for higher-income children, using the regular Medicaid FMAP for CHIP enrollees with family income over 300% of poverty. States may assist qualifying children by covering them under Medicaid or creating a separate CHIP program. When states provide coverage to low-income children through separate CHIP programs, Title XXI rules typically apply, with federal CHIP funds covering program costs. Title XXI does not establish individual entitlement to benefits but entitles states with approved CHIP plans to federal allotments based on a distribution formula. Title XXI does not establish individual entitlement to benefits for low-income children covered under separate CHIP programs. States can cover these children by expanding Medicaid programs through new eligibility groups authorized in Title XXI. States can expand coverage for low-income children under Medicaid programs by either creating a new optional eligibility group authorized in Title XXI or by adjusting the financial rules for existing Medicaid eligibility categories. Many states opt for the latter option to cover targeted low-income children under existing Medicaid pathways, reducing administrative burden. Additionally, states may choose to provide coverage for these children through a separate CHIP program. States can reduce administrative burden by creating a separate CHIP program to provide coverage for targeted low-income children. Title XXI allows states to determine eligibility based on factors such as geography, age, income, resources, residency, disability status, access to other health insurance, and duration of CHIP. Prior to CHIPRA, states could cover adult pregnant women through Section 1115 waivers, CHIP state plan amendments, or a family coverage option in a group health plan. States have the option to offer pregnancy-related services to adult pregnant women through CHIP state plan amendments or a family coverage option in a group health plan. As of October 2007, 17 states provided these services, with 6 using \u00a71115 waivers and 12 extending coverage to unborn children through SPAs. Most states included coverage for unborn children of undocumented aliens. In FY2008, 364,161 unborn children were enrolled in CHIP, with nearly half in California. CHIPRA added a new state option to cover pregnant women under CHIP through a state plan amendment, with certain conditions to be met by states. States must meet specific conditions to cover pregnant women under CHIP, including income standards, no pre-existing conditions or waiting periods, and coverage from pregnancy through the postpartum period. Other eligibility restrictions for CHIP children also apply. Pregnant women can be temporarily enrolled in CHIP for up to two months under presumptive eligibility. Benefits include prenatal, delivery, and postpartum care, with infants covered until age one. States may continue coverage through waivers and unborn child regulation. CHIPRA allows states to cover pregnant women through waivers and the unborn child regulation. Legal immigrants arriving in the US after August 22, 1996, were ineligible for Medicaid or CHIP benefits for five years, but coverage was permitted at state option after the five-year bar. The law requires sponsor's income and resources for legal immigrants. The law requires sponsors' income and resources for legal immigrants to be taken into account for eligibility in federally means-tested programs like Medicaid and TANF. CHIPRA allows states to waive the five-year bar for Medicaid or CHIP coverage for pregnant women and children who are lawfully residing in the United States. The CHIPRA law allows states to waive the five-year bar for Medicaid or CHIP coverage for pregnant women and children who are lawfully residing in the United States. States that elect to extend coverage must ensure that the cost of care will not be deemed against an individual's sponsor. Additionally, states must redetermine eligibility at least every 12 months. Under the CHIPRA law, states can waive the five-year bar for Medicaid or CHIP coverage for pregnant women and children who are lawfully residing in the United States. States must ensure that the cost of care will not be deemed against an individual's sponsor. Eligibility must be redetermined at least every 12 months. Additionally, individuals eligible under this provision must provide further documentation if their initial legal residence documentation is no longer valid. The Security Act grants the Secretary of HHS authority to modify CHIP programs, including expanding eligibility to populations not typically covered. Some states have covered adults with CHIP funds through waivers, initially effective for five years and subject to renewal every three years. Waiver renewals were approved even for states facing federal CHIP shortfalls before 2007. Since 2007, waiver renewals for states with adult coverage waivers have not been approved or states have started transitioning adult populations out of CHIP coverage. As of January 7, 2009, some states have CMS authority to use CHIP funds to extend coverage to childless adult and parent populations. CHIPRA will end coverage for nonpregnant childless adults by the end of 2009. CHIPRA terminates CHIP coverage of nonpregnant childless adults by the end of 2009. States with existing waivers can apply for Medicaid waivers to continue coverage for childless adults, tied to budget neutrality standards. Coverage of parents is permitted for states with CHIP parent coverage waivers in effect during FY2009. Under CHIPRA, coverage of parents is allowed for states with CHIP parent coverage waivers from FY2009. Starting in FY2012, spending under the waivers will be subject to a set-aside amount and matched at the state's regular Medicaid FMAP unless certain coverage benchmarks are met. In FY2013, states meeting the benchmarks will receive an amount between the regular and enhanced FMAPs for parent coverage. CHIPRA prohibits waiver spending for parents with family income exceeding eligibility thresholds set in 2009. It also authorizes $100 million for outreach and enrollment grants, with allocations for a national campaign and Native American children. CHIPRA authorizes $100 million for outreach and enrollment grants for fiscal years 2009 through 2013. 10% allocated to a national campaign, 10% for Native American children, and 80% for state, local governments, and community-based organizations for outreach in rural areas and underserved populations. Grant funds target proposals addressing cultural and linguistic barriers to enrollment. State plans must describe procedures to reduce administrative barriers for Medicaid and CHIP enrollment. CHIPRA requires state plans to reduce administrative barriers for Medicaid and CHIP enrollment. It allows states to use findings from \"Express Lane\" agencies to determine eligibility for children. States have the option to use Express Lane agencies for Medicaid and CHIP enrollment, allowing automatic enrollment based on family consent and reported income from state tax records. The provision under CHIPRA allows states to use an applicant's reported income from state tax records for Medicaid eligibility. CHIPRA also eliminates the need for signatures on Medicaid or CHIP applications under penalty of perjury. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 required proof of citizenship and identity for Medicaid applicants claiming to be citizens. Before the Deficit Reduction Act (DRA), states could accept self-declaration of citizenship for Medicaid, but now proof of citizenship and identity is required. CHIPRA allows states to use Social Security Numbers verified by the SSA for Medicaid eligibility and adds a citizenship documentation requirement for CHIP. CHIPRA adds a citizenship documentation requirement for CHIP, with the highest state-reported upper income eligibility limit for children in New Jersey at 350% of the FPL. Many states have CHIP coverage above 250% FPL, with varying income thresholds across different states. In FY2008, CHIP enrollment reached nearly 7.4 million children, with 5.3 million covered in separate state programs and 2.1 million under Medicaid. Waiver authority has been used to expand coverage for adults, with 12 states reporting enrollment of about 335,000 adults in CHIP. In FY2008, 12 states reported enrollment of about 335,000 adults in CHIP, with most being parents. The number of CHIP-enrolled adults decreased from FY2006 and FY2007 due to changes in adult-coverage waivers. Michigan, New Mexico, and Minnesota had more adult CHIP enrollees than children. In FY2008, Michigan, New Mexico, and Minnesota reported more adult CHIP enrollees than children. States may cover low-income children under Medicaid or create a separate CHIP program. Medicaid-expansion CHIP programs must provide mandatory Medicaid benefits and optional services. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 gave states the option to provide selected benefits under traditional Medicaid. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 allowed states to enroll specified groups, including children in CHIP-financed Medicaid expansions, in new benchmark benefit plans. These plans are similar to CHIP programs and must provide benefits through the EPSDT Program for children under 21 in Medicaid eligibility groups. The EPSDT Program provides benefits for low-income children, including well-child care, immunizations, and other screening services. States can choose from three benefit options for separate CHIP programs. CHIP programs can choose from three benefit options: benchmark benefit package, benchmark equivalent coverage, or any other health benefits plan approved by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Benchmark benefit package includes plans like Blue Cross/Blue Shield, state employee health coverage, or HMO coverage. Benchmark-equivalent coverage is a package of benefits with the same actuarial value as the benchmark benefit packages, including inpatient and outpatient hospital services, physicians' services, lab and x-ray services, and well-baby care. Benchmark-equivalent coverage must include key services such as inpatient and outpatient hospital services, physicians' surgical and medical services, lab and x-ray services, well-baby and well-child care with immunizations. Additional services like prescription drugs, vision, and hearing services should also be covered. States are encouraged to cover other services as well, but abortions are only allowed in specific circumstances. Abortions may not be covered under CHIP, except in cases of rape, incest, or to save the mother's life. All 50 states, DC, and five territories have CHIP programs with different approaches. CHIPRA made changes to mental health and substance abuse coverage under CHIP. The CHIPRA law made changes to mental health and substance abuse coverage under CHIP, ensuring that financial requirements and treatment limitations for these benefits are no more restrictive than those for medical and surgical benefits. The CHIPRA law requires mental health and substance abuse benefits under CHIP to have financial requirements and treatment limitations no more restrictive than those for medical and surgical benefits. Dental services are now a mandatory benefit under separate CHIP programs, including preventive and restorative care. The CHIPRA law mandates dental services as a required benefit under separate CHIP programs, including preventive care, restorative treatment, and emergency services. States have the option to offer dental services through benchmark dental benefit packages modeled after existing medical plans. Additionally, the law includes provisions for dental education for parents of newborns and services through federally qualified health centers. The CHIPRA law mandates dental services as a required benefit under separate CHIP programs, including preventive care, restorative treatment, and emergency services. States have the option to offer dental services through benchmark dental benefit packages. The new law also includes provisions for dental education for parents of newborns and services through federally qualified health centers. States must report detailed information on children's dental care in their annual reports for EPSDT reporting purposes. GAO will conduct a study on children's access to dental care under Medicaid and CHIP, with recommendations for addressing barriers to dental care. The study focuses on children's access to dental care under Medicaid and CHIP, with recommendations for federal and state actions to address barriers. It also explores the use of mid-level providers to improve access. CHIPRA allowed for dental-only supplemental coverage for children in employer-sponsored plans who meet CHIP eligibility criteria. CHIP programs can provide dental-only supplemental coverage to children in group or employer plans who meet CHIP eligibility criteria. States can offer dental coverage based on new benchmark benefits or cost-sharing protections. States must have implemented the highest income eligibility by January 1, 2009, to offer this coverage. States must meet specific criteria to offer dental-only supplemental coverage to children under CHIP, including implementing the highest income eligibility by January 1, 2009, not limiting acceptance of applications or imposing enrollment caps, and providing benefits to all eligible children. Additionally, states cannot provide more favorable dental coverage for children with supplemental coverage than for those eligible for the full range of CHIP benefits. States can offer dental-only supplemental coverage to CHIP children without an eligibility waiting period. Previously, states could pay for group health insurance costs if it was cost-effective and did not replace existing coverage for low-income children. Under Medicaid and CHIP, states can provide premium assistance for employer-based plans as long as certain criteria are met, such as ensuring CHIP minimum benefits, cost-sharing ceilings, and a waiting period without group coverage. Enrollment in an employer plan is considered cost-effective if it covers premiums, deductibles, and other expenses. To be cost-effective under Medicaid, enrollment in an employer plan must be cheaper than the state providing Medicaid-covered services directly. States must offer \"wrap-around\" benefits for services not covered by private plans, but meeting all requirements can be challenging for many plans and states. Most states with CHIP or Medicaid premium assistance programs operate under these restrictions. Most states operate CHIP or Medicaid premium assistance programs under waivers due to cost restrictions. CHIPRA created a new state plan option for providing premium assistance, including outreach and enrollment assistance for eligible families. States can offer premium assistance for Medicaid and CHIP-eligible children and parents with access to employer-sponsored insurance. Under CHIPRA, states can offer premium assistance for Medicaid and CHIP-eligible children and parents with access to employer-sponsored insurance. If the employer pays at least 40% of the total premium and the coverage is offered in a nondiscriminatory way, the employer's group health plan qualifies as \"creditable coverage.\" Individuals eligible for CHIP and employment-based coverage can choose to enroll in regular CHIP rather than the premium assistance program. Enrollees eligible for CHIP and employer-sponsored coverage can opt for regular CHIP over premium assistance. The subsidy covers the difference in out-of-pocket premiums for the child. Wrap-around coverage is required for employer plans not meeting CHIP benefits. No cost-effectiveness test is needed for child coverage with premium assistance. Family coverage has a separate cost evaluation under CHIPRA. CHIPRA allows for premium assistance to cover the entire family's share of the premium if it is more cost-effective than regular CHIP coverage for the eligible individual(s). States offering premium assistance must conduct outreach, and can establish purchasing pools for small employers with CHIP-eligible employees. CHIPRA allows for premium assistance through an employer-family purchasing pool for small employers with CHIP-eligible individuals. The law streamlines coordination between public and private coverage, making loss of Medicaid/CHIP eligibility a \"qualifying event\" for purchasing employer-sponsored coverage. The provision in CHIPRA allows for premium assistance through an employer-family purchasing pool for small employers with CHIP-eligible individuals. It also requires health plan administrators to disclose information about their benefit packages to states upon request for evaluation of wraparound coverage. Cost-sharing in health insurance plans includes out-of-pocket payments like premiums, deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance. States can impose cost-sharing for some beneficiaries and services under CHIP, following nominal cost-sharing rules for targeted low-income children under Medicaid. States can impose cost-sharing for some beneficiaries and services under CHIP, following nominal cost-sharing rules for targeted low-income children under Medicaid. Children in families with income under 100% FPL are not allowed to have premiums and have limited service-related cost-sharing. CHIP Medicaid-expansion programs have different cost-sharing rules based on family income levels. For children in families with income under 100% FPL, no premiums are allowed and limited service-related cost-sharing. For those with income between 100%-150% FPL, no premiums but up to 10% cost-sharing. Families above 150% FPL can have premiums and up to 20% cost-sharing. Total cost-sharing cannot exceed 5% of family income. The Deficit Reduction Act (DRA) sets limits on cost-sharing for Medicaid recipients based on family income. Preventive services for children are exempt from cost-sharing. Cost-sharing amounts will be adjusted for inflation. Special rules apply to prescription drugs and emergency room copayments. States can require payment of premiums for Medicaid eligibility. Providers may deny care for non-payment of cost-sharing. Providers may deny care for failure to pay service-related cost-sharing. States implementing CHIP through separate programs may impose premiums or enrollment fees, capped based on family income. Families under 150% FPL in separate state programs have premium limits set by federal Medicaid regulations. Service-related cost-sharing is limited for families below 100% FPL and slightly higher for CHIP regulations. Cost-sharing in CHIP is limited based on income levels, with nominal amounts for those below 100% FPL and slightly higher amounts for families between 100%-150% FPL. Families above 150% FPL may face cost-sharing, but it must not be less than lower-income families and is capped at 5% of family income. States must inform families of these limits and provide a way to stop payments once reached. Preventive services are exempt from cost-sharing for all CHIP families. Preventive services exempt from cost-sharing for all CHIP families, including newborn visits, physical exams, lab tests, immunizations, dental services. CHIPRA 2009 aimed to expand and improve data collection and reporting for CHIP and Medicaid, including developing child health quality measures and standardized reporting formats. Reporting requirements were added to states' annual CHIP reports to encourage voluntary reporting on pediatric care quality. CHIPRA 2009 expanded reporting requirements for states under CHIP and Medicaid to include data on eligibility criteria, access to care, and premium assistance. A study on children's access to primary and specialty care will be conducted by GAO. The establishment of MACPAC will review policies impacting children's benefits, such as payment policies and quality of care. The establishment of MACPAC will review policies affecting children's benefits under Medicaid and CHIP, including payment policies and quality of care. Regular reports to Congress will detail findings and provide recommendations for improving access and quality of care for children. Additionally, CHIPRA mandated a federal evaluation of 10 states with approved CHIP plans to assess different approaches to coverage and uninsured children. The federal evaluation of CHIP will assess various states' approaches to coverage and uninsured children, focusing on outreach strategies, cost-sharing effects, disenrollment, and retention factors. Federal financing includes appropriations for states' CHIP allotments and reallocation of unspent funds. The federal evaluation of CHIP will assess states' approaches to coverage and uninsured children, focusing on outreach strategies, cost-sharing effects, disenrollment, and retention factors. BBA 97 appropriated approximately $40 billion for CHIP allotments for FY1998 to FY2007, with funding levels varying annually. Total annual appropriations ranged from a little over $4.2 billion for FY1998-FY2001 to under $3.2 billion for FY2002-FY2004, increasing to about $4.1 billion for FY2005 and FY2006. The annual total funding for CHIP varied, starting at over $4.2 billion for FY1998-FY2001, dropping to under $3.2 billion for FY2002-FY2004, then increasing to about $4.1 billion for FY2005 and FY2006, and further rising to roughly $5.0 billion in FY2007. The \"CHIP dip\" in funding was due to budget constraints. The 110th Congress attempted to reauthorize CHIP with bills H.R. 976 and H.R. 3963, both vetoed by President George W. Bush. The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007 appropriated funds for CHIP allotments for FY2008 and FY2009, with additional funds allocated due to projected shortfalls in certain states. CHIPRA provided a national appropriation of $68.9 billion for CHIP allotments from FY2009 to FY2013. CHIPRA provided a national appropriation of $68.9 billion for CHIP allotments from FY2009 to FY2013, with annual allotments ranging from $10.562 billion in FY2009 to $17.406 billion in FY2013. The allotment of funds among states is determined by a formula set in law, with territories receiving 0.25% prior to CHIPRA. The territories received 0.25% of the national appropriation under CHIPRA, with the remainder divided among states based on a formula using survey estimates of low-income children. Allotments were adjusted by a geographic factor and limited to ensure consistency with past allotments. The state's CHIP allotment is now calculated based on national appropriation and state survey estimates. Allotments are separate funding accounts available for a certain period, with FY2009 and onwards allotments only available for two years. Payments are typically taken from the earliest active account. The CHIP allotments for FY2009 and after will only be available for two years. Payments are taken from the earliest active account, and once fully expended, the state can draw from the next available allotment. FY2009 federal CHIP allotments are based on state-specific amounts and will be increased by 10%. The FY2009 federal CHIP allotment for states will be the largest of three amounts submitted to HHS, increased by 10%. For FY2010, the allotment will be calculated based on specific factors and growth rates. The FY2009 CHIP allotment for states will be adjusted by growth factors, including unspent FY2006 funds, spending in FY2009, and Contingency Fund payments. FY2011 and FY2013 allotments will be \"rebased\" on prior year spending, while FY2012 allotments will be based on FY2011 spending and Contingency Fund payments. For FY2012, a state's CHIP allotment is calculated based on the prior year's spending and growth factor. Unspent funds are redistributed to other states after a certain period. BBA 97 specified rules for fund redistribution, with inadequate funds available for 12 states in FY2006. In FY2006, Congress appropriated $283 million to cover projected shortfalls in 12 states for the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). Illinois and Massachusetts had higher CHIP spending than anticipated, resulting in shortfalls of approximately $100 million, mostly from Illinois. In FY2007, $147 million in unspent funds from FY2004 was available for redistribution, with a bill passed in the closing hours of the 109th Congress to specify how the funds would be redistributed. The National Institutes of Health Reform Act of 2006 (H.R. 6164, P.L. 109-482, NIHRA) required that unspent funds from FY2004 be redistributed to states facing funding shortfalls for fiscal year 2007, aiming to delay shortfalls until the end of March 2007. The CHIP provisions of NIHRA allowed for an initial redistribution of up to half of the unspent funds. The NIH Reform Act of 2006 aimed to delay funding shortfalls for states until March 2007 by redistributing unspent funds from FY2004. The CHIP provisions allowed for up to half of the unspent funds to be redistributed, capped at $20 million per state. States had to meet specific criteria to forgo unspent funds, resulting in an additional $138 million for shortfall states. In FY2007, the state projected to spend federal CHIP funds, providing an additional $138 million for shortfall states. P.L. 110-28 appropriated up to $650 million to cover shortfalls in 10 states for the remainder of the fiscal year. Cumulative federal CHIP financing from 1998 to FY2007 is shown in Table 2. In FY2007, additional funds were provided to cover shortfalls in 10 states, with a total of $138 million allocated. For FY2008, unspent FY2005 allotments were redistributed to states with shortfalls, along with an appropriation of up to $1.6 billion. Actual shortfall funding in FY2008 was just under $1 billion. In FY2009, unspent FY2006 allotments were redistributed to states projected to face shortfalls before March 31, 2009. In FY2009, MMSEA redistributed unspent FY2006 allotments to states facing shortfalls before March 31, 2009. CHIPRA increased FY2009 allotments to prevent federal funding shortfalls. Any remaining unspent funds would be redistributed to shortfall states or used for bonus payments. The Child Enrollment Contingency Fund was created as part of CHIPRA to prevent states from facing federal funding shortfalls. It receives a separate appropriation and can provide direct payments to shortfall states for CHIP children above a target enrollment level, not exceeding 20% of the national allotment amount. Payments are to be reduced proportionally if necessary. The Child Enrollment Contingency Fund was established to prevent federal funding shortfalls for CHIP children above a target enrollment level. Payments from the fund cannot exceed 20% of the national allotment amount and are subject to proportional reduction if needed. CHIP operates as a federal-state matching program, with the federal government matching state spending. The enhanced FMAP for CHIP lowers a state's share of expenditures by 30% compared to the regular FMAP. The enhanced FMAP for CHIP reduces a state's share of expenditures by 30% compared to the regular FMAP. The enhanced FMAP ranges from 65% to 83.09% for CHIP, with a ceiling of 85% and a floor of 65%. All CHIP assistance for low-income children is eligible for the enhanced FMAP. The enhanced CHIP FMAP has a ceiling of 83% and 85%, and a floor of 50% and 65%. There is a limit on federal spending for CHIP administrative expenses, with a 10% cap on state non-benefit expenses. This cap is tied to the dollar amount that a state draws down from its annual allotment for CHIP benefit and non-benefit expenditures combined. Under CHIPRA, states can receive federal CHIP bonus payments by increasing Medicaid child enrollment and implementing specific outreach activities. The funding for these payments comes from an initial $3.225 billion appropriation in FY2009 and unspent national allotment amounts."
