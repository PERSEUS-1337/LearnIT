The tragedy of January 8, 2011, at Congresswoman Gabrielle Gifford's ``Congress on Your Corner'' event resulted in the deaths of 6 people and injury of 13 others. This was the first time in the history of the United States. The assassination attempt on Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords during a meeting with constituents resulted in severe injuries to her and the death of 6 people, including Congressional staffer Gabe Zimmerman. The Arizona community and people worldwide came together to provide support in the aftermath of the tragedy. The world united in support after the tragedy, gathering at three memorial sites in Tucson - the shooting location, the hospital where victims were treated, and Congresswoman Giffords' office. The January 8th Memorial will honor the victims and the response to the tragedy on a local, national, and international level. The January 8th Memorial will pay tribute to those who died in the tragedy and also commemorate the local, national, and international response. It will serve as a place for visitors to learn about the resilience of the community and the durability of democracy in the United States. The January 8th National Memorial will honor those who perished in the tragedy and celebrate the community's resilience and democracy in the United States. The January 8th National Memorial, established by the Tucson's January 8th Memorial Foundation, is defined by specific terms including \"Memorial,\" \"Foundation,\" \"Map,\" and \"Secretary.\" The Secretary of the Interior will establish the January 8th National Memorial as an affiliated area of the National Park System once the Foundation complies with requirements. The Memorial cannot be established until the Secretary certifies in a written report to the House of Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. The Foundation has established a trust fund for receiving donations and managing the construction, operation, and maintenance of the Memorial. The Memorial will consist of the area depicted as the \"Memorial Boundary\" on the map, with the Foundation being the management entity for the Memorial. The Foundation is responsible for managing the Memorial, including construction, operation, maintenance, and management. If the Foundation fails to comply with laws or maintain the trust fund, the Memorial may no longer be affiliated with the National Park System. The Secretary may provide technical assistance and enter into cooperative agreements with the Foundation for the purpose of providing financial assistance with marketing of the Memorial. The map shall be on file and available for public inspection at the appropriate offices of the National Park Service. Nothing in this Act limits the Secretary's role. The Secretary can provide technical assistance and cooperate with the Foundation for financial aid in marketing the Memorial. The Secretary is not authorized to acquire property or use federal funds for the Memorial's construction, operation, maintenance, or management. A general management plan for the Memorial will be developed by the Secretary in consultation with the Foundation. The Secretary will prepare a general management plan for the Memorial in accordance with the law and provide it to the relevant congressional committees within 3 years of funds availability."
