(a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Prevent a Government Shutdown Act of 2015''.\n(b) Findings.--Congress finds that the Budget Control Act of 2011 established spending caps and mandated deficit reduction through negotiations or sequestration to avoid drastic cuts in spending levels. The initial sequester in fiscal year 2013 resulted from unsuccessful negotiations, leading to a two-year agreement for higher spending levels in 2014 and 2015. A similar agreement is now needed to prevent deep cuts. Senator John McCain and Representative Mac Thornberry have criticized the level of defense spending under sequestration, stating that the cuts are undermining the capabilities, readiness, morale, and modernization of the armed forces. Military leaders from the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps have testified to Congress about the impact of these cuts. A new agreement is needed to avoid deep budget cuts in the upcoming fiscal year. The impact of sequestration-level defense spending on the National Military Strategy has been highlighted by senior military leaders. NDD United warns that these cuts are harming economic recovery, business growth, public health, and education resources. The impact of sequestration-level defense spending on various sectors includes weakening public health preparedness, reducing resources for schools and colleges, compromising federal oversight, hindering scientific discovery, eroding infrastructure, and threatening global emergency response efforts. This is evident in proposed budget cuts for the Department of Education and housing vouchers in fiscal year 2016. The sequester will cut education funding by $2.8 billion, remove housing vouchers from families, and reduce funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs. Eliminating the sequester would boost GDP by 0.4% in 2016 and 0.2% in 2017, creating 500,000 jobs next year and aiding the economic recovery. Eliminating the sequester would boost GDP by 0.4% in 2016 and 0.2% in 2017, creating 500,000 jobs next year and 300,000 in 2017. Relief from the sequester would allow Congress to pass appropriations legislation before the fiscal year starts, preventing a government shutdown. The 2013 government shutdown lasted 16 days, costing 120,000 private-sector jobs and shrinking GDP growth by 0.2% to 0.6%. The 2013 government shutdown cost the economy about 120,000 private-sector jobs and shrunk GDP growth by 0.2% to 0.6%. It resulted in the loss of 6.6 million days' worth of work, $500 million in visitor spending at national parks, delayed tax refunds of $4 billion, and impacted services like Head Start and food safety inspections. Immediate negotiations are necessary to prevent another shutdown and fund vital services for fiscal year 2016. Immediate negotiations are needed to allow appropriations bills for fiscal year 2016 to fund vital services at necessary levels. It is essential to raise discretionary spending caps for defense and non-defense, eliminating the non-defense sequester and reducing the defense sequester by the same amount. Congress should aim to offset the cost of sequester relief with deficit reduction from closing special interest tax loopholes, but sequester relief must occur regardless. Sequester relief is crucial regardless of reaching an agreement on deficit reduction through closing tax loopholes. Bipartisan, bicameral agreement on sequester relief is essential. A bipartisan measure will be negotiated to increase discretionary spending limits for fiscal years 2016 and 2017, with provisions to reduce the deficit. Members will be appointed to carry out this agreement. The bipartisan measure aims to increase discretionary spending limits for fiscal years 2016 and 2017 while including provisions to reduce the deficit. Members will be appointed by key leaders to negotiate and approve the measure. The measure described in subsection (a) requires approval by a majority of individuals appointed by key leaders. If approved, it will be considered under specific procedures, with a substitution for a date. The measure in subsection (a) requires approval by appointed individuals and will be considered under specific procedures with date substitutions. SEC. 3. ALTERNATIVE ADJUSTMENT TO DISCRETIONARY SPENDING LIMITS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2016 AND 2017. If the measure described under section 2(a) is not enacted into law before October 1, 2015, the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 is amended to adjust the Security and Nonsecurity Discretionary Spending Limits. This includes changing the dollar amounts to $559,600,000,000 and $573,393,000,000 in specific paragraphs. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 is amended to adjust discretionary spending limits for fiscal years 2016 and 2017 by inserting specific dollar amounts. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 is amended to remove the Office of Management and Budget's authority for measures not enacted by October 1, 2015."
