    "content": "Since the mid-1980s, Congress has passed legislation to support older youth in foster care through the Chafee Foster Care Independence Program (CFCIP), providing services like housing. States have developed independent living programs with funding from CFCIP and other sources to help youth attain self-sufficiency. Federal law also directs child welfare agencies to develop policies for older youth transitioning from care. Research has shown that former foster youth struggle more than their peers in transitioning to adulthood, often forgoing higher education and reporting fair general health. Research on former foster youth shows they are more likely to forego higher education, report fair or poor general health, become homeless, and rely on public supports during their early adult years. Efforts by policy makers and advocates have raised awareness of the challenges these youth face in transitioning from care. Congress is focusing on ensuring youth have support from caring adults and the state after reaching legal adulthood to ease the transition. The 110th Congress passed the Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 to provide support for older youth in care as they transition to adulthood at age 18. This law addresses various aspects of the child welfare system and is considered significant in helping youth who are wards of the state. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) signed into law in 2014, provides protections for older youth in foster care and promotes normalcy for children in care to participate in age-appropriate activities. This report addresses issues faced by older youth transitioning from foster care into adulthood, focusing on the implementation challenges of P.L. 110-351 and P.L. 113-183. One key issue is the difficulty states may encounter in extending foster care to older youth after age 18. The main challenge with extending foster care to older youth under P.L. 110-351 is the cost for states, despite federal assistance. States must also help youth develop a transition plan within 90 days of exiting care. Emancipated youth face challenges in transitioning to adulthood, including difficulties in forming permanent connections, obtaining health insurance and housing, and staying connected to work and school. Older foster youth and those who have aged out may continue to experience obstacles despite the option to extend foster care. Emancipated youth encounter obstacles in forming lasting connections with caring adults, securing health insurance and housing, and staying engaged in work and school. Concerns also exist regarding their transition from foster care, with a new national database expected to shed light on their outcomes in education, employment, and interactions with social services and the criminal justice system. Additionally, there is a risk of child sex trafficking among youth in foster care, prompting the implementation of policies by child welfare agencies to support these vulnerable individuals. The report discusses the implementation of P.L. 113-183, which requires child welfare agencies to have policies in place to serve youth under 18 for commercial purposes. Congress may monitor state implementation and identify best practices for serving victims. The report discusses the implementation of select aspects of P.L. 110-351 and ongoing issues related to older foster youth. The number of children in foster care has decreased over the past decade, with children ages 13 through 17 making up about 29% of the caseload in FY2002, 35% in FY2010, and 34% in FY2012. The share of older children in foster care increased but then declined slightly over the years. In FY2002, over 20,000 children \"aged out\" of foster care, making up 7% of all children who exited care that year. This number increased in subsequent years, reaching a peak in FY2010 with slightly more than 26,000 youth aging out. However, the number of youth emancipating reached a low of 23,396 in FY2012. The number of youth emancipating from foster care reached a recent all-time low of 23,396 (10%) in FY2012. Research shows that youth who spend time in foster care tend to have more negative outcomes in adulthood compared to their peers. The Midwest Evaluation study is tracking outcomes of former foster youth in Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin. The Midwest Evaluation study is tracking outcomes of former foster youth in Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin. Surveyed youth entered care before age 16 and responded to researcher questions in four data collection waves. The most recent results at age 26 found that former foster youth and peers in the general population shared some common outcomes. The most recent results of the Midwest Evaluation study at age 26 found that former foster youth experienced more negative educational and employment outcomes compared to youth in general. Former foster youth were less likely to have attained a four-year college degree (2.5% versus 23.5%) and faced barriers to enrolling or staying in school, such as financial constraints, employment, childcare responsibilities, and transportation issues. Former foster youth faced barriers to enrolling or staying in school, such as financial constraints, employment, childcare responsibilities, and transportation issues. While almost as likely to report ever holding a job as youth in general, a smaller share of former foster youth were currently employed with a lower mean annual income compared to their peers. The state child welfare agency is responsible for the care and placement of children removed from their homes due to abuse or neglect. The child welfare agency uses federal and state funds to help children reunite with parents or find a safe home if reunification is not possible. Title IV-E foster care is a primary federal funding source for this purpose. States must meet requirements to receive federal funds for child welfare services. To promote the safety and well-being of children in foster care, states must have a written case plan detailing the child's placement and services for a permanent home. The plan must be reviewed every 6 months by a judge or panel, and annually by a judge considering the child's permanency plan. The court must review the child's case plan every 6 months by a judge or panel, and annually by a judge considering the permanency plan. For youth age 14 and older, the plan must include programs for a successful transition to adulthood. The state child welfare agency is required to include in a child's case plan a document listing rights related to education, health, visitation, and court participation for children in foster care at age 14 or older. The plan must also include provisions for identification documents and the right to be safe. Children in foster care age 14 or older must be consulted in the development of the case plan. Children in foster care age 14 or older must be consulted in the development of their case plan and permanency plan. They can choose up to two members of the planning teams, with one being their advisor and advocate for the \"reasonable and prudent parenting standard\" for participation in extracurricular activities. States must assist youth in developing a transition plan for housing and other needs after emancipation from foster care. Efforts are made to find adoptive parents or legal guardians for children who cannot reunite with their parents for safety reasons. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program prepares youth aging out of foster care for independence. The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act addresses reforms in the child welfare system. The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act (P.L. 110-351) made significant changes to federal child welfare statutes, focusing on older youth in foster care and their transition to adulthood. States can now extend foster care to youth aged 18 and older, up to age 19, 20, or 21. The 113th Congress has also addressed the needs of older youth in the child welfare system. The 113th Congress has focused on the needs of older youth in foster care and child sex trafficking. They passed the Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) in 2014, which provides protections for older youth in care and promotes normalcy for children in foster care. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) passed by the 113th Congress focuses on older youth in foster care and child sex trafficking. It requires child welfare agencies to respond to sex trafficking of children and provides provisions for older youth in care and those aging out, including funding for room and board costs under Title IV-E of the Social Security Act. The Title IV-E foster care program provides funding for room and board costs for eligible children in out-of-home foster care. The program is funded through the general treasury on an open-ended entitlement basis, with the federal government obligated to reimburse states for eligible expenditures. Eligibility criteria include being in state care, citizenship or qualified alien status, meeting income/assets tests, age requirements, and family structure/living arrangement rules. The Title IV-E foster care program provides funding for eligible children in out-of-home foster care, including those who are qualified aliens and meet certain criteria such as age and family structure. A judge must determine that the child's home was detrimental to their welfare, and the state must make efforts to prevent foster care placement and secure a permanent home. Foster care maintenance payments are provided for eligible children in licensed settings. The state or tribal child welfare agency must provide a \"foster care maintenance payment\" for every Title IV-E eligible child in foster care, covering food, clothing, shelter, supervision, school supplies, personal incidentals, insurance, visitation travel, and school-related travel. Federal reimbursement for travel expenses is available for children in licensed child care institutions or foster care homes. States and tribes receiving federal child welfare funds must promote safety and well-being for all youth in care, regardless of eligibility for maintenance payments. Eligibility for Title IV-E foster care is maintained for children in extended care. To ensure the safety and well-being of all youth in care, states and tribes can provide Title IV-E foster care maintenance payments until age 21 for those still in school or vocational training. States may seek reimbursement for eligible youth aged 18 or older participating in education or training programs. States and tribes can provide Title IV-E foster care maintenance payments until age 21 for youth still in school or vocational training, or participating in employment programs. Reimbursement may also be sought for older youth with medical conditions preventing participation in activities. The law allows states to seek federal foster care reimbursement for eligible youth living in licensed foster homes or child care institutions. Child care institutions must be licensed and have no more than 25 children. Excluded facilities include detention centers and training schools for delinquent youth. The law allows states to seek federal foster care reimbursement for eligible youth living in licensed foster homes or child care institutions. Excluded facilities include detention centers and training schools for delinquent youth. States may also seek reimbursement for youth ages 18 or older in foster care placed in a supervised independent living setting. HHS is directed to establish regulations for qualifying settings. HHS encourages states and tribes to extend federal foster care assistance to eligible youth until age 21, with a requirement to provide rationale if extending to a lower age. States and tribes must submit this description as part of their Title IV-E plan to receive funding. Criteria must be established to determine if young people meet employment or education conditions for assistance. States and tribes must establish criteria to determine if young people meet employment or education conditions for extended foster care assistance. They must also verify that youth continue to meet these conditions while in care. Examples of eligible activities include finishing high school, pursuing a GED, enrolling in college or vocational school, or joining Job Corps. HHS advises that states and tribes may establish requirements for extended foster care, such as enrolling in post-secondary education. States and tribes should consider providing assistance to youth aged 18 and older in various ways. The guidance advises states and tribes to consider providing extended assistance to youth aged 18 and older, ensuring ample support for older youth in post-secondary education. Program instructions address criteria for Title IV-E foster care eligibility for young people reaching the state age of majority, continuing in care, seeking reentry before age 21, or entering foster care at age 18 or older. To be eligible for federal foster care, youth aged 18 or older must meet Title IV-E requirements regarding income, assets, and living arrangements at the time of removal from their parents' home. States do not need to reassess AFDC eligibility for these youth. Eligibility for older youth entering or reentering care is based on the youth themselves, not their parents or guardians. Eligibility for federal foster care for youth aged 18 or older is based on the youth themselves, not their parents or guardians. Youth in extended care must have entered care via a court order or voluntary placement agreement. Removal criteria for youth who are age 18 or older are specified in the program instructions. The instructions specify that youth aged 18 or older can be removed from their home if it is deemed contrary to their welfare by the court or if they sign a voluntary placement agreement. A judicial determination is required if Title IV-E payments extend beyond 180 days. Placement and care guidelines for state and tribal child welfare are also addressed. The instructions address placement and care rules for older youth, allowing for supervised independent living or placement in foster family homes or child care institutions. Title IV-E payments may extend beyond 180 days with court authorization or a voluntary placement agreement. The program instructions allow for supervised independent living settings for older youth in care, giving states and tribes discretion to develop various arrangements consistent with the law. The program instructions allow for supervised independent living settings for older youth in care, giving states and tribes discretion to develop various arrangements reasonably interpreted as consistent with the law. Examples of eligible settings include host homes, college dormitories, shared housing, and supervised apartments. Child welfare agencies must ensure youth in these settings have opportunities to form connections with caring adults. Title IV-E foster care maintenance payments, typically paid to foster care providers, may be used for these arrangements. The program instructions allow for Title IV-E foster care maintenance payments to be paid directly to young people in independent living settings. States and tribes must apply case planning and review requirements to youth in extended care, addressing their needs. The program instructions require case plans and reviews for youth aged 18 and older to address their needs, with benchmarks for achieving independence. Periodic reviews every six months should focus on the youth's safety in placement. States and tribes must make efforts to finalize a permanency plan every 12 months for older youth in court-ordered placements, which may include goals of emancipation or independence. The guidance requires states and tribes to make efforts to finalize a permanency plan every 12 months for older youth in court-ordered placements, which may include goals of emancipation or independence. The court overseeing the child's case can determine reasonable efforts without a court hearing, as long as authorized by a judiciary member. States and tribes extending care to ineligible youth are not obligated to fulfill IV-E requirements. The program guidance advises states and tribes extending care to youth ineligible for federal foster care that they are not required to fulfill IV-E requirements, including case planning and certain data collection and reporting, for these youth. Medicaid eligibility is to be extended to youth in care after age 18, up to the age chosen by the state or tribe. The guidance states that Medicaid eligibility is extended to youth in care after age 18, up to the age chosen by the state or tribe. Nearly half of jurisdictions have amended their Title IV-E state plans to extend foster care age, with plans approved for 18 states and the District of Columbia. Plans for two other states are under review. Nebraska, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, and West Virginia, along with the District of Columbia, have approved plan amendments to extend foster care until age 21. Indiana extends care to age 20, while Nebraska extended care to age 21 in 2013. HHS is reviewing Nebraska's legislation change. Tennessee, Washington, and West Virginia have approved plan amendments allowing youth to remain in care under certain conditions. Tennessee, Washington, and West Virginia allow youth to remain in care under specific conditions, including being in school or participating in a program to address employment barriers. Other states considering extending care need to evaluate the outcomes for youth who stay in care. In considering extending care for youth, states and tribes must evaluate outcomes, costs, youth eligibility, court oversight, rethinking care, youth re-entry, foster care placements, and independent living settings. Research on youth emancipating from care or staying beyond age 18 is limited. The Midwest Evaluation study found that youth who remained in care until age 20 had more positive outcomes compared to those who emancipated at age 18. Outcomes were examined for former foster youth in Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin, with Iowa and Wisconsin emancipating most foster youth by age 18. The Midwest Evaluation study compared outcomes of foster youth in Iowa, Wisconsin, and Illinois. Iowa and Wisconsin emancipated most foster youth by age 18, while Illinois kept three-fourths in care until age 21. Remaining in care was linked to higher earnings and delayed pregnancy. Each additional year in care after 18 was associated with a $470 increase in annual earnings. Remaining in care after age 18 was associated with higher earnings and a reduced risk of pregnancy for youth in Illinois. Each additional year in care led to an increase in average annual earnings by $470, with a total increase of $924 for those who stayed longer. Additionally, young people in Illinois were 38% less likely to become pregnant between ages 17 and 19 compared to their counterparts. Youth in care in Illinois had a reduced risk of pregnancy after age 19 compared to their peers, but this difference was not statistically significant. They were more likely to receive transitional living services funded through the CFCIP between ages 19 and 21. Benefits of remaining in care seemed to diminish two years after aging out, as they were more likely to have completed one year of college by age 23 but not more likely to earn a two- or four-year degree. This could be due to losing access to services. Researchers suggest that youth in care who completed one year of college were not more likely to earn a two- or four-year degree, possibly due to losing access to necessary services and supports. Despite assistance from programs like the Chafee Education and Training Voucher (ETV) program, these young people may not have received adequate academic and social/emotional support in school. States face challenges in extending care to help these youth succeed. States face challenges in extending care to youth in foster care to help them succeed academically and socially. Budget constraints are a major factor for not extending care, according to a Government Accountability Office review. The Jim Casey Youth Opportunities Initiative suggests convening a planning group to address this issue. The Opportunities Initiative recommends that states convene a planning group to assist youth transitioning from foster care to adulthood. This group should include key stakeholders, review federal requirements, consider existing supports, reach agreement on design issues, and project costs. The Opportunities Initiative suggests convening a planning group to assist youth transitioning from foster care to adulthood. This group should address key design issues, project costs, and consider the advantages of youth remaining in foster care after age 18. Studies show that extending foster care can offset costs like state prison admissions and welfare payments. Extending foster care can help offset costs like state prison admissions and welfare payments. A study evaluated the cost of extending care based on Illinois data, estimating an annual cost of about $20,800. Researchers estimated the annual cost of extending foster care in Illinois to be around $20,800, with potential benefits including increased earnings for youth who can attend college. The analysis found an average return of $2 for every $1 spent on youth in care, resulting in an additional $72,000 earned over time. The analysis found that extending foster care in Illinois costs around $20,800 annually, with potential benefits including increased earnings for college-bound youth. On average, there is a $2 return for every $1 spent on youth in care, resulting in an additional $72,000 earned over their lifetime. The analysis did not consider the costs to state child welfare agencies or courts, such as additional personnel hiring, but also did not explore potential societal benefits like higher tax revenues and reduced homelessness. The cost of providing foster care to eligible youth after age 18 is a consideration for most states, with only partial reimbursement from the federal government. Eligibility for federal foster care maintenance payments varies by state. State foster care expenditures may only be partially reimbursed by the federal government for Title IV-E eligible children and youth. The federal government partially reimburses state foster care expenditures for Title IV-E eligible children and youth based on specific criteria. The reimbursement rate is tied to a state's Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP). The federal government reimburses state foster care expenditures for Title IV-E eligible children based on the state's Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP). Reimbursement rates for maintenance payments, program administration costs, and training costs vary. States are not required to make foster care payments for children ineligible for federal foster care. States may choose to extend foster care beyond the age of 18, but they are only required to cover youth who are IV-E eligible. This could lead to different reimbursement levels for eligible and ineligible youth, raising equity concerns. States must cover the full costs for children who do not meet IV-E eligibility criteria, either from state funds or other federal sources. States extending foster care beyond age 18 may establish different reimbursement levels and services for Title IV-E eligible youth. Eligible youth can remain in care by meeting certain criteria, such as attending school or working. States and tribes can make continued care conditional on youth pursuing specific pathways. States and tribes can make remaining in foster care conditional upon youth pursuing specific pathways, which may raise equity concerns if certain activities are restricted. For example, if extended care is only available to those in post-secondary education, it may reinforce inequality among youth who choose different paths like working or pursuing college later. Federal child welfare law gives state courts the responsibility to oversee the safety and appropriateness of a child's placement, regardless of their eligibility for IV-E funding or the circumstances of their entry into care. This ensures that each child has an appropriate permanency goal. Federal child welfare law mandates that state courts oversee a child's placement and permanency goal, regardless of IV-E eligibility or entry circumstances. A case review must occur every six months to assess safety and progress, with a permanency plan required within 12 months of foster care placement. The permanency plan for children in foster care must be established within 12 months of placement, with regular reviews every 12 months thereafter. The court must consult with the child about the plan in an age-appropriate manner, and case review system protections apply to all children under 18. The court must consult with the child about the permanency plan in an age-appropriate manner. HHS program instructions state that case review system protections apply to all children under 18, regardless of IV-E eligibility, and to those in care age 18 and older who are IV-E eligible. Children ineligible for IV-E may not be subject to the same court oversight. In states that extend care beyond age 18, different levels of services may be provided based on IV-E eligibility. Background checks and caseworker visits may not be required for non-IV-E eligible youth. They may not receive the same level of state oversight as IV-E eligible youth. Non-IV-E eligible youth in extended care may lack necessary oversight and supervision compared to IV-E eligible youth. There is a concern about the lack of information on these young adults, hindering policymakers from assessing their needs. Another issue is the jurisdiction of juvenile courts over cases involving youth who turn 18, and the appropriate conduct of hearings for older youth. The American Bar Association is involved in addressing these issues. The American Bar Association recommends legislation to extend juvenile court involvement for older youth in care beyond age 18. They also suggest modifying hearings to ensure the involvement of older youth in care. The ABA advocates for older youth in care to be actively involved in their hearings and recommends modifying procedures for their participation. Stakeholders emphasize the need for tailored support for youth in foster care aged 18 and older, urging states to rethink current models. The Jim Casey Foundation highlights the importance of promoting the well-being of older youth in care and those aging out. The Jim Casey Foundation emphasizes the challenges faced by foster youth aging out of the system at 18, highlighting their anxiety about transitioning to independence. Young people in foster care age out of the system abruptly, lacking gradual growth opportunities. Extending traditional foster care is insufficient for providing necessary developmental support. Stakeholders advocate for extended care with features like being developmentally appropriate, addressing trauma, and involving young adults in decision-making based on research on adolescents. Extended care for young people in foster care is crucial as it considers their trauma, involves them in decision-making, and supports their transition to adulthood based on research on adolescent brain development. Extended care for young people in foster care involves providing opportunities for them to learn from mistakes, take on increasing responsibility, and develop healthy relationships. This approach emphasizes the importance of young people being in control of who they connect with, and may include graduated levels of supervision and support, as well as redesigning case planning to involve youth in decision-making at an earlier age. Redesigning case planning for youth in foster care involves giving them specific roles and responsibilities at an earlier age, increasing autonomy, and building social networks. Research also focuses on factors that help young people remain in extended care, despite challenges in some parts of Illinois. In Chicago, researchers found reasons why many youth in Illinois do not stay in care despite state policies. Child welfare services are managed by DCFS in four regional offices. In Cook County, over 81% of youth stay in care past age 18, compared to 54% in other regions. Chapin Hall studied factors influencing youth leaving care before age 21. Chapin Hall studied factors influencing youth leaving care before age 21 in Illinois. Factors included juvenile courts playing an active role in retaining youth, stakeholders lacking a uniform understanding of laws and policies, and resistance from caseworkers, caregivers, youth, and court personnel. Factors influencing youth leaving care before age 21 in Illinois included court personnel involvement, stakeholders' lack of understanding of laws and policies, limited foster care placements for older youth, the importance of stable relationships with adults, and youth attitudes towards remaining in care. In Illinois, challenges in keeping youth in care beyond the age of majority include restrictions imposed by case workers leading to requests to leave or uncooperative behavior. States that extend foster care may see older youth returning to care due to difficulties living independently. The July 2010 program instructions issued by HHS allow states to extend foster care assistance for youth to return to care after turning 18, depending on the state's regulations. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) examined the implementation of the Fostering Connections Act in 19 states. In a 2014 report, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that 19 states allow young people to leave and re-enter foster care. Youth in 12 states can stay in care under voluntary agreements. States offering extended care options provide supervised independent living for youth over 18. HHS is tasked with clarifying this arrangement. HHS is directed to clarify the extended care option for youth over 18 in foster care, but has not issued regulations on independent living settings. These settings involve continued supervision by the child welfare agency, without formal reunification with parents or guardians. States may establish their own oversight for youth in these settings. States could establish distinct protocols for supervising older youth in care, regardless of setting. Advocates assert that young adults in care should learn to live as adults while still receiving state support. States with foster youth in independent living settings must consider purchasing units or contracting with organizations that own them. The child welfare agency must consider various issues when supervising youth in independent living settings, such as purchasing units, screening residents, rent responsibilities, visitation frequency, consequences for rule violations, and progression to different settings. In independent living settings, youth may move to different levels based on progress. Questions arise about maintenance payment distribution and support for transitioning back home. States face challenges in finding suitable housing for youth in extended care. In a 2014 GAO survey of 19 states with extended care, most provided supervised independent living settings. States struggle to find appropriate housing for these youth. Minnesota allows youth in extended care to live in various settings like apartments and dorms. The state is working on supporting youth pursuing postsecondary education out of state. Youth can live with roommates but not with their removed parent(s). Caseworkers must meet with youth in extended care at least once a month. Youth can live with roommates but not with their removed parent(s) or significant others. Independent living settings do not need to be licensed, and counties have discretion on handling background checks for roommates. The law also focuses on connecting youth with caring adults through adoption or placement with relatives. Monthly federal assistance is generally not available for youth who have turned 18. As of FY2011, states and tribes can provide adoption or kinship guardianship subsidies for eligible children who leave foster care after their 16th birthday, as long as they are under 21, enrolled in school, employed, or in a program to promote employment. Older youth with medical conditions may also be covered. States and tribes can provide assistance to older youth with medical conditions that prevent them from participating in employment activities. This assistance can continue up to the age of 21 if the state determines that the youth has a mental or physical handicap that warrants the continuation of support. States and tribes can provide assistance to older youth with medical conditions that prevent them from participating in employment activities up to age 21 if they have a mental or physical handicap that warrants support. For kinship guardianship, the child must have resided with the prospective relative guardian for at least six consecutive months. HHS's program instructions allow states to extend foster care beyond age 18 to provide adoption and kinship guardianship subsidies to youth age 18 and older. The instructions allow states to extend foster care beyond age 18 to provide adoption and kinship guardianship subsidies to youth age 18 and older. The term \"relative\" for kinship guardianship assistance can include biological and legal familial ties, tribal kin, extended family, friends, or other \"fictive\" kin. States and tribes can establish conditions for a person to qualify as a child's guardian, such as requiring the child to be in care for more than six months and targeting certain age groups for guardianship. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program (CFCIP) provides support services for youth expected to emancipate from foster care, targeting those likely to remain in care until age 18. It assists with employment, postsecondary training, and emotional support through mentors. (P.L. 106-169) The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program (CFCIP) supports youth aging out of foster care by providing employment, education, housing, and emotional support to help them achieve self-sufficiency and transition to adulthood. P.L. 110-351 allows states and tribes to offer independent living services to youth leaving foster care after age 16. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act added a purpose area to the Chafee program to ensure children likely to remain in foster care until 18 have opportunities for appropriate activities. The CFCIP is a capped entitlement with an annual ceiling of $140 million for states and tribes. The Chafee program, with a capped entitlement of $140 million, provides funding for states and tribes based on their foster care population. States must match 20% of the funding and offer independent living programs for youth, including housing, education services, and mentoring. The Chafee program provides funding for states and tribes to offer independent living programs for youth, including housing, education services, and mentoring. States and tribes must describe in their five-year Child and Family Services Plan how they will carry out their independent living program to be eligible for CFCIP funds. They must ensure statewide coverage and serve children of various ages and stages of achieving independence. States and tribes must also certify that they meet certain requirements pertaining to the youth served. The Chafee program provides funding for states and tribes to offer independent living programs for youth, including housing, education services, and mentoring. States and tribes must certify that they meet requirements for the youth served and how funding will be spent. Program funds have limitations on room and board expenses for youth ages 18 to 21. The Chafee Education and Training Voucher Program (ETV) supports children who have emancipated from care or were adopted from care at age 16 or older. The Chafee Education and Training Voucher Program (ETV) supports youth who have emancipated or were adopted from care at age 16 or older. Congress authorized $60 million in discretionary funds for the program, allocated to states based on their foster care population. Vouchers worth up to $5,000 annually are provided for higher education expenses. The Chafee Education and Training Voucher Program (ETV) provides vouchers for higher education expenses to eligible students in good academic standing. States may have additional requirements, and only youth receiving a voucher at age 21 can continue until age 23. States are authorized to provide independent living services to youth who left foster care under a permanent arrangement before age 18. Independent living services are available to youth who have left foster care under a permanent arrangement before age 18, either through adoption or kinship guardianship. States have discretion in defining which youth are eligible for these services until age 21. States may need to assess capacity to serve additional youth in independent living programs. States may need to assess the capacity of independent living programs to serve additional youth and determine how to support youth in age-appropriate activities. Child welfare law mandates that a youth's caseworker assist in developing a transition plan directed by the youth. The transition plan for youth aging out of foster care includes options for housing, health insurance, education, mentors, workforce supports, and employment services. It must be implemented 90 days before the youth's 18th birthday, with assistance from the caseworker and other representatives. The transition plan for youth aging out of foster care includes addressing the importance of designating someone to make health care decisions if the youth is unable to do so. This is required by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The transition plan for youth aging out of foster care includes providing the option to execute a health care power of attorney or similar document. It is distinct from a case plan, which outlines the youth's placement and care while in foster care. The child welfare agency must provide a written document outlining the youth's placement and care, including a plan for safe and proper care. For youth aged 16 or older, the case plan should also address programs and services for a successful transition to adulthood. The transition plan focuses on services and supports for when the youth is no longer in state custody or receiving independent living services, aiming to help them live independently. The transition plan for youth aged 16 or older focuses on identifying specific housing options and services to help them live independently. It is directed by the youth in consultation with others and can be detailed as desired. The plan is not reviewed by a court but additional guidance is provided by HHS. The transition plan for youth aged 16 or older focuses on identifying housing options and services for independent living. Guidance from HHS encourages child welfare agencies to engage youth in the transition planning process well in advance, but the plan is not required for youth leaving foster care more than 90 days before their 18th birthday. The transition plan is not required for youth leaving foster care more than 90 days before their 18th birthday, raising concerns for those who emancipate at age 17. These youth may be less prepared than their peers who emancipate at 18 or older, potentially missing out on benefits like the Medicaid pathway for emancipated youth. States and tribes may not assist in developing transition plans for youth who remain in care past age 18 but leave before age 19, 20, or 21. Social work professionals are creating guidance on how to implement transition plans that engage youth and stakeholders in the process, focusing on achieving permanency with caring adults. The guidance emphasizes the importance of transition planning for youth in care, focusing on achieving permanency with caring adults and involving the youth in the process. States have adopted policies to engage youth in transition planning. In a 2014 report, GAO found that states have adopted policies to engage youth in transition planning from foster care. Nearly all jurisdictions require documented youth input and key document inclusion in the plan. Some jurisdictions have separate transition plans and require specialists to assist youth with the plan. Several jurisdictions face challenges with transition planning for youth aging out of foster care, including a lack of staff training, difficulty engaging supportive adults, and finding appropriate housing. Some states have developed detailed transition planning processes to address these issues. Some states, like Hawaii and Nebraska, have transition planning processes for youth aging out of foster care. In Hawaii, youth participate in transition planning \"circles\" to celebrate becoming adults and plan for their future with support from their community. These conferences aim to empower youth to make decisions about their future and meet their goals, including options outlined in federal law, transportation, and spirituality. Foster Club advocates for youth in foster care. Foster Club in Nebraska has developed a transition planning kit for older youth in foster care, specifying roles of the transition plan team and courts in oversight. It includes a transition proposal checklist revisited six months after creation and 90 days before aging out, as well as a \"permanency pact\" for youth to consider individuals who can assist them during the transition. Even with the passage of P.L. 110-351, concerns remain about older foster youth and those aging out facing challenges in transitioning to adulthood. Research shows difficulties in forming permanent connections with adults, obtaining health insurance and housing, and maintaining employment. Research indicates that youth in foster care struggle with forming lasting connections with adults, accessing health insurance and housing, and staying engaged in work and school. Limited information is available on their transition from foster care and the effectiveness of the services they receive. Congress is focusing on enhancing protections for vulnerable children in care and addressing the issue of youth going missing. The focus of Congress has been on increasing protections for vulnerable children in care and addressing youth in foster care vulnerable to sex trafficking. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act aims to address these issues. Research shows that youth aging out of foster care struggle to form lasting relationships with adults and remain connected to their biological families. The Midwest Evaluation on the Adult Functioning of Former Foster Youth found that at age 26, emancipated youth were more likely to be married but less likely to live with their parents. Alumni reported varying levels of closeness with their biological family members. The study found that former foster youth had varying levels of closeness with their biological family members, with a significant share not having strong relationships with some relatives. Despite federal protections, advocates push for policies to improve the transition to adulthood by promoting long-term connections to caring adults. Advocates push for policies to improve the transition to adulthood for foster youth by encouraging strong connections to caring adults, ensuring permanency through relationships with committed adults providing support and stability. Advocates emphasize the importance of foster youth having strong connections with committed adults to ensure stability and support in their transition to adulthood. Practitioners suggest various ways to help youth establish permanent relationships, including reconsidering the use of \"another planned permanent living arrangement\" as a goal, assisting in identifying permanent connections, supporting adoptive relationships, and fostering relationships with caring adults like teachers or mentors. Child welfare researchers caution practitioners to be careful in their approach. Child welfare researchers caution practitioners to be cautious in helping foster youth develop lasting connections with adults, as failed relationships can harm youth. Limited research exists on facilitating healthy relationships between foster youth and adults. Advocates urge policy makers and practitioners to initiate permanency planning before youth age out of foster care. This can be achieved through the case planning process, where the judge determines the permanency plan for the child, including options like returning home, adoption, guardianship, or placement with a relative. APPLA was added to the statute as part of reforms enacted in the Adoption and Safe Families Act (ASFA) of 1997, to address concerns about long-term foster care instability and frequent moves for children. Advocates envisioned APPLA as a permanent arrangement for a child, involving a specific adult or couple to care for the child and provide a stable, caring role in their life. Concerns have been raised that APPLA has been used as a replacement for foster care since the enactment of ASFA in 1997. Since ASFA's enactment, concerns have been raised that APPLA has been used as a default permanency goal for some children in foster care, cautioning against pursuing certain settings like group care unless there is clear evidence that the child cannot function in a family before emancipation. In December 2010, the Senate Caucus on Foster Youth issued a white paper based on meetings with foster youth and stakeholders to discuss policy. The Senate Caucus on Foster Youth, co-chaired by Senators Grassley and Landrieu, issued a white paper based on meetings with foster youth and stakeholders to discuss policy changes for children in foster care. The paper highlighted the need for better understanding of permanency goals and suggested eliminating or restricting APPLA as a case plan goal. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) incorporates recommendations to restrict APPLA as a case plan goal, with no child under 16 allowed to have APPLA as a permanency plan. This requirement takes effect one year after the bill's enactment. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act prohibits children under 16 from having APPLA as a permanency plan. The effective date is one year after the bill's enactment, except for children under the responsibility of an Indian tribe, where it is three years. Additional requirements must be met for children with an APPLA designation during annual permanency hearings and periodic reviews in foster care. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act prohibits children under 16 from having APPLA as a permanency plan. Additional requirements for children with an APPLA designation include ensuring the state child welfare agency continues to seek a permanent family, the court reviews the permanency plan, and the child is consulted about their desired outcome. Transition plans aim to help youth establish permanent connections in adulthood by considering local mentoring opportunities. The requirement for youth leaving care to consider local mentoring opportunities could lead to changes in federal child welfare law to help youth achieve permanency. This may include amending case plan requirements to ensure a permanent living arrangement for emancipated children and documentation of the living arrangement for older youth after foster care. The case plan requirements for older youth leaving foster care may include documentation of steps taken to find a permanent placement with a family or adult connection. A 2014 report found that 36 jurisdictions require intensive efforts to establish adult connections for young people transitioning out of care. During the transition process in Texas, youth are assisted in identifying caring adults for support when they leave care. Foster Club's Permanency Pact helps youth aging out connect with supportive adults. Foster Club's Permanency Pact helps youth aging out connect with caring adults to establish lifelong commitments for emotional and tangible support. HHS funded a project to support adoption for older youth, focusing on effective strategies like open adoption. The Adoption Opportunity Grants funded 10 projects nationwide to demonstrate effective strategies for open adoption and securing permanent connections for older youth. Additional federal grants could support mentoring for current and former foster youth. Federal grants could fund mentoring for current and former foster youth, with legislation introduced in Congress seeking permanent authorization for this funding. State and local child welfare agencies are responsible for promoting the safety, well-being, and permanency of all children. State and local child welfare agencies are responsible for promoting the safety, well-being, and permanency of all children, including child victims of sex trafficking who may come to their attention through the CPS hotline. Children in foster care, especially those who run away, are vulnerable to trafficking, and there is a need for these agencies to respond effectively to the needs of sex trafficking victims. State and local child welfare agencies are believed to have limited capacity to respond to the needs of sex trafficking victims, especially children who are vulnerable to this type of victimization. Inadequate training, insufficient resources, high caseloads, and the perception that victims should be handled in the juvenile justice system contribute to this limitation. States may lack mechanisms to identify cases involving children who are sex trafficked by perpetrators who are not their parents or caregivers. The National Academy of Sciences recommends improving collaboration to address child sex trafficking. The National Academy of Sciences recommends improving collaboration across various sectors to address child sex trafficking. Hearings in the 113th Congress discussed the challenges and opportunities for child welfare agencies in responding to child sex trafficking. Witnesses testified on the victimization of children and strategies for prevention. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) amends the Title IV-E foster care program to require state child welfare agencies to develop procedures to identify and provide services for children at risk of sex trafficking. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act requires state child welfare agencies to develop procedures to identify and provide services for children at risk of sex trafficking, in consultation with various stakeholders. These procedures must be developed within one year and implemented within two years of the bill's enactment. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act mandates state child welfare agencies to report child or youth victims of sex trafficking to law enforcement within 24 hours of receiving information. Additionally, agencies must annually report the total number of sex trafficking victims to HHS, which will then report to Congress and the public. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act requires state child welfare agencies to report child or youth victims of sex trafficking to HHS. HHS must then annually report the total number of victims to Congress and the public, as well as provide a written report summarizing demographic information and state efforts to provide specialized services for these victims. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act mandates reporting of child victims of sex trafficking to HHS, establishment of a National Advisory Committee on Domestic Sex Trafficking, and development of best practices for combating domestic sex trafficking of minors. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act mandates reporting child victims of sex trafficking to HHS and developing best practices for combating domestic sex trafficking of minors. Congress should monitor states' implementation of these requirements, including guidance provided by HHS, serving youth not in foster care, reporting of victims, and identifying best practices. State child welfare agencies are required to serve only children and youth victims who are already in the child welfare system, not those who may come to their attention as victims. Congress may consider the extent to which these agencies should screen in victims. Legislation such as H.R. 5081 aims to address this issue. Pending legislation, including H.R. 5081, would require state child welfare agencies to identify and assess reports involving child sex trafficking victims and train CPS workers to recognize and assess these victims. Children in foster care due to abuse and neglect may go missing, with limited federal guidance on serving missing children. Children in foster care homes due to abuse and neglect may go missing, with limited federal guidance on serving missing children. Some child welfare stakeholders are advocating for a more uniform and robust response to children missing from care. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) directs state child welfare agencies on responding to children missing from foster care, aiming to ensure policies are implemented effectively. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) directs state child welfare agencies to develop protocols for locating and responding to children missing from foster care, including addressing factors contributing to their disappearance and ensuring their safety in current and future placements. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) requires state child welfare agencies to develop protocols for locating and responding to children missing from foster care, including addressing factors contributing to their disappearance, ensuring their safety in placements, learning about their experiences while absent, and reporting any related information as required by HHS. Additionally, agencies must report information on missing and abducted children to the National Center on Missing and Exploited Children and law enforcement authorities. Child welfare agencies are required to develop protocols for locating and responding to children missing from foster care, including addressing factors contributing to their disappearance and ensuring their safety. Best practice guidelines recommend recruiting, retaining, and training a competent workforce. The Child Welfare League of America (CWLA) recommends that state child welfare agencies have procedures in place to recruit, retain, and train a competent workforce, involve youth and other stakeholders in decision-making, examine and address issues in foster care facilities with high runaway rates, and take corrective action as needed. The Child Welfare League of America recommends that state child welfare agencies address issues in foster care facilities with high runaway rates and implement corrective action as necessary. States should consider how to define and report missing children, including whether to involve law enforcement only when necessary. States may need to restrict reporting missing children from care to situations where law enforcement can provide the most assistance, as smaller agencies may not have dedicated staff for such cases. Law enforcement agencies may not respond as vigorously to certain types of missing incidents, such as frequent runaways, due to various factors. The challenges of coordinating between child welfare agencies, law enforcement, and courts to prevent children from going missing are highlighted. Federal child welfare policy outlines general requirements for these agencies, but more specific guidelines for handling missing children are needed. The CWLA Best Practices and NCMEC guidelines emphasize the importance of collaboration between law enforcement and child welfare agencies to address missing children. Little is known about children missing from foster care, and state agencies must report on runaways through AFCARS. Agencies report to HHS via AFCARS on children who run away from foster care placements and remain missing. AFCARS does not cover children missing for other reasons. States may need to improve tracking to locate these children. Child welfare agencies need to track children who are no longer living in their placements, including those who were abducted or are missing. Concerns have been raised about restrictions on foster youth participating in normal activities due to safety policies. Witnesses testified about the limitations foster youth face in a House Ways and Means Subcommittee hearing. Witnesses testified about the restrictions foster youth face, such as limitations on activities like sleepovers, dating, driving, working, and sports. They highlighted the need for balancing safety with allowing youth to have normal experiences and take on more risks as they test their independence. Witnesses explained that teenagers exhibit more risk-taking behaviors due to changes in brain development during adolescence. The enactment of the Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) addressed efforts to promote normalcy for foster youth. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) introduced provisions to promote normalcy for youth in foster care, including a \"reasonable and prudent parenting\" standard. Congress will monitor the law's implementation one year after enactment. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act introduced a \"reasonable and prudent parenting\" standard to promote normalcy for youth in foster care. Child welfare agencies must provide training to foster parents on children's developmental stages and how to apply the standard for age-appropriate activities. States are required to revise their licensing to comply with the law. Several studies have examined rates of homelessness among former foster youth, with varying percentages reported. The lack of adequate and affordable housing is a major concern for youth aging out of foster care. States are required to revise their licensing standards to reflect provisions around normalcy for foster family homes and child care institutions. Studies on former foster youth show varying rates of homelessness, ranging from 11% to 36%. The Midwest Evaluation found that 24% of 23-year-olds reported being homeless after exiting care. Some youth couch surf, with estimates ranging from one-quarter to one-half. Housing status is influenced by individual factors like lack of financial support and family ties. The housing status of former foster youth is often affected by individual characteristics, involvement with the child welfare system, and the housing market. Youth lacking housing may struggle to stay in school or maintain employment. States can allocate up to 30% of their funds for room and board for youth ages 18 to 21 who emancipate from care. Former foster youth face challenges in staying in school and finding employment due to housing instability. While states can allocate funds for room and board, these may not be sufficient. Nonprofit organizations offer housing programs for former foster youth in collaboration with developers or property management agencies, providing various housing options across different states. Researchers found that housing programs for former foster youth in 21 states and the District of Columbia offer various options like single-site locations, scattered-site locations, and host homes. These programs focus on independent living support and require youth to be employed or in school. However, none of the programs have been rigorously evaluated for their effectiveness in preventing homelessness or improving housing stability. Some states struggle to find appropriate housing options for current and former foster youth, especially during school breaks when college facilities are closed. California law requires public universities to provide housing for these youth. Some states require public universities to provide housing for emancipated foster youth during school breaks. The Higher Education Act addresses housing concerns for youth in foster care or recently emancipated youth. The Higher Education Act authorizes services for youth in foster care or recently emancipated youth, including housing services and support through Student Support Services. It also allows funds to establish demonstration projects for students who were in foster care or homeless before age 13. The Higher Education Act authorizes services for youth in foster care or recently emancipated youth, including housing services and support through Student Support Services. It also allows funds to establish demonstration projects that provide comprehensive support services for students who were in foster care or homeless before age 13, including housing support during breaks at educational institutions. Additionally, federal law enables owners of properties financed with Low-Income Housing Tax Credits to designate units for low-income students who were in foster care. The U.S. Government Accountability Office defined disconnected youth as individuals aged 14 to 24 who are not in school or working, lacking family support. Low-Income Housing Tax Credit properties can designate units for low-income students who were in foster care, without specifying the length of time spent in foster care or requiring emancipation. The U.S. Government Accountability Office defines disconnected youth as individuals aged 14 to 24 not in school or working, lacking support networks. Youth in care and certain groups are at higher risk of disconnection. Those who aged out of care have low employment rates and earnings. A study in California, Minnesota, and North Carolina linked child welfare data to show employment outcomes at age 24. At age 24, three out of five youth who aged out of care in three states had lower employment rates and earnings compared to national averages. They also faced challenges in education, experiencing multiple school placements and enrollment delays. Young people in foster care or who have aged out face challenges in education, including multiple school placements, enrollment delays, and lack of consistent education support. Foster care alumni are less likely to attend college, with only about 7% attaining a degree by age 26 compared to one-third of the general youth population. Young foster care alumni face challenges in education and are less likely to attain a degree compared to the general youth population. Additional supports such as academic, social/emotional, and logistical support, including year-round housing, may be needed to facilitate their education completion. Federal and state child welfare laws address the educational needs of youth in or formerly in foster care, including considerations for school proximity in placement decisions. When placing a child in foster care, the agency must consider the proximity to the child's school. The child's case plan should include education-related records, and efforts should be made to keep the child in the same school or find the best alternative if necessary. The law requires education authorities to ensure that a child remains in the same school during foster care placement or enrolls in a new school if it's in the child's best interest. States can claim federal funding for transporting children to their \"school of origin\" at the same rate as foster care maintenance payments. The law mandates that states ensure children in foster care receiving federal assistance are enrolled in school or have completed high school. Educational records must be updated and provided to foster care parents. Federal agencies are collaborating to address the education needs of vulnerable youth populations. The U.S. Departments of Health and Human Services and Education convened a summit in November 2011 to discuss promoting educational stability and improving outcomes for children in foster care. Despite collaboration, federal education law does not address the educational needs of children in foster care. Recent legislation aims to improve access to education for children and youth in foster care. Recent legislation, such as S. 1094, aims to improve access to education for children and youth in foster care by amending federal education law to reflect provisions in child welfare law. This bill would require state education agencies to ensure that children in foster care remain in the same school they were enrolled in at the time of placement. The bill requires state education agencies to ensure that children in foster care stay in their current school or enroll in a new school if it's in their best interest. SEAs must also have policies for transferring school credits. Federal education law addresses the educational needs of foster youth, including supportive services under the Higher Education Act. The Higher Education Act provides supportive educational services for foster youth, including those who have left foster care. These youth are eligible for federal Trio programs, which offer mentoring, tutoring, and other support services to prepare them for higher education. The Trio programs aim to support potential post-secondary students from disadvantaged backgrounds by providing preparation for higher education, support services during college, and training for service providers. The programs include Talent Search, Upward Bound, Student Support Services, and Educational Opportunity Centers. Additionally, the FY2014 appropriations law directs the Department of Education to modify the FAFSA form to include a box for applicants to indicate if they are or were in foster care, and to provide them with information on federal educational resources. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program provides funding for independent living services for youth in care or who have aged out. Limited research exists on the effectiveness of these services and outcomes for foster youth post-care. Limited research exists on the effectiveness of independent living programs for youth after they leave care. National studies are lacking, with most focusing on specific regions. The National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD) aims to provide a comprehensive view, but full implementation will take time. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program is the primary support system for these youth. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program provides funding for independent living services for youth in and recently emancipated from foster care. States receive $140 million annually for the program, with a 20% match requirement. A 2008 survey found that 31 states spend additional funds on these services. Based on a 2008 survey, 31 states spend extra funds on independent living services for youth in foster care, beyond the required 20% match for CFCIP dollars. This indicates that federal funding alone may not be sufficient for states to support their independent living programs effectively. Research on the effectiveness of these programs is limited, but states could benefit from learning about the most effective services. The research literature on independent living programs is scarce. HHS contracted with the Urban Institute to evaluate the effects of independent living programs funded by P.L. 106-169 in achieving key outcomes. The evaluation involved randomly assigning 1,400 eligible foster youth to four programs in California and Massachusetts\u2014an employment services program in Kern County, CA; a one-on-one intensive, individualized life skills program in Massachusetts; and a classroom-based life skills training program and tutoring/mentoring program, both in Los Angeles County, CA. The 1,400 youth participating in the evaluation at the four sites were assigned to intervention and control groups and were surveyed at three. The evaluation involved 1,400 foster youth in California and Massachusetts assigned to different programs. Surveys were conducted at three points over two years, along with in-person interviews and focus groups with various stakeholders. State administrative data was used to gather demographic and placement history information. The evaluation of foster youth programs in California and Massachusetts found no significant impacts overall, but the Massachusetts Adolescent Outreach Program for Youth in Intensive Foster Care showed positive effects on education outcomes. The program helps youth prepare for independent living and establish permanent connections with caring adults. The Adolescent Outreach Program for Youth in Intensive Foster Care assists youth in preparing for independent living and establishing permanent connections with caring adults. It aims to help youth achieve various outcomes such as obtaining a high school diploma, continuing education, avoiding high-risk behaviors, and gaining employment. The program provides tailored services with a focus on empowering youth to make positive decisions about their lives. The Outreach model empowers youth to make positive decisions by assigning social workers to oversee a small caseload and build close relationships with the youth. Caseworkers assist with tasks like obtaining driver's licenses, applying for college, and gaining employment, as well as referring youth to service providers as needed. The evaluation focuses on educational, employment, and other outcomes to assess the young person's progress. The evaluation of the Outreach model showed that youth who received support were more likely to enroll and stay in college, remain in foster care, and receive assistance in various areas such as education, employment, money management, and housing. The evaluation of the Outreach model showed that youth receiving support had higher college enrollment and retention rates, with assistance in education, employment, money management, and housing. Remaining in care was crucial for educational success. However, outcomes for Outreach youth were similar to the control group in areas like employment, housing, and preparedness for independent living, raising questions about the program's effectiveness. The evaluation of independent living programs raises questions about their efficacy in helping youth transition to independent living. The Outreach program, which assigns case workers to transitioning youth, shows promise but did not significantly outperform other foster youth in areas beyond education and remaining in foster care. The National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD) tracks outcomes for foster youth. The National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD) tracks demographic and outcome information of current and former foster youth to identify promising approaches for serving them, as required by the Chafee Foster Care Independence Act. States have reported information to the database, providing insight into the outcomes of foster youth nationwide. The curr_chunk focuses on collaborating with various stakeholders to develop outcome measures for assessing the performance of states in operating independent living programs for children. This includes tracking data on children receiving services, the type and quantity of services provided, and state performance on key measures. The final rule establishing the NYTD became effective on April 28, 2008, requiring states to collect data on youth in FY2011. HHS uses NYTD for data collection and reporting on youth receiving independent living services. States collect and report information twice each fiscal year on eligible youth receiving independent living services, tracking their outcomes at ages 17, 19, and 21 regardless of service receipt. The rule requires states to collect and report data on eligible youth receiving independent living services at ages 17, 19, and 21, with the option to track a sample of youth to reduce data collection burden. Financial penalties are imposed on states that do not meet data submission requirements."
