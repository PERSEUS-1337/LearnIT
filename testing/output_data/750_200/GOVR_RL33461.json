The Trump Administration's FY2019 budget request includes $120 million for the Department of Energy for Yucca Mountain and interim nuclear waste storage, along with an additional $47.7 million for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to resume the licensing process. The Trump Administration's FY2019 budget includes $120 million for Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository development. An additional $47.7 million was requested for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to resume licensing process. The House passed an appropriations bill with $100 million more than requested for Yucca Mountain, but the Senate version excludes funding for the project. Yucca Mountain funding has been a contentious issue, with the Obama Administration halting funding for the project in 2010. Despite Congress approving the halt, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act still designates Yucca Mountain as the sole repository candidate site. The Obama Administration halted funding for the Yucca Mountain repository project after FY2010. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future recommended the development of new nuclear waste repositories and storage facilities through a \"consent based\" process. The Blue Ribbon Commission recommended new nuclear waste repositories and storage facilities through a \"consent based\" process. DOE issued a Strategy for the Management and Disposal of Used Nuclear Fuel and High-Level Waste in response to the BRC report, calling for a new nuclear waste management entity to develop consent-based storage. The DOE strategy, in response to the Blue Ribbon Commission's recommendation, called for a new nuclear waste management entity to develop consent-based storage and disposal sites. This included plans for a pilot interim spent fuel storage facility by 2021, a larger-scale storage facility by 2025, and a geologic disposal facility by 2048. Public meetings were held in 2016, and a draft consent-based siting process was issued in January 2017. The House approved a bill on May 10, 2018 (H.R. 3053, H.Rept. 115-355) to withdraw the Yucca Mountain site from other uses under public lands laws, satisfying a licensing condition identified by the NRC staff in its Safety Evaluation Report. The NRC completed a Safety Evaluation Report (SER) in response to a court order regarding the Yucca Mountain repository licensing process. The report concluded that the DOE's design would meet safety and environmental standards, but construction should not proceed until all requirements are met. The NRC completed a Safety Evaluation Report (SER) stating that the DOE's design for the Yucca Mountain repository meets safety and environmental standards. However, construction should not proceed until all land and water rights requirements are met and a supplement to the environmental impact statement is completed. NRC Chairman Stephen Burns testified that an additional $330 million is needed to complete the licensing process, including adjudicatory hearings on 300 issues raised by Nevada and others. The Trump Administration is requesting $47.7 million in FY2019 for this purpose. The Trump Administration is requesting $47.7 million in FY2019 for NRC licensing activities for Yucca Mountain, plus $120 million for DOE to defend its license application for the repository and develop interim storage facilities. The Obama Administration issued a draft plan on December 16, 2016, for a separate underground repository for high-level radioactive waste and spent fuel generated by nuclear defense activities. The Reagan Administration's decision in 1985 to dispose of defense and civilian nuclear waste together is being reversed with the effort to develop a defense-only waste repository. Then-Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz suggested that a defense-only repository could be easier to site, license, and construct due to the smaller volume and radioactivity of defense waste. The Department of Energy's report in October 2014 concluded that a defense-only nuclear waste repository could be developed independently of the Nuclear Waste framework. The Department of Energy's report in October 2014 suggested that a defense-only nuclear waste repository could be developed outside the Nuclear Waste Policy Act framework. The repository would need to be licensed by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and comply with NWPA requirements. Disposal of defense waste could start approximately 22 years after a consent-based siting process begins. The Department of Energy's draft plan estimated that disposal of defense waste could start about 22 years after a consent-based siting process begins. However, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) criticized the analysis for excluding major costs and having an overly optimistic schedule. Republican leaders criticized the plan as a way to avoid progress on Yucca Mountain. Legislation was introduced in January 2017 (H.R. 433). Legislation introduced in January 2017 (H.R. 433) and H.R. 3053 in May 2018 would block development of a defense-only nuclear waste repository until a licensing decision is made on the Yucca Mountain repository. The Senate passed a bill in June 2019 authorizing DOE to develop consent-based pilot interim storage facilities for spent nuclear fuel. The FY2019 appropriations bill (H.R. 5895) passed by the Senate on June 25, 2018 includes provisions for pilot storage facilities for spent nuclear fuel. Priority for storage at these facilities would be given to fuel from closed nuclear plant sites. The Department of Energy (DOE) would need consent from the governor of the host state, local jurisdictions, and affected Indian tribes before selecting a site. DOE must also report to Congress on compensation for host jurisdictions and recommend a mechanism for waste storage. The Senate's FY2019 appropriations bill includes provisions for pilot storage facilities for spent nuclear fuel, with priority given to fuel from closed nuclear plant sites. The Department of Energy would need consent from the governor of the host state, local jurisdictions, and affected Indian tribes before selecting a site. DOE would report to Congress on compensation for host jurisdictions and recommend a mechanism for waste storage. The House has not included provisions for consent-based siting in its Energy and Water bills. H.R. 3053 authorizes DOE to store spent nuclear fuel at interim storage facilities with consent from the governor, local government, and Indian tribes. Legislation in the 114th Congress aimed to implement BRC recommendations. In the 114th Congress, bipartisan legislation was introduced to implement major recommendations from the Blue Ribbon Commission (BRC) on nuclear waste management. The Nuclear Waste Administration Act of 2015 (S. 854) proposed establishing an independent Nuclear Waste Administration to find sites for nuclear waste storage and disposal facilities with consent from state, local officials, and affected Indian tribes. Holtec International filed an NRC license application for a spent fuel storage facility in New Mexico on a 1,000-acre site provided by a local government. Holtec International filed a license application for a spent fuel storage facility in New Mexico on a 1,000-acre site near the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant. The facility is planned to hold 10,000 canisters of spent fuel in below-grade concrete silos, developed in 20 phases over 20 years. Total storage capacity is expected to be about 120,000 metric tons. The waste management company Waste Control Specialists (WCS) filed an application for an NRC license to develop an interim storage facility for spent nuclear fuel in Texas. WCS later formed a joint venture with Orano USA called Waste Control Partners and submitted a renewed application for the Texas facility. The proposed WCS spent fuel storage facility would be built at a 14,000-acre site near Andrews, TX, with a total storage capacity of about 120,000 metric tons. Control Partners submitted a renewed application for the Texas facility on June 11, 2018. The proposed WCS spent fuel storage facility would be built at a 14,000-acre site near Andrews, TX, with DOE taking title to spent fuel at nuclear plant sites and paying WCS for storage for up to 40 years. The proposed WCS spent fuel storage facility in Texas would offer storage for up to 40 years, funded by DOE through the Nuclear Waste Fund. Legislation has been introduced to authorize DOE to contract with non-federal interim storage facilities for spent fuel. The House passed legislation (H.R. 3053) related to nuclear waste storage. A bill (H.R. 474) introduced by Representative Issa is similar to previous bills but not enacted. DOE could take title to spent nuclear fuel and use interest from the Nuclear Waste Fund for private interim storage. The Trump Administration's FY2018 budget requested new funding for Yucca Mountain. The Trump Administration is seeking funding for Yucca Mountain in FY2019, with $110 million for DOE to seek an NRC license and $47.7 million for NRC to consider the application. An additional $10 million would go towards developing interim nuclear waste storage facilities. Total funding of $120 million would come from two appropriations accounts. The FY2019 funding for Yucca Mountain includes $120 million from two appropriations accounts: $90 million for Nuclear Waste Disposal and $30 million for Defense Nuclear Waste Disposal. The funding is part of the Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill, combined with other bills. The House passed a bill with $100 million more than requested for Yucca Mountain. The House passed a bill on June 8, 2018, with $100 million more than requested for Yucca Mountain. The Senate version passed on June 25, 2018, included no Yucca Mountain funding. DOE stopped collecting nuclear waste fees in 2014 due to a court ruling, leading to uncertainty about the future of the nuclear waste program. The U.S. Court of Appeals ordered DOE to stop collecting fees for nuclear waste disposal, totaling about $750 million per year. DOE's waste plans are too vague for cost estimation, with an uncertainty range of nearly $7 trillion. The U.S. Court of Appeals ordered DOE to stop collecting fees for nuclear waste disposal, totaling about $750 million per year, citing DOE's vague waste plans with an uncertainty range of nearly $7 trillion. The Trump Administration planned to restart the Yucca Mountain program and conduct a new cost assessment for determining the waste fee. NRC approved a final rule on continued storage of spent nuclear fuel to replace its earlier \"waste confidence\" rule. The NRC approved a final rule on continued storage of spent nuclear fuel on August 26, 2014, replacing the earlier \"waste confidence\" rule that was struck down by the U.S. Court of Appeals. The court ruled that NRC should have conducted an environmental review before issuing the waste confidence findings. The court ruled that NRC should have conducted an environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act before issuing waste confidence findings in December 2010. NRC halted licensing of new facilities generating radioactive waste after the rule was struck down. NRC ended its suspension of final licensing decisions for new reactors and spent fuel storage facilities in August 2014. In 2014, NRC lifted its suspension on final licensing decisions for new reactors and spent fuel storage facilities. A lawsuit challenging NRC's storage rule was rejected by the U.S. Court of Appeals in 2016. NRC proposed changes to low-level waste disposal regulations in 2015, primarily containing low concentrations of radioactive materials. The final version of the regulations was submitted for commission approval in 2016. The NRC staff submitted final regulations for commission approval in 2016, with further revisions issued in 2017. The regulations aim to establish time periods for technical analyses of low-level waste sites to protect the general population. Nuclear waste disposal remains a significant challenge for the industry. The controversy surrounding nuclear power revolves around the lack of a disposal system for highly radioactive spent fuel. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act mandates the focus on Yucca Mountain, NV, as a repository, despite strong opposition from Nevada citing safety concerns. The State of Nevada strongly opposes the Yucca Mountain repository for nuclear waste due to safety concerns such as potential volcanic activity, earthquakes, and water infiltration. Despite opposition, the DOE determined the site suitable for a repository under the George W. Bush Administration. The DOE submitted a license application to the NRC in 2008, projecting waste acceptance to begin in 2020, 22 years later than the original goal set by the NWPA. The Obama Administration decided not to open the Yucca Mountain repository due to Nevada's opposition, halting funding and closing the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management in FY2011. The Yucca Mountain project was shut down in FY2010, with remaining functions transferred to the Office of Nuclear Energy. President Trump plans to restart the licensing process, requesting $120 million for Yucca Mountain in his FY2019 budget submission. In his FY2019 budget submission, President Trump requested $110 million for DOE to seek an NRC license for the Yucca Mountain repository, with an additional $47.7 million for NRC to consider the application. DOE also received $10 million for interim nuclear waste storage facilities. Under the Obama Administration, a motion was filed to withdraw the Yucca Mountain license application \"with prejudice,\" preventing its resubmission to NRC in the future. The DOE's motion to withdraw the Yucca Mountain license application received support from Nevada but opposition from states with defense-related and civilian radioactive waste. State utility regulators also intervened, arguing that dismissing the application would hinder the government's obligation to dispose of nuclear waste. The ASLB denied DOE's license withdrawal motion in 2010, ruling that the NWPA prohibits withdrawal until NRC determines repository acceptability. NRC commissioners upheld the decision in 2011, but halted further consideration due to budget constraints. Lawsuits were filed to overturn the withdrawal, with the U.S. Court of Appeals ruling in 2013 that NRC must continue work on Yucca Mountain. The U.S. Court of Appeals ruled in 2013 that NRC must continue work on the Yucca Mountain license application as long as funding is available. NRC directed its staff to complete the Yucca Mountain safety evaluation report in response, issuing Volume 3 of the report in October 2014. The NRC issued Volume 3 of the Yucca Mountain Safety Evaluation Report in October 2014, stating that the proposed repository design would comply with safety standards for 1 million years. The final two volumes of the report were issued in January 2015. The staff recommended not authorizing construction until all land and water rights requirements were met and a supplement to the environmental impact statement was completed. The supplemental EIS was completed in May 2016, and the licensing documents for Yucca Mountain were made publicly available. The DOE's environmental impact statement (EIS) and NRC's supplemental EIS for Yucca Mountain were completed. NRC made its licensing documents publicly available using remaining funds. Additional appropriations of $330 million are needed to complete the licensing process. The Obama Administration halted the Yucca Mountain project in 2010 and established the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future to explore alternative waste disposal strategies. The Obama Administration established the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future in 2010 to develop alternative nuclear waste disposal strategies. The BRC recommended creating a new organization to develop waste repositories and storage facilities using a consent-based process. The DOE issued its Strategy for a new nuclear waste program in response to the BRC report. The DOE issued a Strategy for the Management and Disposal of Nuclear Waste in response to the Blue Ribbon Commission's recommendations. The strategy called for a new nuclear waste management entity to develop consent-based storage and disposal sites, with plans for a pilot interim storage facility by 2021 and a geologic disposal facility by 2048. The DOE plans to open a storage facility by 2025 and a geologic disposal facility by 2048. Public input is being sought for a consent-based siting process, with issues such as fairness, site-selection models, participant roles, information requirements, and other concerns being addressed. The DOE issued a draft consent-based siting process on January 12, 2017, with five phases: initiation and community outreach, preliminary site assessment for interim storage and permanent repository, and detailed site assessment upon request by interested communities. Phase 3 involves a detailed site assessment taking 2-4 years for interim storage and 5-10 years for a repository. Communities with suitable sites decide on hosting facilities. Phase 4 includes an agreement lasting 1-2 years for interim storage and 2-5 years for a repository, negotiated between the potential host community and waste management agency. Phase 5 covers licensing, construction, operation, and closure. Phase 5 involves licensing, construction, operation, and closure of the storage facility or repository. Licensing and construction timelines are estimated at up to 5 years for interim storage and 15 years for a repository. The Trump Administration's proposal includes funding for the Yucca Mountain project, legal and technical support for the license application, and management of necessary documents. The Trump Administration's proposal includes funding for a Yucca Mountain program office, legal and technical support for the license application, and management of documents. The request for $10 million for interim storage involves planning for storage services, transportation, and waste shipments. The nuclear power industry supports completing NRC's licensing review of Yucca Mountain and pursuing alternative storage facilities with a target opening date within 20 years of a consolidated storage site. The safety of geologic disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste in the United States relies on rock formations characteristics. Worldwide consensus supports long-term isolation of radioactive materials until they decay to safe levels. The best long-term option for dealing with high-level radioactive waste is geologic isolation, but specific sites face challenges such as water intrusion and earthquake vulnerability that could release radioactivity into the environment. The challenges of geologic isolation for high-level radioactive waste include the risk of flaws like water intrusion or earthquake vulnerability that could release radioactivity. President Obama's budgets have supported research on technologies to reduce waste volume and toxicity. The Bush Administration proposed large-scale facilities to reprocess and recycle spent nuclear fuel by separating long-lived elements like plutonium. However, reprocessing has been controversial due to cost concerns and potential weapons use. The Obama Administration shifted nuclear waste research towards fundamental science, while the Trump Administration's FY2019 budget request aimed to reduce funding. The Trump Administration's FY2019 budget request would sharply reduce DOE funding for nuclear spent fuel reprocessing, focusing on a long-term, science-based approach. President Bush recommended the Yucca Mountain site to Congress in 2002, facing a state veto from Nevada Governor Guinn. The state veto could have blocked further repository development at Yucca Mountain without Congressional approval within 90 days. President Bush signed an approval resolution for the Yucca Mountain site in 2002, allowing for further repository development within 90 days of Congressional approval. Civilian low-level waste is currently disposed of in trenches in South Carolina, Texas, and Washington, with the Washington facility only accepting waste from its region. The Washington facility does not accept waste from outside its region, and the South Carolina site is available only to the three members of the Atlantic disposal compact. A Utah commercial disposal facility accepts the lowest-concentration class of low-level radioactive waste from anywhere in the United States. Threats by states to close their disposal facilities led to congressional authorization of regional compacts for low-level waste disposal in 1985. The first new disposal site under the regional compact system opened on November 10, 2011, near Andrews. The Texas Legislature approved legislation in May 2011 to allow up to 30% of the facility's capacity to be used by states outside the Texas Compact, which consists of Texas and Vermont. NWPA Section 302 authorized DOE to enter into contracts with U.S. generators of spent nuclear fuel and other highly radioactive waste for disposal. The act prohibited nuclear reactors from operating without a waste disposal contract with DOE. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act required nuclear reactors to have a waste disposal contract with the DOE. When the DOE missed the deadline for waste disposal, nuclear utilities began filing lawsuits to recover storage costs. The first settlement was reached with PECO Energy Company in 2000. The DOE reached a settlement with PECO Energy Company in 2000, allowing them to retain up to $80 million in nuclear waste fee revenues over 10 years. Other utilities sued the DOE, arguing that waste fees should only be used for the waste program, not as compensation for missed disposal deadlines. The U.S. Court of Appeals ruled in 2002 that compensation must come from sources other than the waste fund, leading to payments from the U.S. Treasury's Judgment Fund. Subsequent nuclear waste compensation to utilities has come from the U.S. Treasury's Judgment Fund, totaling about $6.9 billion by FY2017. 39 lawsuits settled and 46 cases received final court judgments, representing utilities generating 84% of U.S. nuclear electricity. By the end of FY2017, 39 lawsuits had been settled, representing utilities generating 84% of U.S. nuclear electricity. Utilities submit annual reimbursement claims to DOE for delay-related nuclear waste storage costs. Disagreements go to arbitration. Utilities not settled with DOJ seek compensation through U.S. Court of Federal Claims for damages resulting from DOE's nuclear waste delays. Court of Claims awards cover only past damages. The U.S. Court of Federal Claims awards cover only past damages incurred from DOE's nuclear waste delays. DOE's potential liabilities for waste program delays could reach $34.1 billion, including $6.9 billion already paid in settlements. Delays in waste disposal could lead to future environmental enforcement actions over DOE's high-level waste and spent fuel. The U.S. Court of Federal Claims awards cover past damages from DOE's nuclear waste delays, with potential liabilities reaching $34.1 billion. Delays in waste disposal could result in future environmental enforcement actions over DOE's high-level waste and spent fuel, stored in noncompliance with state and federal laws. After DOE halted the Yucca Mountain project, the nuclear industry and state utility regulators sued to stop further collection of nuclear waste fees. A federal court agreed with the waste-fee opponents, suspending fee collections in May 2014. Petitions to end the fees were filed by the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC) and the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) in 2010, arguing that the $750 million per year fees should not be collected without a nuclear waste disposal solution. The nuclear industry and state utility regulators sued to stop collecting nuclear waste fees, arguing that the fees should not be collected while the federal government's waste disposal program is halted. Energy Secretary Steven Chu determined that excess funds were not being collected for future disposal activities. The U.S. Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Secretary Chu's determination on June 1, 2012. The U.S. Court of Appeals ordered Energy Secretary Chu to conduct a more thorough study of nuclear waste fees within six months, stating that the fees should consider alternative costs and timing. This decision came after the termination of the Yucca Mountain site by the Obama Administration. The U.S. Court of Appeals ordered Energy Secretary Chu to evaluate the costs of various waste management scenarios in a new fee adequacy assessment. The assessment showed that some scenarios exceeded projected revenues by $2 trillion, while others resulted in a surplus of up to $5 trillion. Due to these varying results, DOE concluded that there was no clear evidence to immediately raise or lower the fee. NEI and NARUC requested a review of the assessment, leading to the Circuit Court ordering a review. The Circuit Court ordered DOE to stop collecting nuclear waste fees due to the uncertainty in DOE's waste plans and cost estimates. As a result, DOE ceased collecting fees from nuclear power generators in May 2014. The Trump Administration planned to restart the Yucca Mountain program. The court ruling led to DOE halting nuclear waste fee collection from power generators in 2014. The Trump Administration planned to revive the Yucca Mountain program, conducting a new fee assessment based on previous cost estimates. DOE filed a motion to withdraw the Yucca Mountain license application with NRC's ASLB in 2010, arguing for termination of the licensing process. The Department of Energy (DOE) filed a motion to withdraw the Yucca Mountain license application with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's Atomic Safety and Licensing Board (ASLB) on March 3, 2010. The motion argued for termination of the licensing process due to the Secretary of Energy's decision that a geologic repository at Yucca Mountain is not a feasible option for long-term nuclear waste disposal. The Obama Administration's policy change was driven by challenges in overcoming opposition from Nevada and a desire to find a waste solution with greater public acceptance. The DOE filed a motion to withdraw the Yucca Mountain license application, but the ASLB denied it, stating that the NWPA prohibits withdrawal until NRC determines the repository's acceptability. The board emphasized that Congress did not intend for DOE to unilaterally terminate the review process. The DOE appealed the ASLB decision to terminate the Yucca Mountain review process, arguing that the Secretary of Energy has the authority to make policy decisions regarding nuclear waste disposal. After deliberation, the NRC commissioners sustained the licensing. After a year of deliberation, the NRC commissioners upheld the denial of the license withdrawal for Yucca Mountain on a tie vote. NRC stopped further consideration due to budget constraints. Plaintiffs, including Nye County, NV, petitioned the court to compel NRC to continue licensing proceedings. The Court of Appeals ruled in 2013 that NRC must continue work on the Yucca Mountain license application if funding is available. The Court of Appeals ruled in 2013 that NRC must continue work on the Yucca Mountain license application as long as funding was available. NRC completed its Safety Evaluation Report in January 2015 and used remaining funds for a supplemental EIS and licensing database. Additional funding of about $330 million would be needed for NRC to complete the Yucca Mountain licensing review. The Trump Administration proposes to resume consideration of the NRC license for Yucca Mountain, with estimated costs of $330 million for NRC and $1.9 billion for DOE. DOE's FY2018 budget includes $110 million for a Yucca Mountain program office and $30 million for NRC to restart adjudicatory proceedings. The NRC is requesting an additional $30 million to restart the ASLB adjudicatory proceeding related to issuing licenses for nuclear reactors and waste storage facilities. NRC's Waste Confidence Decision in 1984 stated that nuclear waste could be safely stored at reactor sites for at least 30 years after plant closure, with a permanent repository planned for 2007-2009. DOE's schedule for opening a nuclear waste repository has been delayed, causing NRC to update its plans. The NRC updated its Waste Confidence Decision in 1990, predicting a repository would be available by the early 21st century. The 2010 waste confidence rule stated waste could be stored at reactor sites for 60 years after shutdown. Lawsuits were filed against this rule by New York and environmental groups. The 2010 waste confidence rule allowed for safe storage of waste at reactor sites for at least 60 years after shutdown. Lawsuits were filed against this rule, leading to a court ruling that NRC must conduct an environmental review of the decision. The court found flaws in NRC's rulemaking process regarding permanent storage of nuclear waste. NRC failed to calculate environmental effects of not securing permanent storage and did not properly examine future dangers of storing spent fuel on site for sixty years after a plant's license expires. NRC's final rule on continued storage was approved in August 2014 after a two-year halt in licensing new facilities producing nuclear waste. The NRC's final rule on continued storage of spent nuclear fuel was approved in August 2014 after a two-year halt in licensing new facilities producing nuclear waste. The new rule describes environmental effects of various periods of waste storage based on a generic environmental impact statement. The GEIS analyzed the environmental effects of three potential time periods of storage before a permanent repository would become available: \"short-term timeframe,\" \"long-term timeframe,\" and an \"indefinite timeframe.\" It assumed active management and oversight of spent fuel with replacement of canisters and casks every 100 years. The environmental impact of storing spent fuel for different time frames was deemed minimal. A lawsuit to overturn the NRC's storage rule was rejected by the U.S. Court of Appeals. The termination of work on the Yucca Mountain repository by the Obama Administration sparked congressional controversy. President Trump proposed restarting the project. The House consistently voted to continue or restore Yucca Mountain funding, while the Senate repeatedly zeroed it out, with President Obama's support. President Trump's proposal to restart the Yucca Mountain licensing process has changed the dynamics of the congressional debate on nuclear waste. The 115th Congress has not provided new funding for Yucca Mountain, with the House approving funds for the project in FY2018 but the Senate not doing so. No funds were included in the enacted appropriations bill. In FY2019 appropriations legislation, the House included $100 million above the Administration's Yucca Mountain funding request, while the Senate did not provide any funds. Senator Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada raised concerns about nuclear waste during the confirmation hearing for former Texas Governor Rick Perry to be the Secretary of Energy. Senator Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada expressed her opposition to Yucca Mountain as a nuclear waste site during the confirmation process for Secretary of Energy Rick Perry. Despite differences on other issues, she believes Perry understands the importance of this issue and can work together to prevent Yucca Mountain from being used. The Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2017 (H.R. 3053) passed the House on May 10, 2018. The Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2017 (H.R. 3053) passed the House on May 10, 2018. It would withdraw the Yucca Mountain repository site from public lands laws, increase its capacity to 110,000 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel, and authorize storage at an interim facility. The House-passed bill increased the capacity of the Yucca Mountain repository to 110,000 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel, compared to the 80,000 metric tons stored at U.S. nuclear plants. It included changes such as eliminating mandatory funding provisions and addressing criticism of the Nuclear Waste Fund being used for deficit reduction. The bill passed by the House would have provided mandatory funding for repository development and allowed nuclear waste fee collections to offset program appropriations. It specified the use of Monitored Retrievable Storage facilities for interim storage of spent nuclear fuel before disposal in a permanent repository. The Department of Energy would be authorized to site, construct, and operate these facilities. The bill passed by the House authorized the Department of Energy to operate Monitored Retrievable Storage facilities for interim storage of spent nuclear fuel. DOE could also work with nonfederal entities to develop MRS facilities, but only after NRC licensing and state approval. The bill authorized the Department of Energy to operate Monitored Retrievable Storage facilities for interim storage of spent nuclear fuel. Nonfederal entities could develop MRS facilities with approval from NRC, state, and local authorities. Priority for shipment to an MRS would be given to spent fuel from closed reactors. The bill authorizes the Department of Energy to operate Monitored Retrievable Storage facilities for interim storage of spent nuclear fuel. Priority for shipment to an MRS would be given to fuel from closed reactors. Appropriations for an MRS would come from the general fund, not the Nuclear Waste Fund. Construction of an MRS facility could only begin after approval for the Yucca Mountain repository. The proposed Yucca Mountain repository, located on federal land, would be affected if the repository license were revoked, leading to a halt in construction. H.R. 3053 aims to permanently withdraw the site from federal public land laws and transfer jurisdiction to the Secretary of Energy for development activities. The Yucca Mountain site is proposed to be withdrawn from federal public land laws for the development of a nuclear waste repository. This withdrawal is necessary for the Department of Energy to obtain a license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The repository would not be subject to certain hazardous waste requirements, and a decision on construction authorization must be made within 30 days. The Yucca Mountain repository must comply with hazardous waste requirements. The final decision on construction authorization must be made within 30 months. DOE can conduct infrastructure activities before the decision. The limit on spent nuclear fuel disposal would increase to 110,000 metric tons. DOE is prohibited from planning a separate repository until NRC's final decision. The DOE is prohibited from planning a separate repository for defense-related high level waste and spent fuel until NRC reaches a final decision on the Yucca Mountain repository. The Secretary of Energy cannot resume collecting nuclear waste fees until NRC approves or disapproves the construction authorization for Yucca Mountain. Total collections of nuclear waste fees would be limited to 90% of each fiscal year's appropriations for the DOE nuclear waste management program. Unpaid fees may be required to be paid when deemed necessary. The DOE nuclear waste management program's appropriations are limited to 90% of each fiscal year's collections. Unpaid fees may need to be paid as deemed necessary by the Secretary. Fees collected after enactment would offset program appropriations, ensuring a net zero impact on discretionary funding allocations. The existing balance of the Nuclear Waste Fund remains available for appropriation without offsets. The Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill allows the existing balance of the Nuclear Waste Fund to be available for appropriation without offsets. The Secretary of Energy can enter into a benefits agreement with Nevada for annual payments of $15 million before fuel is received at Yucca Mountain, an increase from $10 million. Nevada would also receive $400 million. The Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill allows the Nuclear Waste Fund balance to be appropriated without offsets. Nevada would receive $400 million upon the first spent fuel receipt at Yucca Mountain, with annual payments increasing to $40 million. Benefits agreements could be reached with local governments, subject to congressional appropriation. Acceptance of a benefits agreement does not imply consent to host the repository. The Director of the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM) would oversee functions related to nuclear waste management, reporting directly to the Secretary of Energy. The Director could serve up to two five-year terms and could only be removed by the President for specific reasons. This transfer of responsibilities would ensure efficient management of nuclear waste. The Nuclear Waste Informed Consent Act would transfer nuclear waste management functions to OCRWM and require consent from State and local governments before expenditures from the Nuclear Waste Fund. Senator Heller and Representative Titus introduced the legislation for a consent-based approach to siting nuclear waste repositories. The Sensible Nuclear Waste Disposition Act (H.R. 433) introduced by Representative Joe Wilson would require a consent-based approach to siting nuclear waste repositories, following recommendations from the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future. The bill would delay the development of a repository for defense nuclear waste until a final decision is made on the Yucca Mountain repository. Private-sector interim storage facilities are also being proposed in Texas and New Mexico. A bill (H.R. 474) introduced by Representative Issa authorizes DOE to contract with private spent fuel storage facilities. The Interim Consolidated Storage Act of 2017 is similar to previous legislation but not enacted, allowing DOE to take title to spent nuclear fuel from commercial reactors. In the 114th Congress, Representatives Conaway and Mulvaney introduced legislation (not enacted) for DOE to take title to spent nuclear fuel from commercial reactors at private storage facilities. Annual interest from the Nuclear Waste Fund could be used by DOE to pay for private interim storage. Representative Lowey introduced the Removing Nuclear Waste from our Communities Act of 2017 (H.R. 4442) to authorize DOE to store spent fuel at privately owned consolidated storage facilities. Priority would be given to nuclear plant sites with no current storage options. Legislation introduced in November 2017 authorizes DOE to store spent fuel from nuclear plants at privately owned consolidated storage facilities. Priority is given to sites with no operating reactors and a large population nearby. Senator Duckworth and Representative Schneider introduced bills to provide assistance to communities with stored spent fuel, offering financial incentives and tax credits. The bills introduced by Senator Duckworth and Representative Schneider aim to provide assistance to communities with stranded nuclear waste. This includes reviving a tax credit for first-time homebuyers in these communities, making them eligible for the New Markets Tax Credit, establishing a task force to simplify the process of applying for government assistance, and requiring the DOE to explore alternative options for hosting decommissioned nuclear waste. The Dry Cask Storage Act of 2018 (H.R. 4891) introduced in the 115th Congress aims to move spent nuclear fuel from storage pools to dry storage facilities within seven years of NRC-approved plans being submitted. This addresses concerns about the risks posed by spent fuel storage pools in nuclear power plants. The Dry Cask Storage Act of 2018 (H.R. 4891) requires spent fuel to be transferred to dry storage facilities within seven years of NRC-approved plans. Emergency planning zones would expand to 50 miles around non-compliant reactors. NRC can use interest from the Nuclear Waste Fund for grants to facilitate the transfer. H.R. 4891, similar to previous legislation, aims to establish an independent Nuclear Waste Administration for developing nuclear waste storage and disposal facilities with consent required for siting. The Nuclear Waste Administration (NWA) was proposed to develop storage and disposal facilities for nuclear waste, requiring consent from state, local, and tribal governments. The mission plan included opening a pilot storage facility by 2021 for priority waste and a permanent repository by 2048. The Nuclear Waste Administration (NWA) planned to open a waste storage facility by 2025 and a permanent repository by 2048. NWA could issue requests for proposals for storage facilities only after 10 years of funding for the repository development. Financial compensation and incentives would be offered for hosting storage and disposal facilities, with preference given to sites with both storage and repository facilities. President Obama authorized the DOE to pursue a defense-only repository on March 24, 2015, under S. 854. Nuclear waste fees collected after the bill's enactment were to be held in a Working Capital Fund for the Nuclear Waste Administration to draw from as needed. The Nuclear Waste Administration could immediately draw from a newly established Working Capital Fund for S. 854. The disposal limit of 70,000 metric tons for the first repository under NWPA would be repealed. Energy Secretary Ernest J. Moniz supported S. 1240 as a promising framework. NARUC Electricity Committee Chairman David C. Boyd viewed the bill as a step in the right direction. S. 1240 is seen as a promising framework by Energy Secretary Ernest J. Moniz and NARUC Electricity Committee Chairman David C. Boyd. However, Natural Resources Defense Council Senior Attorney Geoffrey H. Fettus opposes the bill due to concerns about temporary waste storage facilities and states' authority to regulate repository safety. S. 854 requires actions on a permanent repository before siting a storage facility for nonpriority waste. The Senate approved initial funding for DOE to develop a consent-based waste storage pilot facility. The Senate bill included an authorization and a $10.0 million appropriation for DOE to develop a consent-based waste storage pilot facility. Similar language was included in previous Energy and Water bills, but corresponding House appropriations bills have not included such authorization. The Senate FY2015 Energy and Water bill approved an authorization for a waste storage pilot facility, influenced by the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident. The House appropriations bills have not included this authorization. The Senate approved a bill for a waste storage pilot facility after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident. Senator Barbara Boxer introduced a bill requiring NRC to maintain safety at closed reactors until spent fuel is moved to dry storage, but it was not enacted. NRC's study found that expedited transfer of spent fuel to dry cask storage would provide limited safety benefits and not be cost-effective.

NRC's study found that expedited transfer of spent fuel to dry cask storage would provide limited safety benefits and not be cost-effective. Radioactive waste varies in characteristics, some decaying quickly while others remain dangerous for thousands of years. Major types include spent nuclear fuel. Spent nuclear fuel, the most radioactive type of civilian nuclear waste, contains hot fission products and long-lived radionuclides. It is fuel rods withdrawn from a reactor after irradiation, and can no longer sustain a nuclear chain reaction. High-level waste from spent fuel reprocessing contains radioactive fission products and requires isolation for thousands of years. Transuranic waste is lower in activity but still poses a risk. Transuranic waste, which contains long-lived radioactive elements heavier than uranium, requires isolation for 10,000 years or more. Radiation shielding may be needed for handling some types of this waste, primarily due to the presence of plutonium. In the United States, transuranic waste is mainly generated from nuclear weapons production processes. The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) in Carlsbad, NM, is the nation's only permanent repository for this type of waste. The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) in Carlsbad, NM, resumed underground waste emplacement in 2017 after a radioactive release. Low-level waste, not classified as high-level or transuranic waste, is also disposed of at the site. NRC has established four classes of low-level waste based on radioactivity levels. The NRC has established four classes of low-level waste based on radioactivity levels, ranging from least radioactive to most radioactive. Low-level waste contains relatively low concentrations of radioactivity that decays quickly. Low-level waste disposal facilities have concentration limits set by the NRC. Uranium mill tailings are sand-like residues from uranium ore processing with low radioactivity but large volumes that can pose hazards like radon emissions and groundwater contamination. Mixed waste includes chemically hazardous materials. Mixed waste includes radioactive material along with chemically hazardous waste. This type of waste poses institutional challenges as the radioactive portion is regulated by the DOE or NRC under the Atomic Energy Act, while the nonradioactive elements are regulated by the EPA and states under the RCRA. Spent nuclear fuel removal from reactors is also a part of this category. When spent nuclear fuel is removed from a reactor, it is thermally hot and highly radioactive, in the form of fuel assemblies containing metal-clad fuel rods. Fresh fuel rods contain enriched uranium, but after nuclear fission, most U-235 nuclei have split into highly radioactive fission products. After nuclear fission in the reactor, U-235 nuclei split into radioactive fission products. Some U-238 nuclei become radioactive plutonium. Spent fuel assemblies are stored in water pools to prevent overheating and protect workers. Older fuel is sealed in dry canisters and transferred to shielded storage facilities. NRC regulations govern this process. The NRC requires spent fuel to cool for 7-10 years before transferring it to dry storage. Currently, spent fuel from U.S. commercial nuclear reactors is stored at various sites, including 59 operating nuclear plant sites, 15 shutdown plant sites, and the Idaho National Laboratory. On average, a large commercial nuclear reactor discharges 20-30 metric tons of spent fuel per year, totaling about 2,200 metric tons annually for the entire U.S. nuclear power industry over the past two decades. A recent report estimates that approximately 80,000 metric tons of spent fuel are in storage. The U.S. nuclear power industry has been storing about 2,200 metric tons of spent fuel per year for the past two decades. A recent report estimates that there are approximately 80,000 metric tons of spent fuel stored at U.S. nuclear plants, with 30,000 metric tons in dry casks. This amount exceeds the 70,000-metric-ton limit for Yucca Mountain, even without including 7,000 metric tons of DOE spent fuel and high-level waste planned for disposal. The storage of spent fuel will continue to increase until an interim storage facility or permanent repository is established. The amount of spent fuel stored at nuclear plant sites will continue to grow until an interim storage facility or permanent repository is opened. DOE estimates that 105,000 to 130,000 metric tons of spent fuel from existing U.S. reactors may need disposal. New storage capacity will be needed if waste cannot be accepted into the disposal system. Utilities are expected to build new dry storage capacity at reactor sites. The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, raised concerns about the vulnerability of stored spent fuel. An aircraft crash or sabotage could cause overheating, leading to the release of hazardous radioactivity. NRC's report in January 2001 highlighted the risk of zirconium alloy cladding catching fire in such scenarios. The NRC report in January 2001 warned of the risk of zirconium alloy cladding catching fire in spent fuel, while the NAS report in April 2005 stated that successful terrorist attacks on spent fuel pools are possible. Recommendations included interspersing hotter and cooler fuel assemblies, installing spray systems, and transferring fuel to dry cask storage to reduce the risk of fires. The nuclear industry suggests installing spray systems above spent fuel pools and transferring more fuel to dry cask storage to reduce the risk of fires. The NRC's 2013 report found minor safety benefits in expedited transfers of fuel. The safety of spent fuel pools is being examined by an NRC task force in light of lessons from the Fukushima accident. The task force identified lessons from the Fukushima accident for U.S. nuclear power plant regulation, recommending improved electrical power and water spray systems for spent fuel pools. NRC approved an order for reactors to install better water-level monitoring equipment. In 2017, 5.1 million cubic feet of low-level waste with 57,179 curies of radioactivity was sent to disposal sites. In 2017, 57,179 curies of radioactivity were shipped as low-level waste to disposal sites. The volume and radioactivity can vary yearly based on nuclear decommissioning and cleanup activities. Low-level waste is categorized into Class A, B, and C, with Class A constituting most of the volume and classes B and C containing the majority of radioactivity. Most low-level waste is categorized into Class A, B, and C for disposal. Class A waste makes up the majority of the volume, while classes B and C contain most of the radioactivity. The nation's Class B and C waste has been stored on-site since June 2008 due to the lack of a permanent disposal site. The disposal of spent fuel and high-level waste is a federal responsibility, with states authorized to develop disposal facilities for commercial low-level waste. The Yucca Mountain repository was halted by the Obama Administration after FY2010, but it remains the sole candidate site for civilian highly radioactive waste disposal under current law. The Trump Administration is proposing changes in this area. The Trump Administration is proposing to revive the Yucca Mountain repository for highly radioactive waste disposal, requesting funding for both Yucca Mountain and interim nuclear waste storage. Under the Obama Administration, an alternative waste management strategy was proposed, including a pilot facility for spent fuel storage by 2021 and a new repository by 2048. New legislation would have been needed to implement the Obama strategy. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 established a system for selecting a geologic repository for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste. DOE's Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM) was created to carry out the program, funded by the Nuclear Waste Fund. The fee for the program was set at a tenth of a cent per kilowatt-hour. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 established a fee for the program, funded by the Nuclear Waste Fund, to select a geologic repository for high-level waste disposal. The fee can be adjusted by the Secretary of Energy based on projected costs. DOE was required to choose three candidate sites for the repository, but the act was modified in 1987. The 1987 amendments to the Nuclear Waste Policy Act designated Yucca Mountain, Nevada as the only candidate site for a permanent high-level waste repository. If Yucca Mountain cannot be licensed, DOE must seek further instructions from Congress. The amendments also allowed for the construction of a monitored retrievable storage facility for spent fuel, but DOE cannot select a site for this facility until recommending the construction of a permanent repository. The law prohibits the selection of a Monitored Retrievable Storage (MRS) site until a permanent repository is recommended to the President. The Obama Administration halted funding for the Yucca Mountain project and transferred responsibilities to DOE's Office of Nuclear Energy. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future was established to develop a new waste management strategy. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future recommended a new, consent-based approach to siting nuclear waste facilities, stating that the existing policy with Yucca Mountain as the sole candidate site has broken down. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future recommended a new, consent-based approach to siting nuclear waste facilities through extensive negotiations with affected parties, aiming to avoid controversy and litigation. The Blue Ribbon Commission recommended a new waste management program, citing the success of the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico. They proposed establishing a federally chartered corporation independent from Administration control. The Blue Ribbon Commission recommended the establishment of a congressionally chartered federal corporation for nuclear waste management, with assured access to funds and congressional oversight. They also called for the development of a permanent underground repository and interim storage facilities. The Blue Ribbon Commission recommended establishing a federal corporation for nuclear waste management with access to funds and oversight. They also suggested developing a permanent underground repository and interim storage facilities. In response, the DOE issued a strategy for managing and disposing of nuclear waste, including opening a pilot interim spent fuel storage facility. The DOE issued a strategy in January 2013 for managing and disposing of nuclear waste, including plans for a pilot interim spent fuel storage facility by 2021 and a larger-scale facility by 2025. The strategy aims to prevent the storage facility from becoming a de facto repository, but current restrictions make it difficult to build the facility. The DOE strategy aims to prevent the storage facility from becoming a de facto repository. Current NWPA restrictions make it challenging to build the facility. The strategy recommends not overly restricting progress on a pilot or larger storage facility. A geologic disposal facility is planned to open by 2048, 50 years after the Yucca Mountain repository's initial planned opening date. Site selection is set for 2016, with completion of site suitability studies, design, and licensing by 2042. The Yucca Mountain repository's opening date is to be selected by 2016, with site suitability studies, design, and licensing to be completed by 2042. The proposed storage and disposal facilities will be selected through a \"consent based\" process, with few details on implementation provided in the DOE strategy. The Obama Administration will consult with Congress and interest groups on defining consent and ratification. The \"Draft Consent-Based Siting Process\" was issued on January 12, 2017. The Obama Administration proposed a new nuclear waste management entity without specifying its nature. Senator Alexander introduced a bill in the 114th Congress (S. 854) to modify the waste program. Other proposals suggested privatizing waste management services. DOE recommended testing in a report issued in October 2014. The Obama Administration proposed a new nuclear waste management entity, while other proposals suggested privatizing waste management services. In October 2014, DOE issued a report recommending testing a consent-based approach for siting a separate repository solely for defense and research waste, which would not be subject to the Yucca Mountain siting requirement. This idea would reverse the long-standing federal policy of a single repository holding both civilian and defense high-level waste and spent fuel. The Obama Administration proposed a new nuclear waste management entity, while DOE recommended a separate repository for defense and research waste, diverging from the previous policy of a single repository for all high-level waste. President Obama authorized planning for an underground repository for high-level radioactive waste from nuclear defense activities in 2015. Obama authorized DOE to plan a separate underground repository for high-level radioactive waste from nuclear defense activities in 2015. GAO criticized DOE's analysis of the defense-only repository in 2017, leading to bills introduced to delay the plan. President Obama blocked DOE's preferred rail route to Yucca Mountain in 2015 but other potential routes were still available. Waste Control Specialists filed for an NRC license to develop a consolidated waste management facility in 2016. The waste management company Waste Control Specialists (WCS) filed an application on April 28, 2016, for an NRC license to develop a consolidated interim storage facility for spent nuclear fuel in Texas. WCS later formed a joint venture with Orano USA called Waste Control Partners and submitted a renewed application for the Texas facility on June 11, 2018. The proposed WCS spent fuel storage facility would be built at a 14,000-acre site near Andrews, TX. The proposed WCS spent fuel storage facility in Texas would consist of dry casks on concrete pads, with construction taking place in eight phases. Each phase could hold 5,000 metric tons of spent fuel, totaling a capacity of 40,000 metric tons. DOE would take title to the spent fuel at nuclear plant sites, transport it to the Texas site, and pay WCS for storage for up to 40 years with possible extensions. The proposed WCS spent fuel storage facility in Texas would consist of dry casks on concrete pads, with construction taking place in eight phases. DOE would transport spent fuel from nuclear plant sites to the Texas site and pay WCS for storage for up to 40 years with possible extensions. An NRC license application for a spent fuel storage facility in New Mexico was filed by Holtec International. Holtec International filed a license application for a spent fuel storage facility in New Mexico near the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant. Local officials support additional waste facilities at the site, originally planned for high-level waste storage. Conditions for accepting high-level waste and spent fuel at the WIPP site were discussed in a presentation by a New Mexico official in 2012. In 2012, conditions for accepting high-level waste and spent fuel at the WIPP site were discussed. Governor Martinez supported the efforts, but Senators Udall and Heinrich opposed an interim storage facility without a permanent disposal plan. A radioactive release in 2014 led to the suspension of disposal operations, impacting public support for expanded waste activities. The 2014 radioactive release from WIPP impacted public support for expanded waste activities. Interest in hosting nuclear waste sites has been expressed in Mississippi and Loving County, Texas. A bill to authorize DOE to enter contracts with privately owned spent fuel storage facilities was introduced in 2017. The Interim Consolidated Storage Act of 2017, introduced by Representative Issa, allows DOE to take title to spent nuclear fuel from commercial reactors for private storage. Annual interest from the Nuclear Waste Fund can be used by DOE to fund private interim storage. The bill has 33 cosponsors, including 14 from Texas. Provisions for a private-sector MRS facility are included in another bill (H.R. 3053) approved by the House Energy and Commerce Committee in June 2017. A private spent fuel storage facility was developed by a utility consortium with the Skull Valley Band of the Goshute Indians in Utah after DOE missed the 1998 deadline for taking nuclear waste. The Private Fuel Storage consortium obtained a 20-year license from the NRC in 2006 to store up to 44,000 tons of spent fuel in dry casks on tribal land. The Private Fuel Storage consortium submitted a license application to NRC on June 25, 1997, and received a 20-year license on February 21, 2006, to store up to 44,000 tons of spent fuel in dry casks. However, the Department of the Interior issued two decisions against the project on September 7, 2006, disapproving a proposed lease of tribal trust lands and rejecting necessary rights-of-way for waste transportation. The Skull Valley Band of Goshutes and PFS filed a federal lawsuit in 2007 to challenge Interior's decisions on waste transportation rights-of-way. A federal court ordered a reconsideration in 2010, but PFS requested to terminate its license in 2012. Despite efforts to shift focus, current law still centers on Yucca Mountain for nuclear waste disposal. The Obama Administration tried to redirect the high-level nuclear waste program, but current law still focuses on Yucca Mountain for civilian waste disposal. NWPA requires high-level waste repositories to be licensed by NRC according to EPA standards. DOE and NRC approve general siting guidelines for the repository. Waste transportation to storage sites is regulated by NRC and DOT. DOE shipments to Yucca Mountain and an MRS facility are under NWPA regulations. Transportation of waste to storage and disposal sites is regulated by NRC and DOT under NWPA. DOE shipments to Yucca Mountain and an MRS facility must use NRC-certified casks and comply with NRC requirements. Shipments also need to follow DOT regulations on routing, placarding, and safety. NRC's licensing requirements for Yucca Mountain require compliance with EPA's standards and establish procedures for seeking a repository license. The DOE must receive a construction authorization before being issued a license to bring nuclear waste to the Yucca Mountain repository. NRC requires a performance confirmation program to ensure systems are functioning as intended. Specific standards for Yucca Mountain were necessary due to concerns about meeting EPA's general standards. The Yucca Mountain standards were required to be consistent with a study by the National Academy of Sciences, which recommended limiting radiation dose to individuals near the repository. The standards focused on risk to individuals rather than specific limits on radioactive material releases. The study also considered the potential for human intrusion into the repository. The NAS study examined the potential for human intrusion into the repository and found no scientific basis for predicting human behavior thousands of years into the future. EPA proposed Yucca Mountain radiation protection standards in 1999, limiting annual radiation doses for the first 10,000 years of operation. EPA's standard aimed to reduce the risk of fatal cancer for the maximally exposed individual. EPA proposed Yucca Mountain radiation protection standards in 1999, limiting annual radiation doses for the first 10,000 years of repository operation. The final standards, issued on June 6, 2001, included provisions criticized by the nuclear industry as overly stringent and by environmental groups as too short-term. The final Yucca Mountain standards, issued by the EPA on June 6, 2001, included a 15 millirem overall exposure limit and a 4 millirem groundwater limit. Despite the DOE's opposition, the site was deemed able to meet these standards. The NRC revised its regulations to align with the EPA standards in September 2001. However, a U.S. Court of Appeals panel later struck down the 10,000-year regulatory compliance period in the standards. The appeals panel in 2004 overturned the 10,000-year compliance period in the Yucca Mountain standards, citing inconsistency with the NAS study. The court found that peak radioactive exposures would occur hundreds of thousands of years in the future. In response, the EPA proposed new standards in 2005. The EPA proposed new Yucca Mountain standards in 2005, with higher annual dose limits for the period of 10,000 years through 1 million years. Nevada officials criticized the leniency of the proposed standards. EPA issued a final rule in 2008, reducing the annual dose limit for the same period. The EPA issued a final rule in 2008 to amend the Yucca Mountain standards, reducing the annual dose limit from 350 to 100 millirems for the period of 10,000 through 1 million years. Compliance with the post-10,000-year standard will be based on the arithmetic mean of projected doses. NRC revised its licensing regulations to align with the new EPA standards in 2009. The NRC revised its repository licensing regulations in 2009 to align with new EPA standards, reducing the annual dose limit to 100 millirems for 10,000 through 1 million years. DOE's FSEIS for the Yucca Mountain repository estimated a maximum mean annual individual dose of 2 millirems after 10,000 years, a significant reduction from previous estimates. The FSEIS for the Yucca Mountain repository attributed a reduction in annual dose limit to changes in DOE's computer model and assumptions, with potential challenges in DOE's modeling approach during the NRC licensing process. DOE's Fuel Cycle Research and Development Program conducts research on technologies for managing spent nuclear fuel, including those related to the Obama Administration's waste strategy. The Trump Administration's FY2018 budget proposed $88.5 million for nuclear waste processing but eliminated funding for the Obama Administration's initiatives. The Trump Administration's FY2018 budget proposed $88.5 million for nuclear waste processing and related technologies, while eliminating funding for the Obama Administration's waste strategy. The FY2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act included $63.9 million for generic nuclear waste R&D and $22.5 million for integrated waste management activities. The FY2019 budget request includes $10 million for waste disposal R&D and zero for integrated waste management. The focus of the Fuel Cycle R&D program is on technology for reprocessing spent fuel to convert plutonium, uranium, and other radionuclides to faster-decaying fission products. The Fuel Cycle R&D program focuses on reprocessing spent fuel to convert plutonium, uranium, and other radionuclides to faster-decaying fission products. Nuclear utilities paid fees to the Nuclear Waste Fund for disposal costs until halted in 2014. The fund balance was $37.2 billion in FY2017. $7.41 billion had been disbursed for the Yucca Mountain project before it was halted in FY2010. The Yucca Mountain project was halted by the Obama Administration after $7.41 billion had been disbursed from the Waste Fund. The estimated cost of the program was $96.2 billion in 2007 dollars from 1983 to 2133. Selecting disposal sites for low-level radioactive waste is also a key aspect. The program started in 1983 and ended with repository closure in 2133. States are authorized to select disposal sites for low-level radioactive waste under the 1980 Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act. Most states have joined interstate compacts for waste disposal. After 1992, commercial low-level waste disposal facilities could refuse waste from outside their regional compacts. One site in Beatty, NV, closed, leaving two sites in Barnwell, SC, and Hanford, WA. After 1992, commercial low-level waste disposal facilities could refuse waste from outside their regional compacts. One site in Beatty, NV, closed, leaving two sites in Barnwell, SC, and Hanford, WA. Another site in Utah is available nationwide for most Class A low-level waste, while a new disposal facility near Andrews, TX, opened in 2012 to alleviate storage issues for Class B and C waste. A new disposal facility near Andrews, TX, opened in 2012 to address storage problems for Class B and C waste. The facility can also accept waste from other states, with up to 30% of its disposal capacity available. Legislation for the Texas compact, originally including Maine and Vermont, was signed in 1998, but a proposed site near Sierra Blanca, TX, was rejected, leading to Maine's withdrawal. The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission rejected a proposed disposal site near Sierra Blanca, TX in 1998. Texas Governor Rick Perry signed legislation in 2003 authorizing the licensing of disposal facilities for low-level waste. Waste Control Specialists LLC filed an application to build the Andrews County disposal facility in 2004, which was approved in 2011. The TCEQ approved the construction of a disposal facility in Barnwell, SC in 2011, which is currently accepting low-level waste from the Atlantic Compact. South Carolina can limit the facility's use to compact members only, and a state law phased out acceptance of noncompact waste by June 30, 2008. The facility had previously stopped accepting waste from outside the Southeast Compact. The Barnwell facility in South Carolina phased out acceptance of noncompact waste by June 30, 2008. South Carolina withdrew from the Southeast Compact in 1995 and began accepting waste from all states except North Carolina. North Carolina withdrew from the Southeast Compact in 1999. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2010 that North Carolina's withdrawal from the Southeast Compact did not result in sanctions. Hanford, WA is the only other facility accepting all classes of low-level waste, controlled by the Northwest Compact. Licensing of commercial low-level waste facilities is overseen by the NRC or approved agreement states. Licensing of commercial low-level waste facilities is regulated by the NRC or agreement states under the Atomic Energy Act. NRC proposed modifications to disposal regulations in 2015, with final revisions issued in 2017. Transportation of low-level waste is jointly regulated by NRC and the Department of Transportation. The NRC staff submitted final regulations for commission approval in 2016, with further revisions issued in 2017. The regulations establish time periods for technical analyses of low-level waste sites to ensure protection of the general population, with a 1,000-year compliance period for sites without significant quantities of long-lived radioactive material, and a 10,000-year compliance period for sites with significant quantities. The NRC's low-level waste regulations, established in 1982, require technical analyses for disposal sites. Compliance periods are set at 1,000 years for sites without significant radioactive material and 10,000 years for sites with significant quantities. A post-10,000-year analysis may be needed in certain cases to protect against inadvertent intruders. Disposal of radioactive waste is a key issue in the nuclear power debate, with on-site storage of spent fuel being necessary without a national waste management system. On-site storage of nuclear fuel is a concern, especially near proposed reactor sites. Safety worries have increased since the Fukushima Daiichi disaster in 2011. The federal government's focus on the Yucca Mountain site for nuclear waste disposal has been halted by President Obama's actions. Congress is still debating a new waste strategy. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future halted DOE waste program activities. Congress debates Yucca Mountain's future, with NRC finding site meets standards. Trump Administration proposes Yucca Mountain licensing restart. Senator Reid's retirement may impact legislative action on nuclear waste in the 115th Congress. Requesting $120 million for the project. The Trump Administration's request for $120 million in FY2018 for Yucca Mountain licensing and spent fuel storage was not approved, but the request has been repeated for FY2019. Senator Reid's retirement may impact legislative action on nuclear waste in the 115th Congress. Owners of existing reactors with waste-disposal contracts with DOE are likely to seek damages from the federal government if disposal issues persist. The Trump Administration's request for $120 million in FY2018 for Yucca Mountain licensing and spent fuel storage was not approved, but the request has been repeated for FY2019. Owners of existing reactors with waste-disposal contracts with DOE are likely to continue seeking damages from the federal government if disposal delays persist. DOE estimates potential liabilities for waste program delays could total as much as $34.1 billion, with the nuclear industry predicting future damages could rise by tens of billions of dollars more if the federal disposal program fails altogether. The nuclear industry predicts that future damages could increase by tens of billions of dollars if the federal disposal program fails. Lack of a nuclear waste disposal system could impact the licensing of new nuclear plants and cause DOE to miss compliance deadlines for defense waste disposal. The Blue Ribbon Commission addressed problems caused by nuclear waste disposal delays in its final report, suggesting options like centralized interim storage and reprocessing. The Blue Ribbon Commission's final report in January 2012 recommended options for nuclear waste storage, including centralized interim storage and development of alternative repository sites. A congressionally chartered corporation was suggested for siting new waste facilities, but delays in the nuclear waste program make longer on-site storage likely. The commission proposed a \"consent based\" siting process for nuclear waste facilities. The Blue Ribbon Commission recommended a \"consent based\" nuclear waste siting process for longer on-site storage, which has attracted interest from localities in New Mexico and Texas. State cooperation is crucial for the success of this renewed siting effort. The Blue Ribbon Commission recommended a \"consent based\" nuclear waste siting process for longer on-site storage, which has attracted interest from localities in New Mexico and Texas. State cooperation is crucial for the success of this renewed siting effort, as governments of potential host states have blocked previous attempts. The curr_chunk discusses various reports and studies related to the disposal of high-level nuclear waste, including the economics of reprocessing vs. direct disposal of spent nuclear fuel and technical issues associated with developing a separate repository for high-level radioactive waste. The curr_chunk provides references to reports and studies on managing high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel, including technical issues and strategies for disposal. References to reports and studies on managing high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel are provided, including strategy alternatives, policy implications, and a draft consent-based siting process for consolidated storage and disposal facilities. The U.S. Department of Energy has released a draft consent-based siting process for consolidated storage and disposal facilities for spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste. This includes assessments of disposal options for DOE-managed radioactive waste and a strategy for the management and disposal of used nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste. The U.S. Department of Energy has released a draft consent-based siting process for consolidated storage and disposal facilities for spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste. This includes assessments of disposal options for DOE-managed radioactive waste and a strategy for the management and disposal of used nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste. The strategy involves research and development for disposal, safety evaluation reports, and repository safety after permanent closure at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. The books \"Waste of a Mountain: How Yucca Mountain Was Selected, Studied, and Dumped\" by Voegele and Vieth, \"The Road to Yucca Mountain: The Development of Radioactive Waste Policy in the United States\" by Walker, and a report on repository safety after permanent closure at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, are key resources on radioactive waste management."
