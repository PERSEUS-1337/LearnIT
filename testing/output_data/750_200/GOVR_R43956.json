    "content": "The Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA), enacted in 1990, provides one-time cash benefits to individuals who participated in atomic weapons testing or worked in the uranium industry between 1942 and 1971. Claimants must have contracted specified medical conditions after possible exposure to ionizing radiation. The RECA program, administered by the Civil Division of the Department of Justice, provides benefits to individuals who developed medical conditions after exposure to ionizing radiation from atomic weapons testing or working in the uranium industry. Over 30,000 claims have been approved, totaling nearly $2 billion in benefits. The majority of claims are related to atomic weapons testing. Benefits are paid from general revenue and are considered mandatory spending. The Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) provides benefits to individuals affected by atomic weapons testing or working in the uranium industry. All benefit applications must be filed before July 10, 2022, when the program will end. The era of atomic weapons testing began in 1945 with the Trinity Test Site detonation and continued until 1992. During the era of atomic weapons testing, the United States conducted 1,054 tests, with the majority (928) at the Nevada Test Site. 828 were underground tests and 100 were atmospheric tests, releasing radioactive material into the atmosphere. During the era of atomic weapons testing, the United States conducted 1,054 tests, with 100 atmospheric tests at the Nevada Test Site releasing radioactive material into the atmosphere. The largest atmospheric test at NTS was the Hood Test on July 5, 1957, with an energy yield equivalent to 74,000 tons of TNT. The Hood Test on July 5, 1957 at the Nevada Test Site had an energy yield equivalent to 74,000 tons of TNT. Benefits under the RECA program include $75,000 for onsite participants, $50,000 for downwinders, and $100,000 for uranium workers. These benefits are one-time lump sum payments and are not subject to federal income tax. Benefits under the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) program include one-time lump sum payments for onsite participants, downwinders, and uranium workers. These payments are not adjusted for changes in wages or cost of living, not subject to federal income tax, and may be reduced by other compensation received for radiation-related illnesses. No medical benefits are provided by RECA, but uranium workers are eligible for an additional $50,000 in compensation and medical benefits for covered illnesses. Eligible individuals under RECA receive $50,000 in compensation and medical benefits for covered illnesses. Benefits are paid directly to the claimant or to eligible survivors in a specific order. The RECA program provides $50,000 in compensation and medical benefits to eligible individuals for covered illnesses. Survivors eligible for benefits are listed in order of precedence: spouse, children, parents, grandchildren, and grandparents. Only those survivors are eligible for benefits, and if none are present, no benefit is paid. To qualify for benefits, an onsite participant must meet exposure and disease requirements from participating in atmospheric atomic weapons tests conducted by the United States. To be eligible for RECA benefits, a person must have been present onsite during atmospheric atomic weapons testing conducted by the United States in specific geographic areas, including NTS, Pacific Test Sites, and other designated locations. The curr_chunk discusses specific designated locations where individuals must have been present onsite during atmospheric atomic weapons testing to be eligible for RECA benefits. This includes test sites for various operations, the Trinity Test Site, South Atlantic Test Site, and locations for decontamination of equipment used in nuclear detonations. The curr_chunk specifies occupations and activities required for eligibility for RECA benefits related to atmospheric atomic weapons testing. Eligibility for RECA benefits includes individuals who were involved in activities related to atmospheric atomic weapons testing. This includes members of various government agencies and organizations who performed duties within the operational area of nuclear detonations. Individuals eligible for RECA benefits were involved in activities related to atmospheric atomic weapons testing, including duties such as decontamination, cloud tracking, garrison maintenance, and monitoring fallout patterns. To be eligible for RECA benefits as a downwinder, a person must have been physically present near NTS for at least 24 consecutive months between January 21, 1951, and October 31, 1958, and have contracted one of the specified types of cancers after exposure to ionizing radiation. To qualify for RECA benefits as a downwinder, one must have been physically present near NTS for a specific period and developed one of the listed cancers after exposure to ionizing radiation from atomic weapons testing. Uranium miners must also meet certain exposure and disease criteria to be eligible for benefits. A uranium miner must have worked in a uranium mine for at least one year between 1942 and 1971 or have been exposed to 40 working-level months of radiation. Working level months are defined as one unit of radiation exposure per work day for a month. A uranium miner must have developed lung cancer or non-malignant respiratory diseases after exposure to radiation to qualify for RECA benefits. Uranium millers and ore transporters may also qualify if they meet specific exposure and disease requirements. Uranium millers must have worked in a uranium mill in specific states for at least one year between 1941 and 1971. A uranium miller or ore transporter must have worked in specific states listed in Table 4 for at least one year between 1941 and 1971 and developed specific conditions after radiation exposure to qualify for RECA benefits. The RECA program provides benefits for individuals with specific illnesses such as primary lung cancer, primary renal cancer, chronic renal disease, non-malignant respiratory diseases, and related conditions. Claimants must submit written documentation of their illnesses to qualify for benefits. The RECA regulations require specific documentation of illnesses for benefits, with consideration for Native American law and customs. Application decisions are made within 12 months by an assistant director at the DOJ Civil Division. The 2000 RECA amendments authorize the Department of Health and Human Services to provide grants for cancer screenings and medical documentation assistance. These grants are administered by the HHS Health Resources and Services Administration. The RECA program provides grants for cancer screenings and medical documentation assistance through the HHS Health Resources and Services Administration. There are six RESEP clinics in Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada, and Utah, with one clinic serving Native Americans. Applicants for RECA benefits do not need to be screened for cancer at these clinics. Denied applicants can appeal to the DOJ within 60 days of the decision. Applicants for RECA benefits and appeals of benefit denials can be represented by licensed attorneys or non-attorney representatives of tribal organizations. Appeals must be made in writing within 60 days to an appeals officer appointed by the assistant attorney general of the Civil Division of DOJ. The officer will affirm, reverse, or remand the initial decision, and dissatisfied applicants can seek judicial review in the U.S. district court. Non-attorney representatives of tribal organizations can assist Native American claimants in RECA matters. They are the only non-attorneys authorized to represent claimants and cannot charge fees. Licensed attorneys representing RECA claimants have fee limitations based on the date of their contract with the claimant. Attorneys representing RECA claimants have fee limitations based on the date of their contract with the claimant. They can recover costs associated with representing the claimant and may also recover expenses in addition to a 2% or 10% fee. Some Members of Congress are proposing legislation to expand RECA benefits for downwinders and uranium workers exposed to radiation after 1971. Current law requires downwinders to have been present in designated counties in Arizona, Nevada, or Utah during atmospheric testing. These unresolved issues are likely to keep RECA on the congressional agenda. Under current law, to qualify for RECA benefits as a downwinder, a person must have been present in designated counties in Arizona, Nevada, or Utah during atmospheric testing at NTS. Residents of other areas, including some closer to NTS or near the Trinity test site in New Mexico, are not eligible for benefits. New downwinder eligibility areas cannot be added through regulation or executive action. Residents outside the current eligibility area had no benefits even before RECA became a federal program. Residents outside the current downwinder eligibility area expressed concern about health effects from atomic weapons testing fallout and tried to seek compensation through civil courts. Congress created the RECA program in 1990 due to downwinders' inability to win civil judgments against the federal government or testing contractors. Initial bills for compensation were introduced in 1979 during the 96th Congress. The RECA program was created in 1990 to provide compensation to civilian downwinders affected by atmospheric testing at NTS. The first bills for compensation were introduced during the 96th Congress in 1979, aiming to make the United States liable for damages caused by atmospheric atomic testing at NTS to downwinders with cancer and other related health issues. The affected area for downwinder eligibility in H.R. 4766 was a rectangular area around NTS from 112 degrees to 117.5 degrees longitude and from 36.5 degrees to 39 degrees latitude, including parts of Nevada, Utah, California, Arizona, Mohave, and Coconino Counties. The boundaries were proposed in a map in the Appendix. A companion Senate bill (S. 1865) also aimed to make the United States liable for damages to downwinders. The boundaries proposed by H.R. 4766 for downwinder eligibility included specific counties and geographic areas in Arizona, Nevada, and Utah. A companion Senate bill (S. 1865) aimed to hold the United States liable for damages to downwinders, onsite participants, affected sheep herds, and uranium miners. The bill also proposed the creation of a federal advisory board with the authority to expand the list of specified cancers. The bill proposed expanding the downwinder eligibility area to include specific counties in Arizona, Nevada, and Utah. The Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare would have the authority to add more areas. The original RECA statute covered a smaller area initially. The RECA downwinder eligibility area was initially limited to specific regions in Arizona, Nevada, and Utah. The 2000 RECA amendments expanded the eligibility area to include additional geographical areas in Arizona and Utah. The current downwinder eligibility area is described in Table 3 and shown in the map in the Appendix. Since the 2000 RECA amendments, efforts have been made to expand downwinder eligibility areas to include individuals in Colorado, Idaho, Montana, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, and Utah during atmospheric atomic weapons testing at NTS. Legislation has also been proposed to include Guam residents affected by Pacific atomic weapons testing fallout. In 2002, HRSA requested the NRC to study the health effects of radiation exposure and consider expanding the RECA downwinder area. The NRC studied the health effects of radiation exposure and recommended a science-based approach to determine eligibility for RECA benefits for downwinders, advising against expanding the downwinder area solely based on geography. The NTC recommended a science-based approach for determining downwinder eligibility for RECA benefits, considering factors like location, outdoor time, and milk consumption for exposure to radiation. The ingestion of Iodine 131 through contaminated milk was a significant pathway of exposure. The NRC report suggested using a probability of causation model to evaluate individual benefit claims. The NRC report recommended using a probability of causation model to evaluate individual claims for RECA benefits based on absorbed dose of radionuclides, demographic, and behavioral factors. This model would calculate the probability that a specific type of cancer was caused by exposure to ionizing radiation. The NRC report recommended using a probability of causation model to evaluate individual claims for RECA benefits based on absorbed dose of radionuclides, demographic, and behavioral factors. This model, similar to methods used for EEOICPA benefits and VA disability compensation, would determine the probability that a specific type of cancer was caused by exposure to ionizing radiation. Congress may need to set thresholds or varying benefit levels based on probabilities, but no legislation has been introduced to change RECA downwinder eligibility from geography-based to probability-based. No legislation has been introduced to convert RECA downwinder eligibility from geography-based to probability-based. The probability of causation model recommended by the NRC may result in fewer successful claims due to low radiation exposure levels from fallout. The NRC's recommendation for a probability-based model for RECA downwinder eligibility may lead to fewer successful claims due to low radiation exposure levels from fallout. The scientific evidence suggests that exposure to radiation is unlikely to be a substantial cause of cancer development in most cases. Congressional changes based on this report are expected to result in few successful claims. Under current law, RECA benefits for uranium workers are only available if exposed to radiation before 1972. The December 31, 1971 cut-off date was chosen due to the end of federal uranium procurement for atomic weapons. Since the end of federal uranium procurement for atomic weapons in 1971, private ownership of uranium for nuclear power plants has been legal, creating a market for mined uranium. Legislation has been introduced to expand RECA eligibility to include uranium workers exposed to radiation after 1971. Legislation is being considered in Congress to expand RECA eligibility to uranium workers exposed to radiation after 1971, including uranium mine core drillers. Advocates argue that despite safety regulations enacted since 1971, uranium workers, especially miners, are still at risk for radon-induced diseases. The current annual exposure limit for radiation set by MSHA is higher than the limit before 1971. The RECA program aims to provide restitution to individuals affected by fallout from atomic weapons tests and uranium miners exposed to high levels of radon. Current uranium miners can exceed recommended radon exposure levels while still complying with federal safety standards. The Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) aims to provide restitution to individuals affected by fallout from atomic weapons tests and uranium miners exposed to high levels of radon. Expanding RECA to cover post-1971 uranium activities would extend coverage to workers in the commercial uranium sector, beyond its original statutory intent. Expanding the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) to cover post-1971 uranium activities would extend coverage to workers in the commercial uranium sector. Illnesses from uranium mining for commercial clients would likely be covered by state workers' compensation systems."
