    "content": "The European Union (EU) is a partnership among 28 member states focused on peaceful integration through enlargement. This process has helped former dictatorships and communist states in Central and Eastern Europe become stable democracies and free market economies. The EU keeps the door open for any European country, including Turkey and the Western Balkans, that meets its political and economic criteria. The EU maintains an open door for European countries meeting membership criteria. Croatia joined in 2013. Enlargement may be limited due to financial troubles and uncertainty about the EU's future direction. The EU's economic woes and uncertainty about its future direction may deter some current and potential candidates from joining the Union. The EU was established after World War II to promote political reconciliation and economic prosperity in Europe through a series of binding treaties. In 1952, six European states established the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) to promote peace, stability, and economic growth. This led to the creation of the European Economic Community (EEC) in 1957. In 1957, the six ECSC member states signed two new treaties in Rome: the first established the European Economic Community (EEC) to develop common economic policies and merge national markets into a single market; the second created a European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM) for peaceful nuclear energy use. These \"Treaties of Rome\" came into force in 1958, leading to the formation of the European Community (EC) in 1967. The Treaties of Rome established the European Economic Community (EEC) and the European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM) in 1957. In 1967, they collectively became known as the European Community (EC). The EC expanded with new members in 1973, 1981, 1986, and 1993 with the Treaty on European Union (Maastricht Treaty). The Treaty on European Union in 1993 established the modern-day European Union, including an expanded European Community, common foreign and security policy, and Economic and Monetary Union with the euro currency. The European Union was established in 1993, leading to the creation of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) with the euro currency. In 1995, Austria, Finland, and Sweden joined the EU, bringing the total membership to 15 states. The Amsterdam Treaty in 1999 enhanced the EU's legislative powers and foreign policy, while the Nice Treaty in 2000 paved the way for further integration. The Nice Treaty of December 2000 aimed to strengthen the EU's foreign policy and internal security, enabling further enlargement to the east. It introduced reforms to allow the Union to accept new members and operate effectively by extending majority voting in the Council of Ministers and restructuring the European Commission. The EU worked with former communist countries in Central and Eastern Europe to meet membership criteria. Enlargement to the east was seen as fulfilling a historic pledge to integrate the continent peacefully. Accession negotiations began with Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Poland, and Slovenia in March 1998. Cyprus and Malta also expressed interest in joining the EU. In March 1998, the EU started accession negotiations with Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Poland, and Slovenia. In December 1999, negotiations were opened with Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Romania, and Slovakia. By December 2001, 10 countries were likely to conclude talks by the end of 2002. Negotiations in 2002 were challenging due to budgetary and burden-sharing issues. In 2002, negotiations with 10 candidates on issues like agriculture and regional assistance were challenging due to budgetary concerns. A deal was reached, and the EU concluded accession talks with all 10 at its December 2002 summit. The accession treaty was signed on April 16, 2003, and they joined the EU on May 1, 2004. Bulgaria and Romania completed negotiations in December 2004 and joined the EU on January 1, 2007. Croatia joined on July 1, 2013, bringing the Union to 28 member states. The EU expanded with Bulgaria and Romania joining in 2007, followed by Croatia in 2013, bringing the total member states to 28. The Nice Treaty aimed to improve the Union's functionality but was criticized for creating a more complex decision-making process and implicitly limiting the EU to 27 members. The Lisbon Treaty, which came into force on December 1, 2009, aimed to streamline the EU's governing institutions and decision-making processes, addressing criticisms of the Nice Treaty and allowing for potential enlargement beyond 27 member states. The Lisbon Treaty, in force since December 1, 2009, aims to streamline the EU's institutions and decision-making processes, eliminating hurdles to EU enlargement. It also seeks to strengthen the EU's global voice, enhance democracy and transparency, and grant more powers to the European Parliament. Countries can apply for EU membership by meeting the \"Copenhagen criteria.\" Countries may apply for EU membership by meeting the \"Copenhagen criteria,\" which include stability of institutions, democracy, rule of law, human rights, a functioning market economy, and the capacity to take on EU obligations. The EU decides when to accept new members based on its ability to absorb them. The EU decides on new member acceptance based on the ability to absorb them. The process involves a complex technical and political evaluation, with unanimous agreement from existing member states required at each step. Prospective candidates' relationships with member states can impact their accession prospects. The EU accession process involves the European Commission issuing a formal opinion on a country's application, followed by the Council of Ministers deciding on acceptance. Once all 28 member states unanimously agree, the country becomes an official EU candidate and can start accession negotiations. The candidate must adopt and implement EU treaties, laws, and regulations, with approval required from the Commission and Council of Ministers for the actual opening of accession. The EU accession process involves the candidate country adopting and implementing EU treaties, laws, and regulations. The Commission and Council of Ministers must approve the opening of accession negotiations and a negotiating framework. The acquis communautaire, consisting of 144,000 pages of rules and regulations divided into 35 chapters, guides the enlargement talks. Accession negotiations on each chapter start with a screening process to assess the applicant's compliance. The EU enlargement process involves screening applicants to assess compliance with each chapter's requirements. Negotiations at the ministerial level establish terms for adopting and implementing EU rules. The European Commission leads negotiations on behalf of the EU, with the Commissioner for Enlargement and European Neighborhood Policy overseeing the process. Candidate countries must align their institutions, management, and judicial systems with EU standards across all areas of the acquis. The candidate country must align its institutions, management capacity, and judicial systems with EU standards in all areas of the acquis. Financial assistance is provided to aid in the accession process, and chapters of the acquis require unanimous approval from all 28 EU member states. The Commission issues progress reports assessing achievements in the candidate country. The Commission issues progress reports to assess achievements in candidate countries. Once negotiations on all chapters are concluded, agreements are incorporated into a draft accession treaty for approval by the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament. Ratification by EU member states and the candidate country is required, a process that can take up to two years. Five countries are currently official candidates for EU membership: Iceland, Macedonia. Currently, five countries are official candidates for EU membership: Iceland, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, and Turkey. Iceland has close ties with the EU, being a member of the European Economic Area since 1994 and participating in the EU's single market through the EEA. Iceland also belongs to the Schengen area. Iceland participates in the EU's single market through the EEA, belongs to the Schengen area, and is involved in various EU agencies and programs. Despite political divisions and citizen doubts, Iceland applied for EU membership in 2009 after the financial crisis. The collapse of Iceland's banking system and devaluation of its currency led to the government seeking EU membership to aid economic recovery. Despite initial progress in accession talks, negotiations have been on hold since May 2013. As of the end of 2012, Iceland's EU accession negotiations had opened on 27 of the 35 chapters, with 11 provisionally closed. Talks have been on hold since May 2013 due to the election of a new government opposed to EU membership. The future of Iceland's EU prospects is uncertain, with plans for a public referendum on resuming negotiations. Iceland's EU accession negotiations should resume, but a referendum date is not set. Opinion polls show strong opposition to EU membership. Challenges include resolving issues with the EU on fisheries and whaling policies, and repaying debts from the Icesave bank failure in 2008. Macedonia settled a dispute over repaying debts from the Icesave bank failure in 2008. It became an official EU candidate in 2005 and has been recommended for membership talks since 2009, fulfilling political and economic criteria. EU officials have expressed some concerns. Macedonia has been an official EU candidate since 2005 and has been recommended for membership talks since 2009. The EU has concerns about the country's democratic progress, treatment of journalists, inter-ethnic tensions, and the need for necessary reforms to improve the rule of law, freedom of expression, independence of the judiciary, and anti-corruption efforts. Start date for membership has not been secured yet. Macedonia's EU accession negotiations have been delayed due to a dispute with Greece over its official name. The EU refers to Macedonia as the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) to avoid territorial implications. EU officials are also concerned about inter-ethnic tensions in Macedonia, particularly with its Albanian minority. The EU refers to Macedonia as the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) due to a dispute with Greece, which has led to delays in Macedonia's EU accession negotiations. Bulgaria has also raised concerns about Macedonia's readiness for EU membership, and other EU member states are hesitant to support opening accession negotiations due to political difficulties and deteriorating democratic standards in the country. Several EU member states are hesitant to support opening accession negotiations with Macedonia due to political difficulties and deteriorating democratic standards in the country. The European Commission initiated a High Level Accession Dialogue (HLAD) in 2012 to aid in maintaining momentum for reforms in Macedonia. Progress has been made in priority areas such as reducing court backlogs and combating corruption, but concerns remain about the stalled formal accession process jeopardizing sustainability. The EU initiated a High Level Accession Dialogue in 2012 to aid Macedonia's reform efforts. Despite progress in reducing court backlogs and fighting corruption, concerns persist about the stalled formal accession process risking the country's sustainability. Montenegro gained independence in 2006 and signed a Stabilization and Association Agreement with the EU in 2007. Macedonia applied for EU membership in 2008 and was granted candidate status in 2010. Montenegro achieved compliance with accession criteria in 2011, leading to the opening of accession negotiations. The EU opened accession negotiations with Montenegro in June 2012, with seven negotiating chapters opened by December 2013. Key challenges for Montenegro include improving the rule of law, fighting corruption, enhancing judiciary independence, guaranteeing freedom of expression, strengthening administrative capacity, and improving the business environment. EU officials acknowledge Montenegro's progress but assert that more work is needed. Serbia's path towards EU membership faced obstacles due to its past involvement in the violent dissolution of Yugoslavia and the conflict over Kosovo. The EU viewed Serbia as slow in implementing necessary reforms and uncooperative in tracking down war crimes suspects. Efforts are being made to improve the rule of law, fight corruption, enhance judiciary independence, guarantee freedom of expression, strengthen administrative capacity, and improve the business environment. Serbia's progress towards EU membership has been hindered by its past involvement in the Yugoslav conflict and the Kosovo issue. The EU criticized Serbia for being slow in implementing reforms and uncooperative in tracking down war crimes suspects. However, in recent years, Serbia has made significant strides in modernizing its political and economic systems. In April 2008, the EU signed a Stabilization and Association Agreement with Serbia, and in December 2009, Serbia formally applied for EU membership. In April 2008, the EU signed a Stabilization and Association Agreement with Serbia, and in December 2009, Serbia formally applied for EU membership. In October 2011, the European Commission recommended EU candidate status for Serbia, contingent on improving relations with Kosovo in EU-brokered talks. In February 2012, Serbia concluded two accords with Kosovo addressing key EU concerns. In December 2012, EU leaders agreed to assess the possibility of opening negotiations with Serbia in spring 2013, following a Commission report on Serbia's progress toward meeting all EU membership criteria. In spring 2013, negotiations with Serbia began following a Commission report on Serbia's progress towards meeting EU membership criteria, especially regarding relations with Kosovo. In April 2013, Serbia and Kosovo reached a landmark agreement on normalizing relations, focusing on resolving the situation in Northern Kosovo. In June 2013, the EU announced plans to open accession negotiations with Serbia by January 2014 at the latest, with EU governments wanting more time to assess progress on the Serbia-Kosovo agreement before setting a firm start date. In December 2013, EU member states endorsed opening accession talks with Serbia, noting its compliance with membership criteria and progress in improving relations with Kosovo. Serbia was urged to continue efforts in rule of law, judiciary reform, anti-corruption, and crime prevention. The EU endorsed opening accession talks with Serbia in December 2013, noting its compliance with membership criteria and progress in improving relations with Kosovo. Serbia was urged to continue efforts in rule of law, judiciary reform, anti-corruption, and crime prevention. Serbia may not join the EU until Kosovo's independence status is resolved, and Turkey's EU membership bid has had a history of ups and downs. Turkey's bid for EU membership has faced historical ups and downs due to concerns about its political system, human rights record, economy, and large Muslim population. Tensions between Turkey and the EU persist over the status of Turkey's membership application, dating back to the 1960s. Turkey's EU aspirations date back to the 1960s with the Ankara Agreement in 1963 aimed at closer economic ties. Despite a customs union in 1995 and EU eligibility in 1997, Turkey's 1987 full membership application was essentially rejected. In 1999, the EU recognized Turkey as an official candidate country, but stated that Turkey needed to meet political and economic criteria before accession talks could begin. In 2001, the EU set out priorities for Turkey to adopt and implement EU standards and legislation through an \"Accession Partnership.\" Turkey hoped for a firm date to start negotiations at the December 2002 summit. Turkey hoped for a firm date to start negotiations at the December 2002 summit, but was disappointed as some EU members felt Turkey did not fully meet the membership criteria, particularly regarding its stance toward Cyprus. The Republic of Cyprus is administered by the Greek Cypriot government in the south, while the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus is controlled by Turkish Cypriots. Turkish troops are stationed in northern Cyprus, and Turkey does not recognize the Republic of Cyprus under the Greek Cypriot government. In December 2004, the EU acknowledged Turkey's progress on reforms and allowed accession talks to begin in October 2005, with conditions to be met by Turkey. Turkey met the requirements to extend its agreements with the EU and customs union to new member states, including Cyprus, by July 2005. Despite not granting diplomatic recognition to the Greek Cypriot government, Turkey opened accession talks with the EU in October 2005. The EU opened accession talks with Turkey in October 2005, aiming for eventual full membership but with no guaranteed outcome. Negotiations on the acquis began in 2006, with slow progress due to complications, including Cyprus-related issues. Progress on Turkey's EU accession talks has been slow due to Cyprus-related issues, specifically Turkey's refusal to open its ports and airports to Greek Cypriot ships and planes as required by the 1970 Additional Protocol. The EU delayed opening eight chapters related to the customs union until Turkey complies with the protocol. The EU delayed opening chapters related to the customs union due to Turkey's refusal to comply with the 1970 Additional Protocol to Cyprus. Negotiations on other chapters can continue, but no further chapters will be provisionally closed without resolution of the protocol issues. In May 2012, the European Commission launched a \"positive agenda\" with Turkey to reinvigorate EU-Turkish relations and accelerate Turkey's accession process. The \"positive agenda\" was introduced by the European Commission to boost Turkey's EU accession process, covering areas such as legislation alignment, political reforms, visas, energy, and counterterrorism. It aimed to support, not replace, Turkey's accession process, but its success remains uncertain. At the start of 2013, hopes were high for Turkey's EU accession process with the opening of negotiations on a new chapter. The new French government was supportive of Turkey's accession process. In June 2013, EU leaders agreed to open the regional policy chapter but delayed talks due to Turkey's crackdown on anti-government activities. In June 2013, EU leaders agreed to open the regional policy chapter but delayed talks due to Turkey's crackdown on anti-government protests. In November 2013, formal negotiations began on the regional policy chapter following the release of the Commission's progress report on Turkey. Little progress has been made to date, and a recent scandal in the Turkish government led to the replacement of the Minister for EU Affairs, who was the chief accession negotiator. The replacement of Turkey's Minister for EU Affairs, who was the chief accession negotiator, by Tayyip Erdogan has had a significant impact on Turkey's internal reform and democratization process. The EU accession process has played a crucial role in transforming Turkey's political, military institutions, leadership, and political culture, benefiting its economy as well. Turkey's customs union with the EU has contributed to Turkey's economic growth and competitiveness. As a candidate country, Turkey receives financial support from the EU to meet standards and implement reforms. The EU accession process has strengthened relations between Europe and Turkey, with economic ties expanding despite Eurozone issues. Turkey's strong economy provides a significant market for European goods and services. Turkey's strong economy serves as a vital market for European goods and services, with a significant portion of Turkey's exports going to Europe. The country also attracts foreign direct investment, particularly from Europe, and plays a crucial role as an energy hub for European supply diversification. The recent decision to build the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline highlights Turkey's growing importance in this regard. The Trans-Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) will transport natural gas from Azerbaijan through Turkey to Italy and Europe. The ongoing instability in North Africa and the Middle East suggests a need for closer strategic dialogue between Turkey and the EU. Despite slow progress towards EU membership, experts believe that both parties benefit from their relationship. Turkey's slow progress towards EU membership raises concerns about the implications of Turkey's accession on the Union's institutions and finances, given its large population and economic disparities. Some in the EU fear an influx of Turkish laborers if Turkey joins the Union. Despite Turkey's improving economy, some in the EU fear an influx of Turkish laborers and worry about the potential cultural impact of Turkey's predominantly Muslim culture on the Union. EU concerns also persist about Turkish political reforms, fundamental rights, judiciary independence, women's rights, media freedoms, and protection of religious and ethnic minorities. European support for Turkey is not strong among the average population. European support for Turkey's EU membership is wavering due to concerns about political reforms, fundamental rights, judiciary independence, women's rights, media freedoms, and protection of minorities. Analysts predict that Turkish membership in the EU is at least a decade away, with doubts about joining without a political settlement on Cyprus. Some Turkish policymakers and citizens are questioning the value of EU accession, as public opinion shows a decline in interest in EU membership. Many Turks are questioning the need for Turkish accession to the EU as EU membership has lost its appeal. A 2013 poll showed only 44% of Turkish respondents believed in joining the EU, down from 73% in 2004. Turkey's economy is still growing, and Ankara is focusing on strengthening its position between secular Europe and the Islamist Middle East. The idea of \"being European\" or gaining EU membership is no longer seen as necessary for Turkey's status or partnership with Europe. Many Turks are reevaluating the importance of EU membership, with some suggesting a \"positive agenda\" to strengthen Turkish-EU ties without full membership. Turkish officials still prioritize EU membership, but experts believe neither Turkey nor the EU is ready to end the accession process. The EU maintains that the door for enlargement is open to any European country. Neither Turkey nor the EU is currently ready to end Turkey's accession process. The EU keeps the door open for any European country meeting membership criteria. Western Balkan states like Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Kosovo are potential candidates, but their accession timelines vary. It may take many more years before they are ready to join the EU. The EU hopes that the possibility of membership will drive reforms and progress. The EU hopes that the possibility of membership will help accelerate reforms and promote stability in countries like Ukraine, Moldova, and the southern Caucasus. While the Western Balkans have a recognized membership perspective, countries in \"wider Europe\" like Georgia and Moldova aspire to join the EU in the future. Ukraine has also shown support for EU membership. Georgia and Moldova, in particular, aspire to join the EU one day. In November 2013, they initialed Association Agreements with the EU, setting out a framework for cooperation and promoting European values and economic ties. Ukraine also supports EU integration. The current Ukrainian government under Viktor Yanukovych supported EU integration but did not sign the Association Agreement in November 2013 due to Russian opposition, sparking protests and a political crisis. \"Enlargement fatigue\" is a concern in Europe despite Croatia's recent accession and the EU's commitment to Western Balkan countries. Despite Croatia's recent accession and the EU's commitment to Western Balkan countries, European leaders and citizens are cautious about further EU enlargement, especially regarding Turkey and \"wider Europe.\" EU officials emphasize that enlargement must consider the Union's integration capacity to ensure acceding countries can fulfill membership obligations without compromising EU institutions or finances. Apprehensions about continued EU enlargement persist. Apprehensions about EU enlargement include concerns about the impact on EU institutions and finances, as well as fears of low-cost migrant labor influx. Some EU member states imposed temporary restrictions on labor migration from new member countries in 2004 and 2007. Studies since 2004 suggest that labor migration from Central and Eastern Europe to EU countries has been relatively small and has not displaced local workers or driven down wages significantly. Concerns persist regarding the accession of larger, less affluent countries like Turkey or Ukraine in the future. The EU member states may impose temporary labor migration restrictions on Croatian nationals following Croatia's 2013 accession. The accession of big countries like Turkey or Ukraine could have financial consequences for the Union's budget and regional assistance programs, as well as implications for certain EU institutions. Some member states fear that an ever-expanding Union could weaken their ability to drive EU policies. Key EU member states may have concerns about the potential weakening of their influence in EU institutions and the ability of some aspirants to meet EU standards, particularly in areas like the rule of law and anti-corruption measures. There are also broader concerns about the identity of Europe and the compatibility of certain cultures, such as Turkey's Islamic culture, with the European Union. The possible admission of Turkey with its Islamic culture is seen as incompatible with Europe by many Europeans. Questions also arise about whether countries like Ukraine or those in the southern Caucasus should be considered part of Europe due to their distinct geography, history, and culture. Experts believe that EU enlargement may be reaching its limits, and economic problems could further slow future expansion. The EU's economic problems and sovereign debt crisis may hinder future enlargement. EU leaders are uncertain about the Union's direction, potentially slowing down the enlargement agenda. Joining the EU and adopting the common currency may be less attractive for some countries due to economic difficulties. The economic problems and sovereign debt crisis in the EU may hinder future enlargement, making joining the Union and adopting the common currency less attractive for some countries. Aspirants like Turkey, with a strong economy, may now see the potential constraints on sovereignty and national policies outweighing the benefits of EU membership. The United States has historically supported EU enlargement for advancing democracy and economic prosperity. Many Members of Congress support EU enlargement to advance democracy and economic prosperity, creating strong European allies and trading partners. U.S. and EU officials collaborated after the collapse of communism to promote democratic transitions and market reforms in Central and Eastern Europe. U.S. policymakers also aim to promote EU enlargement for political and economic reasons. Some analysts suggest that U.S. policy makers have been keen on promoting EU enlargement to decrease U.S.-EU tensions and have viewed newer members as more pro-American. U.S. officials hoped that with the EU's enlargement, it would become a more capable partner in addressing global challenges. U.S. business interests also support EU enlargement for access to a larger, integrated market. U.S. business interests support EU enlargement for access to a larger, integrated market and to help further reforms of the EU's regulatory regime. The U.S. has advocated EU membership for Turkey as a vital strategic ally. Many Members of Congress support EU membership for Turkey as a strategic ally. The US has played a small role in Turkey's EU accession path, lobbying Ankara to accept the EU's offer despite tensions with the EU. The US continues to support Turkey's EU membership bid and the EU aspirations of the Western Balkans. The US supports Turkey's EU membership bid and the EU aspirations of the Western Balkans, despite tensions with the EU. US officials back those in Ukraine aligned with Europe amidst recent protests. Concerns exist about EU enlargement pace and potential hindrances like \"enlargement fatigue\" and the EU's financial crisis. Some U.S. officials are worried about \"enlargement fatigue\" and the EU's financial crisis affecting further EU expansion. Critics argue that EU enlargement has not made the EU a more coherent global actor and has created divisions, like on policy towards Russia. Some pundits worry that despite the EU's financial difficulties, a larger EU could rival U.S. power and prestige in the longer term."
