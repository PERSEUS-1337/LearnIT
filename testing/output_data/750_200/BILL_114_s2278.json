    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Promoting Unlicensed Spectrum Act of 2015\" and includes definitions for key terms. The Act defines key terms such as \"appropriate committees of Congress,\" \"Assistant Secretary,\" \"Commission,\" and \"Federal entity.\" The curr_chunk defines terms related to the Federal Communications Commission, including \"Federal entity,\" \"Spectrum Relocation Fund,\" and \"unlicensed operations.\" The curr_chunk discusses the use of spectrum on a nonexclusive basis without protection from interference under specific regulations. The curr_chunk focuses on the Federal Communications Commission's allocation and allotment of spectrum. The Commission must ensure a balance between exclusive licensing and unlicensed operations in spectrum allocation. Within 18 months of the Act's enactment, rules must be established to achieve this balance and consider permitting unlicensed operations. The Commission must establish rules within 18 months to balance exclusive licensing and unlicensed operations in spectrum allocation. Rules may permit unlicensed operations until the licensee initiates commercial service. These rules must be included in service rules for spectrum auctions and reflected in reports to Congress. The Commission must establish rules within 18 months to balance exclusive licensing and unlicensed operations in spectrum allocation, including a national strategy for unlicensed spectrum. The United States aims to maximize spectrum utility, promote innovation in wireless broadband, and ensure a balanced spectrum policy. The Commission, with the Assistant Secretary, will develop a national strategy within a year to expand unlicensed radio frequency bands. The Assistant Secretary will develop a national strategy to make additional radio frequency bands available for unlicensed operations, including identifying bands to be cleared for unlicensed use and considering spectrum sharing rules. The Assistant Secretary will develop a national strategy to expand radio frequency spectrum for unlicensed operations, including rules for spectrum sharing to allow additional ranges for unlicensed use without causing interference to licensees. The FCC will explore spectrum sharing approaches to expand opportunities for unlicensed operations and improve spectrum utilization. Additionally, they will examine ways to enhance existing databases and systems for promoting spectrum sharing and access for unlicensed operations, as well as consider additional bands for such purposes. The FCC will submit a report to Congress within a year of enacting the Act, detailing the strategy developed for spectrum sharing and access for unlicensed operations, along with any legislative recommendations. The FCC will submit a report to Congress detailing the strategy for spectrum sharing and access for unlicensed operations, along with any legislative recommendations. The report will be made publicly available on the Commission's website. SEC. 5. MAKING FEDERAL SPECTRUM AVAILABLE FOR UNLICENSED OPERATION. The Assistant Secretary, along with the Commission and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, must submit a report to Congress within 270 days of the Act's enactment on designating additional radio frequency bands for unlicensed operations by Federal entities without causing interference. The report will also address recommendations for reforming the Spectrum Relocation Fund to cover costs incurred by Federal entities. The report must consider recommendations for reforming the Spectrum Relocation Fund to address costs incurred by Federal entities related to sharing radio frequency bands with unlicensed operations. It should also include recommendations for ensuring the fund's solvency if used for this purpose, and explore the possibility of permitting unlicensed operations in spectrum bands used by Federal entities without causing harmful interference. The report should consider recommendations for reforming the Spectrum Relocation Fund to address costs incurred by Federal entities related to sharing radio frequency bands with unlicensed operations. It should explore the possibility of permitting unlicensed operations in spectrum bands used by Federal entities without causing harmful interference. Additionally, it should assess whether other spectrum sharing techniques can facilitate access to Federal spectrum for radio technologies conducting unlicensed operations."
