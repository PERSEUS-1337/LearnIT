    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Independent Contractor Tax Simplification Act of 1995\" and includes findings. The Congress finds that simplifying tax rules for independent contractors was a top priority at the 1995 White House Conference on Small Business. Delegates recommended recognizing the legitimacy of independent contractors and establishing realistic guidelines. It is crucial for taxpayers and the Federal Government to have fair rules for distinguishing between employees and independent contractors. SEC. 3511 introduces standards for determining whether individuals are not employees under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. This amendment aims to provide clear guidelines for distinguishing between employees and independent contractors, following recommendations from the 1995 White House Conference on Small Business. The amendment in SEC. 3511 establishes criteria to classify individuals as non-employees for tax purposes. If specific requirements are met, the service provider, recipient, and payor are not considered as employees. The focus is on differentiating between employees and independent contractors as suggested by the 1995 White House Conference on Small Business. The requirements for a recipient to be classified as a non-employee for tax purposes include having a significant investment in assets and/or training, incurring unreimbursed expenses, agreeing to perform a service for a specific time or result, being paid on a commissioned basis, or purchasing products for resale. The service provider must have a principal place of business, not primarily work at the recipient's place of business, pay fair market rent if using the recipient's place of business, or not be required to perform the service. The service provider must have a principal place of business, not primarily work at the recipient's place of business, and may perform service for other persons through advertising or solicitations. The service provider may advertise, solicit individually, list with registries, agencies, brokers, or engage in similar activities to provide services under a registered business name. The individual must have a registered business name or a license from a State, political subdivision, or agency. Services must be performed under a written contract stating the individual is not an employee. The individual must have a registered business name or a license from a State, political subdivision, or agency. Services must be performed under a written contract stating the individual is not an employee. Special rules apply if reporting requirements are not met by the service recipient or payor for a taxable year.

Services must be performed under a written contract stating the individual is not an employee. Special rules apply if reporting requirements are not met by the service recipient or payor for a taxable year. If the service provider is performing services through an entity owned by them, the entity may be included in the references to 'service provider'. The term 'service provider' is defined for the purposes of this section. The term 'service provider' is defined as any individual who performs services for another person. The term 'service recipient' refers to the person for whom the service provider performs the service, and the term 'payor' is the person who pays the service provider if the service recipients do not pay. The term 'payor' refers to the person who pays the service provider in case the service recipients do not pay. 'In connection with performing the service' means activities related to the actual service provided or the operation of the service provider's trade or business. The term 'payor' refers to the person who pays the service provider if the service recipients do not pay. The operation of the service provider's trade or business is also included in this definition. Exceptions include entities owned by the service provider. The amendments made by this Act regarding standards for determining employee status shall apply to services performed after December 31, 1995."
