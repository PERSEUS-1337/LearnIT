    "content": "Under the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, the President can propose to rescind funding from an appropriations act by sending a special message to Congress. If Congress does not approve the rescission within 45 days, the funding must be made available for executive agencies. President George W. Bush, who had item veto authority as Governor of Texas, has advocated for similar power for the President. President George W. Bush advocated for the Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006 to address the issue of too many special interest projects. The bill required expedited rescission, where at least one house of Congress had to vote on the proposals. If one house disapproved, the other house could ignore the request. \"Under the Line Item Veto Act of 1996, 'enhanced rescission' allowed spending reductions to be permanently cancelled unless Congress passed a disapproval bill, which could be vetoed by the President requiring a two-thirds majority in both chambers.\" Under expedited rescission, special presidential messages are permanently cancelled unless Congress enacts a disapproval bill. If the President vetoes the disapproval bill, a two-thirds majority in both chambers is required to override the veto. Expedited rescission bills focus on procedural changes in Congress to ensure immediate approval of the President's rescission request. Fast-track procedures encourage an up-or-down vote on the funding rescission proposal. The expedited rescission approach requires congressional approval to rescind funding, but fast-track procedures encourage a prompt up-or-down vote on the President's proposal. It is seen as transferring less power from Congress to the President compared to other approaches. In the past, the House has passed expedited rescission bills annually, with specific procedures outlined in H.R. 2164 in 1992. The expedited rescission approach, outlined in H.R. 1578 in the 103rd Congress, allowed the President to propose rescissions without limits on the amount that could be rescinded, including the ability to eliminate a program by requesting 100% of its funding. This bill also included provisions for expedited judicial review. H.R. 1578 allowed the President to request rescission of 100% of a program's funding, effectively eliminating it. The bill also included provisions for expedited judicial review. In the second session of the 103rd Congress, H.R. 4600 passed the House in 1994 with a substitute amendment for strengthened expedited rescission. H.R. 4600, passed by the House in 1994, allowed submission of special rescission messages at any time and proposed the repeal of targeted tax benefits within 20 days of enactment. The President proposed the repeal of targeted tax benefits within 20 days of enactment. A draft expedited rescission bill, titled the Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006, was introduced on March 7, 2006. It aimed to amend the Impoundment Control Act by adding a new \"Part C -- Legislative Line Item Veto\" to authorize the President to rescind targeted tax benefits. The Administration bill proposed to amend the Impoundment Control Act by adding a new \"Part C -- Legislative Line Item Veto,\" granting the President the authority to propose rescission of discretionary budget authority, direct spending items, or targeted tax benefits in a special message to Congress. The President would have flexibility in submitting and packaging these special messages, with no time constraints and the ability to include multiple proposals in a single message. The LLIVA would give the President flexibility in submitting special messages for rescissions without time constraints. A single message can include multiple rescission proposals from various laws, with the requirement that the amounts rescinded must be used for deficit reduction. Budget Committees must adjust allocations within five days of approval, and spending caps under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit must be adjusted by the Office of Management and Budget. The LLIVA would allow the President to submit rescission requests without time constraints. Committee allocations and spending caps would need to be adjusted accordingly. Rescission requests would be considered under fast-track procedures, with a five-day deadline for committees to report the bill without substantive revision. The committee handling the bill must report it within five days without substantial changes, or it will be automatically discharged. A vote on final passage must occur by the 10th day of the session after the bill's introduction. Debate time is limited to four hours in the House and 10 hours in the Senate, with no amendments allowed. Additional expedited procedural rules are outlined for the approval bill's consideration. The LLIVA would grant the President the authority to withhold budget. The LLIVA allows the President to withhold budget authority proposed for rescission or suspend the execution of direct spending for 180 days, with the option to release the funds before the 180 days expire. These provisions have not been previously seen in expedited rescission. Provisions allowing the President to withhold funds proposed for rescission or suspend the execution of direct spending for 180 days have not been previously seen in expedited rescission bills. Supporters argue it provides a temporary mechanism for Congress to consider a President's request, while others view it as unnecessary due to expedited procedures in LLIVA ensuring a final vote within a month. Critics of the 180-day withholding mechanism argue that it could lead to abuse and unnecessary delays, as expedited procedures in LLIVA already ensure a final vote within a month. They believe a shorter period than 180 days would be sufficient for Congress to act on a special message. Additionally, they point out that the bill does not prevent the President from initiating multiple 180-day withholding periods, potentially allowing for the return of policy deferrals invalidated by previous court rulings. The 180-day provision allows for the return of policy deferrals, subject to a one-house veto, but invalidated by court decisions. Supporters argue it is the maximum deferral period, with the President able to release funds earlier if deemed necessary. The language does not mandate early release even if one chamber rejects the approval bill. The LLIVA states that its provisions are severable for judicial review, meaning unconstitutional parts would be removed while the rest remains. It would take effect upon signing and only apply to future spending or tax bills. Other similar measures have been introduced in the 109th Congress. Several measures with expedited rescission provisions have been introduced in the 109th Congress, including the LLIVA (H.R. 4890 / S. 2381) and an omnibus budget reform measure, H.R. 2290. The provisions in H.R. 2290 would authorize the President to propose rescissions of \"wasteful\" budget authority in appropriations acts. The President could propose to reduce discretionary spending limits under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 by an amount not exceeding the proposed rescission. H.R. 2290 limits the President to one message for each appropriations act, unless accounts fall under multiple appropriations subcommittees. Representative Mark Udall introduced the \"Stimulating Leadership in Cutting Expenditures Act (SLICE Act) of 2006\" in the 109th Congress to enable the President to propose spending reductions for Congress to debate and vote on. The bill includes provisions for special messages and expedited procedures for budget authority. The provisions in H.R.4699 allow the President to submit special messages for reducing spending in appropriations acts. Senator John Kerry introduced S. 2372, the Expedited Budget Item Act. The draft bill introduced by Senator John Kerry, S. 2372, allows the President to propose cancellations for discretionary budget authority, new direct spending, and limited tax benefits within three days of enactment. The President can propose cancellations for discretionary budget authority, new direct spending, and limited tax benefits within three days of enactment. If the draft bill is defeated in either the House or the Senate, items proposed for cancellation will take effect. Representative John Spratt introduced H.R. 5667 on June 21. H.R. 5667, introduced by Representative John Spratt, proposes a legislative line item veto allowing the President to cancel discretionary spending and limited tax benefits. It includes expedited procedures for congressional consideration of the President's proposals. H.R. 5667 proposes a line item veto for the President to cancel discretionary spending and limited tax benefits. The bill allows for one special message per bill and expedited procedures for congressional consideration. Amendments are limited, with 100 House members and 16 Senate members able to seek a separate vote on a spending item or tax provision. The House Budget Committee and Rules Committee have both voted favorably on the bill. The House approved H.R. 4890, as amended, by a vote of 247-172. Meanwhile, Senator Judd Gregg introduced the Stop Over Spending Act, including a modified version of the Legislative Line Item Veto Act in Title I, as S. 3521. Senator Gregg introduced the bill S. 3521, which includes a modified version of the Legislative Line Item Veto Act. The Senate Budget Committee voted 12-10 to report the bill favorably, with a comparative overview provided in Table 1. The Line Item Veto Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-130) was overturned by the Supreme Court in 1998. H.R. 4890 / S. 2381 had differences in versions, with modifications to lessen the President's flexibility. The House-passed version of H.R 4890 requires submission of special messages within 45 calendar days of enactment. The House-passed version of H.R 4890 requires submission of special messages within 45 calendar days of enactment, while S. 3521 allows submission up to one year later. The House version sets a limit of five special messages per act, or 10 for omnibus measures, while the Senate bill limits the President to four special messages per calendar year. The House version is more permissive in total number of special messages, while the Senate bill is more lenient in timing of submissions. The House-passed version of H.R 4890 is more permissive in terms of total number of special messages, while the Senate bill is more lenient in the timing of their submissions. The LLIVA allows the President to withhold funds for up to 180 calendar days, while S. 3521 limits withholding to 45 calendar days. The House-passed version allows a 45-day extension for a total withholding period of up to 90 days. The LLIVA has no sunset termination date. The House-passed version of H.R. 4890 allows the President a 45-day extension for a total withholding period of up to 90 days. The expedited rescission authority would expire after six years in the House-passed version and after four years in S. 3521. Both versions narrow the range of targeted tax benefits compared to the Administration's proposal. The House-passed version of H.R. 4890 and S. 3521 narrow the range of targeted tax benefits compared to the Administration's proposal. H.R. 4890 covers measures affecting a single beneficiary, while S. 3521 defines targeted tax benefits as affecting a particular or limited group of taxpayers. The Senate Budget Committee version and the 1996 act also require the Joint Committee on Taxation to report on targeted tax benefits. The House-passed version of H.R. 4890 and S. 3521 narrows the range of targeted tax benefits compared to the Administration's proposal. It covers measures affecting a single beneficiary, while S. 3521 defines targeted tax benefits as affecting a particular or limited group of taxpayers. The Senate Budget Committee version and the 1996 act require the Joint Committee on Taxation to identify targeted tax benefits. The House-passed version also relates to the Impoundment Control Act of 1974. The House-passed version of H.R. 4890 and S. 3521 narrows the range of targeted tax benefits compared to the Administration's proposal. It covers measures affecting a single beneficiary, while S. 3521 defines targeted tax benefits as affecting a particular or limited group of taxpayers. The version approved by the House would repeal the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, except for certain sections. H.R 4890/ S. 2381 and S. 3521 would amend Title X of the ICA by striking Part C and inserting new text. The current bills aim to augment or replace the President's rescission authority under the ICA. The House-passed version of H.R. 4890 and S. 3521 aims to narrow targeted tax benefits compared to the Administration's proposal. There were no substantive changes to H.R. 4890 during floor consideration, but a manager's amendment was adopted. The amendment clarified that any cancelled amount from a trust fund or special fund would be returned to the original fund. The Transportation and Infrastructure Committee added clarifying language to H.R. 4890, specifying that any cancelled amount from a trust fund or special fund would be returned to the original fund. Changes to S. 3521 included prohibiting the President from resubmitting items of direct spending or targeted tax benefits. The bill prohibits the President from resubmitting rejected direct spending or tax benefit items, but allows resubmission of cancellation proposals if Congress fails to act. It also shortens the period for the President to suspend new spending or tax benefits. Features in the bill remain unchanged from the original version. The provisions for expedited consideration of special messages proposing rescissions of funds have remained similar over the years, with bills seeking a vote on final passage within 10 days. In the early 1990s, there were provisions for consideration of substitute rescissions packages or allowing a motion to strike a particular item. In the 109th Congress, expedited rescission bills have varied in scope, including discretionary budget authority, direct spending, and targeted tax benefits. H.R. 4699 in particular would add certain transportation projects to the special messages for rescissions. In the 109th Congress, H.R. 4699 proposed adding transportation projects to possible cancellations by the President, expanding the scope of rescission to discretionary budget authority and direct spending. The Line Item Veto Act of 1996, with its enhanced rescission framework, faced constitutional concerns and included provisions for expedited judicial review. The Line Item Veto Act of 1996, with its enhanced rescission framework, faced constitutional concerns and included provisions for expedited judicial review. The expedited rescission approach, especially for discretionary spending, is seen as constitutionally sound. The LLIVA also includes a severability provision to protect the act if any part is found unconstitutional. The Line Item Veto Act of 1996, facing constitutional concerns, included provisions for expedited judicial review. The President's authority for special rescission messages might continue if targeted tax benefits are overturned. The Bush Administration sought enactment of the LLIVA in the 109th Congress, urging the Senate to pass the line item veto quickly. The President urged Senators to pass line item veto legislation quickly to target pork in large spending bills and enhance fiscal discipline."
