    "content": "The Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program offers private health insurance to federal employees, retirees, and their dependents, providing over $40 billion in benefits annually. Approximately 8.2 million individuals are covered by FEHB each year, with 85% of federal employees and 90% of retirees participating. Coverage options include individual, family, and self plus one plans. Beginning in 2016, individuals will have a new coverage option in the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program: self plus one coverage for themselves and one eligible family member. FEHB offers fee-for-service (FFS) and health maintenance organizations (HMOs) plans with shared premiums between the federal government and the employee or retiree. All plans must cover basic services like hospital and physician care with varying cost sharing. Prior to the creation of FEHB in 1959, federal employees could not obtain health insurance through the government. They had to purchase coverage on their own or through union plans. Employers in the private sector started offering health insurance in the 1950s. President Truman's Commission recommended federal health insurance in 1951. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Act of 1959 (FEHBA) was passed by Congress to provide health insurance coverage for federal employees. It established eligibility parameters, types of health plans, benefits, and the government's share of premiums. An Employees Health Benefits Fund was also created to cover program expenses. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Act of 1959 (FEHBA) established an Employees Health Benefits Fund to pay for program expenses and outlined the role of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). OPM has the authority to contract with insurers and manage FEHB. The general model of FEHB, with enrollees choosing coverage from private insurers, has remained unchanged despite amendments to the law. Employees and retirees share the cost of premiums with the federal government. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Act of 1959 (FEHBA) established the Employees Health Benefits Fund and the role of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). While the general model of FEHB, with enrollees choosing coverage from private insurers, has not changed, aspects such as the government's share of premiums and eligibility have been modified over time by Congress. Policymakers play a role in proposing changes to the program. Since its inception, Congress has been involved in modifying the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program. The FEHB model allows enrollees to choose coverage from competing insurers with minimal intervention from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). This model is seen as successful in giving enrollees cost-conscious choices and controlling overall program costs. Researchers are interested in FEHB as a model for both private and public health insurance programs. Researchers have considered exporting aspects of the successful FEHB model to other health care programs, such as Medicare, or expanding access to FEHB for individuals outside of federal workers and retirees. Some policymakers have introduced legislation to create new programs or expand FEHB eligibility, with suggestions that FEHB features could serve as a model for state-level health programs. Congressional interest in FEHB goes beyond its potential as a model for other health care programs. Policymakers have a responsibility for FEHB's viability and sustainability, with suggestions that lessons learned from FEHB could inform the establishment of health insurance exchanges under the ACA. Congressional policymakers have a financial interest in the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program, as the federal government has always contributed to its costs. Congress has the authority to restructure FEHB to maintain or improve its function. This report aims to explain the evolution of FEHB and how Congress has interacted with the program in the past. It also discusses certain changes to the program and how Congress has linked the use of federal funds to policy conditions. The report discusses how Congress has interacted with the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program in the past, including conditioning the use of federal funds on policy changes, changing the formula for determining the government's share of FEHB premiums, modifying program eligibility, and implementing policies affecting the relationship between Medicare and FEHB. Congress has the authority to place conditions on federal funds to make changes to FEHB. In 1983, Congress passed a law prohibiting the use of federal funds for abortions under FEHB, except in cases of danger to the woman's life. This provision has been renewed annually with slight changes, except in 1994 and 1995 when it was excluded by the 103rd Congress. The provision was reinstated to allow funds for abortions in cases of danger to the woman's life, rape, or incest, and has been included in subsequent appropriations bills each year. Table 1 summarizes laws that have enacted policy changes to FEHB by placing conditions on the use of federal funds, with the government's share of premiums increasing over the years. The government's share was initially set at 50% of the premium and had to fall within a specified dollar range, but in 1971, the \"big six\" formula was created, equal to the simple average of the premiums of six health plans offered in FEHB meeting specified criteria. The \"big six\" formula was created in 1971, equal to the simple average of premiums of six health plans in FEHB. The government's share of premiums increased from 40% to 50% in 1974. In 1997, the Balanced Budget Act introduced the current formula where the government contributes 72% of the weighted average premium of all plans, not exceeding 75% of any one plan's premium. The government contributes 72% of the weighted average premium of all plans in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Act (FEHBA), not exceeding 75% of any one plan's premium. Eligibility for FEHB has been extended to more categories of federal employees, retirees, and their family members since its enactment. Since FEHBA's enactment, eligibility for FEHB has been extended to more categories of federal employees, retirees, and their family members. In 1978, part-time employees were included, and in 1988, certain temporary workers were also covered. Congress authorized temporary continuation of coverage (TCC) in 1988 for separating employees and their dependents for up to 18 months after separation, with TCC enrollees paying the entire FEHB premium plus a 2% administrative fee. Since its establishment, FEHB eligibility has expanded to include more federal employees, retirees, and their families. TCC allows separating employees and dependents to continue coverage for up to 18 months, with enrollees paying the full premium plus a 2% fee. Exceptions include 36 months of coverage for children aging out of their parents' plans. In 1982, Congress passed a law applying Medicare's Hospital Insurance tax to federal employment, changing the interaction between FEHB and Medicare. In 1982, Congress passed the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act (P.L. 97-248), which extended Medicare eligibility to federal workers based on their employment. Additionally, the Federal Employees Health Benefits Act of 1959 (P.L. 86-382) established the FEHB program for federal employees, outlining eligibility and enrollment procedures. The FEHB program for federal employees was established by P.L. 86-382 on July 1, 1960. It outlined eligibility criteria for current employees and retirees, including enrollment procedures, benefit types, premium shares, and OPM's role. Retirees needed to have at least 12 years of service or retire due to disability after July 1, 1960, and be enrolled in an FEHB plan for five years prior to retirement. OPM could contract or approve different types of health benefit plans for participation in FEHB, including Service Benefit Plan and Indemnity Benefit Plan, as well as Employee Organization Plans. Retirees needed to have at least 12 years of service or retire due to disability, and be enrolled in an FEHB plan for five years prior to retirement. Family members of employees and retirees were also eligible for coverage. Comprehensive Medical Plans are either group-practice prepayment plans or individual-practice plans. Employee Organization Plans provide health benefits to members of the organization and are available only to employees, retirees, and their families who are members of the organization at the time of enrollment. Medical Plans can be group-practice prepayment plans or individual-practice prepayment plans. The government's share of premiums in FEHB plans under P.L. 86-382 depended on the type of plan and enrollee, with a 50% share for service benefit and indemnity plans. The government's share of premiums in FEHB plans under P.L. 86-382 depended on the type of plan and enrollee, with a 50% share for service benefit and indemnity plans. For employees and retirees with individual or family coverage, the biweekly government share had specific minimum and maximum amounts. The government's share of premiums in FEHB plans under P.L. 86-382 varied based on the type of plan and enrollee, with a 50% share for service benefit and indemnity plans. For employees and retirees with individual or family coverage, the government's share was 50% of the biweekly premium if it was less than $2.50 for individual coverage and less than $6.00 for family coverage. Female employees or retirees with family coverage received a 30% government share if the biweekly premium was less than $6.00. P.L. 86-568 authorized FEHB coverage for employees of county committees under the Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act. P.L. 88-59 extended the deadline for applications to participate in FEHB from December 31, 1959, to December 31, 1963, and eliminated the requirement for offering health care benefits prior to applying. P.L. 88-284, passed on March 17, 1964, expanded FEHB coverage to include employees with work-related injuries, foster children, and unmarried children. It removed the requirement for employee organizations to offer health benefits before applying for FEHB. P.L. 88-284, enacted on March 17, 1964, expanded FEHB coverage to include employees with work-related injuries, foster children, and unmarried children up to age 21. It also allowed retirees to continue their FEHB coverage if enrolled by December 31, 1964. Additionally, it granted OPM discretionary authority to terminate contracts with carriers not meeting enrollment requirements and equalized the government's share of premiums for all enrollees. The government's share of premiums for employee organization plans and comprehensive medical plans was changed by the act. For enrollees in these plans with biweekly premiums less than twice the government share, the government's share was set at 50% for both individual and family plans. P.L. 88-531 authorized FEHB coverage for certain United States commissioners and their dependents if the Civil Service Retirement Act applies to the commissioners. It also allowed certain teachers employed by the Board of Education of the District of Columbia to participate in a health benefits plan established under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Act of 1959. P.L. 88-631 extended FEHB coverage to teachers in the District of Columbia with at least two years of temporary employment. It also provided retroactive salary increases for certain federal government employees and preserved benefits for Congressional staff receiving fellowships. P.L. 89-379 extended FEHB coverage to congressional employees with certain staff fellowships, while P.L. 89-504 amended FEHB to adjust government share of premiums for individual and family enrollment. Enrollment costs increased to $1.62 for individual and $3.94 for family plans, not exceeding 50% of the total premium. Dependent children coverage extended to age 22. Employees on leave without pay for full-time officer roles could maintain FEHB coverage. National Guard technicians became eligible for FEHB coverage starting January 1, 1969. Federal Magistrates Act authorized FEHB coverage for full-time employees. The Federal Magistrates Act of 1968 and subsequent acts expanded FEHB coverage for federal employees, including those transferring to international organizations. P.L. 91-418 in 1970 adjusted the government's premium contribution. P.L. 91-418 in 1970 changed the government's share of health insurance premiums by introducing the \"big six\" formula, which calculates the average of premiums from six benefit plans to reflect medical price inflation. The government's share of health insurance premiums was changed by P.L. 91-418 in 1970 through the introduction of the \"big six\" formula. This formula calculates the average of premiums from six benefit plans to reflect medical price inflation. The act also allowed family members of deceased employees or retirees with less than five years of service to continue enrollment in an FEHB plan. Additionally, noncitizen employees stationed in the Panama Canal Zone were granted FEHB coverage. The Intergovernmental Personnel Act of 1970 extended FEHB coverage to federal employees assigned to state or local governments, as well as state or local government employees assigned to an executive agency. P.L. 93-160 extended FEHB coverage to eligible U.S. nationals employed by the federal government outside the U.S. and Panama Canal Zone. P.L. 93-246 increased the government's contribution to health benefits for federal employees. P.L. 93-246 increased the government's share of the FEHB plan premium from 40% to 50% in 1974, with a provision to raise it to 60% in 1975. A maximum limit of 75% of the total premium amount for any health plan was set. Health insurance plans in FEHB had to comply with OPM decisions in disputes. P.L. 93-363, enacted on July 30, 1974, allowed FEHB enrollees direct access to licensed optometrists and clinical psychologists without the need for supervision or referral by another practitioner. The amendments in P.L. 94-310 granted FEHB enrollees direct access to optometrists and clinical psychologists without supervision or referral. Payment or reimbursement for services performed was also provided for. The government's share of health plan premiums for retirees should be available until expended. P.L. 94-342 restored eligibility for health benefits coverage to certain individuals whose survivor annuities were restored. This amendment aims to establish uniformity in Federal Employee Health benefits. P.L. 95-368, enacted on September 17, 1978, established uniformity in benefits and coverage under FEHB by preempting certain state and local laws inconsistent with FEHB contracts. It provided protections to medically underserved populations and ensured that if an FEHB contract covered a health service cost, it would be provided from January 1, 1980, to December 31, 1984. The Federal Employees Part-Time Career Employment Act of 1978 (P.L. 95-437) required insurance carriers to pay for health practitioners for medically underserved populations from 1980 to 1984. Employee organizations could apply to sponsor health benefit plans between 1978 and 1980. The Federal Employees Part-Time Career Employment Act of 1978 (P.L. 95-437) allowed part-time career employees and their dependents to access FEHB coverage between 1978 and 1980. Part-time career employment is defined as a 16-32 hour work week according to Title 5, Section 3401(2) of the United States Code. P.L. 95-583 reduced the required service for FEHB coverage in retirement from 12 years to 5 years, allowing employees to retain their benefits after 5 years of service. The amendments in P.L. 96-54 and P.L. 96-70 redefined employee eligibility for FEHB coverage, excluding certain individuals. The amendments in P.L. 96-179 redefined employee eligibility for FEHB coverage to exclude non-citizens or nationals of the United States with a permanent duty station outside the country, unless they were employees at specific agencies in the Panama Canal Zone. The amendments in P.L. 96-179 eliminated the \"lives with\" requirement for natural children to be covered by FEHB and added a dependency requirement for all children. P.L. 97-248 required federal employees to pay the Medicare Hospital Insurance tax starting January 1, 1983. The Medicare Hospital Insurance tax was required for federal employees to count their federal employment towards entitlement for premium-free benefits under Medicare Part A. This act also made Medicare payments secondary for employees aged 65 to 69 covered under certain employer group health plans. The amendments in P.L. 97-346 required OPM to determine the difference in government's share of health plan premiums for 1983 and pay the difference into the contingency reserves of all FEHB plans for employees aged 65 to 69 covered under certain employer group health plans. The government was required to pay the difference into the contingency reserves of all FEHB plans for 1983 in proportion to the number of enrollees in each plan. A Joint Resolution Making Further Continuing Appropriations for the Fiscal Year 1984 (P.L. 98-151), November 14, 1983, prohibited funds from being used to pay for abortions or administrative expenses for any FEHB plan that provides benefits for abortions, except in cases where the woman's life would be endangered. This was the first time an abortion-related provision was applied to FEHB. The Civil Service Retirement Spouse Equity Act of 1984 extended FEHB coverage to former spouses of federal employees, who must pay both the employee's and government's share of the premium. Abortion-related provisions have been included in appropriations bills each year, except in the 103rd Congress. The Civil Service Retirement Spouse Equity Act of 1984 extended FEHB coverage to former spouses of federal employees, who must pay both the employee's and government's share of the premium. P.L. 99-53 authorized the establishment of additional employee organization plans in FEHB if the organization applied within 90 days of enactment, specifying conditions required for plan approval. The Federal Employees Benefits Improvement Act of 1986 (P.L. 99-251) allowed for a new type of comprehensive medical plan, called a mixed model prepayment plan, to participate in the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program. This plan combines group practice prepayment plans and individual practice prepayment plans, which are recognized under FEHB. Additionally, the act permitted certain disability annuitants who were reemployed to enroll in an FEHB plan if they were enrolled in one immediately prior to termination of employment. The Federal Employees Benefits Improvement Act of 1986 (P.L. 99-251) introduced mixed model prepayment plans in the FEHB program, combining group and individual practice prepayment plans. It eliminated the requirement for group plans to include physicians from three specialties and allowed studies on expanding contracting authority to health practitioners like nurse midwives and chiropractors. Clinical social workers were also granted contracting authority. The Federal Employees Benefits Improvement Act of 1986 (P.L. 99-251) extended contracting authority to clinical social workers and allowed health plans to require referral by a psychiatrist for reimbursement. It emphasized adequate treatment for mental illness, alcoholism, and drug addiction for FEHB enrollees and directed OPM to study the adequacy of information materials during open enrollment. The act also granted OPM the authority to waive the five-year service requirement for FEHB coverage in retirement under exceptional circumstances. The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (P.L. 99-272) required OPM to determine the minimum financial reserves for health plan carriers to ensure stability. Enrollees were allowed to change or cancel their enrollment within a three-week period if rates or benefits changed, a new plan was offered, or an existing plan was terminated. Transfers of enrollment were also permitted under OPM's prescribed circumstances. The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (P.L. 99-272) required OPM to determine minimum financial reserves for health plan carriers to ensure stability. It set provisions for refunds and excess reserves to be returned to the Employees Health Benefits Fund. Starting October 1, 1986, USPS had to pay the government's share of health plan premiums for postal retirees. Medicare payments were made secondary for services to employees aged 70 and older. The Federal Employees' Retirement System Act of 1986 (P.L. 99-335) provided FEHB eligibility to individuals first employed by the government of the District of Columbia before October 1, 1987. The Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1987 (P.L. 99-569) provided health benefits for certain former spouses of Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) employees. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 (P.L. 100-203) specified USPS contributions to the Employee Health Benefits Fund for health plan premiums. P.L. 100-202 added qualified clinical social workers to FEHB enrollees' non-physician providers. The Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1988 and 1989 (P.L. 100-204) and Making Technical Corrections Relating to the Federal Employees' Retirement System (P.L. 100-238) provided FEHB coverage for certain individuals, including former spouses of Foreign Service employees. Nonfederal employees eligible for FEHB benefits were no longer entitled to such benefits after October 1. The Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988 (P.L. 100-360) included provisions affecting FEHB, later repealed by the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Repeal Act of 1989 (P.L. 101-234). It would have required OPM to reduce rates charged to retirees. The Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988 included provisions affecting FEHB, later repealed by the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Repeal Act of 1989. It would have required OPM to reduce rates charged to retirees participating in FEHB who were also Medicare eligible. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Amendments Act of 1988 (P.L. 100-654) required OPM to make changes to FEHB to incorporate health benefit plans for Medicare-eligible individuals and improve program efficiency. It also mandated OPM to submit a report on adopting NAIC standards for Medicare supplemental health benefit plans under FEHB. Additionally, the Act allowed OPM to impose sanctions on healthcare providers convicted of illegal activities. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Amendments Act of 1988 (P.L. 100-654) authorized OPM to impose debarment and sanctions on healthcare providers convicted of illegal activities, including financial misconduct, patient neglect or abuse, drug-related offenses, and obstruction of justice. It also set time limits for debarment proceedings, prohibited unlicensed providers from participating in FEHB, allowed fines for false claims, and created temporary continuation of FEHB. P.L. 100-654 authorized OPM to impose fines on providers for false charges related to health services. It also established Temporary Continuation of FEHB coverage (TCC) for separating employees and their families, allowing coverage for up to 18 months post-separation. TCC enrollees must pay full premiums plus a 2% administrative charge. The Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act Amendments of 1988 (P.L. 100-679) extended FEHB coverage to certain employees of former Presidents or Vice Presidents who are considered federal employees. Former Presidents or Vice Presidents' office staff are federal employees eligible for FEHB. P.L. 101-76 adjusted the government's share of FEHB plans for 1990 and 1991 in response to Aetna's withdrawal by using the big six formula. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 required the USPS to pay the employer's share of FEHB premiums for survivors of postal employees who retired on or after October 1, 1986. OPM must transmit recommendations to Congress for comprehensive FEHB reform within 180 days of enactment. The Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1990 and 1991 (P.L. 101-246) authorized FEHB coverage for former spouses of Foreign Service employees under specific conditions. P.L. 101-303, enacted on May 29, 1990, allowed federal retirees to pay health benefits premiums directly if their annuity was insufficient to cover the required withholdings. P.L. 101-508, enacted on November 5, 1990, included FEHB-related reforms such as hospitalization cost-containment measures, improved cash management, exemption from state premium taxes, and extension of the big six formula through plan year 1993. The act P.L. 101-508 exempted FEHB plans from state premium taxes and extended the big six formula through plan year 1993. It required coordination between FEHB and Medicare, applied Medicare payment limits to services for retired FEHB enrollees aged 65 and older, limiting FEHB payments for certain services. The Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1991 (P.L. 101-513) limited FEHB payments for services for retired enrollees aged 65 and older to Medicare rates. It also required USPS to pay government's share of FEHB premiums for annuitants retiring from USPS after July 1, 1971, prorated based on service after June 30, 1971. The Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1991 (P.L. 101-513) provided U.S. hostages in Iraq, Kuwait, and Lebanon, and their family members, with FEHB benefits while in hostage status and for 12 months thereafter. The act appropriated up to $10 million for these benefits, with funds expiring six months after enactment. The authority to obligate funds for specific purposes expired six months after enactment. P.L. 101-530 allowed National Guard technicians to be eligible for FEHB benefits without post-1968 service requirements. P.L. 102-88 amended the Central Intelligence Agency Act to provide benefits for former spouses of certain CIA employees. P.L. 102-88, enacted on August 14, 1991, amended the Central Intelligence Agency Act to restore eligibility for FEHB coverage to former spouses of certain CIA employees who lost coverage due to remarriage before age 55. P.L. 102-90, also enacted on August 14, 1991, made employees of the Senate Employee Child Care Center eligible for FEHB coverage. Employees of the Senate Employee Child Care Center can get FEHB coverage during specific periods. P.L. 102-393 prohibits using funds to make changes to FEHB that would impact Medicare beneficiaries. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993 (P.L. 102-484) imposed restrictions on OPM regarding FEHB benefits for retired enrollees eligible for Medicare. These restrictions prevented changes in out-of-pocket costs and the waiver of coinsurance for prescription drugs. The changes intended for plan year 1993 were not implemented due to the act. The Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993 (P.L. 102-484) allows for the continuation of FEHB benefits for individuals involuntarily separated from the Department of Defense due to a reduction in force. This provision applies to those separated on or after the enactment date and before October 1, 1997, or February 1, 1998 (with specific notice given before October 1, 1997). Payments for coverage are limited to the employee's share of premiums, with the last employing agency responsible for payment. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (P.L. 103-66) limits individual payments for FEHB coverage to the employee's share of premiums and requires the last employing agency to cover the remaining portion. It also directed a review to assess the efficiency of providing health care similar to FEHB to eligible individuals under Department of Defense programs. The Reconciliation Act of 1993 (P.L. 103-66) required most FEHB plans to apply Medicare Part B limitations on payments for physician services to retired FEHB enrollees aged 65 or older. Physicians and suppliers accepting Medicare payments must accept equivalent payment and cost sharing from FEHB. Nonparticipating providers in Medicare cannot impose charges exceeding the limiting charge. The act also extended and modified the restructured big six formula temporarily. The Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government Appropriations Act, 1994 (P.L. 103-123) extended and modified the restructured big six formula for plan years 1990-1998. It was the first appropriations act since fiscal year 1984 that did not include a provision restricting funding for abortion coverage in FEHB plans, although this restriction was reinserted in the Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government Appropriations Act, 1996 (P.L. 104-52). The FEGLI Living Benefits Act, 1994 (P.L. 103-409) allowed individuals covered under health benefit plans administered by certain offices to enroll in an FEHB plan upon termination of their current plan. This act deems any prior enrollment under the previous plan as enrollment under FEHB. The Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1996 (P.L. 104-37) allowed individuals covered under health benefit plans administered by the Farm Credit Administration to enroll in an FEHB plan for coverage effective on and after September 30, 1995. Any prior enrollment under the Farm Credit Administration's health benefit plan is considered enrollment under FEHB. Prior to P.L. 104-37, enrollment under FEHB was allowed for individuals covered by the Farm Credit Administration's health benefit plans. P.L. 104-52 reinstated the prohibition of using appropriated funds for abortions or administrative expenses of health plans covering abortions, with exceptions for endangerment of the woman's life, rape, or incest. This provision has been included in subsequent appropriations bills. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996 (P.L. 104-106) changed TCC for certain individuals, allowing them to continue FEHB coverage after separating from a surplus position. The Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act, 1997 (P.L. 104-208) required OPM to prescribe regulations for surviving individuals. The Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act, 1997 (P.L. 104-208) required OPM to prescribe regulations for surviving children to enroll in an FEHB plan if their survivor annuity was terminated due to marriage and later restored. It also mandated a report with recommendations for a demonstration program for certain beneficiaries of Department of Defense health programs. OPM was mandated to write a report with recommendations for a demonstration program allowing certain beneficiaries of Department of Defense health programs entitled to Medicare Part A to enroll in an FEHB health plan. The Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act of 1997 prohibited federal funds for assisted suicide-related benefits, while the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 modified the government's share of FEHB premiums. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-33) modified the formula for determining the government's share of FEHB premiums. OPM is required to calculate the weighted average premium of all plans in FEHB annually by October 1st. The government's share of an FEHB plan for an employee or retiree is 72% of the weighted average premium, with a cap of 75% of any given plan's premium. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-33) maintained the provision that the government's share of FEHB premiums cannot exceed 75% of any plan's premium. Individuals enrolled in FEHB are not eligible for Medicare MSA plans until OPM certifies no increased government expenditures. The Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999 (P.L. 105-261) directed the Secretary of Defense to enter into an agreement. The Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999 (P.L. 105-261) directed the Secretary of Defense to conduct a demonstration project with OPM for eligible individuals to enroll voluntarily in health plans offered through FEHB. The project ran for three contract years, with enrollment open for the year 2000 and ending on December 31, 2002. The Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999 (P.L. 105-261) directed a demonstration project with OPM for eligible individuals to enroll voluntarily in health plans offered through FEHB. The project ran for three contract years, with enrollment open for the year 2000 and ending on December 31, 2002. The Federal Employees Health Care Protection Act of 1998 (P.L. 105-266) required reports on project costs, effectiveness, and feasibility of making the program permanent. It also addressed debarment of health care providers from FEHB for fraudulent activities. The Federal Employees Health Care Protection Act of 1998 (P.L. 105-266) made administrative changes to FEHB, including debarment of fraudulent health care providers, modifying the definition of a carrier, and allowing government-wide plans underwritten by state affiliates. It also revised preemption provisions for FEHB contracts. The Federal Employees Health Care Protection Act of 1998 made administrative changes to FEHB, including revising preemption provisions for contracts related to health insurance or plans. OPM is required to encourage carriers to obtain discounts from healthcare providers and disclose the conditions for such discounts. The act also established rules for the readmission of certain plans that have discontinued their participation in FEHB. The Federal Employees Health Care Protection Act of 1998 established rules for the readmission of certain plans that have discontinued their participation in FEHB. It clarified that plans under FEHB can provide direct access, direct payment, and reimbursement to licensed health care providers not specified in statute.

The government's share of premiums for self plus one coverage is determined in the same way as for individual and family coverage, with OPM finding the weighted average premium of all plans in FEHB. OPM determines the government's share of premiums for self plus one coverage by finding the weighted average premium of all plans in FEHB and paying either 72% of this average or 75% of any given plan's premium, whichever is smaller. For the first contract year with the self plus one option, OPM will base the weighted average premium on an actuarial analysis."
