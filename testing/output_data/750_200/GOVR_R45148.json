    "content": "Economics is the study of efficiently using scarce resources and trade benefits countries by allowing them to produce more efficiently through comparative advantage. Trade also enables countries to import goods and services, boosting consumer welfare. Trade allows countries to import goods and services, benefiting consumer welfare by providing access to a greater variety of products at lower costs. Imports are necessary when certain goods cannot be produced domestically or are more efficiently made by foreign firms. This leads to improved consumer purchasing power through global value chains. Trade benefits consumers by providing access to a wider range of goods at lower costs, improving purchasing power, particularly for lower-income households. It also helps control inflation and allows producers to access lower-cost inputs, enhancing global competitiveness. Overseas markets for exports enable firms to exploit economies of scale and increase returns to scale. In the long term, trade fosters greater competition. Trade allows firms to exploit economies of scale by expanding production and reducing average costs. It leads to greater competition, encourages innovation and investment in research and development, supporting increased productivity and economic growth. Economist David Ricardo's theory of comparative advantage remains relevant in explaining how countries trade today, emphasizing the benefits of specialization and trade even if a country is more efficient than its trading partners in producing all goods. David Ricardo's theory of comparative advantage emphasizes that even if a country is more efficient than its trading partners in producing all goods, specialization and trade are still beneficial. The key factor is the opportunity cost - how much output of one good must be sacrificed to produce another. Ricardo argued that comparative advantage, not absolute advantage, determines which goods countries should specialize in. David Ricardo's theory of comparative advantage states that countries should specialize in goods they can produce relatively well and trade for goods they produce less efficiently. This theory predicts gains from trade by focusing on each country's comparative advantage. Subsequent economic theories have built upon and refined this concept to explain modern trade patterns in the global economy. Economists analyze how comparative advantage explains complex trade patterns in the 21st century with global value chains, services, digital trade, and technology flows. Differences in comparative advantage stem from varying factor endowments like labor, capital, human capital, and technology. The United States has a comparative advantage in producing goods that use high-skilled labor intensively, such as aircraft, due to its relative abundance of high-skilled labor. Differences in productive technology among countries can also affect relative efficiency in production. The ICT revolution and new platforms for digital trade have broken down barriers to technology and knowledge-flows across countries, potentially influencing comparative advantage through government policies. Government policies can either indirectly influence industries through measures like eliminating corruption and building infrastructure, or directly support strategic industries with subsidies or tariffs. This debate on the impact of government intervention continues. There is a debate on the impact of government intervention in supporting strategic industries that may require initial government support to reach economic targets. Protectionist policies can distort trade and investment flows, reduce efficiency, and hinder the development of competitive industries. Intra-industry trade, where countries trade goods within the same industry, is a significant portion of global trade. Intra-industry trade between countries with similar resource endowments and levels of development suggests trade based on economies of scale rather than comparative advantage. This type of trade involves large flows of products between advanced economies. Trade between countries involves a pattern of specialization where each country produces and trades a niche subset of goods. This drives changes in employment, wages, income distribution, and standard of living. Overall, trade has a positive effect on a country's economic well-being. Trade benefits a country's economic well-being by increasing GDP through competition, efficiency gains, and consumer welfare. Liberalizing trade globally has reduced extreme poverty by half in the past 25 years. However, trade benefits are not evenly distributed within an economy and can disrupt certain sectors. Trade has reduced extreme poverty by half in the past 25 years, but benefits are not evenly distributed. Job losses and stagnant wages may be concentrated in certain regions and industries. While economy-wide gains from trade generally exceed costs, the challenge lies in dealing equitably with those affected. Economists argue that policies facilitating adjustment and compensating for losses from market forces, like trade, are more cost-effective than protective measures. Political support for free trade is maintained by providing adjustment assistance to those potentially displaced. Policymakers debate the effectiveness of existing trade-related community support policies in the United States. Trade can create and destroy jobs in the economy, known as \"job churn,\" similar to technological changes. Different effects on workers in various occupations, called \"occupational exposure to trade,\" can result from trade liberalization. Disruptions can also occur domestically when firms relocate between states for economic reasons. This can lead to varying effects not only between sectors but also within the same sector. Trade liberalization can cause firms to relocate between states for economic reasons, leading to job shifts within industries. Job loss attributed to trade is a small share of jobs lost economy-wide each year, with estimates suggesting around 150,000 U.S. net jobs lost annually between 2001 and 2016 due to expanded trade in manufactured goods. Between 2001 and 2016, over 150,000 U.S. net jobs were lost annually due to expanded trade in manufactured goods, accounting for 1% of workers laid off in a typical year. Some workers may be reemployed elsewhere, but the short-run costs of switching occupations due to trade liberalization can be substantial, including reduced wages. Import competition from China has negatively affected U.S. local labor markets and manufacturing jobs. Import competition from China has negatively affected U.S. local labor markets and manufacturing jobs. Economists argue that linking net imports to unemployment is questionable. U.S. global trade has historically expanded during economic growth, with the trade deficit and unemployment rate moving together. GDP growth reduces unemployment and increases demand for imports. International trade can impact worker wages and income inequality in the United States, with conflicting findings on the effects of trade agreements. Trade is not the sole factor affecting wages, as technological change plays a significant role. Many studies have found that factors like technological change have a larger impact on relative wages than trade. Trade can increase returns for capital and high-skilled workers while decreasing returns for low-skilled labor. Imports from countries like China with abundant low-skilled labor can negatively affect wages of low-skilled U.S. workers in import-sensitive industries. The growth of global value chains has led some U.S. multinational corporations to shift low-value, labor-intensive production overseas, impacting wages of low-skilled workers. However, U.S. workers in export-oriented industries earn more on average than those in non-exporting industries. The U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) estimated a 16% earnings premium in export-intensive manufacturing industries and a 15.5% premium in services. Economic globalization involves trade in goods and services, capital flows, technology transfer, and international labor flows. Economic globalization involves trade in goods and services, capital flows, technology transfer, and international labor migration. Global trade as a percentage of global GDP increased from 25% to 57% from 1960 to 2017. The stock of global foreign direct investment (FDI) also grew during this period. Global trade grew faster than GDP post-World War II, with FDI increasing from 6% to 39% of global GDP by 2017. Technical advances in transport and communication have reduced geographic barriers, while policies have lowered man-made barriers to international exchange since World War II. Globalization post-World War II has led to increased global trade and FDI, with reduced barriers to international exchange. The ongoing debate surrounds the inclusivity of economic integration and its impact on inequality within countries. Global value chains, mainly driven by multinational corporations, involve the production of goods across multiple countries. Global value chains (GVCs), led by multinational corporations (MNCs), involve assembling products from parts produced in different countries, traded across borders multiple times. More than half of global manufacturing imports are intermediate goods within supply chains, while over 75% of global services imports are intermediate services. OECD data shows that a quarter of national exports include foreign content. In the U.S., the foreign value-added share in exports increased across most industries from 1995 to 2011. The foreign value-added share in U.S. exports increased in most industries from 1995 to 2011, driven by global value chains (GVCs) which are considered the backbone of the global economy. GVCs have facilitated lower trade barriers, technological advances, and faster international transport, leading to increased trade with advanced economies, emerging markets, and developing countries. The growth of GVCs has blurred the distinction between exports and imports, making it difficult to understand who benefits from global trade. Trade in intermediates means imports are essential inputs into exports, affecting policies and bilateral trade balances. Analysts point to fundamental shifts in GVCs as they evolve. Analysts highlight key shifts in Global Value Chains (GVCs) that shape globalization and future policy challenges. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) drives trade by multinational corporations, supporting the development of GVCs. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) supports the development of global value chains by multinational corporations (MNCs), leading to increased intra-firm trade and trade between parent companies and their foreign affiliates. U.S. firms often invest abroad to expand their market for goods. U.S. firms invest abroad to sell goods and services to foreign markets, maintaining operations close to customers to understand local preferences. In 2016, 11% of sales from U.S. foreign affiliates went to U.S. parent companies, 59% to the host country's market, and 30% to other foreign countries. Foreign firms invest in the United States to access the consumer market, high-skilled labor, and resources. Global integration through trade and investment flows can disrupt markets, leading to concerns about offshoring and outsourcing to countries with lower labor costs. The shift of manufacturing and business functions to countries with lower labor costs by U.S. multinational corporations can lead to concerns about offshoring and outsourcing. While globalization and trade liberalization may not significantly impact overall U.S. employment rates, there could be greater volatility in worker incomes and employment in certain sectors. The impact of globalization on U.S. employment is unlikely to affect the overall rate, but it may lead to greater volatility in worker incomes and employment in specific sectors. For example, offshoring manufacturing jobs could reduce U.S. manufacturing jobs but increase service-related jobs. Globalization also affects wealth distribution by dampening wages for lower-skilled workers and increasing returns to capital. Globalization has led to a decline in the labor share of national income, with a 10-20% contribution to rising wage inequality in the United States. Most-favored-nation treatment is a key principle in the World Trade Organization. Most-favored-nation treatment (MFN) in the World Trade Organization requires members to treat each other equally, granting the same trade benefits to all. Exceptions exist, such as establishing separate trade agreements outside the WTO. There are exceptions to MFN treatment in the WTO, allowing countries to form separate trade agreements with additional preferences. Developing countries may receive special treatment. National treatment requires equal treatment of domestic and foreign products once imported. The concept of \"most-favored nation\" (MFN) trade status ensures equal treatment of imported products compared to domestic ones. This principle also applies to services and intellectual property rights. Countries without permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) with the United States, like Cuba and North Korea, may face higher duty rates on imports. Other countries may initially have temporary or conditional NTR status before receiving PNTR. Countries may receive temporary or conditional NTR status before graduating to PNTR. Imports from countries with NTR status face lower duty rates. The Trade Act of 1974 prohibits granting PNTR status to countries not receiving such treatment at the time of the law's enactment. The Jackson-Vanik amendment denies PNTR status for countries restricting freedom of emigration. The United States, as a WTO member, must extend MFN treatment to all WTO members immediately and unconditionally. As a WTO member, the United States must grant MFN treatment to all WTO members immediately. PNTR status is required for countries like China, Vietnam, and Russia upon their WTO accession to receive full benefits. The Harmonized Tariff Schedule determines tariffs on imported goods using standard commodity codes developed by the World Customs Organization. The Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) determines tariffs on imported goods using standard commodity codes developed by the World Customs Organization (WCO). The HTS groups products into 96 chapters with detailed descriptions at the 6-digit level, providing a more specific classification for each product category. The Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) uses standard codes to classify imported goods into product categories. These codes are standardized worldwide up to the 6-digit level, with further subdivisions in the United States. The U.S. International Trade Commission maintains the HTS, while U.S. Customs and Border Protection enforces the tariff code. Rules of origin determine the nationality of imported products and are crucial for various reasons. Rules of origin (ROO) are crucial for interpreting and enforcing the tariff code, determining product nationality, assessing duty rates, and establishing eligibility for trade programs. Determining origin can be complex due to global sourcing of parts for products like autos, computers, and clothing. The United States negotiates different ROO within its free trade agreements (FTAs). The United States negotiates Rules of Origin (ROO) within its free trade agreements (FTAs) to ensure eligible trading partners receive tariff benefits. The \"yarn-forward\" rule in apparel requires yarn and fabric to come from FTA partners, impacting import-sensitive industries. Some argue the rule is strict compared to other countries' rules. Some in Congress argue that the yarn-forward rule is strict compared to other countries, while textile interests believe it is crucial for the U.S. industry's survival. Global trade is vital for the economy, with trade as a share of global GDP increasing from 25% in 1960 to 57% in 2017. Trade openness and reforms have led to higher growth in productivity, real incomes, and reduced poverty worldwide. Annual real global trade growth used to outpace GDP growth post-World War II, but this trend has not continued in recent years. In recent years, global trade growth has slowed down due to various factors such as weak import demand, exchange rate fluctuations, and falling commodity prices. The slowdown in investment and China's shift towards a consumption-driven economy have also played a role. However, trade growth has rebounded since 2016, increasing from 2%. Trade growth rebounded from 2% in 2016 to over 5% in 2017, driven by increased investment and consumption. IMF and WTO projected further growth for 2018 and 2019, but now expect a slowdown due to rising trade tensions and policy uncertainty, especially between the US and China. Global trade growth is expected to slow due to heightened trade policy uncertainty between the United States and China. Restrictive trade measures imposed by the US and its major trading partners are impacting trade flows and prices in specific sectors. Recent policy announcements have also negatively affected businesses' outlooks and investment plans, leading to concerns over disruptions to supply chains and potential increases in trade restrictions. The top-five largest trading economies in 2017 were the United States, China, Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom. In 2017, the top-five largest trading economies were the United States, China, Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom. The EU would be the largest trading economy if treated as a single bloc. China was the largest exporter, while the United States was the largest importer. The U.S. share of global goods exports fell from 15% in 1960 to 9% in 2017 due to increased global trade. The United States is the largest importer and exporter, with a declining share of global goods exports from 15% in 1960 to 9% in 2017. U.S. exports and imports of goods and services combined were equivalent to 27% of GDP in 2017. Despite being a major global trader, the size of trade relative to the U.S. economy is smaller compared to other major trading economies. Various organizations have developed indexes to assess the \"openness\" or \"competitiveness\" of the U.S. economy. The United States ranked first in the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Index. In 2017, U.S. exports grew by over 40% and imports by over 20%. Trade relative to GDP has increased significantly since 1960, with exports as a percent of GDP rising from 5% to 12% and imports from 4% to 15%. China was the top U.S. trading partner in 2017, with $712 billion in trade. In 2017, U.S. exports as a percent of GDP increased from 5% to 12%, while imports increased from 4% to 15%. China was the top U.S. trading partner with $712 billion in trade, followed by Canada, Mexico, Japan, and Germany. The EU is the largest export destination and source of imports for the United States. About 65% of U.S. global trade is with countries without a free trade agreement. The majority of U.S. global trade, about 65%, is with countries without a free trade agreement. Multinational corporations produce worldwide using inputs from many countries, leading to complex value chains. Traditional trade statistics do not fully reflect the source of imports or exports. The implications of trade data for the U.S. economy are not fully reflected in traditional trade statistics. For example, products like iPhones, developed by U.S. firm Apple, are assembled in China using components from various countries. When the U.S. imports iPhones, the full value is attributed to China, even though most profits benefit Apple. The value added in China is small, with Apple benefiting the most from profits generated by product sales. U.S. imports from China often involve products from multiple countries, leading to an inflated bilateral trade deficit. \"Trade in value-added\" (TiVA) aims to identify the origin of value in global trade. According to TiVA estimates, the U.S. trade deficit with China would have been reduced by one-third in 2011 if bilateral trade flows had been measured this way. The trade deficit refers to the balance of trade in goods and services, with the trade balance being the difference between a country's exports and imports of goods and services. The trade balance is the difference between a country's exports and imports of goods and services, with a deficit occurring when a country imports more than it exports. The United States has consistently run trade deficits post-WWII, with a global trade deficit of $552.3 billion in 2017 driven by goods trade. In 2017, the United States had a global trade deficit of $552.3 billion, driven by goods trade. The U.S. trade deficit in goods was $807.5 billion, while the services trade surplus was $255.2 billion. The current account, which includes trade in goods, services, net income, and government flows, is the broadest measure of a country's trade balance. The United States has had an annual current account deficit since the mid-1970s, with a $449.1 billion deficit in 2017. The decrease from the peak of $806 billion in 2006 was due to the economic slowdown post-2008 financial crisis, reduced demand for imports, and lower commodity prices. The deficit reflects that the U.S. consumes more than it produces and imports more. The U.S. global trade deficit reflects that the United States consumes more than it produces and imports more than it exports. Economists attribute the deficit to an imbalance between domestic savings and total investment, with low rates of domestic savings being a significant cause. Americans borrow from countries with excess savings, like China, to make up for the shortfall and fuel economic growth. Americans borrow from countries like China to make up for the shortfall in domestic savings, enabling higher economic growth. This leads to a trade deficit, influenced by factors like economic growth differences and the role of the U.S. dollar as a global reserve currency. The U.S. trade deficit is sustained by the U.S. dollar as a global reserve currency, allowing foreign investors to seek dollar-denominated assets. As long as foreigners continue to finance the lack of savings in the U.S. economy by buying U.S. Treasury securities, the trade deficit can persist. The trade deficit relative to the economy size serves as a metric to analyze trends and compare with other countries. The U.S. trade deficit relative to GDP reached a historic high of 5.8% in 2006 but has since declined to 2.3% in 2017. Countries with a ratio below 100 are net borrowers and typically run current account deficits. The United States, along with the United Kingdom and Canada, had the largest current account deficits as a percent of GDP in 2017. Some policymakers believe that U.S. bilateral trade deficits with countries like China are a result of unfair trade practices. The U.S. trade deficit is seen as unfair due to market-distorting trade policies like barriers and subsidies. While reducing protectionist measures in certain countries could boost U.S. exports, the overall deficit is mainly influenced by low U.S. savings. If protectionist trade measures were reduced in certain countries, U.S. exporters might sell more products, but the overall trade deficit would remain unchanged if U.S. consumption and savings behavior stayed the same. Bilateral trade balances offer a snapshot of trade relationships, but are influenced by factors beyond trade barriers. Trade balances provide a snapshot of the U.S. trade relationship with a country, influenced by factors like economic development, raw materials, and technological change. Bilateral trade deficits with certain partners reflect complex supply chain relationships, where added value is small compared to other parts of the chain. The U.S. trade deficit causes adjustments in the economy, particularly the exchange rate. Net imports lead to an excess supply of U.S. dollars flowing abroad, which can lower the dollar's value relative to other currencies. This can make imports more expensive for Americans and exports cheaper for foreign buyers, gradually reducing the trade deficit. The U.S. trade deficit causes adjustments in the economy, particularly the exchange rate. Imports become more expensive for Americans and exports cheaper for foreign buyers, leading to a smaller trade deficit. The dollar's special status in global financial markets as a reserve currency affects its value, making U.S. exports more expensive when the dollar appreciates. Foreign governments intervene to keep their currency value stable. The dollar's appreciation makes U.S. exports more expensive, while foreign governments intervene to prevent their currency from appreciating relative to the dollar. Analysts believe past currency market interventions by countries like China have hindered global trade balance realignment. Trade deficits reflect a savings/investment shortfall, leading to the U.S. borrowing from abroad and accumulating debt. The United States is facing a savings/investment shortfall, resulting in borrowing from abroad and accumulating debt from sustained trade deficits. The key concern is whether borrowing to finance imports leads to greater investments in productive capital for future economic growth. Borrowing to finance consumer purchases can lead to a deficit that future generations may struggle to repay. Some economists warn that a rising U.S. trade deficit could cause a sudden fall in the value of the dollar, risking financial turmoil domestically and abroad. Many economists argue that reducing the U.S. trade deficit without addressing macroeconomic imbalances could harm the economy by reducing growth and not improving the trade balance in the long run. Ways to reduce the current account deficit include increasing domestic savings or decreasing foreign investment. Realigning exchange rates through dollar depreciation or preventing foreign market interventions are also options. In 2017, the United States had a merchandise trade deficit of $698 billion, with manufactured goods accounting for 56% of exports and 70% of imports. Trade policies are not seen as the most effective tool for balancing trade, with options including increasing domestic savings or reducing foreign investment. Realigning exchange rates through dollar depreciation is another strategy to address the trade deficit. Manufactures account for a significant portion of U.S. exports and imports, with a shift towards services exports over the past decade. Top exports and imports include transportation equipment, computer products, chemicals, and machinery. Global value chains have led to changes in U.S. manufacturing, with some industries requiring advanced technology and less labor. Labor-intensive activities like assembly have moved overseas for many products. The U.S. manufacturing sector has seen a shift towards advanced technology and less labor-intensive activities, leading to factory closings and layoffs. Reports of merchandise made in other countries have reinforced the perception of a shrinking sector. Data on output and employment paint a mixed picture of the sector's health. The U.S. manufacturing sector has experienced a decline in employment but an increase in output due to improved productivity. Despite its shrinking relative importance, manufacturing remains a significant component of the economy, with real output increasing by more than 80% from 1980 to 2017. Since 1980, U.S. manufacturing real output has increased over 80%, with a 20% increase since 2009. However, the share of manufacturing value-added in GDP has decreased from 21% in 1980 to 11% in 2017, while services increased from 55% to 70% of GDP. Manufacturing employment fell from 19.4 million in 1979 to 12.4 million in 2017, but has been rising yearly since 2010. In 2017, manufacturing employment accounted for 8.5% of total nonfarm employment, down from 20.7% in 1980, while services expanded by 20 percentage points. Employment in manufacturing has decreased in the United States since 1980, with a shift towards services. Business services within manufacturing have also seen growth. Factors such as technology, consumer preferences, and macroeconomic changes have contributed to these shifts. Trade's role in these changes is a topic of debate. The decline in U.S. manufacturing employment since 1980 has been influenced by factors like technology, consumer preferences, and macroeconomic changes. Debate surrounds the impact of trade on job loss, with some attributing it to increased imports from China while others argue that job gains in services from U.S. exports offset the decline. Automation and other factors are also considered significant in the restructuring of the manufacturing sector. Prior to China joining the WTO, the U.S. manufacturing sector underwent a significant restructuring over two decades. Despite a decline in the U.S. share of global manufacturing value-added, the country remains a top global manufacturer, with U.S. manufacturers contributing significantly to R&D and exports. In 2017, the U.S. exported $138 billion worth of goods. In 2017, the United States exported $138 billion in agricultural goods and imported $121 billion, creating a trade surplus of $17 billion. U.S. agricultural exports accounted for 6% of total U.S. exports of goods and services and 4% of total U.S. imports. Agriculture's share of U.S. exports has fallen slightly below the average of 8% over the past decade, while the import share remains on trend. Trade remains a significant component of the U.S. agricultural sector, with exports accounting for about 20% of total farm production. Foreign markets play a significant role in the U.S. agricultural sector, with exports representing about 20% of total farm production value. Imports of products like coffee, cocoa, spices, fish, and juices make up a large portion of U.S. food consumption. \"Services\" encompass various economic activities such as audiovisual, construction, computer services, energy, express delivery, e-commerce, and financial services. Services encompass a wide range of economic activities that facilitate the economy, including transportation, telecommunications, financial services, and more. These services play a crucial role in moving products along global value chains and providing credits for manufacturing goods. Services play a crucial role in global value chains by providing transportation, telecommunications, and financial services. Barriers to trade in services, such as discriminatory regulations, often hinder foreign service providers from fully expanding in importing countries. In 2017, the United States had a trade surplus of $255 billion in services, with $798 billion exported and $542 billion imported. Trade barriers for services often involve discriminatory regulations favoring domestic providers and restrictions on establishing a commercial presence in foreign countries. In 2017, the United States had a trade surplus of $255 billion in services, exporting $798 billion and importing $542 billion. Services trade accounts for 79% of U.S. GDP and 82% of U.S. private sector full-time employment, playing a crucial role in the economy. Unlike goods trade, the U.S. consistently exports more services than it imports, helping to offset deficits in goods trade. Trade data may underestimate services trade due to measurement methods. Trade in services has helped offset U.S. deficits in goods trade. Conventional data may underestimate services trade, as it doesn't account for the value-added services in manufacturing and agriculture. These services include R&D, design, engineering, and business services within the value chain. Digital trade, including online shopping, information transmission, online health and educational services, communication channels, and financial services, plays a crucial role in enhancing productivity and competitiveness in manufacturing and agriculture. This type of trade facilitates economic activity and captures value-added services beyond just the final product. Digital trade, including online shopping, information transmission, health or educational services, communication channels, and financial services, is crucial for enhancing productivity and competitiveness. Information and communication technologies (ICT) services are growing faster than trade in ICT goods. Digital trade constraints can be tariff or nontariff barriers, with nontariff barriers often taking the form of localization requirements that restrict the flow of commercial data for digitally delivered exports and services. Trade barriers, such as localization requirements, restrict cross-border data flows for digitally delivered exports and services, as well as for manufactured goods and agricultural products. Data transfer regulations that impose data localization barriers can limit the services a firm can offer and hinder communication with subsidiaries or headquarters abroad. The United States played a key role in establishing the global economic order after World War II, focusing on promoting open trading systems and reducing trade barriers through agreements and negotiations. This has historically supported economic growth and job creation. The United States has historically focused on promoting open trading systems and reducing trade barriers through agreements and negotiations to support economic growth and job creation. Current U.S. trade policy objectives include liberalizing markets, enforcing trade commitments, and advancing strategic goals such as supporting economic development in developing countries and strengthening regional alliances. The U.S. Trade Representative's annual trade policy agenda includes objectives such as supporting national security, negotiating new trade deals, enforcing trade laws, and reforming the multilateral trading system. Key trade functions of the U.S. government involve formulating policy, negotiating agreements, enforcing laws, and administering trade programs. The U.S. Trade Representative is responsible for trade and investment agreements, enforcing trade laws, and administering trade programs. Congress plays a significant role in U.S. trade policy, working with the executive branch to negotiate and implement trade agreements. Interagency coordination is crucial in implementing trade policy, with the USTR serving as the President's principal advisor on trade policy. The USTR is the President's main trade policy advisor and negotiator, with other agencies like Commerce and Agriculture playing specific roles. Agency responsibilities have changed over time through legislative and administrative actions. Congress holds primary authority over trade policy according to the U.S. Constitution. The U.S. Constitution designates Congress as the primary authority over trade policy, granting them the power to regulate commerce and make necessary laws. Congress exercises this power through various means such as tariff schedules, trade remedy laws, and trade agreements. U.S. trade policy is based on statutory authorities passed by Congress. The approval and implementation of reciprocal trade agreements in the U.S. are based on statutory authorities passed by Congress, which include laws authorizing trade programs, tariffs, nontariff barriers, trade remedies, and import/export policies. Congress also sets trade negotiating objectives through trade promotion authority (TPA) and conducts oversight hearings on trade programs and agreements to ensure compliance with U.S. law and congressional intent. The Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934 authorized the President to enter into reciprocal agreements to reduce tariffs within preapproved levels without additional legislation. Congress renewed this authority until the Trade Act of 1974 combined various trade laws. The Trade Act of 1974 expanded the President's authority to implement tariffs without additional legislation, focusing on opening markets and negotiating international trade norms. The House Ways and Means Committee and Senate Finance Committee play a key role in trade matters. Committees in Congress have primary responsibility for trade matters, with subcommittees dedicated to trade issues. Other committees may also be involved in trade agreements and policies within their jurisdiction. Congressional Advisory Groups on Negotiations provide advice to USTR during trade agreement negotiations. The Congressional Advisory Groups on Negotiations (CAGs) advise USTR during trade agreement negotiations. Separate CAGs exist for each house: a House Advisory Group on Negotiations (HAG) and a Senate Advisory Group on Negotiations (SAG). Members influence trade policy through voting on statutes and serving on relevant committees. They can also provide input through testimony and written letters to USTR. Members of Congress can influence trade policy through voting on statutes, serving on relevant committees, providing input through testimony and written letters to USTR, and exercising informal influence over other Members. Trade promotion authority (TPA) expedites the approval and implementation of most trade agreements, ensuring quick consideration of implementing legislation. Trade promotion authority (TPA) expedites the approval and implementation of trade agreements by ensuring expedited consideration of implementing legislation through a guaranteed, up-or-down vote with no amendments, as long as certain requirements are met. This includes negotiations reflecting the objectives specified in the TPA statute and conducting consultations with Congress and stakeholders. Trade promotion authority (TPA) expedites the approval and implementation of trade agreements by ensuring expedited consideration of implementing legislation through a guaranteed, up-or-down vote with no amendments. TPA defines how Congress exercises its authority over trade policy and gives the President negotiating credibility. Congress first enacted TPA in 1974 and has renewed it four times, with the most recent renewal in 2015 (P.L. 114-26). The most recent Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) legislation, signed into law in 2015 (P.L. 114-26), applies to concluded trade agreements notified to Congress before July 1, 2021. The executive branch is responsible for executing trade policy, including negotiating treaties, implementing trade agreements, customs enforcement, and administering export programs. The USTR is responsible for customs enforcement, duty collection, trade laws implementation, budget proposals, and trade policy development. The President oversees trade policy and adjusts tariff rates. The USTR negotiates trade agreements and enforces U.S. trade laws. The USTR is responsible for developing, coordinating, and implementing trade policy, negotiating trade agreements, and enforcing U.S. trade laws. It reports annually to Congress on the President's trade policy agenda and foreign trade barriers. Congress created the USTR in 1962 to provide better balance in U.S. trade policy and negotiations. The USTR is responsible for managing U.S. trade policy and negotiations, with various departments and agencies within the executive branch handling trade functions. Key agencies involved in trade policymaking and enforcement include Commerce, Agriculture, State, Treasury, Homeland Security, and Labor. The USTR primarily handles trade negotiations and policy decisions. The USTR is responsible for trade policy and negotiations, with involvement from various government departments. The Trade Policy Committee, chaired by the USTR, includes representatives from Treasury, Commerce, State, Agriculture, Labor, and other relevant departments. Additionally, sub-Cabinet groups like the Trade Policy Review Group and Trade Policy Staff were established to facilitate the interagency process. The USTR is responsible for trade policy and negotiations, involving various government departments. Sub-Cabinet groups like the Trade Policy Review Group and Trade Policy Staff Committee were established to facilitate the interagency process. The President influences trade legislation and policies based on national interest and political environment. The President influences trade legislation and policies based on national interest and political environment, making specific decisions on U.S. trade policies and programs. This includes requesting TPA, initiating trade remedy cases, and communicating with foreign heads of state. The private sector and stakeholders also play a role in U.S. trade policy formulation. The private sector and stakeholders play a role in U.S. trade policy formulation through a three-tiered committee system established by Congress in the Trade Act of 1974. The system includes 28 committees with about 700 citizen advisors, administered by USTR's Office of Intergovernmental Affairs & Public Engagement. The U.S. trade policy formulation involves a three-tiered committee system established by Congress in the Trade Act of 1974. This system includes various committees with citizen advisors who provide information and advice on negotiating objectives and trade agreements. Private sector, NGOs, labor groups, and other stakeholders influence U.S. trade policy by testifying before congressional committees and government bodies. They provide assessments of pending trade negotiations and offer comments on trade initiatives through Federal Register notices. The private sector, NGOs, and labor groups play a significant role in influencing U.S. trade policy through various channels such as testifying before congressional committees and providing comments on trade initiatives. Trade is crucial to the U.S. economy, encompassing a wide range of goods and services that can be exported and imported. Trade policy in the United States can impact a wide range of interests, including industries, firms, workers, and consumers. Congressional decisions on trade agreements and antidumping cases can affect employment, economic growth, product choices, and prices. Groups are also seeking greater market access in other countries. The increasing focus on trade agreements has made services once considered non-tradeable now tradeable due to technological advancements. Groups representing various stakeholders in the U.S. are concerned with trade policy decisions, including product choices, prices, market access, and nontariff issues like intellectual property rights and labor/environmental protections. Legal challenges can be brought by importers, exporters, manufacturers, and other parties to appeal governmental actions on trade. Legal challenges in trade can be brought in federal court by various parties such as importers, exporters, and manufacturers to appeal governmental actions and decisions. Cases may involve customs classification, antidumping proceedings, national security investigations, or challenges to state economic sanctions. The federal government can also initiate legal proceedings to enforce customs laws. Some trade statutes may limit judicial review. Legal challenges in trade can be brought in federal court by various parties such as importers, exporters, and manufacturers to appeal governmental actions and decisions. Cases may involve customs classification, antidumping proceedings, national security investigations, or challenges to state economic sanctions. Some trade statutes may limit judicial review, with most federal cases heard in the U.S. Court of International Trade. Court decisions can significantly impact U.S. trade policy by examining agency interpretations of statutory mandates. The U.S. Court of International Trade (USCIT) in New York City has exclusive jurisdiction over trade-related matters, including customs decisions, trade remedy determinations, and import embargoes. Court decisions can impact U.S. trade policy by examining agency interpretations of statutory mandates and determining if trade statutes violate the U.S. Constitution. The U.S. Court of International Trade (USCIT) in New York City has exclusive jurisdiction over trade-related matters, including customs decisions, trade remedy determinations, import embargoes, and the recovery of customs duties and penalties. The court consists of nine judges appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate, and decisions may be appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and possibly to the U.S. Supreme Court. The U.S. Court of International Trade (USCIT) in New York City has exclusive jurisdiction over trade-related matters, including customs decisions and trade remedy determinations. USCIT decisions can be appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and possibly to the U.S. Supreme Court. Statutory provisions related to the USCIT can be found in specific sections of the U.S. Code. The United States negotiates trade agreements for economic, commercial, foreign policy, and national security reasons, aiming to reduce tariffs, nontariff barriers, and increase market access for U.S. exporters. The United States participates in trade agreements to reduce tariffs and barriers, increase market access for exporters, gain competitive advantages, access lower-cost imports, encourage liberalization in developing countries, and strengthen alliances. The United States participates in trade agreements to reduce tariffs, increase market access, and strengthen alliances. Trade agreements can be multilateral, bilateral, regional, or plurilateral, with varying numbers of participants. The United States has 14 FTAs in force, covering 20 countries, with the majority of partners being small, developing countries. Only 35% of total U.S. trade is with major trading partners like Canada and Mexico. The United States has 14 FTAs in force, covering 20 countries, with the majority of partners being small, developing countries. While U.S. FTAs include major trading partners like Canada and Mexico, only 35% of total U.S. trade is with FTA partners. U.S. trade policy under the Trump Administration has shifted trade negotiation approaches, including withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership in January 2017. The United States under the Trump Administration has shifted its trade negotiation approach by withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and focusing on bilateral trade deals. President Trump has renegotiated two FTAs and proposed new negotiations, including the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) and amendments to the U.S.-South Korea FTA (KORUS). These changes aim to expedite consideration by Congress for implementing legislation. The United States has renegotiated two FTAs under the Trump Administration, including the U.S.-South Korea FTA (KORUS) amendments. The delayed reduction of the U.S. light truck tariff on imports from South Korea took effect in 2019. USTR has also notified Congress of intent to negotiate new trade agreements with Japan, the European Union, and the United Kingdom. The United States is planning to negotiate new trade agreements with Japan, the European Union, and the United Kingdom in early 2019. U.S. FTAs are known for their comprehensive coverage of tariffs, enforceable commitments, and rules that go beyond WTO standards. These agreements typically include the elimination of tariffs on goods, reduction of services trade barriers, foreign investment rules, intellectual property protection, government procurement market access, and provisions on labor standards and the environment. The United States aims to negotiate new trade agreements with Japan, the European Union, and the United Kingdom in early 2019. These agreements typically cover tariffs, enforceable commitments, rules beyond WTO standards, intellectual property protection, and labor and environmental standards. The U.S. seeks to establish new trading rules in recent negotiations, including digital trade and state-owned enterprises. Trade and Investment Framework Agreements (TIFAs) are used to consult on mutual economic interests for promoting trade and investment, with the USTR leading TIFA talks. The U.S. has over 50 TIFAs, mostly with developing countries. The USTR leads TIFA talks to promote trade and investment. There are over 50 TIFAs, mainly with developing countries. TIFAs do not require congressional approval and can lead to FTA or BIT negotiations. GATT was created in 1947 post-WWII for international economic stability. The GATT was established in 1947 post-WWII to create a stable international economic framework. It governed international trade for 47 years until the WTO was formed in 1995. The core principles of the GATT included lowering tariffs and applying them in a nondiscriminatory manner. The GATT, established in 1947 post-WWII, aimed to lower tariffs and apply them in a nondiscriminatory manner. The WTO, formed in 1995 with 164 members including the United States, administers trade rules to eliminate barriers and create nondiscriminatory trade governance. It also facilitates trade liberalization negotiations and dispute resolution. The United States played a significant role in establishing the WTO in 1995 to govern trade rules and facilitate trade negotiations. The WTO encompasses agreements such as GATT for goods and GATS for services. The WTO oversees agreements and negotiations among its members, including GATT for goods, GATS for services, TRIPS for intellectual property rights, and others. The Doha Development Agenda, which began in 2001, faced challenges due to differences among the US, EU, and developing countries on various issues. The WTO's negotiating effectiveness has been questioned since the collapse of the Doha Round in 2015. The latest WTO Ministerial Conference in 2017 did not yield major results, with ongoing talks in fisheries subsidies and e-commerce showing some progress while other areas remain stalled. The WTO's effectiveness in negotiating trade liberalization and resolving disputes has been questioned since the collapse of the Doha Round. Members are exploring reforms for the global trading system and dispute settlement system. The Trump Administration is withholding approval for appointments to the WTO Appellate Body due to concerns over judicial overreach. The WTO Appellate Body is facing concerns over \"judicial overreach\" and potential disruptions to the dispute settlement system if new appointments are not approved by late 2019. Dispute settlement proceedings can be initiated by a WTO member to challenge trade practices that violate WTO agreements, starting with consultations and potentially leading to a dispute panel decision that can be appealed to the WTO Appellate Body. Since 1995, 575 dispute settlement complaints have been filed in the WTO. The United States has been heavily involved in the WTO dispute settlement system, being the complainant or respondent in the most cases. If a member is found to violate a WTO obligation, they must remove the challenged measure within a compliance period, or face temporary retaliatory action or seek compensation. The United States is actively involved in the WTO dispute settlement system, being the complainant or respondent in many cases. Despite this, WTO decisions do not directly impact U.S. law, requiring legislative action for implementation of any findings. Compliance actions are determined by USTR if an administrative action is successfully challenged. The United States complies with WTO decisions by amending regulations or practices, issuing new determinations, or paying compensation to complainant countries. USTR decides on compliance actions if administrative actions are challenged, ensuring other WTO members also comply with dispute rulings. The United States complies with WTO decisions by amending regulations, issuing new determinations, or paying compensation to complainant countries. U.S. FTAs also have procedures to resolve disputes, aiming to resolve them through consultations first, with the option of adjudication by a panel. Non-compliance can result in suspension of trade benefits or other remedies. Countries can choose between FTA and WTO forums for common disputes. The United States resolves disputes under FTAs through consultations first, with the option of adjudication by a panel. Non-compliance can lead to suspension of trade benefits. State-state dispute settlement is not commonly used under U.S. FTAs, with most disputes adjudicated under WTO rules. NAFTA has had three cases decided, and one FTA labor dispute was brought with Guatemala under CAFTA-DR. FTAs also have a separate dispute system for investment-related provisions. The US resolves disputes under FTAs through consultations and panel adjudication, with the option of suspending trade benefits for non-compliance. NAFTA and USMCA have unique dispute settlement systems, including investor-state dispute settlement and binational panel reviews of trade remedy laws. Trade preference programs offer duty-free access to the US market for eligible developing countries. Since 1974, Congress has established six trade preference programs: GSP, APTA, CBERA, CBTPA, AGOA, and HOPE. GSP is the largest program, covering 120 countries and territories, providing duty-free treatment for thousands of products. In 2016, Nepal was granted country-specific trade preferences. The Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) is the largest trade preference program, covering 120 countries and territories. It offers duty-free treatment for around 3,500 products from designated beneficiary developing countries and 1,500 additional products from least-developed countries. In 2017, $21 billion worth of imports entered the United States under the GSP program. Countries must meet specific criteria set by Congress to be eligible, including protecting intellectual property and worker rights. The USTR is currently reviewing the eligibility of several GSP beneficiary countries like India, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, and Turkey. Trade capacity building (TCB) involves U.S. assistance in the form of funding, training, and technical expertise to support developing countries. In FY2016, the United States invested about $1.2 billion in 651 Trade Capacity Building (TCB) activities across 134 countries, including India, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, and Turkey. TCB involves U.S. assistance to help developing countries integrate and participate in international trade by providing funding, training, and technical expertise. The U.S. government sees TCB as crucial for assisting developing countries in negotiating trade agreements, implementing market reforms, and improving their capacity to benefit from increased trade. The United States invests in Trade Capacity Building (TCB) activities to help developing countries integrate into international trade. U.S. assistance includes implementing customs reforms, improving labor and environment protections, and meeting export standards. Various agencies are involved in TCB, with USAID receiving the most funding. Congress has the authority to set tariffs. The United States invests in Trade Capacity Building (TCB) activities to help developing countries integrate into international trade. Various agencies, including the Departments of Agriculture, Labor, and State, and the Trade and Development Agency, have TCB responsibilities. Congress has the power to set tariffs, which has been partially delegated to the President. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) collects tariffs at U.S. ports of entry, generating $32 billion in revenue in 2016. Tariffs were historically used for revenue collection, but now developed countries rely on other means. The United States has historically used tariffs to encourage global trade liberalization and reduce tariffs through trade negotiations. Congress authorized the President to negotiate reciprocal tariff reductions starting in 1934, and after World War II, the U.S. supported global tariff reduction efforts. The United States historically used tariffs to promote global trade liberalization and reduce tariffs through negotiations. By 2012, global tariffs had decreased to under 7% on average, with U.S. tariffs at 3.3% in 2016. The Trump Administration has criticized low-tariff policies and increased tariffs on certain goods from key trading partners. The Trump Administration has been critical of low-tariff policies and has increased tariffs on certain goods imported from key U.S. trading partners. U.S. trade laws include antidumping (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) laws to mitigate unfair trade practices, administered primarily through the Department of Commerce's International Trade Administration (ITA). The U.S. trade laws, including antidumping and countervailing duty laws, are administered by the Department of Commerce's International Trade Administration (ITA) and the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC). Other trade remedy laws focus on import surges, violations of trade agreements, patent and copyright infringements, and counterfeit goods. Trade remedy laws in the U.S. include antidumping and countervailing duty laws, as well as laws targeting import surges, trade agreement violations, and intellectual property infringements. These laws must comply with U.S. WTO obligations, but some argue that they can lead to disguised protectionism and inefficiencies in the global trading system by artificially raising prices on imported goods. Antidumping (AD) is a commonly used U.S. trade remedy law that addresses unfair trade practices where exporters sell goods at lower prices in one market compared to others. This can lead to market share gains, competition deterrence, or industrial overcapacity reduction. AD duties are imposed when the ITA determines foreign goods are sold at less than fair value. The U.S. trade remedy law of Antidumping (AD) addresses unfair trade practices by imposing duties when foreign goods are sold below fair value, causing material injury to U.S. industries. AD orders are subject to annual and sunset reviews, with 354 orders in place as of mid-December 2018, with a significant portion against China. Countervailing duty (CVD) is another commonly used trade remedy law to offset injurious practices. After AD laws, countervailing duty (CVD) is the most frequently used U.S. trade remedy law, aimed at offsetting competitive advantages from foreign subsidies. CVD orders are imposed on imports of subsidized goods into the United States. As of mid-December 2018, there were 113 CVD orders in place, with a significant portion targeted against China. The United States has 113 CVD orders in place, with nearly half against China. Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974 allows the President to restrict imports causing serious harm to domestic industry, providing temporary relief through additional tariffs or quotas. Unlike AD and CVD cases, no unfair trade practices allegation is needed for safeguard actions. The Trade Act of 1974 allows the President to impose safeguard measures, such as additional tariffs or quotas, to help domestic industries adjust to import competition. The International Trade Commission (ITC) conducts investigations based on petitions from industry representatives, and if imports are found to cause serious injury, recommendations are made to the President for temporary relief. In 2017, two safeguard investigations were initiated, leading to a four-year safeguard measure imposed by the President in January 2018. In 2017, two safeguard investigations were initiated under the Trump Administration. In January 2018, the President imposed a four-year safeguard measure on solar cells and a three-year safeguard on large residential washing machines. The ITC conducted 73 investigations from 1975 to 2001, with 19 cases resulting in safeguard measures imposed by the President. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 is known as the \"national security clause.\" Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, also known as the \"national security clause,\" allows the President to impose import restrictions if they threaten national security. The Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security consults with the Secretary of Defense and other agencies to investigate and determine the impact of imports on national security. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 allows the President to impose tariffs or quotas on imports that threaten national security. Commerce conducts investigations based on specified factors, with the President having discretion to take measures to offset adverse effects. Recent investigations on steel and aluminum imports led to tariffs being imposed in 2018. The President imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports in 2018, citing national security concerns. Currently, investigations are ongoing for uranium, autos, and auto parts imports. Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 is used to enforce U.S. rights under trade agreements and address unfair trade barriers, including intellectual property rights violations. Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 addresses foreign acts that violate trade agreements or restrict U.S. commerce. Cases can be initiated by petition or USTR, seeking a negotiated settlement or using formal dispute settlement proceedings. If no resolution is reached, retaliation may be considered. USTR, as part of the WTO, uses formal dispute settlement proceedings to address trade agreement violations. If no resolution is reached, USTR may retaliate with tariffs. The \"Special 301\" provision requires USTR to report annually to Congress on countries with inadequate IPR protection. Countries can be designated as a \"Priority Foreign Country\" for serious IPR violations, leading to Section 301 investigations. Since 1974, USTR has initiated 125 Section 301 cases, retaliating in 16 instances, with almost half occurring in the 1980s. In 2017, USTR launched an investigation into China's IPR technology policies. In March 2018, USTR found certain Chinese policies to be discriminatory, leading to increased tariffs on $250 billion worth of U.S. imports from China. The Trump Administration increased tariffs on $250 billion worth of U.S. imports from China and threatened more. China responded with tariffs on $110 billion of U.S. products. Both sides pursued dispute cases at the WTO. In November 2018, USTR reported that China had not changed its unfair practices. President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to start negotiations on \"structural changes\" at the 2018 G-20 Leaders' Summit. At the 2018 G-20 Leaders' Summit, President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to start negotiations on \"structural changes\" regarding IP, technology, agriculture, and services within 90 days. China agreed to make significant purchases of U.S. products, while the U.S. agreed to suspend planned tariff increases from 10% to 25% on January 1, 2019, contingent on reaching an agreement within 90 days. Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 prohibits unfair acts or methods of competition in importing goods to the United States, including infringement of U.S. patents, copyrights, trademarks, and semiconductor products. The import or sale of infringing products is illegal if U.S. industry is producing a covered article. The import or sale of infringing products is illegal under Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 if U.S. industry is producing a covered article. The ITC conducts investigations and may issue exclusion orders. Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) programs provide federal assistance to workers and firms affected by trade. Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) programs, authorized by the Trade Act of 1974, provide federal assistance to workers and firms affected by trade. TAA for Workers (TAAW) is the largest program, with appropriations of $790 million in FY2019, offering assistance to trade-affected workers separated from their jobs due to foreign competition. Administered by the Department of Labor, TAAW supports various benefits and services for career development. The Trade Adjustment Assistance program, administered by the Department of Labor, provides benefits and services to workers affected by foreign competition. This includes funding for career services, training, and income support through the Trade Readjustment Allowance. Additionally, smaller TAA programs are available for firms and farmers impacted by trade liberalization. Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) helps workers, firms, and farmers affected by trade liberalization by facilitating adjustment, compensating for losses, and generating support for international trade. Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) aims to compensate those impacted by trade liberalization, spread costs to society, and garner support for international trade. Critics argue it is costly, inefficient, and may not be equitable, while others believe the programs are not extensive enough to be effective. Despite differing opinions, Congress consistently reaches compromise on TAA. Several federal agencies, including the Export-Import Bank, the Department of Agriculture, and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, administer finance programs to help U.S. firms export and invest in developing countries. The BUILD Act of 2018 establishes a new program in this area. The BUILD Act of 2018 establishes a new successor agency for OPIC to promote U.S. commercial interests and foreign policy objectives, including leveling the playing field for U.S. firms against foreign competitors. The Department of Commerce's ITA also supports U.S. exports, especially for small and medium-sized companies. The Department of Commerce's International Trade Administration (ITA) and the Ex-Im Bank support U.S. exports, especially for small and medium-sized companies, by providing export counseling, direct loans, loan guarantees, and export credit insurance. The Ex-Im Bank operates under a renewable general statutory charter to help finance U.S. exports to developing economies. The Export-Import Bank, operating under a statutory charter extended through September 30, 2019, has faced operational constraints due to unfilled board positions. Presidential appointments to the board require Senate approval, impacting the bank's ability to approve medium- and long-term export financing above $10 million. This issue has been part of the broader debate over the role of government in financing exports. The United States restricts exports for national security, foreign policy, and economic reasons through various acts like the AECA, ECA, IEEPA, and others. Export controls aim to balance national security goals with export competitiveness. The United States restricts exports of defense items, dual-use goods, certain nuclear materials, and items related to weapons proliferation. Export controls are used to restrict trade with sanctioned countries. The ECA provides legislative authority for implementing dual-use export controls. The ECA (P.L. 115-232, Subtitle B, Part I) enacted on August 13, 2018, allows the President to implement dual-use export controls. It replaced the Export Administration Act of 1979 and authorizes the Department of Commerce to regulate the export of \"emerging and foundational technologies\" crucial for national security. Dual-use goods have both civilian and military applications. Dual-use goods are commodities, software, or technologies with civilian and military applications. Examples include nuclear materials, microorganisms, electronics, computers, lasers, and sensors. Exports are licensed by the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security based on technical characteristics, destination, end use, and end user activities. Foreign direct investment (FDI) and foreign portfolio investment (FPI) are the main capital flows. FDI involves acquiring real assets. Foreign direct investment (FDI) and foreign portfolio investment (FPI) are the two main types of capital flows. FDI involves acquiring real assets like real estate or a manufacturing plant, while FPI involves purchasing foreign equities or bonds. FDI often leads to long-term commitments and stimulates direct employment, while FPI is highly liquid and can be withdrawn easily. Global trade in goods and services grew significantly from $4 trillion to $23 trillion between 1990 and 2017. Gross capital flows also expanded from $1 trillion to $4 trillion annually, with a peak of over $12 trillion in 2007. Official capital flows are generated by governments for various purposes, such as humanitarian assistance and foreign aid. The expansion of global trade in goods and services from $4 trillion to $23 trillion between 1990 and 2017 was accompanied by a significant increase in capital flows, reaching around $4 trillion annually. The peak of over $12 trillion in 2007 showed substantial growth since the 1990s. Additionally, there was a surge in foreign exchange and over-the-counter derivatives markets, impacting the international exchange value of the dollar and influencing prices of goods, services, and securities. The total daily trading of foreign currencies exceeded $5.1 trillion in 2016, impacting the international exchange value of the dollar and prices of goods and services. Multinational corporations invest abroad to increase profits, leveraging their competitive advantages such as special knowledge or managerial abilities. Multinational corporations (MNCs) invest abroad to leverage competitive advantages like special knowledge or managerial abilities, gain access to low-cost resources, improve efficiency, and expand market share. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) supports the development of global value chains by sourcing production globally. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) by multinational corporations (MNCs) supports global value chains and allows firms to operate close to foreign customers. Access to resources like a well-educated workforce can enhance R&D activities. FDI transactions, including mergers and acquisitions, can boost global competitiveness. The total stock of global outward FDI in 2017 was $31 trillion according to UNCTAD. The total stock of global outward FDI in 2017 was $31 trillion, with the United States being the largest source of FDI worldwide. Developing Asia accounted for the largest share of global FDI inflows, followed by Europe, North America, Latin America, and Africa. In 2017, developing Asia led global FDI inflows with 33%, followed by Europe (26%), North America (21%), Latin America and the Caribbean (11%), and Africa (3%). The United States is the largest source and recipient of FDI, with significant growth in FDI stock from 1985 to 2017. Top destinations for U.S. FDI outflows include the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Luxembourg, Ireland, Canada, Singapore, Australia, Germany, and Japan. The top destinations for U.S. FDI outflows through 2017 were the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Luxembourg, Ireland, Canada, Singapore, Australia, Germany, and Japan. U.S. direct investment abroad is mainly in Europe, while FDI in the United States primarily comes from Europe. U.S. outward FDI focuses on high-technology, finance, and services, while inward FDI is concentrated in the manufacturing sector, particularly chemicals and transport industries. Economists advocate for unrestricted international capital flows. The largest share of U.S. inward FDI is in the manufacturing sector, primarily chemicals and transport industries. Economists support unrestricted international capital flows like FDI, as it benefits both home and host countries by improving competitive positions, skills, and incomes. Direct investment, whether inward or outward, brings various benefits such as a strengthened competitive position, higher employee skills, increased firm incomes, technological advances, capital formation, and a more competitive business environment. It also contributes to international trade, global economic integration, and productivity growth. FDI contributes to international trade and global economic integration. In 2016, foreign firm affiliates in the United States employed 7.1 million workers, exported $369.8 billion in goods, and imported $649.9 billion in goods, contributing $894.0 billion value-added to U.S. GDP. Stakeholders raise concerns about U.S. firms investing abroad and sending manufacturing and jobs overseas. U.S. firms invest abroad to send manufacturing and jobs overseas, potentially reducing employment and wages in the United States. Most U.S. outward FDI is concentrated in high-income developed countries with similar markets and consumer tastes. Data on U.S. firms shifting plants or jobs abroad are mostly anecdotal. Most U.S. outward FDI is concentrated in high-income developed countries with similar markets and consumer tastes. Economists argue that U.S. direct investment abroad does not necessarily lead to fewer jobs or lower incomes for Americans, attributing the loss of manufacturing jobs to domestic economic forces and sector restructuring. International investment agreements (IIAs) establish binding rules on investment protections, with over 2,600 IIAs in force globally aiming to reduce FDI restrictions and ensure nondiscriminatory treatment of investors and investments. IIAs have become the primary vehicle for promoting investment rules, as there are no comprehensive multilateral rules on investment. IIAs aim to reduce FDI restrictions and ensure fair treatment of investors. They include provisions for government regulation, national security, and reciprocal commitments for foreign investors. U.S. IIAs are mainly bilateral investment treaties (BITs) ratified by the Senate. The United States' primary forms of International Investment Agreements (IIAs) are bilateral investment treaties (BITs) ratified by the Senate with two-thirds approval and investment chapters in free trade agreements (FTAs). USTR and the State Department negotiate these agreements. The US has BITs in force with 40 countries, mostly developing nations. The latest ratified BIT with Rwanda took effect in 2012. BIT negotiations with China and India have stalled. Additionally, the US has 14 FTAs covering 20 countries, most including investment chapters. Investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) is also a key component. The United States has 14 FTAs in force with 20 countries, most including investment chapters. Investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) allows private investors to bring claims against host country governments for alleged violations of investment agreements before an international arbitration panel. Successful claims can result in monetary penalties, but countries cannot be forced to change their laws. The use of ISDS has significantly increased with the growth of global FDI. U.S. investors make up about one-fifth of investment claims worldwide, with the U.S. government yet to lose a case out of 16 brought against them. ISDS provisions are common in U.S. BITs and FTAs, with most cases brought under NAFTA. The use of ISDS has increased with global FDI growth, with U.S. investors making up one-fifth of claims worldwide. Most ISDS cases against the U.S. are under NAFTA. The Trump Administration made significant changes to ISDS in the NAFTA renegotiation, with the proposed USMCA eliminating ISDS between the U.S. and Canada and placing limits with Mexico. The USMCA, signed in November 2018, would eliminate ISDS between the United States and Canada and impose limits with Mexico. ISDS was a major point of contention in T-TIP talks during the Obama Administration. The EU is advocating for an investment court system in its trade agreements. CFIUS oversees foreign investment transactions that could impact U.S. national security. CFIUS, an interagency committee, assists the President in overseeing foreign investment transactions that could affect U.S. national security. Established in 1975, CFIUS was given the authority to review foreign investments in 1988 and was formally established in statute in 2007. In 2007, the Foreign Investment and National Security Act established CFIUS to review FDI transactions affecting \"homeland security\" and \"critical industries.\" The Secretary of the Treasury chairs CFIUS, conducting a \"risk-based analysis\" of threats posed by foreign investments. The President can block transactions, which has been done five times since 1988, leading to cancellations or divestments by foreign investors. The CFIUS has been invoked five times since 1988, leading to cancellations or divestments by foreign investors. President Trump blocked acquisitions of Lattice Semiconductor Corp. and Qualcomm by Chinese and Singapore-based firms. The FIRRMA of 2018 expands the scope of transactions subject to review by CFIUS. The Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act (FIRRMA) of 2018 expands the scope of transactions subject to review by CFIUS, including non-controlling investments in U.S. businesses involved in critical technology or infrastructure. Some have raised concerns about the expanded role of CFIUS conflicting with the U.S.'s historically open investment climate. The Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) provides services to facilitate U.S. private investments abroad in developing countries and emerging markets.
