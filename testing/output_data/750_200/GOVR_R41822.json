    "content": "The 112th Congress is considering proposals to limit government risk from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, government-sponsored enterprises responsible for nearly half of the nation's residential mortgage debt. They purchase mortgages, pool and guarantee them into mortgage-backed securities, and sell them to investors or hold them as investments. In 2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac faced capital inadequacy due to increased mortgage defaults and foreclosures. To support them during the financial crisis, the U.S. Department of the Treasury purchased over $175 billion of special preferred stock. Additionally, Treasury and the Federal Reserve bought nearly $1.4 trillion in mortgage-backed securities to stabilize the mortgage markets. The Treasury purchased over $175 billion in special preferred stock to support Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac during the financial crisis. The enterprises are required to pay a 10% cash dividend on the Treasury funds. Some proposed bills may reduce the enterprises' future size by eliminating certain advantages from their charters. Proposed legislation may reduce enterprises' future size by increasing costs and imposing limitations on mortgage purchases, potentially allowing competitors to be more competitive. The proposed legislation includes new limitations on mortgage purchases by enterprises, increased regulatory oversight, disclosure requirements, and higher capital requirements to reduce risks. Additionally, new filing requirements with the SEC would eliminate competitive advantages and align them with competitors. The proposed legislative proposals aim to limit mortgage purchases by enterprises, increase regulatory oversight, and impose higher capital requirements to reduce risks. Some bills suggest a deadline for enterprises to return to stockholder control or be dissolved, while others propose replacing the enterprises in the secondary mortgage markets. The enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac faced financial difficulties due to mortgage delinquencies and inadequate capital, leading to voluntary conservatorship in 2008. The Treasury provided financial support to keep them solvent. The Treasury signed contracts with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to provide financial support to keep them solvent. The enterprises purchase mortgages from lenders, package them into MBS, and either keep or sell them to investors. They also provide guarantees on the repayment of loans. The Obama Administration's report on the future of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac presents three alternatives for the housing finance system: a privatized system with government mortgage programs targeted based on income or first-time homebuyer status, a privatized system with a government guarantee only during a crisis, and a privatized system with backup government reinsurance of private mortgages. The Obama Administration's report on the future of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac presents three alternatives for the housing finance system: groups based on income or first-time homebuyer status; a privatized system with a government guarantee only during a crisis; and a privatized system with backup government reinsurance of private mortgage insurance. No legislation has been introduced to implement these proposals as of now. The report discusses legislation introduced in the 112th Congress to reform Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, including the H.R. 31 bill which focuses on accountability and transparency for taxpayers. The Mac Accountability and Transparency for Taxpayers Act of 2011 requires the FHFA director to provide quarterly reports on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in various areas such as liabilities, executive compensation, foreclosure mitigation, and capital levels. The FHFA director is required to provide quarterly reports on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, covering areas such as investments, equity investments by Treasury, capital levels, underwriting standards, mortgage buyback policies, and actions affecting enterprise securities. The reports will be reviewed by the FHFA inspector general and shared with Congress. The FHFA inspector general would review reports on FHFA's loss mitigation policies and inform Congress of findings. Reports and comments would be posted on the FHFA website, covering areas like principal reduction impact and foreclosure rates. Overlapping with current reports, the IG's examination would focus on enterprise financial condition and nationwide foreclosure prevention efforts. The FHFA's Financial Performance includes capital, investments, and loss mitigation activities. The House Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government-Sponsored Enterprises forwarded H.R. 31 to the full committee for review. H.R. 463 emphasizes Congress's oversight in areas related to FHFA and the FHFA IG. H.R. 463, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Transparency Act of 2011, would subject the enterprises to FOIA requests by treating them as federal agencies. H.R. 1221, Equity in Government Compensation Act of 2011, aims to limit the pay of the enterprises' employees, suspending current executive compensation packages exceeding $199,700. No action has been taken on these bills. The bill aims to suspend executive compensation packages exceeding $199,700 and limit pay for other employees to a maximum of $155,500 in the Washington, DC area. Executive compensation would be tied to the enterprise's profitability and would be subject to TARP provisions on executive compensation and corporate governance. Enterprise employees would not be considered federal employees. The bill aims to limit executive compensation packages and employee pay, tying it to profitability and subjecting it to TARP provisions. The bill also states that enterprise employees will not be considered federal employees. FHFA currently has the authority to reject enterprise salaries but the bill would remove this discretion. The bill aims to limit executive compensation and employee pay at enterprises, tying it to profitability and subjecting it to TARP provisions. FHFA would no longer have the authority to reject salaries, but the bill prohibits setting specific salary ranges. H.R. 1222, GSE Subsidy Elimination Act of 2011, would require enterprises to charge guarantee fees reflecting mortgage risk and capital costs of a private company. The House Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government-Sponsored Enterprises marked up the bill and forwarded it to the full committee. The House Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government-Sponsored Enterprises marked up H.R. 1222 and H.R. 1223 in 2011. FHFA has the authority to implement the provisions of H.R. 1222 as conservator or receiver. H.R. 1223 aims to ensure equitable treatment of mortgage-backed securities. Regulatory determinations regarding mortgages would be affected by the bill. The bill aims to regulate securities issued by enterprises differently from similar MBS. Regulatory determinations for low-risk mortgages should not solely consider the enterprises' role in securitization, as per Dodd-Frank. Dodd-Frank mandates joint regulations by federal banking regulators, SEC, HUD, and FHFA for risk retention requirements in MBS, with QRMs being exempt from this risk. The House Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government-Sponsored Enterprises forwarded H.R. 1223 to the full committee for implementation of risk retention requirements for mortgages in MBS under Dodd-Frank. The Federal Reserve's general counsel stated that the enterprises are not exempt from the risk retention requirement, despite their 100% guarantee on MBS payments. The House Subcommittee forwarded H.R. 1223 to implement risk retention requirements for mortgages in MBS under Dodd-Frank. The Federal Reserve's counsel mentioned that the enterprises' 100% guarantee on MBS payments may not satisfy the risk retention rules. H.R. 1224, GSE Portfolio Risk Reduction Act of 2011, aims to reduce the enterprises' portfolios to $250 billion each over five years. Fannie Mae's portfolio was $789 billion and Freddie Mac's was $697 billion at the end of 2010. The financial support agreements between Treasury and the GSEs require the reduction of their portfolios to $250 billion each over five years. H.R. 1224 aims to reduce the enterprises' portfolios, with companion bills proposing different timelines for the reduction. H.R. 408 and S. 178 aim to reduce portfolios over four years, compared to the current agreement H.R. 1224. Delinquent mortgages repurchased to fulfill guarantees would not count towards portfolio limits. FHFA could order faster portfolio reductions. H.R. 1225 requires GSE Debt Issuance Approval. H.R. 1225, the GSE Debt Issuance Approval Act of 2011, would require enterprises to seek permission from the Treasury Secretary to issue new debt. The Secretary's decision would be communicated in writing to the enterprise, FHFA, and Congress, with a seven-day waiting period before debt issuance. The House Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government-Sponsored Enterprises marked up H.R. 1225 for review by the full committee. The House Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government-Sponsored Enterprises marked up H.R. 1225, requiring enterprises to seek permission from the Treasury Secretary to issue new debt. The Secretary's decision would be communicated in writing with a seven-day waiting period before debt issuance. The Secretary could assert the existing review authority contained in the enterprises' charters. The GSE Mission Improvement Act, H.R. 1226, would repeal affordable housing goals and duty to serve underserved markets for enterprises. It formalizes the process for enterprises to seek approval from the Treasury Secretary before issuing new debt. The GSE Mission Improvement Act, H.R. 1226, would repeal affordable housing goals and duty to serve underserved markets for enterprises. It would also eliminate funding for the housing trust fund and the capital magnet fund. FHFA would be required to submit a report to Congress within six months on the bill's impact on multifamily properties, loans to low-income borrowers, and loans to borrowers in rural areas, with recommendations on increasing mortgage credit in these areas. The Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government-Sponsored Enterprises forwarded H.R. 1226 to the full committee, which would repeal housing goals for enterprises. H.R. 1227 would limit FHFA's approval of new products during conservatorship or receivership. The FHFA would retain its new product approval authority if the enterprises are not in conservatorship or receivership. H.R. 1227 limits FHFA's approval of new products during conservatorship. H.R. 2425 prohibits GSEs from purchasing mortgages registered with MERS. H.R. 2428, GSE Legal Fee Reduction Act of 2011, would prohibit Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae from dealing with mortgages registered with MERS, a system bypassing state registration laws. Legal challenges question MERS' authority in foreclosures and ownership history. Employment contracts may cover legal expenses. H.R. 2428, GSE Legal Fee Reduction Act of 2011, requires enterprises to propose a methodology for determining reasonable legal expenses for employees. H.R. 2436, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Taxpayer Payback Act of 2011, aims to prevent a reduction in dividend rates paid to Treasury. H.R. 2439, Removing GSEs Charters During Receivership Act of 2011, empowers FHFA to revoke charters during receivership. H.R. 2439, Removing GSEs Charters During Receivership Act of 2011, would allow FHFA to revoke an enterprise's charter and requires it to be revoked at the end of a limited-life entity created in receivership. H.R. 2441, Housing Trust Fund Elimination Act of 2011, aims to terminate funds established by the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008, funded by the enterprises. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 established the Reserve Fund and Capital Magnet Fund, funded by enterprises. $80 million was appropriated in the FY2010 budget for the Capital Magnet Fund. H.R. 2440, Market Transparency and Taxpayer Protection Act of 2011, would direct FHFA to identify non-mission critical assets held by the enterprises, such as patents and mortgage data, and submit a plan to sell them. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would be required to release loan and appraisal data without disclosing personally identifiable information. H.R. 2462, Cap the GSE Bailout Act of 2011, would set a maximum amount of support for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the Preferred Stock Purchase Agreements. Treasury would purchase preferred stock to keep the enterprises solvent, with an amendment allowing additional financial support if needed. The Treasury purchased preferred stock to support Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, initially limited to $100 billion each but later increased to $200 billion. In 2009, the PSPA was amended to provide unlimited support for 2010-2012, with the $200 billion limit outside of those years. Companion bills in the 112th Congress address the GSEs' financial problems. Two pairs of companion bills introduced in the 112th Congress, H.R. 408 and S. 178, along with H.R. 1182 and S. 693, have provisions related to reforming Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. H.R. 1859 and H.R. 2413 propose replacing the enterprises. H.R. 408 and S. 178, titled the Spending Reduction Act of 2011, address various issues beyond GSE reform. Title VI, the GSE Bailout Elimination and Taxpayer Protection Act, would terminate Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's conservatorships in 24 months. After leaving conservatorship, the enterprises would have to reduce their portfolios to $250 billion each. The revised charters would require Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to reduce their portfolios to $250 billion each over four years after leaving conservatorship. Housing goals would no longer be applicable, and the enterprises would exit conservatorship within 24-30 months, either returning to stockholder control or being dissolved under receivership. The enterprises would leave conservatorship 24-30 months after enactment, returning to stockholder control or being dissolved under receivership. Three years after returning to stockholder control, their charters would be repealed for new business, followed by a 10-year wind-down period. FHFA would have strengthened authority to set and enforce minimum capital levels. The conforming loan limit would be set at $417,000 nationwide with no high-cost exceptions. The enterprises would be prohibited from purchasing mortgages greater than the area median home price, with a minimum downpayment of 5% during the 12 months after leaving conservatorship. The conforming loan limit would be set at $417,000 nationwide with no high-cost exceptions, and could only increase in future years to reflect increasing house prices. The enterprises would be required to pay all state and local taxes, register all stocks and public offerings with the SEC, and adhere to specific downpayment requirements based on the duration after leaving conservatorship. The enterprises would be required to register all stocks and public offerings with the SEC, pay state and local taxes, and be charged for the benefits provided by the government. Additionally, companion bills H.R. 1182 and S. 693 include provisions such as a guarantee fee increase and a requirement for the enterprises to reduce their portfolios to $250 billion each over five years. H.R. 1182 and S. 693 would add a guarantee fee increase, require the enterprises to reduce their portfolios to $250 billion each over five years, and repeal affordable housing goals. Provisions in these bills not found in other bills would end the enterprises' conservatorship in 24 months and start phasing out their charters for new business after three years.

Associations would guarantee timely payment to investors with a backup guarantee from the federal government. The Housing Finance Reform Act of 2011 would establish housing finance guaranty associations to pool and securitize mortgages. These associations would guarantee timely payments to investors with a backup guarantee from the federal government.

The nationwide mortgage limit would be $256,000, with higher limits in specific areas like Honolulu at $897,300. The Housing Finance Reform Act of 2011 would establish housing finance guaranty associations to pool and securitize mortgages. The nationwide mortgage limit would be $256,000, with higher limits in specific areas like Honolulu at $897,300 and San Jose at $886,500.

The Secondary Market Facility for Residential Mortgages Act of 2011 would establish a facility to purchase and securitize mortgages meeting underwriting standards. The facility would charge guarantee and reinsurance fees, adjusted to maintain market share under 50%. The guarantee fee would cover mortgage payments during normal times, while the reinsurance fee would compensate Treasury for the federal guarantee. Eligible mortgages would be based on quality, not location or volume provided by the seller. The proposed Secondary Market Facility for Residential Mortgages Act of 2011 would establish a facility to purchase and securitize mortgages meeting underwriting standards. Mortgages eligible for purchase would be for 30 years or less, be for no more than 80% of the sales price of the house (or 90% with seller participation or private mortgage insurance), with a maximum size based on a formula used in FY2011. The reorganized FHFA would oversee the facility."
