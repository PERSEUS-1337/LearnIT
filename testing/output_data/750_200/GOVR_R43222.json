Harbor maintenance plays a critical role in facilitating U.S. foreign trade and reducing trade costs between different regions. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is responsible for maintaining federal waterways and harbor channels. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is responsible for maintaining federal waterways and harbor channels, which are crucial for facilitating U.S. foreign trade. Congress relies on the Water Resources Development Act to revisit harbor maintenance policy, as decisions on harbor maintenance now have a greater impact on the U.S. economy due to the increase in merchandise trade accounting for 25% of GDP. The cost of harbor maintenance is supported by a harbor maintenance tax (HMT) on imported and domestic waterborne cargo and cruise passengers, generating revenue for the harbor maintenance trust fund (HMTF) used by the Corps for dredging channels and maintaining jetties and breakwaters. The harbor maintenance tax (HMT) on imported waterborne cargo funds the harbor maintenance trust fund (HMTF) for dredging channels, maintaining jetties, and operating locks. HMT revenue is scored as federal receipts, and a surplus reduces the federal budget deficit. About half of the HMT collected annually is spent on harbor maintenance. The Harbor Maintenance Tax (HMT) surplus reduces the federal budget deficit. Over half of the HMT collected annually is used for harbor maintenance. The trust fund balance was $8.5 billion in July 2013. The Corps expects $2.05 billion income in FY2014 from HMT and interest. The Administration's budget requests $923 million for harbor maintenance. Bills in the 113th Congress aim to increase annual funding. The budget requests $923 million for harbor maintenance. Bills in the 113th Congress aim to double annual spending on harbor maintenance, with H.R. 3080 proposing to increase HMTF expenditures every year. This could potentially reduce funding for other activities. Congress established the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) in 1986 to allocate 80% of the HMT collected for harbor maintenance. Increasing HMTF spending may reduce funding for other Corps activities, requiring reallocation within the federal budget. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) was established by Congress in 1986 to allocate funds for harbor maintenance. The funds are designated for commercial navigation operations and maintenance costs of harbors and inland harbors in the United States. Harbors are defined as capable of transporting commercial cargo by vessels, while inland harbors are primarily used for accommodating commercial vessels and handling waterborne cargoes. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) was established in 1986 to allocate funds for harbor maintenance. Inland harbors are defined as primarily used for commercial vessels and waterborne cargoes, while coastal or Great Lakes harbors only need to be capable of handling cargo. Commercial cargo includes passengers but excludes fresh-caught fish, and ferries are not considered commercial vessels. These definitions have remained unchanged since 1986, and there was no rulemaking to implement the harbor maintenance provisions in WRDA 1986. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) was established in 1986 to allocate funds for harbor maintenance. The Corps interprets \"commercial navigation\" as any project authorized by Congress with commercial navigation as an authorized purpose. Most harbor projects are authorized as \"single-purpose\" commercial navigation projects, with all O&M costs payable from the HMTF. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) covers O&M costs for \"single-purpose\" commercial navigation projects. \"Multi-purpose\" projects only allow recovery of costs related to commercial navigation. High-use ports handle 90% of maritime commerce and receive two-thirds of HMTF spending. High-use ports, handling over 10 million tons of freight per year, account for 90% of maritime commerce and received two-thirds of HMTF spending in FY2013. Moderate-use ports, handling between 1 million and 10 million tons of cargo, received 19% of HMTF spending, while low-use ports collectively handled 1% of maritime commerce but received 5% of HMTF spending in FY2013. In FY2013, high-use ports accounted for 90% of maritime commerce and received two-thirds of HMTF spending. Moderate-use ports received 19% of spending, while low-use ports handled 1% of commerce but received 5% of funding. This disparity in funding allocation is a key point of debate in the HMTF discussion. H.R. 3080 and S. 601 address disparities in funding allocation for harbor maintenance, with a focus on balancing funding for commercial and non-commercial ports. The Corps is directed not to allocate funds solely based on tonnage, while data shows 1,228 waterways eligible for HMTF reimbursement. The Corps data shows that out of 1,228 waterways eligible for HMTF reimbursement, 61% carried no cargo from FY2005 to FY2009, and 75% handled little or no cargo. The Administration's budget requests have focused HMTF spending on high-use harbors. The Administration's budget requests for the Corps have directed HMTF spending to high-use harbors based on volume of cargo, favoring ports handling tankers and bulk ships. Using a value-based metric could allocate more funds to ports with container ships, concentrating harbor maintenance funding. The Administration's budget directs HMTF funds to high-use harbors handling tankers and bulk ships. Allocating funds based on cargo value could concentrate funding on container ports, with the top five handling 56% of U.S. maritime container shipments in 2012. In FY2011, high-use ports received half of requested O&M funds, moderate-use ports received 30%, and low-use harbors received 10%. Small harbors received only one-tenth of the funds requested by local Corps officials, while the busiest harbors received only half of the funds requested. Low-use harbors requested $766 million, close to the $922 million requested by the busiest harbors. The 59 busiest commercial shipping channels operated at authorized widths and depths only 30% of the time. The Corps faces a funding shortfall, with the 59 busiest shipping channels operating below authorized levels. A 2012 study highlighted the financial pressures leading to partial investments across facilities. Ship traffic is more concentrated in terms of capacity than tonnage, with 90% occurring at the top 35 harbors. Harbor traffic is more concentrated in terms of ship capacity than tonnage, with 90% occurring at the top 35 ports. The top 10 ports account for 60% of commercial ship calls. The Corps may consider concentrating O&M funds on high-use harbors to maximize national economic benefit, potentially hindering the development of moderate-use ports. The Corps maintains over 900 coastal channels and harbors, with maintenance required every few years. Funding from FY1999 to FY2008 shows 400 to 500 harbors and channels receive maintenance annually. The Corps is authorized to maintain over 1,400 coastal navigation projects. The Corps maintains 400 to 500 harbors and channels annually, but only actively maintains 360 out of over 1,400 authorized coastal navigation projects. It is unclear if the decrease in maintained projects is due to policy, funding, or maintenance needs. A 2003 study prompted by congressional inquiry highlighted funding challenges in harbor maintenance. The Corps' 2003 study on harbor maintenance funding highlighted the lack of systematic reevaluation and passive stewardship of resources. Current policies and tools are inadequate for identifying inefficient projects and managing maintenance. Policy guidance for harbors needs improvement. The 2003 Corps study found that current policies and management tools are insufficient for identifying inefficient harbor projects and managing maintenance. Policy guidance for harbors should include explicit requirements for confirming economic viability and reevaluating projects when necessary. Many harbor projects were authorized decades ago before alternative transportation methods were available. In the early 1900s, \"regular line boats\" provided scheduled service at 50 Great Lakes ports, with a significant amount of cargo and passengers traveling in small vessels. Today, many small harbors once used for maritime commerce are now mainly for pleasure boats, funded by a cargo tax. The Corps retains responsibility for maintaining these channels and harbors, with Congress allowing divestment of some inland waterways projects over the years. The Corps retains responsibility for maintaining channels and harbors using funds from a cargo tax. Congress has allowed divestment of some inland waterways projects. The Corps prioritizes harbor maintenance projects based on commercial importance, using a \"Channel Portfolio Tool\" for allocation of funds. The Corps prioritizes harbor maintenance projects based on commercial importance, using data on commercial tonnage and value to assess dredging needs. Recent budget guidance indicates the use of metrics to group projects, with criteria including tonnage and cost per ton for commercial navigation. Other criteria include support for commercial fishing, public transportation, and public safety. The Corps prioritizes harbor maintenance projects based on commercial importance, using metrics like tonnage and cost per ton. Other criteria include support for commercial fishing, public transportation, public safety, infrastructure condition, and legal requirements. The 2008 GAO report recommended Congress create an advisory for project prioritization. The 2008 GAO report recommended creating an advisory committee for project prioritization, but no such committee has been established. A 2010 GAO report raised concerns about the transparency and effectiveness of the Corps' criteria for prioritizing harbor maintenance projects. The Corps' budget process focuses more on anticipated rather than demonstrated project performance. The GAO audit found that the Corps' budget process emphasizes anticipated project performance over demonstrated performance. However, the O&M budget does reflect actual performance for completed projects. Actual performance over time is assessed against authorized project purposes to determine budget priority, such as commercial use in the navigation program. Opportunity cost is a significant metric for distributing O&M funds efficiently to harbors. Opportunity cost is a significant metric for distributing O&M funds efficiently to harbors. It concerns whether providing maintenance to one harbor results in a loss of potentially greater economic benefits from failing to fully maintain another harbor. Former Secretary of the Army emphasized the importance of defining problems within a national framework for optimal solutions. The costs of operations and maintenance activities funded from the HMTF vary among ports, with higher costs at smaller ports compared to major cargo ports. O&M expenses at a harbor can fluctuate yearly, so an average over several years is a better indicator. However, datasets on O&M expenses and waterway usage do not align. The Corps maintains federally designated channels, with O&M expenses varying yearly. Data on O&M expenses and waterway usage have not been jointly analyzed. The HMTF covers 100% of federal costs for harbors up to 45 feet deep, with non-federal sponsors responsible for 50% of costs for deeper harbors. S. 601 proposes changes to the non-federal cost share requirement for O&M. The HMTF covers federal costs for harbors up to 45 feet deep, with non-federal sponsors responsible for 50% of costs for deeper harbors. S. 601 proposes changes to the non-federal cost share requirement for O&M, with new construction funded through general government revenues. S. 601 proposes changes to the non-federal cost share requirement for O&M at harbors, allowing ports to use HMTF money for dredging and widening berths and private side channels. Some ports argue that current laws prevent them from accessing HMTF funds despite generating significant revenue from shippers. S. 601 and H.R. 3080 propose changes to allow ports with high HMT revenue to use funds for dredging and removing contaminants, potentially impacting allocation of funds to other ports. H.R. 3080 expands the use of the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) for dredging and contaminated sediments at ports with high revenue, potentially affecting fund allocation to other ports. There is significant disparity in HMT revenue generated by different harbors, with the top 15 ports collecting over 75% of total revenue, raising concerns about equity and efficiency. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) revenue is mainly generated by the top 15 ports, raising concerns about equity and efficiency in fund allocation. The Corps maintains harbors for public safety reasons, including \"harbors of refuge\" for small craft, with most authorized by Congress between 1850 and 1950. The Corps prioritizes \"critical\" harbors of refuge when allocating O&M funds. The Corps prioritizes \"critical\" harbors of refuge and subsistence harbors for O&M funding. In FY2011-FY2014, 30 different harbors were identified for funding, including those supporting Coast Guard stations and passenger ferries. In FY2012-FY2014, the House and Senate Appropriations Committees provided an additional $30 million for the maintenance of small, remote, or subsistence harbors. They criticized the administration's criteria for not allowing these harbors to compete for navigation maintenance funds and urged the Corps to revise the criteria for funding navigation projects. The Committee urges the Corps to revise criteria for funding navigation maintenance projects based on economic impact, national defense, and public safety importance. President Clinton proposed phasing out federal funding for harbors not contributing to the HMTF. President Clinton proposed a two-year phase-out of federal funding for harbors that did not contribute to the HMTF, totaling about $63 million in annual expenditures. State and local governments were suggested to take over maintenance responsibilities for these harbors, while the Corps would focus on water projects of national significance. President Reagan had previously proposed terminating funding for harbors with federal maintenance costs exceeding $1 per ton of cargo. The HMTF was enacted as a user fee during the Reagan Administration after Congress rejected the original proposal to allow local port authorities to assess fees on ships for harbor maintenance. Debate over maintaining harbors with little commercial cargo dates back to the 1950s. The debate over maintaining harbors with little commercial cargo dates back to the 1950s. The Corps' policy was not to maintain harbors not extensively used by commercial navigation, endorsed by the House Committee on Appropriations in 1954. Minimum appropriations in recent years have prevented funds from being used on obsolete waterways, but a more thorough analysis is needed. The 1956 audit by the General Accounting Office found that the Corps was maintaining waterways mainly used by recreational boaters or a single shipper, contrary to their policy. GAO recommended Congress establish specific policies for determining which navigation projects should be federally funded. In 2011, GAO identified 11 coastal navigation projects of questionable value, receiving $12 million in O&M spending and generating $1.5 million in HMT revenues. Only two projects still carry cargo, with one being the 155-mile Okeechobee Waterway in Florida recommended for reclassification as a flood-control project to make it ineligible for HMTF expenditures. The waterway was not reclassified as a flood-control project, allowing it to receive $30 million from the HMTF between FY1999 to FY2008. In 2012, it handled 21 barges and 2,000 tons of cargo, along with 3,997 recreational vessels. Another project in Texas, the Anahuac Channel and Trinity River, received $17 million from FY1999 to FY2008 but has not moved any cargo in recent years. Recent budget requests have focused on O&M expenses for flood risk mitigation rather than navigation. Recreational boaters on the Great Lakes and in Oregon contribute significantly to the local economy, supporting thousands of jobs and spending billions of dollars annually. They do not contribute to the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) but pay federal fuel taxes for other purposes like restoring fish habitat. Oregon found that recreational boating supported 1,700 jobs. Recreational boaters pay federal fuel taxes for fish habitat restoration, boating safety programs, and marina infrastructure. Some in the industry support using motorboat fuel taxes for harbor dredging. The Corps is exploring this through a pilot program on the Atlantic Coast. The Corps is exploring a pilot program on the Atlantic Coast to investigate local financing for harbor maintenance. However, key information on current expenditure reports from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund is not publicly available. The Corps has been requesting funds to provide detailed reports on expenditures from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund. They have data on cargo tonnage and O&M expenses for waterways since 1922, but there are discrepancies in facility nomenclature in their database. The Corps has been tracking O&M expenditures on facilities since 1977, but there are discrepancies in facility nomenclature between databases. They do not compare shipping channel dimensions to authorized dimensions or publish estimates of economic loss from deficiencies. The Navigation Economic Technologies Program aims to address these issues. The Corps has established the \"Navigation Economic Technologies Program\" (NETS) to develop economic tools for navigation improvement evaluation. The program focuses on economic analysis of construction dredging projects. The Corps established the \"Navigation Economic Technologies Program\" (NETS) to develop economic tools for navigation improvement evaluation, focusing on construction dredging projects. Congress requested estimates on maintaining authorized dimensions of channels from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund starting in FY2014. The Federal Maritime Commission estimated the average Harbor Maintenance Tax payment for a 40-foot shipping container at $109. The HMT rate is 0.125% and is more significant when compared to typical freight charges. Shipping a 40-foot container from an Asian port to the U.S. Midwest costs around $4,000. The Harbor Maintenance Tax (HMT) of $147 for a 40-foot container of imported electronics raises shipping costs by about 4%. U.S. ports near the Canadian and Mexican borders claim that the HMT diverts cargo to ports in those countries where no similar tax is imposed. Factors like this lead shippers to use ports in Canada or Mexico according to a 2012 FMC study. The Harbor Maintenance Tax (HMT) of $147 for a 40-foot container raises shipping costs by about 4%, leading shippers to use ports in Canada or Mexico. A 2012 FMC study found that factors like risk mitigation and rail rate disparities drive cargo diversion. If the HMT was removed, shippers could divert 59,000 to 72,500 containers per year from Canadian to U.S. ports. The FMC concluded that removing the Harbor Maintenance Tax (HMT) could divert 59,000 to 72,500 containers per year from Canadian to U.S. ports. Senators Murray and Cantwell plan to introduce legislation to replace the HMT with a maritime goods movement user fee to reduce incentives for shipping through Canada. The HMT is a significant obstacle to transshipment of cargo by sea. The Harbor Maintenance Tax (HMT) may discourage coastal feeder service as it is levied twice on imported cargo unloaded at a U.S. port and reloaded on another ship. This could hinder the transshipment of containers arriving at U.S. ports, with the FMC estimating that removing the HMT could divert containers from Canadian to U.S. ports. Senators Murray and Cantwell plan to introduce legislation to replace the HMT with a maritime goods movement user fee. The Harbor Maintenance Tax (HMT) poses challenges for coastal feeder service and container transshipment at U.S. ports. CBP and the Corps estimate up to $500 million in uncollected HMT from domestic waterborne shippers annually. Unlike import duties, the HMT is not refundable, impacting the price competitiveness of some U.S. exports. The Harbor Maintenance Tax (HMT) can be refunded on imported parts used in U.S. exports to maintain price competitiveness. Exporters do not pay HMT for port use when exporting, but do pay on materials used in production. The debate over WRDA is in the context of industrial supply chain cost-effectiveness. House and Senate Committees express concern over insufficient budget requests for Corps O&M. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations are concerned about the President's budget requests for Corps O&M not being sufficient for global competitiveness. They have directed the Corps to use additional funds for harbors to promote international competitiveness. The U.S. Departments of Transportation and Commerce have launched the Competitive Supply Chain Initiative to strategically improve the nation's marine transportation system and overall national freight infrastructure. The Department of Commerce is focused on improving America's national freight infrastructure and competitiveness by enhancing the marine transportation system. Supply chain competitiveness impacts product costs and global prices, influencing investment and hiring decisions. In 2010, a competition analysis between the United States and China highlighted the importance of supply chain management efficiency. It is crucial for policymakers, leaders, and academics to align supply chain design with strategic priorities. In March 2012, the Corps and the U.S. Department of Transportation collaborated to enhance transportation infrastructure investments. In 2012, the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Corps collaborated to improve transportation infrastructure investments, aligning waterside and landside infrastructure with national priorities. President Obama announced an initiative to expedite federal permitting for construction projects at five harbors in response to the Panama Canal expansion. The Task Force on Ports was established in response to requests for a more strategic framework for federal investments in maritime infrastructure."
