The \"SCHIP Expansion for Kids in Need Act of 2009\" prioritizes SCHIP coverage for children in families with income under 200 percent of the federal poverty level. Section 2108 of the Social Security Act is amended to include income-related data in annual reports on the success of states in providing health insurance coverage for children at various income levels. The Secretary will establish standards for data collection and statistical methodologies for reporting family income levels based on gross income relative to percentages of the poverty line. Additionally, a new subsection is added to the Act for a plan to cover low-income children. The Act will include a plan for coverage of low-income children, requiring states to develop and submit a plan to ensure coverage for qualified low-income children. The Act mandates states to develop and implement a plan to cover all qualified low-income children with creditable health coverage starting in fiscal year 2010, subject to approval by the Secretary. The Secretary will approve or disapprove state plans designed to ensure coverage for low-income children, with an opportunity for resubmission if disapproved. The Secretary will notify the State of plan approval or disapproval, allowing for resubmission if necessary. A \"qualified low-income child\" is defined as a child whose family's gross income does not exceed 200 percent of the poverty line for their family size. The text discusses the eligibility requirements for a \"qualified low-income child\" under the SCHIP program, based on family income not exceeding 200 percent of the poverty line for the family size. Additionally, there is a limitation on the use of SCHIP funds related to increases in income eligibility for states. In cases where a State raises its income eligibility level for its child health plan, payment under this section will not be made for individuals exceeding the new income limit unless approved by the Secretary. The State must show that no more than 10% of low-income children are not covered under health insurance to receive funding, with exceptions for qualified low-income children. The State must demonstrate that less than 10% of low-income children lack health insurance to qualify for funding for qualified low-income children or children meeting eligibility standards under the State child health plan."
