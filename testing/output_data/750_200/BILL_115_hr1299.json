    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Berta Caceres Human Rights in Honduras Act\". Congress finds that the Honduran police are corrupt and commit human rights abuses, including torture, rape, illegal detention, and murder with impunity. The New York Times revealed documents indicating top officials ordered the killings of drug-crime investigators with the knowledge of high-ranking government officials. The New York Times suggested that high-ranking government officials in Honduras were manipulating revelations for corrupt purposes. Individuals in the police with records of human rights abuses are promoted, and international bodies report impunity for abuses by the military and police, including death squad activity documented by the Associated Press and Human Rights Watch. The Associated Press and Human Rights Watch have documented death squad activity by police in Honduras, where impunity for human rights abuses remains a chronic problem. Investigations into police abuses are hindered by inefficiency and corruption, with little information made public and prosecutions moving slowly or remaining inconclusive. Efforts to clean up the Honduran police have largely failed, with minimal progress in prosecuting members involved in corruption and human rights abuses. Fundamental reform of the police is still needed. Rights Action documented the involvement of the Fifteenth Battalion of the Honduran Armed Forces in killings of small-farmer activists in the Aguan Valley since 2000. Human Rights Watch confirmed these killings in 2015, with no consequences. Only one private actor has been convicted, and assassinations of activists continue. In October 2016, Jose Angel Flores and Silmer Dionisio George of MUCA were assassinated. Military abuses include the killing of Tomas Garcia in 2013 and torture of Amado Maradiaga Quiroz in 2014. In May 2014, members of the Ninth Infantry tortured and killed Amado Maradiaga Quiroz and tortured his son. In December 2015, the Honduran Navy killed two Garifuna Afro-Indigenous men. The current Government of Honduras has expanded the military's reach into domestic policing. The Honduran military's expansion into domestic policing, including the creation of a 3,000-member Military Police in violation of the constitution, has led to human rights abuses and fatal incidents, such as the killings of unarmed individuals like Ebed Yanes, Erlin Misael Carias Moncada, and Edgardo Moreno Rodriguez. Reports indicate a notable increase in military-related human rights violations, with the announcement of two new battalions of the Military Police in 2016. The military in Honduras has seen an increase in abuses, with the creation of two new battalions of the Military Police in 2016. The judicial system in Honduras is corrupt, with officials connected to organized crime and drug traffickers, leading to widespread impunity. The report on Honduras highlights corruption, intimidation, and institutional weakness in the justice system, resulting in widespread impunity. Efforts to reform public security institutions have made little progress, with the judiciary and police being ineffective due to corruption and abuse. The assassination of activist Berta Caceres in 2016 further exemplifies the challenges faced in the country. The assassination of Berta Caceres in 2016 highlights the human rights crisis in Honduras and the government's complicity. Caceres, a prominent Indigenous and environmental activist, had reported 33 threats before her killing, but none were investigated by the ineffective judiciary and police. The assassination of Berta Caceres in 2016 revealed the human rights crisis in Honduras. Despite reporting 33 threats prior to her death, no investigations were conducted. The government failed to provide adequate protection as mandated by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. Eight suspects, including individuals with ties to the Honduran military, have been arrested in connection with her killing, raising concerns about the military's involvement. The arrests of individuals with ties to the Honduran military in connection with Berta Caceres' assassination raise questions about the military's role and the true authors of the crime. The Government of Honduras restricts access to the case file, with the original file being stolen despite calls for transparency. Despite widespread calls for an independent investigation into the assassination of Berta Caceres, the Honduran government has refused to allow the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights to conduct one. This refusal comes in the midst of corruption and human rights abuses, putting various activists and critics of the government at severe risk. Activists, human rights defenders, and critics of the government face severe risks, with past abuses largely unpunished. The shooting of journalist Felix Molina on May 2, 2016, highlights the ongoing danger. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 allocated around $18 million to the Honduran police and military. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 allocated $18 million to the Honduran police and military, with additional funding authorized by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 and a funding increase requested for fiscal year 2017. The Inter-American Development Bank approved a $59.8 million loan to the Honduran police in 2012 with U.S. approval. SEC. 3. Suspension of security assistance to Honduras for police and military, including equipment and training. Secretary of the Treasury to vote against loans for Honduran police and military at multilateral development banks. The Act will end when the Secretary of State certifies that Honduras has pursued legal action for various murders, including that of Berta Caceres. The Honduran government has investigated and prosecuted military and police forces for human rights violations, withdrawn the military from domestic policing, and ensured separation of domestic police functions from command. The Honduran government, in accordance with the Constitution, separated domestic police functions from the Armed Forces, ensuring civilian authority. It also protected the rights of various groups and worked towards establishing the rule of law and a capable judicial system. The Honduran government has taken effective steps to establish the rule of law and ensure a capable judicial system for investigating and prosecuting members of the police and military who commit human rights abuses."
