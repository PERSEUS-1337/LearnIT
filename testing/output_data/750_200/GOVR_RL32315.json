    "content": "Significant amounts of technically recoverable oil and gas resources are projected to be on federal public lands, but energy development is restricted in environmentally sensitive areas. These restricted areas may still contain substantial oil and gas reserves. The conflict between environmental concerns and the need for increased domestic energy production from public lands is a major policy issue addressed in legislation such as the omnibus energy bill (H.R. 6) and Senate substitute S. 2095. The conference report on the omnibus energy bill (H.R. 6) and the Senate substitute, S. 2095, address restrictions and impediments to oil and gas development on public lands, including evaluating the permitting process. The Bush Administration has its own initiative to expedite the oil and gas permitting process on federal lands. Oil and gas development practices have sparked debate in Congress since the early years of the industry. In the early years of the industry, oil and gas resources on public lands could be transferred to private ownership under the Mining Law of 1872. President Taft withdrew 3 million acres of lands prospective for oil in Wyoming and California in 1909, leading to the Pickett Act of 1910 which recognized executive branch authority for such withdrawals. The Pickett Act of 1910 recognized executive branch authority for public land withdrawals, leading to the Mineral Lands Leasing Act of 1920 which placed oil and gas under a leasing system, generating billions in federal revenues. Split-estate situations arise when minerals are owned by the federal government under privately held lands. Minerals owned by the federal government under privately held lands create split-estate situations. This can also occur with surface and mineral rights held by different private interests, or state-owned mineral rights and privately held surface rights. Federal statutes allow the government to issue patents to land while reserving mineral rights. The mineral estate becomes dominant, requiring specific policies for mineral development, especially for oil and gas. Environmentalists support public land withdrawals and restrictions due to concerns about the Mining Law of 1872 and the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920. Split-estate situations exist where minerals are owned by the federal government under privately held lands, with about 11% of public lands falling under this category. Wyoming and Montana have higher percentages of split-estate lands at 50% and 57% respectively. Specific policies and procedures must be followed by mineral estate holders for mineral development, particularly for oil and gas, including obtaining surface agreements, consent from surface owners, payment for damages, or posting a bond of at least $1,000. Environmentalists support public land withdrawals and restrictions due to concerns about inadequate environmental protection under the Mining Law of 1872 and Mineral Leasing Act of 1920. Ranchers and other groups are also worried about the impact of development on water and land. Development supporters argue that current environmental laws, such as the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and Clean Water and Clean Air Acts, regulate oil and gas development on public lands. The oil and gas industry must comply with environmental laws such as NEPA, Clean Water Act, and Clean Air Act. Delays in drilling on leased lands are a concern. Proposed energy bills aim to address industry and administration concerns over domestic oil and gas supplies. Title III of H.R. 6 and S. 2095 aim to establish a White House Office of Federal Project Coordination to expedite permitting on public lands for oil and gas development. Environmentalists and public land users are concerned about potential harm to the environment. The Senate's approval of the conference report was hindered by a cloture motion in 2003. The House approved a conference report, but the Senate did not due to a failed cloture motion. The Senate's substitute bill, S. 2095, is pending. The report gives an overview of the oil and gas leasing system on U.S. public lands, including permitting, production, and reserves. It discusses the contribution of onshore oil and gas to U.S. energy demand and estimates of reserves in restricted areas. An Appendix provides historical background on land withdrawals from mineral development and the role of the Bureau of Land Management. The leasing of onshore federal public lands for oil and gas development is based on Resource Management Plans developed by the Bureau of Land Management. Tracts of public land are designated for oil and gas development in accordance with these plans. An Appendix provides historical background on land withdrawals from mineral development and the role of the Bureau of Land Management. In accordance with Resource Management Plans developed by the Bureau of Land Management, public lands with oil and gas potential are offered for competitive leasing. Industry has criticized the lengthy process of obtaining drilling permits for exploratory or production wells. In FY2002, 1,765 new oil and gas leases were issued on public lands totaling 1.4 million acres, with a total of 18.6 million acres leased for oil and gas development by the end of FY2002 under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act. In FY2002, 18.6 million acres of public lands were leased for oil and gas development under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act. Resource Management Plans are required for land use planning, covering diverse uses like timber, grazing, wildlife conservation, recreation, and energy, considering present and future generations' needs. Impacts of various uses are identified early in the planning process. Resource Management Plans (RMPs) are essential for land use planning on public lands, covering various uses like timber, grazing, wildlife conservation, recreation, and energy. The plans aim to weigh the impacts of different uses equitably and consider the benefits to the community. RMPs must comply with environmental regulations and allow public participation. The BLM determines which lands with oil and gas potential will be available for leasing through this process. The Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 requires public lands with oil and gas potential to be offered for leasing through competitive bidding. If no bids meet the minimum acceptable bid of $2/acre, leases are offered noncompetitively. Noncompetitive tracts remain available for two years. Noncompetitive leasing tracts are available for 30 days initially and for two years thereafter. Qualified applicants can obtain tracts by paying a nonrefundable fee of at least $75. Simultaneous noncompetitive lease applications are prioritized through a lottery system. Geophysical exploration permits on unleased public lands may be issued by BLM, excluding drilling for core samples or oil and gas. Geophysical exploration permits on unleased public lands may be issued by BLM for activities excluding drilling for core samples or oil and gas. Once a lease is obtained, the lessee has exclusive rights for further exploration, development, and production. An Application for a Permit to Drill (APD) must be approved for each oil and gas well on the leased land. An Application for a Permit to Drill (APD) is required for each oil and gas well on leased land. The APD must include a drilling plan, surface use plan, and bond/surety coverage. The surface use plan details drillpad location, construction, waste disposal, and reclamation plans. The APD is posted for review for 30 days. The APD is required for each oil and gas well on leased land and includes a drilling plan, surface use plan, and bond/surety coverage. It details drillpad location, construction, waste disposal, and reclamation plans. The BLM consults with the surface managing agency and processes the application within 35 days, with possible outcomes of approval, approval with stipulations, rejection, or delay for additional analysis. Despite the 35-day review requirement, a recent study by IPAMS found delays in the region. The Independent Petroleum Association of Mountain States (IPAMS) found delays in approving APDs, taking an average of 137 days in 2002, up from 84 days in 2001. Delays are due to rewriting outdated RMPs to accommodate increased natural gas leasing and development, which may exceed old plan limits. Oil and gas leases awarded under old RMPs must be revised before drilling permits can be issued. Increased natural gas leasing and development is leading to delays in approving drilling permits, as old RMPs need to be revised to accommodate the growth. The BLM is currently revising several plans to comply with FLPMA regulations for land use planning. This process includes public involvement and the preparation of an environmental impact statement under NEPA. The BLM is revising RMPs to accommodate natural gas leasing growth, causing delays in approving drilling permits. IPAMS testified that rewriting RMPs now takes up to three years, compared to less than one year a decade ago. The usefulness of an RMP is now seven years, down from potentially 20 years in the past. The Association argues that RMPs now have a shorter lifespan of seven years compared to potentially 20 years in the past due to rapid CBM development. Environmentalists believe that outdated plans are not suitable for land management decisions, leading to delays in site-specific analysis for drilling permits by the BLM. The BLM announced new strategies in April 2003 to expedite the permit process, including processing multiple applications together, implementing area development planning, and establishing standard operating practices for oil and gas operators. The BLM announced new strategies in April 2003 to expedite the permit process for oil and gas operators. This includes establishing standard operating practices, promoting consistent procedures, and revising relevant BLM manuals. Public lands for oil and gas leasing are categorized as open under standard lease terms, open with restrictions, or closed to leasing due to land withdrawals or other mechanisms, such as wilderness areas and national parks. The withdrawn land includes wilderness areas, national parks, and environmentally sensitive areas closed to oil and gas leasing. Approximately 165 million acres have been withdrawn from mineral entry, leasing, and sale by the BLM. Approximately 165 million acres of federal subsurface minerals have been withdrawn from mineral entry, leasing, and sale by the BLM in 2000. This includes lands in the National Park System, Wilderness Preservation System, and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Another 182 million acres are subject to surface management agency approval and must not conflict with land designations and plans. Public lands open to leasing may have restrictions imposed by the Department of the Interior, such as no surface occupancy, timing limitations to protect wildlife, and controlled surface use requiring a mitigation plan. Some lease stipulations on public lands, including no surface occupancy and timing limitations for wildlife protection, are seen as overly restrictive by the energy industry. They argue that federal withdrawals hinder exploration and limit production opportunities, while environmental groups support these actions for preservation goals. The energy industry argues that public land withdrawals hinder exploration and production opportunities, while environmental groups support these actions for preservation goals. The Rocky Mountain region holds a significant amount of natural gas and crude oil resources on public lands. Approximately 60% of the undiscovered resource base in the Rocky Mountain region's five basins is on public lands, with 40% inaccessible or subject to restrictions. Due to increased interest in natural gas access and Bush Administration policies, this region is a focal point for U.S. oil and gas policy. Recent reports have studied restrictions on natural gas in the area. The EIA and NPC studies compare data on natural gas supplies in the Rocky Mountain region, with a focus on federal lands and development restrictions. The natural gas resource base in the Rocky Mountain region is approximately 335 trillion cubic feet (tcf) according to the 1999 NPC study and 293.6 tcf according to more recent EIA estimates. The EPCA study found 138.5 tcf in the five major geologic basins in the region. The amounts of natural gas closed and restricted for development are similar across the studies. The EIA report shows that 11.5% of natural gas reserves are closed and 37% are restricted, while 60% are open for leasing. This contrasts with the NPC report, which states that 9% are closed, 32% are restricted, and 51.5% are open. The difference is likely due to excluded proven reserves available for leasing. The EPCA study found that 63% of the 26 tcf of proven natural gas reserves on federal lands are open for leasing. Including Rocky Mountain reserves would likely increase the percentage of natural gas open for standard lease terms. Oil resources in the Rocky Mountains have less significance compared to U.S. oil supply, with about 600 million barrels of oil. The EPCA study found that oil resources in the Rocky Mountains have less significance compared to U.S. oil supply. About 600 million barrels of oil fall under the \"no access\" category, with 3.2 billion barrels available for leasing, one-third of which have restrictions. Additionally, 2.5 billion barrels of oil are estimated to be available on non-federal lands in the studied basins, representing about 7% of all technically recoverable oil in the United States. The EPCA study found that about 7% of all technically recoverable oil in the United States is available on non-federal lands in the Rockies. The NPC and EIA studies suggest that developing natural gas in restricted land areas would likely face costly delays. The EIA report suggests that developing gas in restricted land areas could face costly delays. Greater flexibility in federal regulations could make 29 tcf immediately available, and removing certain lease stipulations could make 51 tcf less costly to develop, totaling 80 tcf. Environmental groups argue that relaxing these restrictions would pose a greater risk to the environment. The NPC study estimates that 41% of gas resources in the Rocky Mountain region are either closed or restricted, totaling 335 tcf as of 1999. There are major policy disagreements about the importance of oil and gas reserves on public lands in meeting U.S. energy needs. The Rocky Mountain region holds an estimated 37% of the US natural gas reserves, with 108 tcf currently restricted. If produced, it could last 20-30 years meeting 15% of US demand. US gas demand is currently met by OCS (25%), imports (15%), Rocky Mountain region (15%), and other onshore sources (45%). The United States currently meets its natural gas demand from various sources including the outer continental shelf (25%), imports (15%), the Rocky Mountain region (15%), and other onshore locations (45%). Testimony from The Wilderness Society stated that the US has enough natural gas supply to meet domestic needs for the next 40 years, with annual demand expected to increase from 22 tcf in 2001 to 31 tcf in 2015. The NPC report indicates 1,466 trillion cubic feet of technically recoverable resources in the US, with 115 tcf classified as off-limits. Based on the NPC report, 1,351 tcf of natural gas could be available for development in the future, with 16% subject to restrictions. The NPC argues that 70 tcf of Rocky Mountain natural gas is currently under restriction or lease stipulations. The NPC argues that 70 tcf of Rocky Mountain natural gas is restricted from development due to various impediments, proposing to relax land-use constraints to allow for more drilling on federal lands in the intermountain west. This includes addressing \"no surface occupancy\" designations, overly restrictive environmental stipulations, and outdated access restrictions that do not consider new technology. The RAND Corporation's 2002 Issue Paper suggests focusing access restrictions on the most viable resource category to minimize environmental damage. This approach would reduce the amount of restricted resources, but the analysis is complicated by the conversion rate of oil and gas resources to reserves. Total U.S. oil production was 1.9 billion barrels in 2002, forecasted to decrease to 5.3 million barrels per day by 2025. Oil imports are expected to make up 65% of U.S. supply in 2025. Natural gas production was 19.4 tcf in 2002, up from 17.8 tcf in 1993. Oil production from federal onshore leases accounted for 5.4% of all U.S. oil production in 2002. In 2002, oil production from federal onshore leases was estimated at 5.4% of all U.S. oil production, with Wyoming, New Mexico, and California being the top three states for onshore federal oil production. Onshore federal oil production has generally been in decline over the past 10 years, falling from 133.5 million barrels in 1992 to about 100 million barrels in 2002. U.S. production of natural gas varied between 18-20 tcf annually between 1993-2002. In 2002, U.S. natural gas production ranged from 18-20 tcf annually. Projections suggest production could reach 20 tcf - 24.3 tcf by 2025. Imports from Canada are expected to increase to 3.7 tcf in 2010, then decrease to 2.6 tcf in 2025. Canadian reports of declining gas production and increased domestic use for oil sands production influenced the forecasts. LNG imports are projected to rise from 170,000 bcf in 2002 to 4.8 tcf in 2025 according to the EIA. Gas production on public lands in the U.S. increased to 2.2 tcf in 2002 from 1.7 tcf in 1993, with New Mexico and Wyoming being the top two states in natural gas production on public lands. They accounted for 85% of the total production. The federal onshore share of total U.S. domestic oil and gas production is not expected to change significantly in the near term. The federal onshore share of total U.S. domestic oil and gas production is expected to remain stable, with Texas leading in reserves. U.S. oil reserves were 22.7 billion barrels as of December 31, 2002, with a decline of 1.2 billion barrels over the past 10 years. Texas leads in oil and natural gas reserves in the United States. U.S. oil reserves have declined by 1.2 billion barrels over the past 10 years, with production decreasing by 500 million barrels. The 2.5 billion barrels of recoverable oil discovered in 2001 was three times greater than the average annual discovery since 1976. Despite substantial oil reserves, production is expected to continue declining over the long term. The United States is likely to see a decline in oil production over the long term, despite having substantial reserves. The EIA estimates 92 billion barrels of technically recoverable oil resources, but not all may be recoverable. In contrast, natural gas reserves in the US have increased by 16.5 tcf (10%). The United States has seen an increase in natural gas reserves by 16.5 tcf (10%) since 1991, with production also rising. Gas imports have risen to 17% from about 9% in 1991. Annual discoveries were up 70% above the average since 1976. Technically recoverable gas resources are estimated to be about 1,000 tcf, over five times the amount of current proved reserves. The 2002 oil and gas resource assessment estimates 1.9 billion barrels of oil, 183 tcf of natural gas, and 3.1 billion barrels of natural gas liquids as undiscovered resources in the Rocky Mountain West. Over 90% of the undiscovered gas is unconventional, with 25% being coalbed methane. Public lands account for the majority of proven reserves in the Rocky Mountain region. In the Rocky Mountain region, oil and natural gas liquids on public lands make up 53.6% of reserves, while natural gas accounts for 60.1%. Federal onshore oil is estimated at 12.5% of technically recoverable oil, with natural gas at 22.3%. Undiscovered conventional oil is estimated at 30.1 billion barrels, conventional natural gas at 319.7 trillion cubic feet, and unconventional natural gas at 358.7 trillion cubic feet. The estimate for undiscovered unconventional natural gas resources is 358.7 trillion cubic feet. Coalbed methane gas is trapped in coal and can be extracted by removing water from the coal. Coalbed methane (CBM) extraction involves removing water from coal to release the gas. Operators may fracture coal formations to facilitate gas flow, raising concerns about groundwater contamination. The quality of pumped water varies, with options for reuse if fresh or disposal through injection or discharge. Water quality and disposal are key issues in CBM production. Production of coalbed methane (CBM) has significantly increased since 1987, with coalbed gas contributing to 8% of natural gas production in the United States in 2002. There were 10,000 CBM wells producing 1.65 million barrels of water per day in 2002, mainly in New Mexico, Colorado, and Wyoming. Production rates vary due to the diverse geology of coalbeds. The leading producers of coalbed methane (CBM) are in New Mexico, Colorado, and Wyoming, with production rates varying due to the heterogenous geology of coalbeds. Out of the estimated 700 tcf of CBM in the United States, only about 100 tcf are economically recoverable. The EIA study found that about 46 tcf of coalbed methane in the Rocky Mountain region, with 20% falling under the \"no access\" category. Coalbed methane proved reserves were 18.5 tcf. In the Rocky Mountain region, about 46 tcf of coalbed methane reserves were identified in 2001, with 20% falling under the \"no access\" category. Colorado and New Mexico hold more than half of the U.S. CBM reserves, while Wyoming, Utah, and Alabama also have significant reserves. The San Juan Basin is the most productive, containing 65% of known reserves and 80% of production. The Warrior Basin in Alabama is the second most productive, with 9% of U.S. production and 8% of reserves. USGS estimates CBM resources in the Powder River Basin at 39 tcf. The federal government owns over half of the mineral rights in the Powder River Basin (PRB), with most current CBM production on private lands. Concerns arise over surface use agreements between surface owners and mineral lessees. The Wyoming Split-Estate Initiative was established in 2002 to address concerns about surface use agreements between surface owners and mineral lessees. Environmental concerns related to CBM production focus on land and water issues. Environmental concerns about coalbed methane (CBM) production primarily revolve around land and water issues, including surface infrastructure, water removal, effects on the water table, salinity levels, and disposal of water that may impact wildlife and surface water resources. Hydraulic fracturing for CBM production is under scrutiny due to concerns about the potential impact of injected fluids on underground environments. Hydraulic fracturing for CBM production is under scrutiny due to concerns about the impact of injected fluids, such as diesel fuel, on underground drinking water. A draft EPA report found no evidence of contamination from CBM hydraulic fracturing but expressed concern over diesel fuel use. An agreement was made to end the use of diesel fuel as an injection fluid. Proposed energy legislation includes measures related to this issue. Proposed energy legislation (H.R. 6 and S. 2095) may prohibit EPA from regulating underground injection of fluids for hydraulic fracturing under the Safe Drinking Water Act. Dennis Hemmer of the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality noted that water from CBM production can seep into underground aquifers, potentially polluting drinking water wells with sodium-tainted water. CBM production has resulted in water discharges of 602. CBM production can lead to water pollution in underground aquifers, affecting drinking water wells. Discharges of 602 million barrels annually are typically released into surface waters or holding ponds. Environmental concerns include unlined holding ponds leaking into groundwater, lowering water tables, and impacting wildlife water sources. The Wildlife Management Institute of Washington D.C. warns that CBM production may deplete underground aquifers, harm natural vegetation, and aquatic life in waterways. BLM requires CBM producers to drill monitoring wells at a cost of $50,000 each to monitor groundwater quality and quantity. Since 1992, CBM leases have required one shallow and one deep well per four townships for monitoring water quality and levels. Private lands do not need monitoring wells. In April 2002, three leases were invalidated due to insufficient evaluation of environmental issues related to CBM production. Additional environmental assessments were conducted in the Powder River Basin to guide CBM development. Supplemental environmental assessments were conducted in the Powder River Basin to determine CBM development in approved leasing areas. The Wyoming Outdoor Council sued BLM to withdraw leases due to violations of an IBLA ruling. BLM halted lease sales after the lawsuit. In 2002, an IBLA ruling directed BLM to update a 1985 RMP before offering CBM leases in the Powder River Basin. BLM did not proceed with lease sales on public lands with high CBM content, including the parcels in question, while the ruling was being interpreted. The case was dismissed in December 2003. The Wyoming BLM office finalized a new EA and RMP, planning to approve 39,000 permits for new wells over 10 years. DOI decided to start issuing permits in July 2003. Oil demand is expected to increase by 1.6% annually to 28 mbd by 2025. The DOI decision to start issuing permits in July 2003 was driven by the forecasted increase in oil demand by 1.6% annually to 28 mbd by 2025. The outlook for increased oil and natural gas production from U.S. public lands is uncertain, with domestic production and imports expected to rise. The Bush Administration has initiated actions to ease restrictions on natural gas imports from public lands, but the level of opposition is uncertain. Challenges have been reported based on alleged violations of BLM's multiple-use mandate. Congressional action would be required to change the status of statutorily removed areas. Production of conventional natural gas on available lands is expected to remain steady, with more wells and deeper wells being drilled. The production of conventional natural gas is expected to remain steady, with an increase in onshore unconventional natural gas production. Industry seeks greater access to federal lands for drilling, while environmental concerns focus on potential damage to sensitive lands and wildlife habitats. Meeting U.S. energy demand will likely involve a mix of increased domestic production. The United States is expected to rely more on natural gas imports, including LNG from stable countries, and increased production from the deepwater OCS. The Rocky Mountain region may contribute up to 40% of U.S. natural gas production by 2025. A proposed Alaskan natural gas pipeline could provide 2.71 tcf by 2025. Oil and gas firms are actively exploring worldwide for the best returns on investment. Oil and gas firms worldwide seek the best return on investment, considering factors like resource base, political stability, and financing. The United States is attractive for investment but environmental and societal impacts must be considered in public land use decisions. Competitive lease terms include maximum acreage, minimum bid, term length, and bond requirement. Noncompetitive leases have different terms. The onshore leasing program in the United States offers competitive and noncompetitive lease terms for oil and gas production. Competitive leases have a maximum acreage of 2,500 acres (5,760 acres in Alaska), minimum bid of $2/acre, five-year term, and a $10,000 bond requirement. Noncompetitive leases allow up to 10,240 acres, no minimum bid, ten-year term, and a $10,000 bond requirement. Rentals range from $1.50/acre for 1-5 years to $2/acre thereafter, with a royalty of at least 12.5% on production. The onshore leasing program in the United States generates significant annual revenues for the U.S. Treasury through bonus bids, rents, and royalties collected by the Minerals Management Service. Revenues are distributed to states, the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury, and other designated programs, with Alaska receiving 90% of all revenues collected. In 2001, there were 23,000 federal oil and gas leases covering 17 million acres of public lands. The National Park System was established in 1916 to conserve natural and historic objects. The National Park System (NPS) was created in 1916 to conserve scenery, natural and historic objects, and wildlife for future generations. Initially, there was tension between the NPS and the Forest Service due to differing philosophies on resource use and conservation. Early tension arose between conservationists promoting National Parks and utilitarians promoting National Forests in the early 1900s. The debate focused on the President's authority to make land withdrawal orders based on national security, defining withdrawals as actions that changed land designation from available to unavailable for various activities. The President acted as the chief custodian of public lands. Conflicting interests were resolved based on the greatest good for the greatest number of people in the long run. The President, with tacit approval of Congress, can withdraw public land from entry by the private sector for activities like homesteading or resource exploitation. While Congress has authority over public lands, Presidents have the inherent power to reserve lands, such as establishing military reservations. Withdrawals have occurred under various acts like the Antiquities Act of 1906 and the Taylor Grazing Act of 1934. National monuments can be created by the executive branch through statutory delegation under the Antiquities Act of 1906, the Taylor Grazing Act of 1934, the Organic Act of 1897, the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971, and the Wilderness Act of 1964. The President can reserve the \"smallest area compatible with the proper care and management\" of protected sites on federal lands containing historic landmarks, prehistoric structures, and objects of scientific interest. The Taylor Grazing Act withdrew 140 million acres from homesteading laws. Under FLPMA, withdrawals can be made by the executive branch or Congress. The Wilderness Act required the Forest Service to study 5.4 million acres. The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act withdrew large areas of Alaska from resource use or development pending congressional disposition. Congressional designations as \"wilderness\" were later considered essential for protection. The Wilderness Act withdrew large areas of Alaska from resource use or development pending congressional disposition. It required the Forest Service to study 5.4 million acres for wilderness suitability, defining wilderness as off-limits to development to preserve nature's pristine characteristics. Congress has the authority to designate federal lands as wilderness areas. Currently, there are four types of land withdrawal: Congress has sole authority for creating National Parks, wilderness areas, and national wildlife refuges. The executive branch can use power delegated by Congress under the Antiquities Act and the Pickett Act. Congress may withdraw specific resources like oil and gas, and there is a \"general congressional\" withdrawal for lands pending development. The General Mining Law of 1872 removed minerals, while the \"general congressional\" withdrawal allows lands to be excluded from development. Modern executive withdrawals are governed by FLPMA, which established a federal land use management policy with public and congressional input. FLPMA details procedures for sales, acquisitions, withdrawals, and exchanges of public lands, allowing temporary or permanent withdrawals by the executive or Congress. Under FLPMA, withdrawals of public lands can be temporary or permanent and require congressional approval for parcels exceeding 5,000 acres. Proposed withdrawals must be submitted to Congress with detailed reports on reasons, economic and environmental effects, alternatives, consultations with other agencies, and geological/mineral potential. Under FLPMA, withdrawals of public lands can be temporary or permanent and require congressional approval for parcels exceeding 5,000 acres. The Secretary of the Interior can make emergency withdrawals for up to three years, with a report due three months following the withdrawal. A review of public land withdrawals in 11 Western states is mandated to determine the continuation of existing withdrawals. Millions of acres were withdrawn prior to FLPMA, and the Secretary can determine the consistency of existing withdrawals with statutory objectives. BLM is reviewing approximately 70 million withdrawn acres, prioritizing 26 million acres for potential return or multiple uses. As of November 2000, BLM had reviewed 7 million acres, revoking withdrawals on over 6 million acres. Approximately 7 million withdrawn acres, mostly BLM and Bureau of Reclamation land, have had withdrawals revoked on over 6 million acres. The review process for retention of withdrawals requires a compelling show of need and must be continuously supported by documentation under the National BLM planning process. The review process for withdrawals is ongoing for several years, with lands potentially being developed for oil and gas resources or remaining closed. Withdrawals must be supported by documentation under NEPA."
