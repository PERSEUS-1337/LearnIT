    "content": "In the design of deep neural networks, the focus has been on improving accuracy, resulting in complex architectures that are hard to deploy practically. Recently, there is interest in developing quantitative metrics that go beyond accuracy to evaluate network performance. This study introduces NetScore, a new metric that assesses the balance between accuracy, computational complexity, and practical on-device edge usage. NetScore is a new metric designed to assess the balance between accuracy, computational complexity, and network architecture complexity of deep neural networks for practical on-device edge usage. It was compared with top-1 accuracy and information density metrics across 60 different deep convolutional neural networks for image classification on the ImageNet dataset. The study presents evaluation results of various deep neural networks on the ImageNet dataset, serving as a reference guide for practitioners. There is a growing interest in deep learning, but the complexity of deep neural networks poses deployment challenges in practical industrial settings. Designing networks that balance accuracy and complexity is crucial. The design of deep neural networks that balance accuracy and complexity is a hot area of research focus. One key challenge is assessing how well a network strikes this balance, with information density being a widely cited metric. However, information density does not consider computational requirements for network inference. In the study, a new metric called NetScore is introduced to assess the balance between accuracy, architectural complexity, and computational complexity in deep neural networks. This metric aims to improve network model search and design by providing a quantitative assessment of these factors. NetScore is a new metric introduced to assess the balance between accuracy, architectural complexity, and computational complexity in deep neural networks. The study sets \u03b2 = 0.5 and \u03b3 = 0.5 for evaluation. The deep convolutional neural networks evaluated include AlexNet BID22. The results can guide practitioners in the field."
