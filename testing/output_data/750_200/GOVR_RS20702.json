    "content": "The Water Resources Development Act of 2000 authorized federal agencies to participate in Everglades restoration projects under the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. The Everglades is crucial to the South Florida ecosystem, which includes national wildlife refuges, national park units, a large population, and agricultural economy. Changes in water quantity, quality, and distribution since the 1950s have significantly impacted the region's ecology. The Everglades in South Florida has experienced major changes in water quantity, quality, timing, and distribution since the 1950s, impacting the region's ecology. Water shortages are expected to increase as urban and agricultural demand rises. The Everglades, once a network of wetland landscapes stretching 220 miles, is now unable to meet freshwater needs during the dry season. The Everglades, a network of subtropical wetland landscapes stretching 220 miles from Orlando to Florida Bay, acted as natural filters and retention areas that recharged aquifers. Water flowed south through slow-moving creeks and marshes to Lake Okeechobee, eventually reaching Florida Bay. The Everglades, a vast wetland landscape, acted as natural filters and retention areas that recharged aquifers. By the mid-1800s, efforts to control floods and reclaim marshland led to human interventions like the C&SF project by the Army Corps of Engineers in 1948. The Central and Southern Florida (C&SF) project by the Army Corps of Engineers, authorized in 1948, has significantly altered the water flow in South Florida. This project has directed water into canals and rivers, changing the Everglades' water regime and ecosystem. The Everglades ecosystem has changed due to altered water flow, urban and agricultural development, reducing its size by half. Habitat loss has endangered plant and animal species, while degraded water quality from pollutants like excess nutrients and pesticides further harm the ecosystem. The Everglades ecosystem has been harmed by agricultural runoff, leading to a decline in native vegetation and an overabundance of invasive species. Changes in freshwater flows have disrupted coastal estuaries and reef systems. Restoration efforts by the federal government and the State of Florida include acquiring lands and implementing a multi-species recovery plan through the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force. The South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force, established by WRDA 1996, coordinates restoration activities in the Everglades with goals to improve water quality, restore habitats, and ensure compatibility of natural and built systems. The plan aims to address the decline in native vegetation and invasive species, as well as disruptions in freshwater flows, with an estimated cost of nearly $20 billion, including $10.9 billion under CERP. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) focuses on restoring natural hydrologic functions and water quality in South Florida. It aims to capture and store freshwater for use during the dry season, with 80% directed to the natural system and 20% for agricultural and urban consumption. CERP involves removing levees and canals, building reservoirs, storage wells, and pumping stations to redistribute water. CERP calls for removing 240 miles of levees and canals, building reservoirs, storage wells, and pumping stations to capture and redistribute water. WRDA 2000 approved CERP and authorized $700 million in federal funds for initial projects. WRDA 2007 authorized additional activities, including the Indian River Lagoon and Picayune Strand restoration projects. Title VI of WRDA 2000 established that construction, operation, and maintenance costs of CERP projects would be equally shared by Floridian stakeholders and the federal government, with CERP authorization achieved after negotiations among various stakeholders. WRDA 2007 authorized additional activities, including the Indian River Lagoon and Picayune Strand restoration projects, totaling roughly $2.0 billion in authorizations. CERP authorization was achieved after negotiations among federal, state, local, and tribal stakeholders. Federal agencies receive appropriations for CERP activities through annual appropriations bills. Information on appropriations status for CERP activities is available in CRS reports. Support for CERP remains broad. Recent concerns over the implementation of CERP include project prioritization, federal efforts pace, mitigation for excess phosphorous, restoration effectiveness, and technological uncertainties. $0.37 billion in federal funds and $1.63 billion in state funds have been allocated to CERP projects since WRDA 2000. Since WRDA 2000, $0.37 billion in federal funds and $1.63 billion in state funds have been allocated to CERP projects. Concerns have been raised about the Acceler8 prioritization focusing on water supply needs over ecosystem restoration. Proponents of Accerler8 argue that priority projects in the Corps' mission should focus on restoration and water supply for municipal and agricultural users. They believe federal funding for CERP projects is too slow, and federal participation in ecosystem restoration projects is justified by their environmental benefits for the nation. Some stakeholders are concerned that specific Everglades restoration projects may only benefit locally. Some stakeholders are concerned that specific Everglades restoration projects may primarily benefit locally, rather than nationally. There are worries about increasing costs associated with land acquisition for CERP projects, with proponents of Acceler8 arguing for quicker progress. Stakeholders fear that these rising costs could limit federal funds available for other ecosystem restoration projects nationwide. CERP may limit funds for other national ecosystem restoration projects, causing concerns among sponsors and beneficiaries of traditional Corps projects. Delays in completing CERP components raise feasibility worries, such as the Modified Waters Deliveries Project for Everglades restoration. Delays in the Modified Waters Deliveries Project (Mod Waters) may jeopardize the feasibility of the plan, impacting water flows for CERP components in Everglades National Park. WRDA 2000 links CERP and non-CERP projects, while controversy surrounds potential delays due to a Florida state law on phosphorus pollution mitigation. The controversy surrounding potential delays in restoration efforts in the Everglades is related to a Florida state law that extends phosphorus mitigation deadlines. Proponents argue that the law's plan is a realistic strategy for curbing phosphorus pollution. Funding for restoration projects is conditioned on achieving water quality standards in federal properties. The FY2004 and FY2005 Interior appropriations included provisions conditioning funds for restoration on achieving water quality standards in federal properties. If standards are not met, restoration appropriations may be reduced. Congressional interest is shown in overseeing water quality standards for waters entering federal lands in Florida. Some question the effectiveness and necessity of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) and its costliness. Concerns also exist about the plan lacking sufficient measures to improve water quality. Some groups and federal agencies question the necessity and cost of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) and its focus on water supply over ecological restoration. The Corps made changes to prioritize restoration activities earlier, but some still oppose CERP due to concerns about water quality and natural systems allocation. Some groups and scientists oppose CERP, concerned about Florida's financial contribution and the use of funds designated for land purchase. They argue that land acquisition is crucial for successful Everglades restoration to prevent irreversible damage from development. Acquiring land early in the restoration process is crucial to prevent irreversible damage from development in the Greater Everglades. Questions have been raised about the management of Lake Okeechobee and flood management in central Florida, as well as the integration of water management issues and climate change impacts into Everglades restoration efforts. Ecosystem restoration is a relatively new science with ongoing challenges. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) is utilizing adaptive management to address uncertainties in ecosystem restoration. Pilot projects, including aquifer storage and recovery tests, have been authorized to test restoration outcomes. The use of pilot projects, such as aquifer storage and recovery (ASR), is a mechanism to cope with uncertainty in ecosystem restoration outcomes. ASR involves storing surface water in aquifers for later use during dry periods. These pilot projects, authorized under WRDA 2000, have not been completed, leading to uncertainties in their effectiveness for early water storage projects."
