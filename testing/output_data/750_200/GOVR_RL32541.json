    "content": "The 9/11 Commission found that al Qaeda terrorists exploited weaknesses in aviation security, including a pre-screening process focused on bombers, lax checkpoint screening, lack of in-flight security measures, compliance with hijackers, and a lack of protocols for the FAA. The 9/11 Commission identified weaknesses in aviation security, including compliance with hijackers and a lack of protocols for coordinated responses to multiple hijackings. They attributed these vulnerabilities to a failure of imagination among senior policymakers and agencies responsible for intelligence, national defense, and aviation security. Before September 11, 2001, aviation security experts underestimated the likelihood of suicide hijackings, leading to a lack of specific actions taken to defend against this threat. Congressional oversight of aviation security was also lacking, with a focus on airport congestion and passenger service instead. Before September 11, 2001, congressional oversight of aviation security was lacking as Congress focused on airport congestion and passenger service. The 9/11 Commission noted that Congress concentrated on improving air service with no focus on terrorism. After the attacks, Congress swiftly passed the Aviation and Transportation Security Act to address security weaknesses. The Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA) was passed by Congress after the 9/11 attacks to address aviation security weaknesses. It established the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to oversee security in all modes of transportation, including federal security screeners at airports, explosive detection screening for checked bags, air marshals on high-risk flights, and hardened cockpit doors. The Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA) established the TSA to oversee security in all transportation modes, focusing on aviation security. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 placed the TSA within the Department of Homeland Security and authorized arming airline pilots. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 established the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and placed the TSA within it. The act also authorized arming airline pilots for additional security measures. Vision 100 - Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act included aviation security measures such as an aviation security capital fund for explosive detection systems in baggage screening. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 established the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and placed the TSA within it. The act also authorized arming airline pilots for additional security measures. Vision 100 - Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act included aviation security measures such as an aviation security capital fund for explosive detection systems in baggage screening. Despite improvements in aviation security, vulnerabilities in air cargo operations, general aviation, access controls for airport employees, screener performance, and potential terrorist attacks using shoulder-fired missiles persist. The 9/11 Commission also highlighted these security weaknesses. The 9/11 Commission identified vulnerabilities in cargo and general aviation security, as well as inadequate screening and access controls, leading to ongoing aviation security challenges. Specific recommendations were made for airport passenger and baggage screening, and air cargo security. However, the commission did not address risks related to inadequate access controls in secured airport areas and general aviation operations. The 9/11 Commission emphasized the need for a multi-layered security system in aviation, addressing various terrorist tactics. While recommendations were made for passenger and baggage screening, as well as air cargo security, the commission did not address risks related to inadequate access controls in secured airport areas and general aviation operations. The 9/11 Commission emphasized the importance of a multi-layered security system in aviation to address various terrorist tactics. This system must consist of effective layers that are coordinated to create redundancies. The focus is on persisting vulnerabilities in commercial aviation, with recommendations made to enhance security measures. The 9/11 Commission focused on aviation security recommendations post-9/11 attacks, emphasizing vulnerabilities in commercial aviation. Six aviation-specific recommendations were identified by CRS, including enhancing passenger pre-screening, improving explosives detection, addressing human factors at screening checkpoints, deploying baggage screening systems, intensifying cargo screening efforts, and using hardened cargo containers on passenger aircraft. The 9/11 Commission issued six aviation-specific recommendations to enhance security post-9/11, including improving passenger pre-screening, explosives detection, addressing human factors at screening checkpoints, deploying baggage screening systems, intensifying cargo screening efforts, and using hardened cargo containers on passenger aircraft. Additionally, an overarching recommendation was made to prioritize transportation security based on risk and implement cost-effective deterrents. Passenger pre-screening on September 11, 2001 involved CAPPS, security questions, and photo ID checks. Over half of the hijackers were identified through these measures, but with little consequence as pre-screening was focused on preventing bombings similar to Pan Am flight 103. The CAPPS system is still in use but with a revised purpose. The CAPPS system, originally used to prevent bombings like Pan Am flight 103, now also screens for possible hijackers. Its follow-on, CAPPS II, has faced controversy over data privacy and civil liberties concerns. CAPPS II has been in controversy for the past two years over concerns about personal data protection and civil liberties. It would authenticate passengers' identities using commercial databases and check them against terrorist watch lists. The 9/11 Commission recommended improving passenger pre-screening capabilities without delay and utilizing the federal government's watchlists. The controversy surrounding CAPPS II continues as the 9/11 Commission recommended utilizing federal watchlists for passenger pre-screening. Legislation limited CAPPS II implementation to testing until concerns are addressed, but the TSA only addressed one out of eight concerns according to the GAO in February 2004. Airlines remain reluctant to provide data for testing. The GAO found that TSA addressed only one of eight concerns with CAPPS II implementation in February 2004. Airlines are hesitant to provide data for testing due to liability concerns. Recent reports suggest CAPPS II has been scrapped over privacy issues, but a new program may replace it. Tom Ridge has suggested a new program to replace CAPPS II, which may face increased oversight from Congress. H.R. 10 requires TSA to take over prescreening from airlines within 180 days and begin testing by November 1, 2004, aligning with the administration's plans for the Secure Flight program. The 9/11 Commission highlighted al Qaeda's interest in bombing airliners, referencing Ramzi Yousef's 1994 bombing of a Philippines Airlines flight as a precursor to a larger plot. The 9/11 Commission highlighted al Qaeda's interest in bombing airliners, referencing Ramzi Yousef's 1994 bombing of a Philippines Airlines flight. Yousef assembled an improvised explosive device in the airplane's lavatory and hid it under a seat, using a digital watch timer he had invented. Concerns over IEDs were raised in later incidents involving Richard Reid and Nathaniel Heatwole sneaking banned items resembling explosives aboard passenger jets. The 9/11 Commission acknowledged persisting weaknesses in aviation security. The 9/11 Commission acknowledged weaknesses in detecting explosives on passengers and recommended improving screening technologies. All individuals selected for secondary screening should undergo explosives screening. Current procedures have limited capabilities in detecting explosives carried by passengers. New technology is being tested to detect bomb-making chemicals on individuals at airport sites like T.F. Green State Airport, Greater Rochester International Airport, San Diego International Airport, Tampa International Airport, and Gulfport-Biloxi International Airport. New technology is being tested at various airport sites like T.F. Green State Airport, Greater Rochester International Airport, San Diego International Airport, Tampa International Airport, and Gulfport-Biloxi International Airport to detect explosives on passengers. Methods include body scan imaging with low dose x-ray backscatter, bomb-sniffing dogs, and physical searches. Congress may debate funding for passenger screening initiatives. The 9/11 Commission recommended implementing and funding passenger screening initiatives, including a human factors study to improve screener performance at checkpoints. Recent audits found deficiencies in screener performance during covert testing. The TSA has addressed poor screener performance highlighted by a recent audit through initiatives like threat image projection (TIP) and improving recurrent training for screeners. Key human factors issues include screener selection, training, fitness for duty, and human interaction. TSA is exploring ways to enhance recurrent training for screeners, focusing on human factors such as selection, training, and interaction with screening technologies. However, research and funding for aviation security human factors are lacking compared to other agencies. A comprehensive strategic plan for addressing human factors in aviation security is currently absent. There is a lack of a comprehensive strategic plan for addressing human factors in aviation security. Congress may conduct oversight to identify areas where TSA's human factors research efforts may not be adequately addressing concerns over passenger and baggage screening performance. Congress may also consider tasking an independent body with examining human factors needs in aviation security. The National Academy of Sciences did not conduct a focused study on human factors needs in aviation security since 1999. H.R. 10 includes a provision for TSA to conduct human factors studies to improve screener performance. The 9/11 Commission recommended expediting installation of baggage screening systems. Congress may debate current funding for this activity. The 9/11 Commission recommended expediting installation of baggage screening systems, with Congress potentially debating current funding adequacy. Vision 100 authorizes up to $500 million annually for aviation security capital fund, but only $250 million was appropriated in FY2004 and requested in FY2005. Integration of EDS equipment at all passenger airports, estimated to cost over $4 billion, may take several years given current funding levels. TSA issued Letters of Intent to airports to leverage limited federal funding. The TSA issued Letters of Intent (LOIs) to airports to leverage limited federal funding for integrating EDS systems. However, the TSA has been reimbursing airports for expenses as they are incurred, potentially slowing down the progress of EDS integration. The 9/11 Commission recommended that the aviation industry should contribute to the costs of deploying in-line EDS systems. The 9/11 Commission recommended that the aviation industry should contribute to the costs of deploying in-line EDS systems at airports. Airlines and airports currently share the costs, with large and medium-sized airports contributing 10% and small airports contributing 5%. The TSA has proposed to increase the local share of costs for EDS integration at airports, with large and medium-sized airports facing a 25% contribution and small airports facing a 10% contribution. The 9/11 Commission suggested that the aviation industry is not paying its fair share under the current scheme, leading to debates in Congress over the equity of cost-sharing. The House homeland security appropriations bill included language to limit federal share for airport security projects, but it was removed during debate. Legislation introduced in the House seeks to double the amount collected in aviation security fees for aviation security capital fund. The House homeland security appropriations bill sought to increase aviation security fees for the aviation security capital fund from $250 million to $500 million annually for FY2005 through FY2007. H.R. 5121 also aimed to enhance TSA's flexibility in meeting checked baggage security screening requirements by allowing multi-year contracts for EDS imaging capabilities. These provisions were not included in H.R. 10, despite the 9/11 Commission's recommendation for improved cargo screening by TSA. The 9/11 Commission recommended that TSA intensify efforts to identify suspicious cargo and screen potentially dangerous cargo in aviation and maritime operations. TSA unveiled a strategic plan for cargo security in November 2003, focusing on enhancing shipper security, pre-screening elevated risk cargo, using technology for targeted air cargo inspections, and securing cargo. The TSA strategic plan for cargo security includes goals such as pre-screening all cargo shipments, inspecting items considered high risk, deploying new technology solutions, and implementing enhanced security measures for all-cargo aircraft. The plan aligns with the 9/11 Commission recommendations to improve cargo security in aviation and maritime operations. The 9/11 Commission recommendations support TSA's strategic plan for cargo security, but urge faster progress. Congress may scrutinize TSA's efforts on cargo security and debate approaches. Recent focus in Congress has been on the level of physical screening needed for air cargo security. Recent debate in Congress over air cargo security has focused on the level of physical screening or inspection of cargo needed to mitigate risks. Proposals have been made for 100% screening, but Congress supports a risk-based approach using the known-shipper program. Both H.R. 10 and S. 2845 aim to enhance cargo screening and tracking, with S. 2845 specifically requiring TSA to double efforts in this area. The debate in Congress over air cargo security focuses on improving screening and tracking measures. S. 2845 would require TSA to double air cargo screening within a year. The 9/11 Commission recommended deploying hardened cargo containers on passenger aircraft carrying suspicious cargo. The National Research Council estimated it would cost $125 million to acquire enough containers. The debate over air cargo security in Congress focuses on improving screening and tracking measures. The National Research Council estimated it would cost $125 million to acquire enough hardened cargo containers, with an annual industry-wide cost of $11 million in lost revenue. Passenger airlines may oppose federally funding this initiative due to increased operational costs. Opponents argue that improved identification, tracking, and screening of cargo may negate the need for hardened containers. Initiatives to improve cargo identification, tracking, and screening may eliminate the need for hardened cargo containers. However, proponents argue that deploying hardened containers adds an extra layer of defense. Yet, relying on just one hardened container per aircraft leaves the system vulnerable to risks tied to cargo assessments and suspicious items. TSA currently mandates screening of all cargo. The TSA requires all cargo from unvetted shippers to be carried on all-cargo airplanes, not passenger planes. There are challenges in detecting high-risk cargo and allowing suspect cargo on passenger planes. The criteria for permitting suspicious cargo on passenger aircraft is unclear. The policy debate revolves around allowing suspicious cargo on passenger aircraft in hardened cargo containers. H.R. 10 includes a provision for a TSA pilot program to assess this approach. The policy debate focuses on allowing cargo on passenger aircraft in blast-resistant containers. H.R. 10 proposes a TSA pilot program for this, while S. 2845 and S. 165 also address evaluating blast-resistant cargo container technology. The 9/11 Commission recommends establishing risk-based priorities for protecting transportation assets. The 9/11 Commission recommended establishing risk-based priorities for protecting all transportation assets, including selecting practical and cost-effective approaches for defense implementation. This plan should assign roles to federal, state, and local authorities, as well as private stakeholders. The risk-based approach to aviation security is a key policy tool for allocating limited resources. While the TSA initially focused on meeting ATSA mandates post-9/11, there is a need for a unified strategic plan for aviation security to enhance national policy. TSA has achieved normal operations and can now focus on developing a formal strategy for national aviation security policy, likely based on a risk-based multi-layered approach. Congress may consider tasking TSA with creating a national strategy that addresses funding, budget, and roles of authorities. The TSA is being tasked with developing a national strategy for aviation security that includes funding needs, budget implications, and roles of authorities and stakeholders. Challenges persist in defining roles and allocating resources for state, local, and industry involvement in aviation security. At airports, local jurisdictions and airport operators have shared responsibilities in defining roles and allocating resources for security. TSA maintains oversight and enforcement, while local governments and state authorities provide law enforcement support and presence at screening checkpoints for aviation security. Passenger air carriers also play a role in security measures. Aviation security involves law enforcement support at airports and screening checkpoints. Passenger air carriers participate in security procedures and training. In air cargo and general aviation, aircraft owners and operators play a direct role in security measures. The federal government oversees and enforces aviation security requirements. The current system involves federal, state, local, and industry participation, but lacks a unified approach. The current aviation security system involves federal, state, local, and industry participation but lacks a unified plan or strategy for assigning roles and missions to stakeholders. Congress and the TSA may consider ways to improve strategic planning, resource allocation, and integration of resources for aviation security. H.R. 10 requires the Department of Homeland Security to prepare and update a transportation security plan, including a specific plan for aviation security, to prioritize risks and implement cost-effective protection methods for aviation assets. The 9/11 Commission report led to increased attention from Congress on transportation security recommendations. Hearings were held by the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation and the House Subcommittee on Aviation to review these recommendations. The House Subcommittee on Aviation reviewed aviation security recommendations from the 9/11 Commission. The 108th Congress passed legislation related to aviation security, including the Vision 100 - Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act and the National Intelligence Reform Act in response to the Commission's recommendations. The Vision 100 - Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act, enacted in response to the 9/11 Commission's recommendations, established a redress process for aviation professionals and required justification for Air Defense Identification Zones. Vision 100 established an Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) around cities for security purposes. It also modified security training requirements for airline crews and mandated a study on the effectiveness of the aviation security system. Vision 100 mandated a study on the effectiveness of the aviation security system, including air marshal program, cockpit door security, and passenger screening. It also created the Aviation Security Capital Fund with annual appropriations of up to $500 million through FY2007. The fund receives the first $250 million in aviation security fee collections each year. The Aviation Security Capital Fund, established by Vision 100, receives up to $500 million annually through FY2007. The fund is used for aviation security-related capital improvement projects, with the first $250 million in aviation security fee collections deposited each year. The Undersecretary for Border and Transportation Security has the authority to issue grants for projects such as integrating baggage explosive detection systems and reconfiguring terminal baggage areas. Vision 100 established the Aviation Security Capital Fund, allocating federal share of costs for security projects at airports. It also required security programs for air charter operators and GAO review of the CAPPS II passenger prescreening system. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reviewed the proposed CAPPS II passenger prescreening system, leading to the TSA scrapping the program. They are now developing an alternative system called \"Secure Flight.\" Vision 100 also authorized armed pilots to guard aircraft cockpits. Vision 100 authorized armed pilots to guard aircraft cockpits and expanded the Federal Flight Deck Officer Program to include other flight crew members. It also requires regulations for the security of foreign and domestic aircraft repair stations, along with security reviews of foreign repair stations by the TSA and FAA. Vision 100 legislation transferred background check duties for foreign pilots to DHS, requiring notification and identification for training in smaller aircraft. Fee collections authorized to offset costs. See CRS for more details. The National Intelligence Reform Act (P.L. 108-458) includes provisions for aviation security, addressing concerns from the 9/11 Commission. It mandates the Department of Homeland Security to develop a National Strategy for Transportation Security and modal-specific security plans, including aviation security. The National Intelligence Reform Act mandates the Department of Homeland Security to develop a National Strategy for Transportation Security and modal-specific security plans, including aviation security.

It allocates funds for research, development, and deployment of technologies to enhance air cargo screening, with a grant program for advanced air cargo security technology. TSA must issue final regulations for cargo security, and DHS, in coordination with DoD and FAA, must report on threats from international cargo shipments. The Department of Homeland Security is directed to research, develop, and procure systems to inspect and screen air cargo on passenger aircraft to enhance security measures. The goal is to triple the percentage of cargo inspected on passenger flights. The 108th Congress addressed many aviation security concerns, including general aviation and air cargo security. The goal is to triple the percentage of cargo inspected on passenger flights to enhance security measures. During the 108th Congress, legislation focused on general aviation security, including airport and airspace restrictions. Vision 100 required the DHS to develop a security plan for general aviation flights at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. The 108th Congress focused on general aviation security, with Vision 100 requiring the DHS to develop a security plan for general aviation flights at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. Legislation regarding general aviation security was not as comprehensive as other aviation security measures, leading to concerns about the risk posed by corporate jets and private planes. Temporary flight restrictions over stadiums during major outdoor sports events were made permanent. Some concerns have been raised about the risk posed by general aviation corporate jets, private planes, and helicopters following a recent assessment by the FBI and DHS. Comprehensive legislation on air cargo security and oversight, as well as the known-shipper program, were not adequately addressed during the 108th Congress. Measures passed by the Senate were removed from the final version of the National Intelligence Reform Bill of 2004. In the 108th Congress, comprehensive measures on air cargo security and oversight were removed from the final version of the National Intelligence Reform Bill of 2004. The TSA was directed to address these issues through regulatory proposals, reflecting the intent of the proposed legislation. The 109th Congress may focus on overseeing the implementation of TSA's air cargo security rules and strategic plan. The 109th Congress may focus on overseeing the TSA's implementation of air cargo security rules and strategic plan to ensure desired objectives are met."
