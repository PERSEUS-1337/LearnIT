    "title": "SB 1073",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 17052 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to allow an earned income tax credit against the \"net tax\" for taxable years starting January 1, 2015. The credit amount is determined based on Section 32 of the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted by a factor for the taxable year. The earned income tax credit adjustment factor for taxable years starting January 1, 2015, is 0 percent unless specified in the Budget Act. The credit is only available when resources are allocated in the Budget Act for oversight and audits by the Franchise Tax Board. The credit percentage and phaseout percentage are determined based on the number of qualifying children. The earned income tax credit percentages and phaseout percentages vary based on the number of qualifying children. The earned income amount and phaseout amount for eligible individuals are also determined based on the number of qualifying children. Joint returns are not subject to a specific section of the Internal Revenue Code. The earned income tax credit amounts vary based on the number of qualifying children. Certain sections of the Internal Revenue Code are modified for eligibility in this state. Section 32 of the Internal Revenue Code is modified for eligibility in this state, including adjustments to income thresholds and inflation recalculations starting in 2016. The excess credit under this section can be used to offset other amounts due and any remaining balance will be refunded to the taxpayer. The Franchise Tax Board has the authority to establish necessary rules and procedures for implementing this section. Amounts refunded under this section will be treated like federal earned income refunds for determining eligibility for benefits under the Welfare and Institutions Code. The Franchise Tax Board is exempt from certain requirements for implementing the credit for the 2015 taxable year. The Franchise Tax Board must comply with various requirements outlined in Statewide Information Management Manual Section 30, the 2015 Budget Act, and the Public Contract Code. They are also required to include the scope, costs, and schedule changes related to the implementation of a credit in their next Special Project Report for the Enterprise Data to Revenue Project. The California Earned Income Tax Credit aims to reduce poverty among working families and individuals. The Franchise Tax Board must annually report on the number of tax returns claiming the credit, individuals represented, average credit amount, and distribution of credits by dependents and income ranges. The distribution of California Earned Income Tax Credit by number of dependents and income ranges is reported annually. Data includes estimates of families lifted out of deep poverty by the credit and combination with federal tax credit for families below 50% of the federal poverty threshold. The Franchise Tax Board will provide a written report to various Senate and Assembly committees regarding the California Earned Income Tax Credit. The tax credit will apply to taxable years starting from January 1, 2016."
