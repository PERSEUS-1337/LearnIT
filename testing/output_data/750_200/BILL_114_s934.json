    "content": "The \"Phantom Fuel Reform Act\" may be cited as the official title. It includes a requirement for cellulosic biofuel. The \"Phantom Fuel Reform Act\" requires the provision of estimates for volumes of cellulosic biofuel under the Clean Air Act. The \"Phantom Fuel Reform Act\" mandates the Energy Information Administration to provide estimates of cellulosic biofuel production for the upcoming year. The Energy Information Administration provides estimates of cellulosic biofuel production for the current calendar year. The Energy Information Administration estimates cellulosic biofuel production for the current year, determining the average monthly volume produced by each facility. The Energy Information Administration estimates cellulosic biofuel production for the current year by determining the annualized volume of production for each facility based on average monthly production. The Energy Information Administration estimates cellulosic biofuel production for the current year based on the production volume of each facility starting production after January 1. The Energy Information Administration estimates cellulosic biofuel production by determining the average monthly volume produced by each facility starting production after January 1. The curr_chunk is about the period of production of cellulosic biofuel by a facility, starting from the date of initial production and ending on October 31 of the current calendar year. The estimated annual volume of cellulosic biofuel production for a facility is determined based on the average monthly production volume for the current calendar year. Total production estimate for the following calendar year of cellulosic biofuel production is based on the projected volume from all facilities described in the clause. The Clean Air Act is amended to specify the exact volume of cellulosic biofuel production for the current year, removing the option for a lesser volume. The Clean Air Act is amended to define cellulosic biofuel as excluding compressed natural gas, liquefied natural gas, or electricity for electric vehicles. The Clean Air Act amendment excludes compressed natural gas, liquefied natural gas, or electricity for electric vehicles from the definition of cellulosic biofuel. The Clean Air Act amendment excludes certain fuels from the definition of cellulosic biofuel, including compressed natural gas, liquefied natural gas, and electricity for electric vehicles. Additionally, regulations regarding cellulosic and advanced fuel pathways are addressed in the final rule of the Environmental Protection Agency. The Clean Air Act amendment excludes specific fuels from the cellulosic biofuel definition. The EPA must reissue a rule to align with the amendments. The mandate for cellulosic biofuel volume in 2014 is removed."
