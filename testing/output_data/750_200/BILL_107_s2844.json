The No Child Left Behind Act requires States to recruit qualified teachers by 2006, but schools in rural and high-poverty areas struggle to attract and retain teachers. Rural education is crucial for overall education performance. The Trust 2000 report emphasizes the importance of rural education in 25 States for overall education performance. High poverty schools face challenges in teacher certification, requiring special assistance to meet the goals of the No Child Left Behind Act. The National Board for Professional Teaching Standards was established in 1987. The National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, founded in 1987, aims to establish high standards for accomplished teachers.

Teacher salaries have stagnated over the past decade, with 2/3 of states not meeting the national average of $40,582. The purposes of the Act include encouraging teachers to work in rural or high-poverty schools through a refundable tax credit and providing an additional tax credit for National Board certification.
