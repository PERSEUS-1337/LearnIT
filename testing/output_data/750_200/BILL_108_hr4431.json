    "content": "The Act may be cited as \"One Church, One Child Act of 2004\". It includes findings related to the Act. The Congress finds that many States are experiencing shortages of qualified foster and adoptive parents. A 2002 report highlighted a 68% increase in children in foster care from 1984 to 1995, while the number of foster parents decreased by 4%. Additionally, in 2001, only 50,000 children were adopted from foster care, leaving 126,000 children awaiting adoption. Since 2001, 50,000 children were adopted from foster care, with 126,000 still awaiting adoption after an average of 44 months in foster care. The increase in adoptions since 1997 has led to a greater need for post-adoption services and skilled providers. One Church, One Child is a national faith-based organization. One Church, One Child is a national foster care and adoption ministry founded in Chicago in 1980 by Father George Clements. Their mission is to provide services for at-risk children and support adoptive, foster, and kinship families, having successfully placed over 140,000 children in adoptive families nationwide. One Church, One Child programs have placed over 140,000 children in adoptive families nationwide. Despite their success, these programs have received limited federal funding. A federally-funded grant program to support similar recruitment and support services for foster and adoptive parents modeled on this concept would be beneficial. Recruitment of foster and adoptive parents based on the One Church, One Child concept will increase the pool of qualified parents for abused and neglected children. SEC. 479B.
