    "content": "Human history began in Africa, with human ancestors evolving into homosapiens around 200,000 years ago. Small bands of modern humans migrated out of Africa 50,000 to 100,000 years ago, becoming ancestors of all human populations. The Bantu people of West Africa started expanding their settlement area 2,500-5,000 years ago from a base in present-day Nigeria or Cameroon. The Bantu people of West Africa expanded their settlement area 2,500-5,000 years ago from a base in present-day Nigeria or Cameroon, eventually becoming the predominant people in sub-Saharan Africa. Nilo-Saharan languages are found in the Sahel grasslands and parts of eastern Africa, with origins possibly in the Nile valley. The term \"Nilotic\" is no longer favored by scholars due to intermingling with Bantu speakers over the centuries. The Bantu people in southern Africa were skilled in iron smelting by 500 BC, leading to successful agriculture. When Europeans explored Africa after 1450 AD, they found a variety of crops grown by farmers. The region was inhabited by the \"Khoisan\" or \"San\" people due to the unsuitability of Bantu tropical agriculture for the Mediterranean climate. After Europeans explored the African coast post-1450 AD, they discovered farmers growing a variety of crops, including bananas and grains. Some crops had been introduced through contacts with the Indian Ocean region and southeast Asia. African farmers also raised cattle, except in wetter central areas due to the tsetse fly. With the discovery of America, they quickly adopted New World crops like maize and peanuts. By 1500, an estimated 47 million Africans lived in farming communities across the continent. By 1500, an estimated 47 million Africans lived in farming communities across the continent, with some living pastoral lives in dry regions like Kenya's Rift Valley. Large towns and cities had not developed in Africa due to disease-causing organisms, unlike populations outside Africa. Loyalties to large ethnic groups were common among Africans. Outside Africa, large cities were easier to build as they had largely escaped diseases. Historians believe that pre-colonial Africa did not have strong loyalties to large ethnic groups like \"the Yoruba\" or \"the Tutsi\" as seen today. Similar languages and cultural practices were widespread, but African loyalties were mainly tied to extended families and clans. Africans had loyalties to extended families, clans, and patron-client relationships, rather than large ethnic groups. Powerful chiefs emerged, consolidating authority through conquest and alliances to form African kingdoms like the Kongo kingdom. Successful chiefs in pre-colonial African kingdoms consolidated their authority through conquest and alliances. The Kongo kingdom, located south of the Congo River estuary, was ruled by a powerful king who governed several provinces through royal relatives. These kingdoms also showcased great artistic achievements, such as naturalistic bronze castings in Benin and stylized Congolese masks that inspired modern artists like Picasso. The Atlantic slave trade is believed to have started in 1441, lasting for 400 years and resulting in the capture and transportation of around 10 million individuals. The transatlantic slave trade began in 1441 when a man and a woman were captured in Western Sahara and taken to Portugal. Over the next 400 years, between 10 to 13 million people were taken from Africa, with most going to Brazil and the Caribbean. The peak of the trade occurred in the eighteenth century, with annual totals reaching 100,000 in some years. Additionally, 3,000-4,000 individuals were also taken from East Africa in the Indian Ocean slave trade. In 1807, the trade was abolished. In the late 18th century, annual totals of the transatlantic slave trade reached 100,000 in some years. The British parliament voted to end the slave trade in 1807, leading to the Royal Navy intercepting over 1,600 ships and freeing more than 160,000 captives. Despite these efforts, many ships evaded patrols, and slavery continued until its abolition in the Americas in the 1850s and 1860s. The US banned participation in the slave trade in 1807 and enforced it further in 1819. The Atlantic slave trade in the 1850s and 1860s involved European traders purchasing slaves from African owners using various goods. Slavery in Africa was a common practice, where people captured in wars or criminals were enslaved. Slavery in Africa was a common practice where people captured in wars, criminals, and enemies of the king were enslaved. Some slaves in the Atlantic slave trade were kidnap victims. Historians debate the effects of the slave trade on African societies, but it was associated with turmoil. The slave trade in Africa led to turmoil, war, and instability as European guns exchanged for slaves fueled conflicts and incentivized capturing more individuals. This warfare, loss of productive individuals, and psychological damage weakened Africa, making it vulnerable to European colonization. The slave trade in Africa caused turmoil, war, and instability, leading to psychological damage and weakened nations. By 1870, European powers began partitioning Africa, despite the belief that indigenous political entities would consolidate and develop into nation-states. For example, the kingdom of Ashanti in West Africa had a strong central government, advanced infrastructure, and a national language. Ashanti (Asante) and Buganda were powerful African kingdoms with strong central governments, advanced infrastructure, and growing trade. Secondary empires, relying on European military technology, were also emerging, promoting the spread of Islam in sub-Saharan Africa. In the nineteenth century, Islam spread rapidly in sub-Saharan Africa through holy wars or jihads, leading to the creation of a vast West African Islamic empire centered on Sokoto, Nigeria. In East Africa, the sultans of Zanzibar were also extending their power. Koranic schools introduced Arabic literacy across the Sahel to associate with the wider Islamic world. In West Africa, a series of holy wars led to the creation of a vast Islamic empire centered on Sokoto, Nigeria. In East Africa, the sultans of Zanzibar extended their power on the mainland, while Egypt expanded its control in northeastern Africa. The Boers, practicing a conservative form of Christianity, established a secondary empire in southern Africa. Thousands of Boers migrated inland to escape British influence, defeating the Zulu with modern tactics and establishing farms in depopulated areas. The Zulu, armed themselves, remained a significant force in the region. The Scramble for Africa halted the development of indigenous political entities. The European scramble for Africa began in the 1870s, with competition over the Niger and Congo River basins. It concluded in 1920, with British forces ending the last resistance in Somalia using combat airplanes developed during World War I. By then, all of sub-Saharan Africa, except for Ethiopia and Liberia, was under European control. Ethiopia had defeated Italian troops at Adowa in 1896, preventing it from becoming a colony. Menelik II, the Ethiopian emperor, was unable to oust the Europeans. Ethiopia thwarted Italian ambitions by defeating them at Adowa in 1896. Menelik II couldn't remove Italians from Eritrea. Italy invaded again in 1935 but was driven out by British troops in 1941-1942. European scramble for Africa was aided by medical advances and military technology. The European scramble for Africa was aided by military technology advancements, giving them significant advantages over African forces. Despite some resistance from African groups, many chose not to resist the colonial invasion due to Europe's military superiority. Many European leaders were initially hesitant to colonize Africa due to doubts about financial gains balancing the costs. However, imperialists, nationalists, anti-slavery activists, missionaries, and business interests pushed for expansion in British, French, and German territories. European powers were influenced by various factors to colonize Africa, including missionaries, business interests, and the discovery of valuable resources like diamonds and gold. Germany, for example, sought to establish a reliable source of raw cotton in Tanganyika. King Leopold was driven by the profit motive in Africa. King Leopold II of Belgium hid his profit motive in Africa under a guise of humanitarian concerns. He worked with Henry M. Stanley to build a vast empire in the Congo River basin by persuading local chiefs to sign treaties at the Berlin West Africa Conference in 1884-1885. At the Berlin West Africa Conference in 1884-1885, King Leopold II of Belgium gained recognition for his International Association of the Congo (IAC), which controlled Congo. This was supported by Britain, Germany, and U.S. President Chester Arthur to counter French influence in Africa. The conference established rules for future colonization in Africa. The Berlin conference in 1884-1885 set rules for future colonization in Africa, limiting it to the strongest powers like Britain, France, and Germany. Portugal also secured territories in Angola and Mozambique. By the First World War, Britain emerged as the dominant power in Africa with colonies stretching from southern Africa to Egypt, including the Gold Coast and Nigeria. The United States did not have colonies in Africa, but the U.S. Navy assisted the American Colonization Society in settling former slaves on the West African coast in 1820. The settlers declared independence as the Republic of Liberia in 1847 and used firearms in subsequent decades. The settlers in Liberia issued the Declaration of Independence in 1847 and used firearms to conquer indigenous peoples. This expansion has been compared to European colonization and led to violent disintegration in the late twentieth century. In 1980, indigenous soldiers killed the Americo-Liberian president, sparking a decade of political violence and a 6-year civil war. The effects of the colonial era on Africa and its peoples, like the slave trade, are debated. Leopold's rule in Congo had clearly negative consequences, with widespread abuses including forced labor, beatings, mutilations, executions, and starvation. Leopold's rule in Congo led to widespread abuses such as forced labor, beatings, mutilations, and executions. The situation became an international scandal, leading to the Belgian government removing the colony from Leopold's control in 1908. In other colonial territories, infrastructure improvements were made, but rural areas benefitted less than urban areas. Public health standards also saw some improvements. Colonial authorities provided infrastructure like roads and telephone systems, with urban areas benefiting more than rural areas. Public health standards improved, and some basic education was introduced. Christian missions supported by the colonial powers played a significant role in promoting education and literacy, leading to many conversions. Limited opportunities for higher education and employment in the modern sector empowered some Africans who later became leaders in independent Africa, such as Jomo Kenyatta and Kwame Nkrumah. After gaining limited opportunities for higher education and employment in the modern sector, African leaders like Jomo Kenyatta, Kwame Nkrumah, and Nnamdi Azikiwe studied abroad before becoming presidents of their respective countries. Colonial governments expected African colonies to be self-sufficient in terms of development, leading to heavy state involvement in the economy even after independence. After independence, many African countries continued with statist systems inherited from colonial rule, which hindered the development of market economies. Colonial economic policies also led to Africa's dependence on exporting primary products in exchange for manufactured goods, exacerbating economic challenges. Colonial governments prioritized control over promoting democracy, aiming to rule Africa with minimal expenditure. After independence, colonial governments in Africa prioritized control over promoting democracy to rule with minimal expenditure. The colonial state was authoritarian and not meant to foster democracy. Post-independence, authoritarian measures were taken, limiting political participation until the end of the colonial period when elections began. During the colonial period, Africans had limited political participation, with Britain and France working closely with local chiefs and big men to obtain labor and tax revenues. This cooperation with traditional authorities contributed to issues of corruption, nepotism, and authoritarianism in independent Africa. The colonial authorities, particularly the British, shaped Africa's present-day ethnic divisions by grouping peoples as \"tribes\" and ruling indirectly through \"tribal chiefs.\" This contributed to problems of corruption, nepotism, and authoritarianism in independent Africa. The British administratively grouped peoples as \"tribes\" and ruled indirectly through \"tribal chiefs,\" strengthening tribal loyalties. Today, these ethnic divisions fuel much of Africa's violent politics, weakening institutions and economies. Colonial partition imposed artificial boundaries, separating peoples. The colonial partition of Africa imposed artificial boundaries, weakening political institutions and economies. Roads and railroads were built to link colonial capitals to their hinterlands, creating transport difficulties between African countries that persist today. Europeans suppressed indigenous political arrangements, leading to challenges in governance. The Europeans suppressed indigenous political arrangements in Africa, leading to challenges in governance. The end of Colonialism after World War II weakened Britain and France, hastening the end of the colonial era in Africa. This denied Africa's pre-colonial political entities the opportunity to develop further, a situation referred to as the \"black man's burden\" by historian Basil Davidson. The end of Colonialism after World War II weakened Britain and France, hastening the end of the colonial era in Africa. The war aims of the western powers emphasized democracy and resistance to aggression, aligning with Africa's emerging nationalists. The United Nations Charter committed colonial powers to developing self-government and free political institutions in their territories. After World War II, colonial powers were committed to developing self-government and free political institutions in their territories. African nationalists, influenced by European intellectual currents and socialist ideas, organized opposition to colonial regimes. They were inspired by revolutionary movements in Asia and the struggle for social justice by black Americans, particularly by the work of W.E.B. DuBois. Nkrumah and other African nationalists were inspired by W.E.B. DuBois for social justice. British policymakers saw African independence in the distant future, while France aimed for assimilation of its colonies. Individual Africans could become French citizens through education. Leopold Senghor, a poet and philosopher, later became President. By the early 1950s, nationalist sentiments were rising in Africa, leading to anti-colonial protests and guerrilla uprisings. British decision-makers realized they could not afford to suppress African nationalism, and Ghana gained independence sooner than expected. In the 1950s, African countries gained independence as colonial powers like Britain and France realized they could not afford to suppress rising nationalism. Ghana, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Kenya became independent in the early 1960s. President Charles de Gaulle was surprised when Guinea chose independence over close association with France in 1958. France eventually granted independence to 14 African countries in 1960. In 1960, France granted independence to 14 African countries, while Belgium granted independence to the Congo. In southern Africa, independence was delayed due to substantial white populations opposing majority rule, leading to armed struggles for freedom. In 1965, Rhodesia's white minority declared independence from Britain. In 1965, Rhodesia's white minority declared independence from Britain, leading to UN sanctions and a civil war. Zimbabwe gained independence in 1980 under a majority-elected government. Guerrilla wars also occurred in Angola, Mozambique, and Namibia before gaining independence in the 1970s. In 1974, dictator Antonio Salazar was ousted in a coup in Lisbon. Namibia gained independence in 1990 after armed struggle against South Africa. In 1948, the National Party came to power in South Africa and implemented apartheid, sparking protests. In the late 1960s, protests against apartheid in South Africa escalated, leading to a violent resistance campaign in the 1970s. The government responded with harsh repression, and in the 1980s, military strikes and covert operations were launched against the opposition. By the end of the decade, the white-controlled government faced international isolation, prompting Afrikaner leaders to realize the unsustainable costs of defending apartheid. In the late 1960s, protests against apartheid in South Africa escalated, leading to a violent resistance campaign in the 1970s. By the end of the decade, the white-controlled government faced international isolation, prompting Afrikaner leaders to realize the unsustainable costs of defending apartheid. Secret discussions with the ANC led to constitutional negotiations and universal-suffrage elections in 1994, with Nelson Mandela becoming President. In April 1994, Nelson Mandela became President after the end of apartheid in South Africa. In the early 1960s, Africa saw a promising future with new leadership and economic growth expectations. The Organization of African Unity was established in May 1963 to promote solidarity and development efforts in the continent. In May 1963, 30 African states signed the Charter of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) to promote solidarity and improve living standards. However, early problems emerged with civil war in the former Belgian Congo and political instability in Togo. In the 1960s and 1970s, political instability and military coups plagued many African countries, including Togo, Ghana, and Nigeria. Ethnic tensions in Nigeria led to a civil war that lasted until 1970. Economic growth in sub-Saharan Africa declined significantly during this period, with many countries being governed by authoritarian regimes. In the 1970s and 1980s, African countries faced political instability and civil wars under authoritarian regimes. Drought in 1982-1984 exacerbated the situation, leading to high death tolls in war-torn countries like Ethiopia and Sudan. The impact of colonialism on Africa's post-independence era has led to ethnic divisions, authoritarian rule, and economic interference. Limited access to education for indigenous elites and a growing population challenge were also key issues faced by independent Africa. Independent Africa faced challenges of independence with small indigenous elites. The population in sub-Saharan Africa grew from 200 million in 1950 to 600 million in 1990. The Cold War fueled conflicts in Africa with arms from the Soviet Union and Marxist regimes receiving support. The United States provided less weapons but focused on authoritarian regimes in Zaire, Sudan, and Liberia. During the Cold War, the United States provided economic assistance to authoritarian regimes in Zaire, Sudan, and Liberia, perceived as anti-Soviet. This competitive involvement strengthened anti-democratic governments with inefficient economic policies and corruption. France's active engagement in Africa aimed to maintain great power status. France's active engagement in Africa aimed to maintain great power status by cultivating special relationships with former colonies, providing military and economic assistance, and promising intervention to protect them. France's special relationships with former colonies in Africa brought military and economic assistance, with French troops stationed at African bases. French businesses had privileged access to trade and investment opportunities. Critics argued that French policy supported corrupt regimes, while defenders claimed it promoted stability and development. France began reducing its commitments in Africa after the Socialist Party won legislative elections in May 1997. In the 1980s and 1990s, scholars focused on African state weaknesses hindering development due to corruption and weak institutions. France started reducing its African commitments after the Socialist Party's 1997 election win, but future policy direction remains unclear. Some scholars blamed weak African states for hindering societal change and economic development due to corruption and personal ambitions of leaders. Academic discussions on the \"failed state\" in Africa were prevalent, with media coverage of famine and conflict in countries like Somalia and Sudan. Despite a growth spurt in the mid-1990s, overall GDP growth from 1990 to 1998 was only 2.0%. In the early 1990s, Africa faced economic difficulties with GDP growth at 2.0% per year, lower than the population growth rate. Positive developments included the end of the Cold War and changes in South Africa, offering hope for a better future. The changes in South Africa in the early 1990s averted a violent revolution, leading to stability and potential economic growth in the sub-Saharan region. Several African countries were implementing free market reforms, with GDP growth rates exceeding population growth rates. Political reforms were also beginning in authoritarian states across Africa. In the early 1990s, African countries were experiencing economic growth with GDP rates surpassing population growth. Political reforms were underway in authoritarian states, leading to the emergence of civil society groups and multiple political parties. Elections were becoming more free and fair, garnering positive reactions from analysts. In the early 1990s, African countries were experiencing economic growth with political reforms leading to free and fair elections. However, hopes for democratization have faded as some authoritarian leaders manipulate the electoral process, creating \"pseudo-democracies.\" Some African authoritarian leaders have manipulated the electoral process to create \"pseudo-democracies,\" according to Larry Diamond. Countries like Kenya, Gabon, and Cameroon play a game of liberalizing politically under pressure while repressing to hold onto power. Richard Joseph noted in 1998 that Africa's democratic opening resulted in \"virtual democracies\" with surface characteristics of liberal democracy but lacking true democratic principles. Events in Zimbabwe and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire have been discouraging for advocates of democratization. In C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, a military coup in 1999 and exclusion of a qualified candidate from elections in 2000 led to sharp ethnic and religious divisions in the country. In Zimbabwe, the opposition made gains in parliamentary elections in June 2000, but the campaign was marred by political violence and opposition members were killed. Critics accused the government of destroying the rule of law in its campaign to take over white-owned farms. Sub-Saharan Africa's AIDS epidemic is worsening, with 25.3 million people infected with HIV in the region according to a December 2000 United Nations update. The AIDS epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa is intensifying, with 25.3 million people infected with HIV in the region. The disease disproportionately affects the region, which has 10% of the world's population but over 70% of the worldwide total of infected individuals. Uganda and Senegal have successfully slowed the spread of the disease through prevention campaigns, but the overall infection rate in Africa is 8.8%, compared to 1.1% worldwide. In some southern African countries, over 20% of the adult population is infected. The AIDS epidemic in Africa is severe, with 25.3 million infected with HIV in the region. The infection rate in Africa is 8.8%, compared to 1.1% worldwide. In some southern African countries, over 20% of adults are HIV-positive. The ongoing armed conflicts in Africa, particularly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, have worsened the situation. The ongoing armed conflicts in Africa, including in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, have led to serious refugee problems and setbacks in development. Several countries have troops in Congo, raising fears of wider war. Economic performance in Africa has been disappointing, with GDP growth below population growth rates. GDP growth in Africa was below population growth rates in 1998 and 1999, leading to economic stagnation. South Africa's economy also showed slow growth during this period. Academic authors describe sub-Saharan Africa as \"marginalized\" in the global economy. The continent's political and economic prospects are seen as dim for the next few years. The U.S. National Intelligence Council's study in 2000 predicted that Africa's political and economic prospects would be bleak in the next few years due to demographics, disease, and poor governance. Most African states were expected to miss out on global economic growth, with only a few countries faring better while others remained irrelevant to their citizens. Sub-Saharan Africa's problems were seen as compounded by ethnic and communal issues. The U.S. National Intelligence Council's study in 2000 predicted bleak political and economic prospects for Africa due to demographics, disease, and poor governance. Some African states were expected to miss out on global economic growth, while others would have little relevance to their citizens. Sub-Saharan Africa's problems were compounded by ethnic and communal tensions, leading to open conflicts and sometimes secessionist movements. However, some observers reject this Afro-pessimistic view, attributing it to stereotyped perceptions and media sensationalism. The 1998 article by Capitol Hill experts highlighted a new reality in Africa with governments becoming more accountable to citizens and economic policies empowering the private sector. Despite two decades of economic stagnation and little progress in poverty reduction, an IMF brief in 2000 acknowledged the potential for an economic renaissance in sub-Saharan Africa due to policy reforms. The IMF brief in 2000 highlighted the potential for an economic renaissance in sub-Saharan Africa due to policy reforms. President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa and then U.S. Ambassador to South Africa, James Joseph, endorsed the idea of an African Renaissance, emphasizing the positive outlook despite setbacks. The dominant political themes of the 1990s were reconciliation in conflict-torn countries like South Africa and democratization through electoral processes. Significant democratic transitions occurred in South Africa with successful universal suffrage elections in 1994 and 1999, and in Nigeria where civilian rule replaced military rule in 1999. Nigeria, with a population of over 120 million, is a key player in sub-Saharan Africa. A book sponsored by the American Assembly in 1996 and 1997 highlighted the positive developments during this period. The optimistic view on democratization in Africa is supported by the wave of elections held in 28 African countries in 1996 and 1997. Despite economic disappointments, countries like Botswana, Mozambique, Rwanda, and Uganda showed promising GDP growth rates in 1999 and 2000. This trend is seen as establishing precedents for further democratization in the region. Several African countries, including Botswana, Mozambique, Rwanda, and Uganda, had projected annual GDP growth rates of above or near 5% in 2000, following comparable performances in 1999. With economic policy reforms, improved governance, and support from the international community, many believe that other countries could also increase per capita incomes, improving opportunities and quality of life. Debt relief and support for poverty reduction programs are considered crucial. Africa's natural resources, such as oil deposits off the West African coast, minerals, tourism potential, and environmental resources, play a significant role in the continent's development. The Clinton Administration's policy towards Africa had an Afro-optimist tone, with President Clinton emphasizing democracy, peace, and prosperity during his visit to the continent in 1998. Africa's natural resources, including oil deposits and minerals, are seen as key factors in driving a brighter future for the continent. During his visit to Africa in 1998, President Clinton emphasized democracy, peace, and prosperity as essential for a new Africa. He acknowledged economic challenges and conflicts but highlighted growing economies in countries like Ghana, Mozambique, and Nigeria. Clinton praised Nigeria for its democratic transition, calling it the most significant in Africa since apartheid. President Clinton praised Nigeria for its democratic transition, cooperation in combating international crime, and leadership in regional peacekeeping. He also emphasized the importance of addressing the African HIV/AIDS epidemic and highlighted Africa's potential as a U.S. trading partner, particularly in oil imports. The U.S. Administration highlighted Africa's potential as a trading partner, focusing on increased trade and investment opportunities, especially in oil imports. They supported the African Growth and Opportunity Act and emphasized other interests in Africa such as preventing weapons proliferation and preserving environmental resources. The U.S. Administration emphasized various interests in Africa, including preventing weapons proliferation, preserving environmental resources, combating the drug trade and terrorism. They launched initiatives like the Leland Initiative to improve Africa's internet access and the Greater Horn of Africa Initiative to address food insecurity. Additionally, they initiated efforts against the HIV/AIDS epidemic through the LIFE program. The U.S. Administration launched the LIFE Initiative in July 1999 to combat the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Africa and globally. Various U.S. agencies, including the Departments of Transportation, Labor, and Commerce, as well as the Centers for Disease Control, boosted their Africa-related capabilities. Administration policy faced challenges, highlighted by the loss of 18 U.S. soldiers in October 1993. The U.S. Administration faced challenges in Africa, with 18 soldiers killed in Somalia in 1993. This led to hesitation in sending peacekeepers to Rwanda during the genocide in 1994. President Clinton admitted to not acting quickly enough. The Administration then focused on strengthening Africa's peacekeeping capabilities through ACRI. The Administration sought to strengthen Africa's peacekeeping capabilities through the Africa Crisis Response Initiative (ACRI) after the Somalia and Rwanda experiences. They also launched a program to train Nigerian battalions for peacekeeping duties in Sierra Leone. U.S. officials acted as mediators in African conflicts, with the peace agreement between Ethiopia and Eritrea being a notable success. The peace agreement between Ethiopia and Eritrea was a success signed in Algiers on December 12, 2000, attended by Secretary of State Albright. However, Africa's conflicts frustrated Administration policymakers, hindering economic growth and political reform. Trade results during the Clinton years showed slower growth in imports and exports to Africa compared to overall U.S. trade growth rates. Trade mainly focused on a few countries, particularly oil-producing nations. Exports to Africa grew at a slower rate compared to overall U.S. exports, with most trade concentrated in a few countries, particularly oil producers and South Africa. Petroleum accounted for over half of imports, while African trade made up about 1% of total U.S. trade in 1999. U.S. investment in sub-Saharan Africa, mainly in the petroleum sector, was around 1.2% of total foreign direct investment. Despite this, U.S. firms had significant investments in Africa, such as Southwestern Bell's stake in the South African telecommunications industry. Administration officials highlighted major U.S. investments in Africa, including Southwestern Bell's share in the South African telecommunications industry and Caterpillar Inc. dealerships in 15 countries. Sub-Saharan Africa gained importance in U.S. foreign policy in 1958 with the creation of a Bureau of African Affairs. Policy debates often revolved around the level of U.S. involvement in issues like apartheid, African development, and the Soviet/Cuban role. The Eisenhower Administration faced an African crisis in 1960 with the Congo rebellion, fearing Soviet exploitation. The Kennedy Administration was more supportive of African nationalists than its predecessor. During the Kennedy Administration, the United States supported African nationalists and approved funding for a controversial dam in Ghana. President Kennedy also began pressing for reforms in white regimes in southern Africa and backed a U.N.-sponsored arms embargo against South Africa in 1963. The Johnson Administration focused on providing covert aid to Congo (Zaire). During the Johnson Administration, the United States provided covert aid to suppress rebellions in Congo (Zaire) with concerns over potential communist influence. Mobutu Sese-Seko solidified his position as president with U.S. backing. Limited military assistance was given, but deeper involvement was prevented due to fears of \"another Vietnam.\" In the Nixon and Ford Administrations, focus shifted to southern Africa. During the Nixon and Ford Administrations, the Africa policy focus shifted to southern Africa, particularly Angola, Mozambique, and Rhodesia. Political controversy arose as critics accused policymakers of being too sympathetic to white minority regimes. Henry Kissinger believed the Soviet Union was pursuing a policy of \"ruthless opportunism\" and \"adventurism\" in Africa, shaping U.S. Africa policy during this period. Congress eventually banned further involvement in Angola. During the Nixon and Ford Administrations, Africa policy focused on southern Africa, particularly Angola, Mozambique, and Rhodesia. Henry Kissinger accused the Soviet Union of \"ruthless opportunism\" and \"adventurism\" in Africa, influencing U.S. policy. President Jimmy Carter's Administration emphasized human rights, pushing for majority rule in Zimbabwe and independence for Namibia, while criticizing apartheid in South Africa. Mobutu was pressured for reforms in Zaire, but Cold War considerations still constrained Africa policy. During the Carter Administration, Africa policy was influenced by Cold War considerations. The Administration did not intervene in the Liberian coup due to human rights violations and corruption in the regime. To counter Soviet and Cuban influence in sub-Saharan Africa, ties were forged with Somalia, leading to the Ogaden War in 1977-1978. During the Carter Administration, ties were established with Somalia, leading to the Ogaden War in 1977-1978. Cuba sent troops to assist Ethiopia in countering the Somali invasion, averting a crisis at the Somalia border. The Carter Administration opposed mandatory sanctions against South Africa due to Cold War concerns. Cuban troops were also involved in Angola, supporting the Marxist regime against UNITA resistance. During the Reagan Administration, there was support for covert aid to UNITA in Angola to counter Cuban presence. Chester Crocker advocated for a policy of \"linkage\" to secure Cuban withdrawal from Angola in exchange for Namibia's independence. During the Reagan Administration, Chester Crocker favored a policy of \"linkage\" to secure Cuban withdrawal from Angola in exchange for Namibia's independence. Despite facing political opposition, a 1988 regional peace agreement, negotiated under U.S. leadership, achieved the desired goals. In 1986, Congress enacted sanctions legislation over President Reagan's veto, criticizing the lack of push for political change in South Africa. The George H.W. Bush Administration focused on the Horn of Africa. The George H.W. Bush Administration focused on the Horn of Africa, where they successfully managed a peaceful transition in Ethiopia in 1991. However, Somalia faced clan violence, drought, and famine, leading to a humanitarian disaster by 1992. In response, Bush sent U.S. troops to launch a multi-national effort before leaving office. In 1992, clan violence, drought, and famine in Somalia led to a humanitarian disaster. Before leaving office, Bush sent U.S. troops for a multi-national humanitarian intervention, credited with saving thousands despite American losses in 1993. The Bush Administration also pushed for reforms in Africa to promote democracy and economic liberalization. Congress addressed various African issues, including the African Growth and Opportunity Act in 2000. In recent decades, Congress has addressed various issues related to Africa. In 2000, the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) was enacted to boost U.S. trade and investment with Africa. Additionally, the Global AIDS and Tuberculosis Relief Act of 2000 authorized $300 million for HIV/AIDS efforts worldwide. In 1998, Congress passed the Africa: Seeds of Hope Act. In 1998, Congress enacted the Africa: Seeds of Hope Act (P.L. 105-385) to promote African food security through U.S. assistance programs. In 1994, the African Conflict Resolution Act (P.L. 103-381) was enacted to promote peaceful resolution of African conflicts. In 1993, the South African Democratic Transition Support Act (P.L. 103-149) committed the U.S. to supporting democracy in South Africa. In 1990, Congress created the Development Fund for Africa (DFA).
