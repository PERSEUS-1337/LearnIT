The United States Fish and Wildlife Service manages the James Campbell National Wildlife Refuge to promote the recovery of 4 endangered Hawaiian waterbirds on 240 acres of wetland habitat. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service purchased land from the estate of James Campbell to protect endangered species habitat and improve Refuge management. They also identified 800 acres of additional wildlife habitat adjacent to the Refuge owned by the estate. The land on the Kahuku Coast features coastal dunes, wetlands, and coastal strand. The land on the Kahuku Coast, purchased from the estate of James Campbell, features coastal dunes, wetlands, and coastal strand that support a variety of threatened and endangered species, including Hawaiian waterbirds, migratory shorebirds, waterfowl, seabirds, native plant species, monk seals, and green sea turtles. These habitats are increasingly rare on the Hawaiian islands due to extensive coastal development. Expanding the Refuge on the Kahuku Coast will provide more opportunities for wildlife-dependent public uses like observation, photography, and education. Acquiring the described land will create a large, ecologically-intact unit with buffer land to reduce impacts and prevent flood damage. Expanding the Refuge on the Kahuku Coast will create a large, ecologically-intact unit with buffer land to reduce impacts and prevent flood damage in the town of Kahuku. The Act defines key terms such as Director, Refuge, and Secretary. The Refuge will be expanded on the Kahuku Coast to create a large, ecologically-intact unit with buffer land to reduce impacts and prevent flood damage in Kahuku. The James Campbell National Wildlife Refuge is expanded by approximately 1,100 acres to achieve conservation goals and facilitate property acquisition. The Secretary has the authority to make minor boundary modifications as needed. The map depicting the expansion is available for reference. The map showing the expansion of the James Campbell National Wildlife Refuge is available for inspection at a designated office of the US Fish and Wildlife Service. The Secretary will also publish a notice in the Federal Register and local publications about the map's availability. The Secretary may acquire land and water for the Refuge as described in section 4(a), to be administered according to applicable law. Sums necessary for this Act are authorized to be appropriated."
