    "content": "Since the 1930s, federal job training and employment programs have aimed to connect vulnerable youth to work and school. These young people are typically low-income with barriers to employment, such as dropping out of school or being in foster care. The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 provides job training and services for unemployed individuals, including youth. The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 authorizes job training programs for adults, youth, and dislocated workers, as well as adult education, employment services, and vocational rehabilitation. Youth job training programs under Title I include WIA Youth Activities, Job Corps, and YouthBuild. The federal job training system for youth aims to provide opportunities for vulnerable youth to connect to work and school. The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 authorizes job training programs for adults, youth, and dislocated workers. WIA Youth Activities, Job Corps, and YouthBuild are part of the federal job training system for youth, aiming to connect them to educational and employment opportunities. WIA programs continue to be funded through annual appropriation acts, with potential reauthorization in the 112th Congress. This report provides an overview of issues pertinent to WIA youth programs and discusses relevant provisions of H.R. 803. This report discusses issues related to WIA youth programs, including Youth Activities and Job Corps. It also covers provisions of two bills: H.R. 803 and Workforce Investment Act of 2013 (S. 1356). Job training and employment services for youth under WIA include WIA Youth Activities and Job Corps. The Workforce Investment Act (WIA) includes various programs such as WIA Youth Activities, Job Corps, YouthBuild, Reintegration of Ex-Offenders, and Youth Opportunity Grants (YOG) that provide job training and employment services for youth. Youth Opportunity Grants (YOG) is a program funded through FY2003 that created centers in low-income communities for youth to receive employment and other services. WIA's authorization expired in FY2003, but Congress continues to appropriate funds for youth job training programs, except for the YOG program. Job Corps is administered separately by ETA's Office of Job Corps. The Job Corps program, administered by DOL's Employment and Training Administration, connects low-income youth to educational and employment opportunities. YouthBuild is for high school dropouts, while the Reintegration of Ex-Offenders program focuses on youth offenders and those at risk of dropping out. The YouthBuild program is for high school dropouts and focuses on youth offenders and those at risk of dropping out. It provides employment and educational services related to housing and construction work. Job Corps is the only program that offers residential services. The programs provide employment and educational services related to housing and construction work. Job Corps offers residential services for youth. The Reintegration of Ex-Offenders program includes mentoring, educational services, and reentry services for youth returning from secure facilities. Funding for Youth Activities is allocated by DOL to states based on a formula. The Department of Labor allocates funding for Youth Activities to states based on a formula, which is then distributed to local Workforce Investment Boards. DOL partners with nonprofit and for-profit organizations to operate Job Corps centers and cooperates with the USDA Forest Service for Job Corps programs on USDA lands. YouthBuild and the Reintegration of Ex-Offenders program award grants to nonprofit organizations and local communities. Congress is working on reauthorizing the Workforce Investment Act. For more information on these programs, refer to CRS Report R40929, Vulnerable Youth: Employment and Job Training Programs. During the 111th Congress, the Senate HELP Committee held listening sessions to address positive aspects of the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) and potential reauthorization legislation. One session focused on the Youth Activities grant program, where youth advocates and stakeholders discussed program improvements. During the 112th Congress, hearings were held to discuss updating the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) to meet the needs of a changing economy and address declining youth employment. The House Education and Workforce Subcommittee focused on removing inefficiencies in the program. During the 112th Congress, hearings were held to update the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) to address declining youth employment. The House Education and Workforce Subcommittee focused on removing inefficiencies in job training programs and modernizing WIA. The full committee held a hearing on a bill to reauthorize WIA, the Workforce Investment Improvement Act of 2012 (H.R. 4297), on April 17, 2012. The Senate HELP Committee also released discussion drafts in June 2011 but did not take further action in that Congress. The Senate HELP Committee released discussion drafts in June 2011 to amend and reauthorize WIA, but it did not progress further. In the 113th Congress, the House Committee on Education and the Workforce ordered reported H.R. 803 - the SKILLS Act. The bill was introduced by Representative Virginia Foxx on February 25, 2013, and was passed by the House on March 6, 2013. The Workforce Investment Act of 2013 (S. 1356) was introduced in the Senate by Senators Patty Murray, Lamar Alexander, Tom Harkin, and Johnny Isakson on July 24, 2013. The Senate HELP Committee ordered the bill reported by a vote of 18 to 3 on July 31, 2013. Issues raised during the WIA reauthorization process include proposals to consolidate workforce programs for adults. Some policy makers propose consolidating workforce programs for adults, dislocated workers, and youth to increase efficiency and reduce costs. However, concerns exist that at-risk youth and other vulnerable groups may be overlooked if programs are collectively funded. Congress may need to consider the role of one-stop centers and oversight bodies in this consolidation. The workforce programs were collectively funded, and there are concerns about the lack of coordination between the workforce system and other systems serving youth. Stakeholders suggest greater coordination to meet the varied needs of youth as intended by WIA. Congress and others are questioning the effectiveness of youth workforce programs, with only an impact evaluation of Job Corps completed to date. The effectiveness of youth workforce programs in meeting objectives and serving at-risk youth is being evaluated. An impact evaluation of Job Corps has been completed, and a contract was awarded to evaluate YouthBuild. Congress is interested in issues specific to Youth Activities and Job Corps, including eligibility requirements for needy youth. The eligibility requirements for youth programs may exclude some needy individuals, with challenges in proving income. There is debate on whether older youth, ages 22-24, should be targeted by the program. The Youth Activities program under WIA may consider targeting older youth aged 22-24, with stakeholders raising concerns about the school status and eligibility criteria for the program. Congress has debated funding for Job Corps centers and the possibility of closing them. The Job Corps program has faced debates in Congress regarding federal funding and the potential closure of centers due to mixed performance outcomes. A 2011 report by the Government Accountability Office highlighted overlapping services in federal workforce programs, noting differences in the populations served. The Government Accountability Office report highlighted differences in populations served by workforce programs, recommending consolidation of selected programs. Past legislation has aimed to consolidate certain workforce programs. Legislation in the 113th Congress aims to consolidate multiple workforce programs, including those for youth, into a single Workforce Investment Fund (WIF) allocated to states and local areas for employment and training. The 113th Congress aims to consolidate various workforce programs into a single Workforce Investment Fund (WIF) allocated to states and local areas for employment and training activities. This includes providing work-ready services in the one-stop delivery system, such as assessment of skills, job search assistance, career planning, case management, internship, and work experience. The Workforce Investment Fund (WIF) aims to consolidate workforce programs and provide work-ready services at one-stop centers. Funding allocation to states is based on factors like the number of disadvantaged youth. States must set aside funding for a competitive grant program for individuals with barriers to employment, including youth. The Workforce Investment Fund (WIF) aims to consolidate workforce programs and provide work-ready services at one-stop centers. States must set aside funding for a competitive grant program for individuals with barriers to employment, including youth aged 16 or older from low-income families. Grants can be awarded to local boards or nonprofits to provide employment and training services. State and local workforce investment boards must outline strategies to assist at-risk and out-of-school youth in acquiring education, skills, and credentials. The bill aims to assist at-risk youth and out-of-school youth in acquiring education, skills, credentials, and employment experience for success in the labor market. It includes dropout recovery activities, remediation of academic skills, work readiness training, and work experience. The bill aims to assist at-risk youth ages 16-24 who are low-income and high school dropouts, in foster care, offenders, with disabilities, children of incarcerated parents, or migrant youth. Chairman Kline stated that consolidating workforce programs would eliminate duplicative and ineffective programs while ensuring accountability. Some concerns have been raised about the proposed WIF potentially serving fewer youth. The proposed WIF aims to assist at-risk youth ages 16-24 through various programs. Concerns have been raised about potential funding limitations for youth programs under the bill. S. 1356 would maintain existing youth programs and establish Youth Innovation and Replication Grants for states and localities to improve education and career pathways. The Youth Innovation and Replication Grants (YIRG) would provide competitive grants to states and localities to develop strategies to improve education and employment outcomes for youth. One-stop centers play a role in connecting youth to job training and other services, even if they are ineligible for certain programs. One-stop centers offer services to youth through various methods like recruitment, staff placement, training, and facility improvements. However, some areas struggle to attract youth to these centers. Some local areas face challenges attracting youth to one-stop centers, with youth typically not coming in unless referred by schools or service providers. Recommendations include catering more to youth, training service professionals on youth matters, and providing funding to enhance youth connections to the centers. The Department of Labor provides guidance to local areas on enhancing access for youth at one-stop centers, including co-locating youth program staff, customizing centers to be more \"youth-friendly,\" and coordinating outreach efforts. Proposed legislation would require states to address youth access in workforce development programs. The proposed legislation aims to make workforce development centers more \"youth-friendly\" by establishing separate satellite centers for youth. The bills require states to continue funding one-stop centers for job search assistance, but do not specify how youth will be served. The role of youth councils in developing workforce plans for eligible youth is also being considered. The National Youth Employment Coalition (NYEC) has documented challenges faced by youth councils in developing beyond their initial stages. Members of the youth council include representatives from various agencies and parents of eligible youth seeking assistance through WIA's grant programs. The National Youth Employment Coalition (NYEC) has documented challenges faced by youth councils in developing beyond advisory roles to Workforce Investment Boards (WIBs). The Government Accountability Office (GAO) also identified difficulties in establishing youth councils, citing issues such as lack of youth and parent participation due to transportation and scheduling conflicts. Additionally, a 2002 report for the Department of Labor (DOL) highlighted \"enabling conditions\" that have allowed innovative youth councils to create more comprehensive youth programs. Innovative youth councils can develop comprehensive youth activities under the Youth program with conditions like an established intermediary organization, strong school-to-career partnerships, and a community-wide planning process. The planning process has identified key players and initiatives in a community, suggested a stronger role for youth councils, and recommended developing a comprehensive youth plan to coordinate activities and funding streams. Reauthorization legislation may make youth councils optional due to operational challenges. H.R. 803 in the 113th Congress proposes making youth councils optional and not requiring local workforce investment boards to have youth representatives, but state boards must have youth representatives. S. 1356 suggests changing local workforce investment boards to local workforce development boards and requiring them to address the needs of vulnerable youth in their plans. S. 1356 proposes changing local workforce investment boards to local workforce development boards (LWDB) and requiring LWDBs to establish standing committees for the one-stop system, youth services, and disability services. The youth committee must include community-based organizations serving eligible youth. The bill aims to enhance youth workforce programs by improving coordination between the workforce system and education, drawing on successful youth councils as models. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIA) aims to improve coordination between the workforce and education systems, including provisions for local boards to have representatives from education entities. Stakeholders believe that greater coordination can better meet the needs of youth as intended by WIA. Some stakeholders suggest that existing WIA infrastructure can help meet the needs of youth, as discussed at a Senate HELP Committee session. A 2004 report by the Government Accountability Office highlighted collaboration between workforce and education systems, focusing on local WIBs contracting with entities for youth services. The report examined local WIBs' contracts with entities to provide services to youth, finding that about half received services through various organizations. Some educators were hesitant to partner, citing a mismatch between WIA's youth development vision and schools' academic focus. The report found that some schools hesitated to allow WIA Youth Activities on school grounds due to the stigma of targeting at-risk youth. The Department of Labor and Department of Education are working together to ensure all youth, whether in-school or out-of-school, receive necessary services and support. The Department of Labor and Department of Education collaborate to provide services and support for youth, including the School-to-Work program that focused on work-based learning and job training. Congress can learn from this program's successes and challenges in partnership between schools and workforce activities. H.R. 803, a reauthorization legislation passed by the House on March 15, 2013, includes provisions for coordinating workforce and education systems, but the coordination is not explicit. It allows local areas to include education officials on the workforce investment board, but it is not mandatory. The local plan under H.R. 803 requires identifying strategies to assist youth in acquiring education and skills for the labor market, promoting coordination between workforce and education systems. The Senate bill S. 1356 also addresses coordination with the education system, mandating states to submit a Unified State Plan every four years covering Youth Activities program and other programs. The Unified State Plan under H.R. 803 mandates states to submit a plan every four years covering various programs authorized under Titles I and II of WIA, including Youth Activities, Adult Activities, Dislocated Workers, adult education, Employment Service, and vocational rehabilitation. The plan must include an analysis of state economic conditions and goals for preparing a skilled workforce. The current law allows states to submit a unified plan every four years covering programs authorized under WIA, including Youth Activities, Adult Activities, and vocational rehabilitation. Concerns have been raised about the effectiveness of youth programs under WIA in serving at-risk youth, with limited evaluations conducted. The Department of Labor has three programs - Youth Activities, Job Corps, and YouthBuild, which have met or exceeded their goals under the \"common measures.\" Evaluations are required under Section 172 of WIA to assess program effectiveness and cost. The Department of Labor has programs like Youth Activities, Job Corps, and YouthBuild that have met or exceeded their goals. Evaluations are required to assess program effectiveness and cost, with limited information available on the effectiveness of these programs. The law mandates DOL to conduct evaluations of programs funded under WIA every five years. The report found that only 5 out of 47 identified programs had impact studies since 2004 to determine participant outcomes. None of the programs were the youth programs authorized under WIA. The GAO report identified 5 programs with impact studies since 2004, none of which were youth programs authorized under WIA. Limited information on program impacts makes it challenging for policymakers to assess effectiveness. Youth Activities program lacks formal evaluation on participant impacts, with few studies focusing on program implementation. DOL is conducting an impact evaluation on YouthBuild, randomly assigning youth to the program or a control group. DOL contracted a research organization to evaluate the impact of YouthBuild program on youth employment. Initial results are expected in 2015. A process evaluation of Job Corps program was recently completed to assess center practices related to job placement, earnings, and education attainment. The evaluation of Job Corps program identified key center management and program practices related to performance measures. Factors linked to strong performance include robust student support, staff accountability, and strong partner relationships. The Job Corps program was rigorously evaluated in the late 1990s to early 2000s, showing positive outcomes in education and employment for youth ages 16-24. A follow-up report analyzed longer-term impacts on earnings and employment rates 5 to 10 years later. The follow-up report analyzed the longer-term impacts of the Job Corps program on earnings and employment rates 5 to 10 years after random assignment. It found that positive employment effects diminished, with similar employment rates and earnings between the program and control groups. However, there were increased earnings for youth aged 20-24 at the time of program application, showing benefits for older youth outweighed the cost. The benefits for serving older youth in the program outweighed the cost. WIA specifies performance measures for Youth Activities, Job Corps, and YouthBuild program. Concerns have been raised about disincentives for serving youth with the greatest barriers to employment. The WIA reauthorization bill, H.R. 803, aims to eliminate current youth core performance measures and introduce new indicators for individuals in the Workforce Investment Fund program. These new measures include entry into unsubsidized employment, retention in unsubsidized employment, change in median earnings, and more. S. 1356 introduces six performance indicators for eligible youth in WIA-funded activities, including entry and retention in unsubsidized employment, earnings change, attainment of credentials, participation in education or training programs, and employment in a related field. S. 1356 introduces six performance indicators for eligible youth in WIA-funded activities, including entry and retention in unsubsidized employment, earnings change, attainment of credentials, participation in education or training programs, and employment in a related field. States may add more indicators as needed. The Department of Labor Secretary must establish performance measures for Job Corps center operators based on six indicators for youth in WIA-funded activities. These indicators include entry and retention in employment, earnings change, credential attainment, participation in education or training, and employment in a related field. States and local areas have their own performance measures to assess the effectiveness of workforce investment activities. Under the Workforce Investment Act (WIA), state performance measures are used to assess the effectiveness of workforce investment activities. These measures include core indicators for youth ages 14 through 18, such as attainment of basic skills and secondary education. Additional indicators may be identified by individual states to optimize the return on investment of Federal funds. Under the Workforce Investment Act (WIA), state performance measures assess the effectiveness of workforce activities for youth. Core indicators for ages 14-18 include basic skills, diplomas, and postsecondary placement. For ages 19-21, indicators are employment entry, retention, earnings, and credential attainment. States negotiate performance levels with DOL, as stakeholders feel measures may not fully capture progress. Performance measures under WIA Section 136 are determined through negotiation between states and DOL. Stakeholders argue that these measures may not accurately reflect the progress of at-risk youth, leading programs to only serve high-functioning individuals to meet targets. Some programs funded with Youth Activities dollars only accept youth at specific grade levels to ensure goal achievement. DOL officials are aware of these issues. The Department of Labor (DOL) issued guidance in 2010 to state workforce agencies on strategies to help service providers assist youth most in need, while still meeting performance goals. This guidance focused on six specific strategies, such as employing multiyear contracts. The Department of Labor issued guidance in 2010 to help service providers serve youth most in need while meeting performance goals. The guidance focused on six strategies, including multiyear contracts, basing enrollment goals on total participant count, using real-time indicators for provider assessment, considering participant characteristics in goal negotiations, and creating positive incentives for providers to assist youth in achieving successful outcomes. The 2010 Department of Labor guidance focused on six strategies to help service providers serve youth most in need while meeting performance goals, including using real-time indicators for provider assessment and creating positive incentives for providers to assist youth in achieving successful outcomes. The guidance also suggested that common measures could give local programs more flexibility to work with youth at different ability levels. The 2010 DOL guidance encourages local WIBs to adopt \"real-time\" indicators like changes in attitudes, behaviors, knowledge, and skills for youth programs. Some argue that common measures may not serve higher-risk groups effectively. Some suggest adjusting performance levels for workforce investment boards to better serve higher-risk groups, similar to DOL guidance. Insights from the Job Training Partnership Act could inform adjustments for areas serving the neediest youth. JTPA allowed for standards adjustments based on economic factors. Governors adjusted national performance standards for service delivery areas (SDAs) based on economic and demographic factors under the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA). This process aimed to level the playing field across areas with different local conditions, using DOL adjustment models or state-developed approaches approved by DOL. Under JTPA, areas with varying local conditions used DOL adjustment models or state-approved approaches. WIA mandates Job Corps to establish over 20 core performance metrics, including entered employment and retention in postsecondary education. DOL has added 33 performance metrics based on GPRA requirements. The DOL developed performance metrics based on GPRA requirements for agencies to set goals, measure performance, and report to Congress. A 2011 report raised concerns about Job Corps' inaccurate reporting, lack of established targets, and miscalculated costs. The DOL developed performance metrics based on GPRA requirements for agencies to set goals, measure performance, and report to Congress. A 2011 report raised concerns about Job Corps' inaccurate reporting, lack of established targets, and miscalculated costs. In applying for a grant under the YouthBuild program, applicants must include a description of results to be achieved with respect to common indicators of performance for youth and lifelong learning. The final regulation for YouthBuild, issued in February 2012, addresses performance indicators for grantees, including placement in employment. The regulation for YouthBuild, issued in February 2012, includes performance indicators for grantees such as placement in employment or education, attainment of a degree, literacy and numeracy gains, and other required indicators. DOL provides guidance to grantees for awarding grants, including retention rates. The YouthBuild program has performance indicators for grantees, including placement in employment or education, literacy gains, and retention rates. Retention rate measures individuals who exit the program and remain in employment or education. Recidivism rate tracks participants re-arrested within one year of enrollment. Under the YouthBuild program, stakeholders are discussing eligibility criteria and the focus on serving out-of-school and older youth. H.R. 803 requires states to have strategies for assisting at-risk youth, defined as low-income individuals with barriers to employment, and out-of-school youth ages 16 and older. States and local areas must have strategies and services to assist at-risk youth, including low-income individuals with barriers to employment and out-of-school youth aged 16-24. There is no requirement to serve a specific percentage or allocate a minimum amount of funding for these services. Eligibility for the Youth Activities formula program includes being age 14-21, low-income, and having barriers such as basic literacy deficiency, school dropout, homelessness, pregnancy, or being an offender. The WIA Youth program aims to assist at-risk youth with barriers to employment, such as basic literacy deficiency, school dropout, homelessness, pregnancy, or being an offender. There is ongoing debate about the requirement for youth to prove their low-income status for eligibility, with challenges reported in documenting income eligibility by state and local officials. State and local officials find it challenging to document a youth's income eligibility for the WIA Youth program, as many eligible youth are unable or unwilling to provide necessary documentation. This diverts resources from direct service delivery. The GAO examined how states and localities implement the program and other federal programs funded by the Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. State and local workforce officials find it challenging to document youth eligibility for the WIA Youth program and other federal programs funded by the Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Youth may struggle to provide required documentation, leading to potential exclusion from the program due to income eligibility requirements. Additionally, obtaining documentation to prove eligibility under other WIA criteria, such as involvement in foster care or the justice system, can be difficult for youth. Youth involved in foster care, juvenile justice, or homelessness may struggle to provide required documentation for WIA eligibility. Some states have requested waivers from DOL for certain criteria, but waivers for participant eligibility are not allowed under WIA. Some states and localities may struggle to waive certain eligibility criteria for WIA. While regulations allow for flexibility in establishing policies, stakeholders argue that WIA does not provide enough leeway in documenting income and eligibility factors. Some states and localities reported a preference for using specific eligibility criteria under WIA's predecessor, the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA), related to income and other factors. In-school youth were eligible if they qualified for the federal free lunch program or participated in a program authorized under Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act for low-income school districts. Out-of-school youth were eligible if they met the definition of \"economically disadvantaged.\" The eligibility criteria for youth under WIA include being economically disadvantaged or residing in a high-poverty census tract. Some stakeholders suggest adding categorical eligibility for at-risk youth like dropouts, foster care youth, and homeless youth. The goal of WIA is to serve the most vulnerable youth. The eligibility criteria for youth under WIA include being economically disadvantaged or residing in a high-poverty census tract. Some stakeholders suggest adding categorical eligibility for at-risk youth like dropouts, foster care youth, and homeless youth. Stakeholders have raised concerns about whether changing the eligibility requirement to a means-tested program would affect the number of eligible youth or the services received. There is also a discussion on whether the Youth Activities program should focus more on out-of-school youth, including those who are not working. The Youth Activities program under WIA must allocate 30% of funds for out-of-school youth, who face challenges in recruitment and retention. Serving out-of-school youth is twice as costly as in-school youth. The challenges in recruiting and retaining out-of-school youth under the WIA Youth program include higher costs compared to in-school youth, difficulty maintaining contact, and transportation issues. Stakeholders suggest allocating more funding to dropouts and high-risk youth, even those in school. Some argue for prioritizing out-of-school youth for WIA funds, while others suggest maintaining current funding levels but increasing technical assistance for these youth. Localities are seen as needing support to meet the needs of both in-school and out-of-school youth. The Department of Labor (DOL) is increasing technical assistance for states and localities to support out-of-school youth. DOL issued guidance recommending strong alternative education programs for these youth, including dropouts and those at risk of dropping out. Additionally, DOL funded the Multiple Education Pathways Blueprint. The Department of Labor (DOL) funded the Multiple Education Pathways Blueprint Grants to provide alternative education programs for out-of-school youth. In FY2007, DOL allocated $3.4 million to seven midsize cities for implementing systems to reconnect dropouts to education pathways. Additionally, a 2004 report highlighted successful strategies in serving out-of-school youth, such as providing technical assistance and resources like Minnesota's list of resources. Some states provided technical assistance and resources for out-of-school youth, including Minnesota's list of resources with articles and guides. Local areas also contracted with service providers for GED programs and vocational training. Youth aged 14-21 are eligible for WIA, and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 temporarily extended eligibility. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 temporarily extended WIA Youth services to youth up to age 24 to address the growing number of unemployed young adults. Research suggests that many young people are taking longer to transition to adulthood due to factors like delayed marriage and high living costs. The transition to adulthood for vulnerable youth populations is complicated by challenges such as family conflict, obstacles to employment, and being disconnected from work or school. Older youth are more likely to be disconnected than younger counterparts, raising the question of whether WIA should target these older, disconnected youth in reauthorization legislation. Older youth, particularly those who are disconnected, may need to be targeted by WIA in reauthorization legislation. Increasing the age of youth in the program could strain resources if funding remains stable. A report by GAO found that 7% of youth in the Youth program funded by ARRA were ages 22 through 24, indicating a potential influx of youth seeking services if the age is expanded. The Department of Labor has advised workforce investment systems to co-enroll older youth in both the Youth Activities program and Adult Activities program to meet their individual needs. This allows older youth to receive mentoring services under the Youth program and access an individual training account for occupational skills training under the Adult program. It is uncertain how youth ages 18 through 21 choose to participate in these programs. Exiters ages 19 to 21 in the Youth program have increased from 28.1% in program year 2008 to 34.8% in a recent period covering program year 2012 and 2013. Comparatively, youth ages 18 through 21 in the Adult Activities program made up 10% of the exiter population during the same time period. In the Adult Activities program, individuals aged 18 to 21 make up 10% of the exiter population. The program offers job search assistance and workplace training with related instruction. The Youth program, on the other hand, provides more academic services like tutoring and alternative secondary school services. The Adult program offers job search assistance and workplace training with related instruction during the core phase. The Youth program focuses on developing leadership skills and community service activities. Both programs provide opportunities for occupational skills training and links to employment, with training activities available mainly to Adult program participants in the training component. The training component of the program includes on-the-job training, workplace training with related instruction, private sector training programs, skill upgrading, and entrepreneurial training. The Youth program offers supportive services like child care and transportation, adult mentoring, and counseling for drug and alcohol abuse. In comparison, the Adult program focuses on job counseling during the intensive phase. The Adult program focuses on job counseling during the intensive phase, while the Department of Labor uses specific criteria to select low-performing centers for closure, including performance rating and on-board strength. The Department of Labor uses specific criteria, including on-board strength and facility condition, to select low-performing centers for closure. DOL also considers maintaining at least one center in each state, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, and exempts certain centers from closure based on impact on students. The Department of Labor's closure of low-performing centers is part of an ambitious reform agenda to improve performance. Budget constraints emphasize the need to maximize resources for student and taxpayer benefit. The comment period ended in February 2013, with no further information on closures as of February 2014. The comment period for the closure proposal ended in February 2013, with no further information from the Department of Labor as of February 2014. H.R. 803 aims to improve low-performing centers by adding new performance measures and implementing a program improvement plan for underperforming centers. The bill H.R. 803 aims to close centers that perform poorly on certain criteria for more than four years. The DOL Secretary will conduct an audit ranking centers based on performance and incidents of violence, submitting a report to Congress within three months of enactment. The bill H.R. 803 aims to close Job Corps centers ranked in the bottom quintile of performance indicators within 12 months of enactment. Similar proposals have been suggested in the past to improve program efficiency by identifying and closing the least efficient centers. The Department of Labor (DOL) was tasked with identifying the least efficient Job Corps centers, but they were not closed. Legislation in the 104th Congress proposed closing 25 underperforming centers based on various criteria. The proposal also aimed to transfer Job Corps operations from the federal government to the states. The proposal aimed to transfer Job Corps operations from the federal government to the states, with concerns raised about potential limitations on student access and program offerings. Both the House and Senate bills passed despite objections. The Workforce Investment Act of 2013 (S. 1356) would direct the Secretary to determine center closures and performance indicators for Job Corps. The Workforce Investment Act of 2013 would require the DOL Secretary to establish performance indicators for the Youth Activities program, develop a performance improvement plan, and take necessary actions within a one-year period. The Department of Labor's Employment and Training Administration (ETA) developed a set of performance metrics used in various workforce programs, including Youth Activities, Job Corps, and YouthBuild. These common measures focus on placement in employment or education, attainment of a degree or education, and literacy and numeracy gains. In 2003, ETA implemented a common measures policy to streamline reporting requirements for workforce programs, aiming to create a comprehensive system for program performance evaluation. ETA introduced three measures for youth in programs like Youth Activities and Job Corps. The common measures were not meant to replace existing performance reporting requirements for WIA. They help streamline data collection and assess program performance. The common measures introduced by ETA for youth programs like Youth Activities and Job Corps help streamline data collection and assess program performance under GPRA. Table A-1 outlines the goals and outcomes of these measures for Youth Activities, Job Corps, and YouthBuild programs. The goals for the common measures are established as part of the budget process. The common measures for youth programs are based on aggregated program data from 2007 onwards. Goals are set ambitiously and may be adjusted for individual grantees. Performance targets are developed using regression analysis. The regression analysis is used to set performance targets for Youth Activities, incorporating factors like program results, labor market conditions, and individual characteristics. Targets for YouthBuild and Job Corps are also set using regression analysis. The regression analysis is used to set performance targets for Youth Activities, incorporating factors like program results, labor market conditions, and individual characteristics. DOL sets targets for Job Corps based on economic assumptions and program results. Each program met or exceeded goals in PY2011 and PY2012, with placement in employment or education being a key measure. The placement measure in the Youth Activities program refers to the share of participants enrolled in postsecondary education, advanced training, or employed in the first quarter after exiting the program. Attainment of a degree or certificate measures the share of participants who attain a diploma, GED, or certificate by the end of the third quarter after program participation. The attainment measure in the Youth Activities program refers to the percentage of youth participants who achieve a diploma, GED, or certificate by the end of the third quarter after program completion.
