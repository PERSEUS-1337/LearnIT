    "content": "Prior to 1996, health insurance coverage for mental illness was historically less generous than for physical illnesses, with lower limits, fewer covered services, and increased cost sharing. Mental health parity aims to address disparities in insurance coverage by ensuring that mental health services are covered on par with medical and surgical benefits. Policymakers have developed three general approaches to achieve parity. Policymakers have developed three general approaches to achieving mental health parity, based on coverage mandates and parity requirements. Full parity approach mandates coverage for mental illnesses and requires parity coverage, while minimum mandated approach mandates coverage but does not require parity coverage. The federal mental health parity law prior to the ACA employed a mandated offering parity approach, which required insurers to cover both mental health and medical/surgical benefits in compliance with the law. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements and mandates coverage for certain mental health and substance abuse disorder services in specific financing arrangements. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements and mandates coverage for certain mental health and substance abuse disorder services in specific financing arrangements, without including an explicit coverage mandate for mental health services at the federal level. The federal mental health parity requirements are established by two major laws, MHPA and MHPAEA. These laws mandate parity in various aspects of coverage when insurers choose to cover both mental health and medical/surgical benefits. No specific mental health conditions are mandated for coverage, but compliance with parity requirements is required. Recent data shows that some employers have adjusted their benefits in response to MHPAEA, with a small percentage choosing to drop coverage for mental health services. The majority have instead removed coverage limits or increased utilization management. The ACA also mandates coverage for mental health and substance use disorder services by certain plans. The ACA mandates coverage for mental health and substance use disorder services by certain plans, impacting decisions on coverage retention. MHPA was the first federal mental health parity law, employing a mandated offering parity approach with partial parity requirements. The Mental Health Parity Act (MHPA) mandates that annual and lifetime dollar limits on mental health coverage must be no less than those for medical and surgical services under group health plans. It amends ERISA, PHSA, and IRC to apply parity coverage requirements to all group health coverage arrangements. MHPA also includes a small employer exemption. The Mental Health Parity Act (MHPA) mandates parity coverage requirements for group health plans, exempting small employers with 2-50 employees. The act also includes a cost exemption for plans experiencing a 1% cost increase. MHPA received annual extensions until 2008 and was further expanded by the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA). The Mental Health Parity Act (MHPA) was extended annually until 2008 and was expanded by the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA), which removed the sunset provision and included substance use disorders. MHPAEA requires parity in treatment limitations, financial requirements, and in- and out-of-network benefits, and amended the small employer exemption to include single individuals seeking group insurance. The Mental Health Parity Act (MHPA) was expanded by the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA), which added an employer exemption for small groups including single individuals seeking group insurance. MHPAEA clarified the cost exemption parameters and established federal mental health parity requirements that do not apply to the individual market. The ACA redesignated the federal mental health parity requirements previously codified at PHSA Section 2705 to PHSA Section 2726. Medicaid managed care plans and CHIP plans that cover mental health were also affected by these changes. The ACA expanded the federal mental health parity requirements previously codified at PHSA Section 2705 to PHSA Section 2726. Medicaid managed care plans and CHIP plans covering mental health services were also impacted by these changes. Medicare, whether through fee-for-service or Medicare Advantage plans, is not required to comply with federal mental health parity requirements. The ACA extends the applicability of these requirements and mandates coverage of specified mental health services. The ACA extends federal mental health parity requirements to include qualified health plans, Medicaid non-managed care benchmark plans, and individual market plans. It mandates coverage of specified mental health services. The ACA extends federal mental health parity requirements to include qualified health plans, Medicaid non-managed care benchmark plans, and individual market plans. It mandates coverage of specified mental health services, including plans offered through the individual market. The small employer exemption in federal parity law remains in effect, with the definition of small employer expanded per the ACA. Beginning in 2014, QHPs purchased through an Exchange must cover mental health services and comply with federal mental health parity requirements. The ACA extends federal mental health parity requirements to include Medicaid benchmark and benchmark-equivalent plans, ensuring compliance with financial requirements and treatment limitations. The small employer exemption remains in effect, raising considerations for rulemaking to reconcile with federal parity requirements. The ACA did not change the applicability of parity requirements for CHIP plans. The ACA extends federal mental health parity requirements to include Medicaid benchmark and benchmark-equivalent plans, ensuring compliance with financial requirements and treatment limitations. The application of federal mental health parity requirements to CHIP plans is explained in detail. Additionally, the ACA mandates coverage of certain mental health services for QHPs, Medicaid benchmark plans, and new plans in the individual and small group markets. The main issues considered for coverage of mental health and substance abuse services are the existence of a coverage mandate and parity with other services. The ACA mandates coverage for mental health and substance abuse services for QHPs, Medicaid benchmark plans, and plans in the individual and small group markets. It includes a coverage mandate and parity with medical or surgical services. The ACA mandates coverage for mental health and substance abuse services for QHPs, Medicaid benchmark plans, and plans in the individual and small group markets. It defines essential health benefits (EHB) that must be offered by various plan types, including QHPs. EHB are broadly defined by ACA Section 1302(b). The ACA mandates coverage for mental health and substance abuse services as essential health benefits (EHB) for QHPs. These services are required to be offered by QHPs, but the specific coverage details are determined through the rulemaking process. The ACA mandates coverage for essential health benefits (EHB) for QHPs, with coverage details determined through the rulemaking process. Medicaid benchmark plans must offer at least the EHB by January 1, 2014. New PHSA Section 2707(a) outlines additional requirements under the ACA. The ACA mandates coverage of essential health benefits (EHB) for Qualified Health Plans (QHPs) and requires all Medicaid benchmark and benchmark-equivalent plans to offer at least the EHB by January 1, 2014. Additionally, new plans in the individual and small group markets must include coverage of EHB by the same date. While not a comprehensive federal mandate for mental health services, these provisions create a federal-level requirement for mental health benefits coverage by a significant number of insurers. Some states also have parity laws mandating coverage for certain mental health conditions. Some states mandate coverage of specific mental health conditions through parity laws. ACA allows states to require additional benefits beyond Essential Health Benefits (EHB) for Qualified Health Plans (QHPs), but the state must cover the cost of these additional benefits. This can be done by direct payments to individuals or to the QHP. The state is required to assume the cost of additional benefits for QHPs, which can be done through direct payments to individuals or the QHP. ACA Section 1311(j) mandates federal mental health parity requirements for all QHPs offered through Exchanges. The ACA Section 1311(j) mandates federal mental health parity requirements for all QHPs offered through Exchanges, impacting small group and individual plans. Large group plans may have less incentive to participate due to risk pooling advantages for small group and individual plans. Small employers are exempt from federal mental health parity requirements, potentially affecting plans offered through the Exchange. The ACA Section 1311(j) mandates federal mental health parity requirements for all QHPs offered through Exchanges, impacting small group and individual plans. Federal mental health parity law prior to the ACA contained a specific exemption for small employers. The small employer exemption extends to states where the definition includes self-employed individuals. The small employer exemption under ACA Section 1563(c)(4) extends federal mental health parity requirements to the individual market, including self-employed individuals. This amendment replaces references to group health plans with language covering both group and individual health insurance coverage. However, the small employer exemption at PHSA Section 2726(c)(1) may still apply despite the ACA conforming amendment. The ACA conforming amendment does not explicitly remove the small employer exemption at PHSA Section 2726(c)(1). The exemption applies to group health plans for small employers, including those with only one employee in certain states. Based on the amended statutory language, the small employer exemption under federal mental health parity law may still be in effect. The definition of \"small employer\" has been expanded to include employers with an average of at least 1, but not more than 100, employees, compared to the previous definition of 2 to 50 employees. The small employer exemption under federal mental health parity law may still be in effect, now applying to a wider range of employers. States have the option to use the pre-ACA definition of small employer until 2016, potentially impacting plans offered through an Exchange. This could raise questions about compliance with federal mental health parity for plans offered to individuals in the individual market. Questions may arise regarding whether plans offered to individuals in the individual market need to comply with federal mental health parity requirements, while plans offered to individuals seeking group coverage as employers may not have to comply. The small employer exemption under federal mental health parity law and ACA Section 1311(j) raise questions about whether small employer QHPs might be exempt from federal mental health parity requirements. QHPs offered inside or outside of an Exchange may be exempt from federal mental health parity requirements. The ACA does not specify if applying mental health parity provisions to QHPs would include the small employer exemption. Medicaid can be offered in traditional state plan benefits or benchmark coverage. Medicaid can be provided through traditional state plan benefits or benchmark coverage, including Medicaid managed care plans. Prior to the ACA, all Medicaid managed care plans had to comply with federal mental health parity requirements. This requirement applies to managed care plans offered through traditional Medicaid or alternative state options. The ACA expands certain provisions related to Medicaid. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements to Medicaid benchmark and benchmark-equivalent plans, which provide medical, surgical, mental health, and substance use disorder benefits. ACA Section 2001 only requires these Medicaid plans to comply with parity requirements for treatment limitations and financial requirements. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements to include Medicaid benchmark and benchmark-equivalent plans, focusing on treatment limitations and financial requirements. Plans offering EPSDT services are considered to meet the parity requirement. Medicaid benchmark or benchmark-equivalent plans, not Medicaid managed care plans, are not required to comply with federal mental health parity requirements for annual and lifetime limits and in- and out-of-network covered benefits, as per ACA Section 2001(c). Medicaid managed care plans must comply with all federal mental health parity requirements. Medicaid benchmark or benchmark-equivalent plans are not required to comply with federal mental health parity requirements for annual and lifetime limits and in- and out-of-network covered benefits, as per ACA Section 2001(c). It is unclear if these requirements extend to non-managed care plans under traditional Medicaid. Requiring all Medicaid plans to adhere to federal mental health parity requirements may impact coverage for mental health and substance abuse. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements to newly eligible Medicaid populations, up to 133% of the federal poverty level, enrolled through benchmark or benchmark-equivalent non-managed care plans. The CHIP statute also extends federal mental health parity provisions. The CHIP statute extends federal mental health parity requirements to populations enrolled through benchmark or benchmark-equivalent non-managed care plans. Existing statutory provisions in SSA Title XXI may need to be conformed to reflect changes made by the ACA. The state child health plan must comply with PHSA Section 2705 for both mental health/substance abuse and medical/surgical benefits. Similar to ACA Section 2001, CHIP plans offering EPSDT are deemed to satisfy parity requirements. The provision in SSA Section 2103(c)(6)(B) deems CHIP plans offering EPSDT services as meeting the parity requirement, but it is unclear if this fulfills the full set of federal mental health parity requirements outlined in SSA Section 2103(f)(2). Compliance with subpart 2 of part A of Title XXVII of the SSA is also required for all coverage under SSA Section 2103. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements to include CHIP plans, individual market plans, QHPs, and additional Medicaid plans, extending these requirements beyond just financial and treatment limitations. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements to include CHIP plans, individual market plans, QHPs, and additional Medicaid plans, extending these requirements beyond just financial and treatment limitations. Additionally, the ACA creates a mandate for coverage of certain mental health services for specific plan types, representing a significant change from federal law prior to the ACA. The ACA extends federal mental health parity requirements to various health plans, including CHIP plans, individual market plans, QHPs, and certain Medicaid plans. It introduces a mandate for coverage of specific mental health services, marking a significant departure from previous federal law. The small employer exemption is seemingly maintained, but questions arise regarding the impact on small employer plans in the Exchange and certain Medicaid non-managed care plans. Certain Medicaid plans may not meet federal mental health parity requirements, especially non-managed care plans. The CHIP statute includes provisions for parity, with one having limited reach and another applying requirements fully to CHIP plans."
