    "content": "The Constitution outlines the process for appointing a Justice to the Supreme Court, involving nomination by the President and confirmation by the Senate. This process has remained consistent over two centuries despite some changes. The most recent vacancy on the Court was due to the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. President Obama nominated Merrick Garland to replace Justice Scalia on the Supreme Court, but Majority Leader McConnell argued that the vacancy should not be filled until a new President is elected. Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) expressed differing views on filling the Supreme Court vacancy, with Grassley advocating for waiting until after the election and Reid urging for a nominee to be sent to the Senate immediately. President Obama also weighed in on the issue. President Obama urged the Senate to consider the Garland nomination promptly, emphasizing the importance of fulfilling their Constitutional duty. Despite his plea, the nomination did not receive any formal Senate action, marking the first time since 1866 that a Supreme Court nomination was left unresolved. The nomination of Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court in 2016 did not receive any formal Senate action and was ultimately returned to President Obama. President Trump later nominated Neil Gorsuch to fill the vacancy left by Scalia, which is currently pending before the Senate. The report provides analysis and historical information on the Scalia vacancy, including the frequency of Supreme Court vacancies, the length of the Scalia vacancy compared to past vacancies, and the occurrence of vacancies during presidential election years. Since President George Washington's initial six appointments to the Supreme Court in 1789 and 1790, a vacancy on the Court has occurred, on average, every two years. During the post-War period (1946 to the present), a vacancy on the Court has occurred, on average, every 2.4 years. Since President George Washington's initial six appointments to the Supreme Court in 1789 and 1790, vacancies have occurred on average every two years. In the post-War period (1946 to present), vacancies have occurred every 2.4 years. More recently, since 1980, vacancies have occurred slightly less frequently, every 3.1 years. The time between the vacancies created by the retirement of Justice John Paul Stevens in 2010 and Justice Scalia's death in 2016 is the fifth longest period ever on the Court, specifically 2,054 days or 5.6 years. Justices on the Supreme Court hold office \"during good Behaviour\" under the Constitution. Justices on the Supreme Court typically have lifetime appointments, serving until they voluntarily step down or pass away. Historically, vacancies occur every few years, with Justices often choosing to serve for as long as possible. Of the 111 vacancies in the past 225 years, many have occurred due to Justices passing away while in office. Since 1791, 42% of vacancies on the Supreme Court have been due to a Justice's death, while 58% have occurred for other reasons. In the past 60 years, vacancies from a Justice's death have been rare. Since 1956, only 2 out of 25 vacancies on the Supreme Court were due to a Justice's death, making it a rare occurrence in the past 60 years. The passing of Justice Scalia in 2016 was only the second instance of a vacancy created by a Justice's death during this period. Between 1791 and 1899, 59% of vacancies on the Supreme Court arose from a Justice's death. From 1900 to 1955, 43% of vacancies occurred this way. On average, vacancies on the Court last approximately 4 months before Senate approval. Since 1791, vacancies on the Supreme Court have lasted for an average of 121 days before a nominee is approved by the Senate. The length of vacancies has varied, ranging from 1 day to 835 days. Vacancies lasted longer prior to the 20th century, with an average of 165 days before 1900. Since 1791, vacancies on the Supreme Court have lasted for an average of 121 days before a nominee is approved by the Senate. Vacancies prior to the 20th century lasted longer, with an average of 165 days before 1900. As of March 1, 2017, the Scalia vacancy will have lasted for 382 days, currently the seventh longest in the Court's history. The Scalia vacancy is the longest of the 80 vacancies on the Court since 1861. Another long vacancy was in 1969 by the resignation of Justice Abe Fortas, lasting 363 days. The average time from nomination to final Senate action for the 147 nominations made to the Court since 1791 is discussed. Since 1791, the average time from nomination to final Senate action for the 147 Court nominations has been 28 days, with variations over time.

The 10 longest pending nominations for a Supreme Court vacancy since 1791 are shown in Figure 3, with 8 of the 10 nominations occurring since 1956. The Scalia vacancy is currently the seventh longest vacancy on the Court, with Judge Garland's nomination by President Obama being the longest pending nomination for any Supreme Court vacancy since 1791. The nomination of Judge Garland by President Obama to fill the Scalia vacancy is the longest pending nomination for any Supreme Court vacancy since 1791, lasting 293 days. Judge Gorsuch's nomination, as of March 1, 2017, has been pending for 28 days.

The longest-pending nomination for a Supreme Court vacancy was that of Louis Brandeis in 1916, lasting 293 days. Some vacancies may last long without a nomination pending in the Senate for a significant period. For example, the vacancy after Justice John McLean's death in 1861 lasted 295 days, but the nomination of Noah H. Swayne was confirmed in just 3 days. Multiple nominations can also contribute to long vacancies. The vacancy created by Justice Smith Thompson in 1843 lasted 424 days, with a total of 190 days for the six nominations to be confirmed. There have been 16 vacancies on the Supreme Court during presidential election years out of a total of 111 vacancies.

Out of these, 3 vacancies occurred after the general election, and 4 vacancies had nominations submitted after the election. Since 1791, there have been 9 vacancies on the Supreme Court during a presidential election year. The Scalia vacancy is the first to occur under these circumstances since 1932. Out of these vacancies, 3 did not have the Senate approve a nominee before the election. The Senate did not approve a President's nominee for a vacancy that arose during a presidential election year. Two other nominations for vacancies in the 19th century were also not approved. Out of nine vacancies during presidential election years, eight rolled over from a preceding year. During presidential election years, vacancies on the Supreme Court that rolled over from the previous year were typically confirmed by the Senate. In 1987, Justice Powell's retirement led to Anthony M. Kennedy's nomination and confirmation in 1988. Anticipated vacancies have also occurred, such as President Johnson nominating Abe Fortas for Chief Justice in 1968. In 1968, President Johnson nominated Abe Fortas to be Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and Homer Thornberry to be an Associate Justice in anticipation of future vacancies. However, the Senate failed to confirm Fortas, and Chief Justice Warren did not retire until 1969, resulting in no vacancies on the Court in 1968. This was one of seven vacancies on the Supreme Court that arose during one presidency before the Scalia vacancy. Prior to the Scalia vacancy in 2016, there were seven vacancies on the Supreme Court that occurred during one presidency and were filled during a different administration, representing approximately 6% of all vacancies filled since 1791. The last time this happened was in 1881 when a vacancy arose during President Garfield's term and was eventually filled by his administration after his assassination. Justice Nathan Clifford created a vacancy on the Court in July 1881, which was eventually filled by President Arthur in December of that year. Prior to the Scalia vacancy, the last time a Supreme Court vacancy arose during one presidency and was filled during a different administration was in 1862.

The Scalia vacancy on the Supreme Court lasted 342 days from vacancy to the President leaving office. The number of days reported for each vacancy in Figure 5 does not represent the total number of days each vacancy existed prior to being filled with the appointment of a new Justice. Since 1791, there have been 20 vacancies on the Supreme Court that required more than one nomination to fill, representing approximately 19% of all vacancies on the Court. The Scalia vacancy is the most recent on the Court requiring more than one nomination. Figure 6 displays 12 vacancies since 1860 that needed multiple nominations before a new Justice was appointed. Between 1860 and 2016, there were 12 vacancies on the Supreme Court that required multiple nominations. Six vacancies involved Senate rejection of nominations, four involved President withdrawing nominations, and one nominee died before taking office. The Scalia vacancy is unique as the most recent vacancy needing more than one nomination. The Scalia vacancy is distinctive as the only one requiring a nomination returned to the President after the Senate took no action. Vacancies needing multiple nominations have generally lasted longer than the median vacancy length on the Court. The vacancies on the court have lasted longer than 61 days, with 7 lasting at least 100 days. 6 vacancies have exceeded the average length of 121 days. Nominees approved by the Senate received unanimous or nearly unanimous support, with 4 approved by voice vote and 6 by roll call vote. Six of the nominees for court vacancies were approved with overwhelming support, while one nominee, Samuel Alito, faced significant opposition with 42 nay votes in 2006."
