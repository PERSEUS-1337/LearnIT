    "content": "Severe wildfires have been burning more structures and area due to high accumulations of biomass. Congress is being urged to provide more funding and authority for activities that reduce biomass fuels, such as prescribed burning and thinning. Federal agencies already have broad but indirect authorities to reduce biomass fuel for wildfire protection. The existing authorities for federal agencies to reduce biomass fuel for wildfire protection are broad, though indirect. Congress enacts annual appropriations for hazardous fuels treatments and other management activities that encompass fuel reduction efforts. However, insufficient reporting on funding and accomplishments hinders Congress's ability to assess progress in reducing biomass fuels. Improved reporting on funding and results for thinning and other wildfire protection activities is inadequate, hindering Congress's ability to compare benefits and costs. Disaggregating data by ecosystem or fire regime could enhance understanding and inform appropriate funding decisions. Improved reporting on funding and results for wildfire protection activities, with information disaggregated by ecosystem or fire regime, may aid Congress in allocating appropriate funding among activities and agencies. In temperate ecosystems, wildfires are inevitable due to dry conditions and various ignitions, leading to low-intensity surface fires or high-intensity crown fires that can devastate forests. Wildfires can vary in intensity, from low-intensity surface fires to high-intensity crown fires that can destroy forests. The behavior of a wildfire depends on fuel characteristics and weather conditions. Efforts to protect against wildfires focus on altering fuel characteristics to prevent or minimize damage. Fuel moisture content, size, and other characteristics significantly impact wildfire behavior and effects. The characteristics of biomass fuels, such as moisture content, size, distribution, and quantity, play a significant role in wildfire behavior and effects. Moisture content is crucial as it requires heat to evaporate before the biomass can burn. Green foliage's moisture content fluctuates based on weather, while dead biomass contains water at lower levels. Fuel with up to 20%-30% moisture content can still burn. The moisture content of biomass fuels affects wildfire behavior, with dead biomass having lower water levels than green foliage. Fuel with 20%-30% moisture can ignite, while 100% moisture content can burn if driven by high winds. Wildfire fuels are categorized by the time it takes for moisture content to decrease by two-thirds, with fine fuels like needles and grass having a 1-hour time lag. The smallest diameter fuels, known as fine fuels or flash fuels, dry out quickly and are important for spreading fires. They include needles, leaves, grass, and twigs up to a quarter-inch in diameter. Larger size classes include fuels up to 3 inches and more than 3 inches in diameter, with the fine fuels igniting and burning quickly. The 1-hour time lag fuels contribute little to fire intensity and damage. The fine or flash fuels are crucial for spreading fires as they ignite and burn quickly. The 1-hour time lag fuels contribute little to fire intensity and damage due to their small mass and quick burn time. The 10-hour time lag fuels also play a significant role in the rate of spread, as they can be carried by winds as firebrands to start new fires ahead of the current one. Some 100-hour time-lag fuels can also become firebrands. The larger fuels, such as the 1,000-hour fuels, are important for sustaining fires over a longer period. Fuel distribution refers to the arrangement of fuels horizontally and vertically, with compact fuel beds being more resistant to burning due to reduced ventilation. Highly compact fuels slow moisture loss in dry conditions. Fuel distribution is crucial for fire behavior, with compact fuel beds resisting burning due to reduced ventilation. Continuity of fuels is essential for fire spread, and firelines aim to break this continuity to control wildfires. Fires spread through continuous fuels, and firelines aim to break this continuity to control wildfires. Factors like fuel size, moisture content, slope, and wind speed determine the width of the break needed. Steep slopes and high winds can make fuels more flammable by reducing moisture content and carrying firebrands. Vertical continuity, known as \"fuel ladders,\" is also important. \"High winds can carry firebrands, spreading fires across wide firebreaks. 'Fuel ladders' are continuous fuels that help turn surface fires into crown fires by providing fuel between the ground and canopy, pre-heating foliage to reduce moisture content and raise temperatures.\" A crown fire is often initiated by green foliage with higher moisture content than dead biomass. Once started, strong convection can increase winds, intensifying and spreading the fire. Fuel loads vary, including dead biomass, undergrowth, and undesirable trees. Fuel loads can range widely. Fuel loads can range from less than 1 ton to more than 200 tons per acre, including dead biomass, undergrowth, and undesirable trees. Live crown biomass plays a significant role in sustaining crown fires. Fuel loads can vary greatly, ranging from less than 1 ton to over 200 tons per acre, including dead biomass, undergrowth, and unwanted trees. Live crown biomass is crucial for sustaining crown fires, with not all fuel being completely consumed in a wildfire. The size of the fuel affects the proportion consumed, with larger fuels like tree branches and stems being less consumed compared to fine fuels. The characteristics of the remaining large-diameter fuels post-fire are influenced by the ecosystem they are in. Some ecosystems are adapted to different types of fires, such as low-intensity surface fires or high-intensity crown fires. Ecosystems in the United States are often adapted to frequent wildfires every 30 years, characterized by large amounts of fine fuels like grasses and needles. Natural forested frequent-fire ecosystems in the United States, like ponderosa pine and southern yellow pine ecosystems, are dominated by fire-resistant trees with open spaces due to frequent fires killing seedlings and shrubs. These ecosystems have few small to mid-sized trees, reducing the risk of crown fires. Surface-fire ecosystems in the U.S. account for about 34% of wildlands, historically composed of grasses, needles, and shrubs. Heavy grazing and logging practices have led to an increase in fuel loads of branches and small to mid-sized trees, reducing the frequency of surface fires. Logging practices in surface-fire ecosystems have focused on large pines, leading to an increase in fuel loads of smaller, less fire-resistant trees like firs and spruces. Fire suppression has also contributed to higher fuel loads, creating fuel ladders and increasing the risk of catastrophic crown fires. Activities that reduce fuel loads and remove fuel ladders have been shown to decrease wildfire risk. Ecosystems face the threat of catastrophic crown fires, which can significantly alter them. Reduction of fuel loads and removal of fuel ladders have proven effective in decreasing wildfire severity in surface-fire ecosystems. On the other hand, ecosystems adapted to periodic, high-intensity crown fires have dense, uniform fuels and frequent fires, with plants often resprouting from rootstocks. An example of such an ecosystem is chaparral, a dense, arid ecosystem. Crown fires are relatively frequent, with less than 50 years between fires. Plants in these ecosystems often resprout from rootstocks that survive the fire. An example is chaparral, a dense, arid ecosystem dominated by large shrubs and small trees. In contrast, crown fires are infrequent, with 200 years or more between fires. Most trees are killed in these fires, but new stands establish in the burned areas. Lodgepole pine is a classic example of a species that grows in dense stands and relies on fire for seed release. Crown-fire ecosystems make up about 42% of fire-prone areas. Crown-fire ecosystems make up about 42% of wildlands in the United States. These ecosystems have dense, even-aged stands and produce serotinous cones that only open after being heated by fire. Human activities like grazing, logging, and fire suppression have not significantly impacted fuel loads or fire behavior in these ecosystems. Fuel treatments to reduce fuel loads have shown to be ineffective in preventing catastrophic crown fires in these ecosystems. Activities to reduce fuel loads and remove fuel ladders may not prevent catastrophic crown fires in southern California chaparral. Even in crown-fire ecosystems, wildfires can be patchy, leaving some areas lightly burned or unburned. In crown-fire ecosystems, wildfires can be patchy, with some areas lightly burned or unburned. The Yellowstone fires in 1988 showed that only about half of the reported burned acres were severely burned. Some ecosystems consistently burn with mixed crown fires and low-intensity surface fires. In crown fire ecosystems, some ecosystems consistently burn with mixed crown fires and low-intensity surface fires. These mixed-fire-regime ecosystems typically have an array of fuel sizes, including ladders to allow some crown fires and discontinuous crown canopies to halt the spread of crown fires. Whitebark pine is a classic example of a slow-growing species limited to high elevation sites, where sporadic mixed-intensity fires kill competing firs and spruces but some pines survive to produce seed. Whitebark pines rely on Clark's nutcrackers to spread their seeds in burned areas, ensuring regeneration in severely burned patches. Other species in mixed-fire ecosystems can transition to different dominant species under certain conditions. Mixed-fire ecosystems can transition to different dominant species under certain conditions. Ponderosa pine and Lodgepole pine are examples of mixed-fire types in different environments. The consequences of fuel reduction activities in these ecosystems are not well understood, leading to uncertainty about the potential for abnormal crown fires. It is uncertain if fuels are at abnormal levels, sizes, and distributions in mixed-fire ecosystems, leading to uncertainty about potential abnormal crown fires. Fuel reduction activities may not significantly alter wildfire extent or severity in these ecosystems. Reducing fuel loads has been proposed to suppress wildfires and reduce crown fire likelihood and damage, but its effectiveness varies across different ecosystems. Reducing fuel loads may not effectively protect structures and communities from wildfires, as shown by the Hayman Fire in 2002. 83% of homes were destroyed, with 53% due to crown fires and 47% due to surface fires or firebrands. A total of 662 homes (83% of those within the Hayman Fire perimeter) survived relatively unscathed despite high-severity burns. Reducing fuel loads may help limit wildfires, but expanding low-intensity surface fires is also important for maintaining natural conditions. Reducing fuel loads and expanding low-intensity surface fires are essential for maintaining natural conditions and values in ecosystems. Prescribed burning, thinning, and other activities are proposed to achieve this goal, ensuring the safe existence of wildfires in surface-fire ecosystems. Thinning and prescribed fires can alter microclimate, increase surface fire intensity, and potentially ignite overstory crowns. Prescribed burning is the deliberate use of fire in specific areas within prescribed fuel and weather conditions. Fire is a self-sustaining chemical reaction, and prescribed fires can escape control if conditions change. The Cerro Grande Fire in May 2000 burned 237 homes in Los Alamos, NM after escaping control. Prescribed burning eliminates fine and small fuels through burning and decomposition, reducing the risk of extensive damage. Wildland fire use includes naturally occurring fires managed within acceptable conditions for fuel reduction. Prescribed burning reduces fine and small fuels by converting biomass to smoke and ashes, but has limitations in affecting large diameter fuels and tree density. Prescribed burning is a tool for reducing tree density, crown density, and fuel ladders, but it comes with risks such as escaped fires turning into wildfires. Fire managers tend to be cautious, leading to high implementation costs and health hazards from smoke. The federal land management agencies have policies in place to allow fire managers to use naturally-occurring fires for fire management objectives, known as wildland fire use. This practice involves allowing a wildfire to burn with monitoring in suitable conditions. Wildland fire use involves allowing wildfires to burn with monitoring in suitable conditions, similar to prescribed burning. The acres treated are counted as fuel reduction treatments, with the principal difference being the source of ignition. Thinning is the mechanical cutting and removing of trees in a stand, which can be commercial if the trees are large enough for products. Thinning involves cutting and removing trees in a stand, either for commercial use or precommercial purposes. The three basic approaches to thinning are low thinning, crown thinning, and selection thinning, each aimed at altering biomass fuels and improving the health of the remaining trees. Thinning involves removing trees from a stand to open the canopy and stimulate growth. It has advantages over prescribed burning for reducing fuels, such as controlled selection of trees to cut and emphasis on eliminating ladder fuels. Thinning also reduces crown density, with different levels of thinning achieving varying results. Thinning reduces crown density and vertical fuel continuity, targeting ladder fuels and specific fuel components more precisely than prescribed fire. However, it leaves slash behind, unlike prescribed burning. Thinning has disadvantages compared to prescribed burning as it leaves slash on the ground, increasing fuel load. Mechanical treatments are costly, and not all thinning is meant to reduce biomass fuels. Thinning is a labor-intensive and costly operation used to increase biomass growth of desired trees by concentrating growth on fewer stems. It can leave slash on the ground, increasing fire hazards in the short run. Thinning may not provide effective wildfire protection in crown-fire ecosystems but can reduce the likelihood of catastrophic crown fires in surface-fire and mixed-fire regime ecosystems when combined with slash treatment. Thinning, when combined with prescribed burning, can reduce the risk of catastrophic crown fires by eliminating ladder fuels and reducing crown density. However, the effectiveness of this combination is limited and costly compared to other alternatives. Logging, including salvage logging of dead trees, is sometimes proposed to reduce fuel loads. However, commercial logging is costly and does little for fuel ladders, leaving substantial slash behind. The effectiveness of commercial logging in reducing canopy fires remains untested. Commercial logging, focusing on large trees, may not effectively reduce canopy fires as it does not address fuel ladders. Salvage of standing dead trees could help reduce fuels, but standing dead trees with shed needles may contribute less to crown fires. Pruning trees is another potential activity to mitigate fire risk. Pruning trees by removing lower branches can reduce crown density and fuel ladders, altering fuels for wildfire protection. Five federal agencies, including the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management, are responsible for wildfire protection on federal lands.
