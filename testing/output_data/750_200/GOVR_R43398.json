The National Institute of Education (NIE) and the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) were established in the mid-1970s to centralize research efforts. In 1985, the NIE was replaced by the Office of Educational Research and Improvement (OERI). The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) was established in the mid-1970s under the Education Amendments of 1974. In 1985, the NIE was replaced by the Office of Educational Research and Improvement (OERI). The federal educational research and statistics effort is now carried out by the Institute of Education Sciences (IES), established in 2002 through the Education Sciences Reform Act. The Education Sciences Reform Act (ESRA) established the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) within the Department of Education, headed by a Director appointed by the President. ESRA also created the National Board of Educational Sciences (NBES) to advise the Director and assess the progress of IES. Three National Education Centers were established to conduct the work of IES in research and statistics. ESRA established three National Education Centers to conduct the work of IES in three areas: the National Center for Education Research (NCER), the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), and the National Center for Education Evaluation and Regional Assistance (NCEE). P.L. 108-446 amended ESRA by adding a fourth center, the National Center for Special Education Research (NCSER). Additionally, P.L. 107-279 enacted two acts\u2014the Educational Technical Assistance Act (ETAA) and the National Assessment of Educational Progress Authorization Act (NAEPAA). The Educational Technical Assistance Act (ETAA) and the National Assessment of Educational Progress Authorization Act (NAEPAA) were enacted through P.L. 107-279. ETAA authorizes grants for technical assistance activities and data systems, while NAEPAA authorizes national and state assessments in reading and mathematics for grades 4, 8, and 12. These acts are part of the changes affecting federal educational research and statistics activities under ESRA. The Education Sciences Reform Act (ESRA) brought significant changes to federal educational research and statistics activities, including the creation of an independent research institute and the establishment of \"scientifically-based\" standards for research. ESRA allows the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) to operate independently with more freedom from the Department of Education (ED) compared to the Office of Educational Research and Improvement (OERI). Additionally, ESRA mandates greater oversight of IES by a technical panel (NBES) than what was required for OERI. ESRA provides greater oversight of IES by a technical panel (NBES) compared to OERI. It specifies standards for educational research, requiring scientifically based research and valid evaluations. Methodological rigor is a top priority for IES-supported activities. Provisions for methodological rigor in IES-supported research were outlined in legislation such as ESRA, ETAA, and NAEPAA. Funding for these programs continued through annual appropriations. In the 113th and 114th Congress, bills were passed to reauthorize ESRA, ETAA, and NAEPAA. The Senate adopted a bill reauthorizing ESRA, ETAA, and NAEPAA with amendments related to IES independence, research standards, technical assistance, evaluation, privacy protection, student assessment oversight, and IES accountability. The report provides a concise description of the programs and authorities established by these measures.
