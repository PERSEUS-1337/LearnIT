    "content": "The Bush tax cuts, enacted in 2001 and 2003, were set to expire in 2010. This included lower rates for long-term capital gains and dividends. Without legislative action, rates would have reverted to pre-2003 levels. President Obama proposed retaining lower rates for lower- and middle-income taxpayers. President Obama proposed to retain lower tax rates for lower- and middle-income taxpayers, while taxing dividends and capital gains at 20% for higher-income individuals. The tax rates were temporarily extended through 2012, and eventually, higher-income individuals were taxed at a higher rate starting in 2013. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 raised capital gains taxes for higher-income individuals in 2013, with thresholds set at $480,050 for married couples and $453,350 for singles in 2018. The potential revenue gain from this increase is influenced by behavioral responses assumed by the Joint Committee on Taxation and the Department of the Treasury. President Obama's proposal to let the Bush tax cuts for capital gains expire was estimated to raise $16 billion in revenue in FY2019. The Bush tax cuts for capital gains were estimated to raise $16 billion in revenue in FY2019, but projections show that the effective capital gains tax would have increased to 17.9% in 2019, resulting in a potential revenue difference of $40 billion due to behavioral responses. Some propose applying mark-to-market rules to tax capital gains as accrued to address potential behavioral responses and eliminate the realization response for affected assets. Look-back treatment could be applied to assets that are less easily valued to increase taxes and achieve the same after-tax earnings as accrual basis taxation. The proposal to tax capital gains on an accrual basis aims to address behavioral responses and eliminate realization responses. Realization responses in revenue projections were discussed in the late 1980s, with implications for increasing taxes on realized capital gains. The report discusses the impact of responses on revenues, particularly in relation to capital gains taxes. It suggests that current projections may underestimate revenue gains from allowing lower capital gains tax rates to expire. Economists and policymakers are concerned about potential revenue reduction due to taxpayers delaying capital gains realizations. A tax increase could potentially lead to revenue loss if the response is significant. The report highlights concerns about potential revenue loss from capital gains taxes due to taxpayers delaying realizations to avoid taxes. Elasticities show how realizations respond to tax changes, with negative values indicating a decrease in realizations with higher taxes. The elasticity of realizations in response to tax rate changes determines the revenue impact of capital gains tax adjustments. A higher elasticity value indicates a smaller revenue gain or loss. If the elasticity is less than one, a tax increase generates revenue; if it is greater than one, the increase results in revenue loss. The elasticity of realizations in response to tax rate changes determines the revenue impact of capital gains tax adjustments. If the elasticity is less than one, a tax increase gains revenue; if it is greater than one, the tax increase loses revenue. Different types of elasticities are relevant to capital gains realizations and revenues, with the permanent elasticity being most relevant for permanent tax law changes. The elasticity of realizations in response to tax rate changes determines the revenue impact of capital gains tax adjustments. There are three types of elasticities: permanent, short-run, and transitory. The permanent elasticity is most relevant for permanent tax law changes, measuring the longer-run response to a tax rate change. The discussion focuses on the variability of realizations of wealthy individuals and associated taxes due, which may be influenced by tax rate changes. Taxpayers may time realizations to take advantage of lower tax rates, especially when tax changes are pre-announced. Short-term and transitory effects also play a role in estimating the magnitude and effects of elasticities in response to tax changes. The short-term realizations elasticity is often discussed in the context of a capital gains tax cut, with the idea that taxpayers may realize gains sooner if tax rates are lower. However, the short-term response may be limited if there has been recent increases in realizations. The short-term response to a tax cut may be limited if there has been a recent surge in realizations due to pre-announced tax changes. Short-run responses may not apply to a tax increase that is not pre-announced. The short-term response to a tax cut may be limited if there has been a recent surge in realizations due to pre-announced tax changes. A tax increase that is not pre-announced should not cause a similar contraction in realizations. The stock of gains that has not been realized because of taxes will simply remain unrealized, with no effect on realizations. In 1986 and 2012, significant transitory responses occurred due to tax rate changes. Even without law changes, high-income taxpayers with capital gains can still experience fluctuations in income and taxes, leading to transitory responses. Realizations responses were more pronounced before 1987 when capital gains were subject to graduated rates. Statistical estimates of realizations responses can be based on various functional forms, with elasticities rising proportionally with the tax rate. Elasticities should be reported with reference to the assumed tax rate, such as the 22% rate discussed in the 1990 debate. The 22% tax rate is crucial in discussions about capital gains realizations elasticities and revenue-maximizing tax rates. The elasticities will be stated in absolute value for clarity. Appendices provide underlying equations for analysis. Starting with the 22% rate is appropriate for considering tax increases. The 22% tax rate is important for analyzing capital gains realizations elasticities and revenue-maximizing tax rates. It is a starting point for considering tax increases. Additionally, there are other tax rates in place, such as the 3.8% net investment income tax for high-income taxpayers. The overall marginal tax rate for long-term capital gains is estimated to be around 21.2% to 21.3%. These issues do not apply to taxes on dividends. The Department of the Treasury estimates a capital gains tax rate of 21.3%, while dividends are taxed at a lower rate of 18.4%. In 1990, the George H. W. Bush Administration proposed increasing the top rate on capital gains from 20% to 28%. This change treated capital gains as ordinary income and led to investigations on behavioral responses in realizations. In 1990, agencies investigated behavioral responses in realizations elasticities for capital gains tax. The Administration and JTC used different elasticities, with data from aggregate time series to estimate realizations response. Estimates of the realizations response varied from 0.3 to almost 4, using two types of data: aggregate time series and micro-data studies. Estimates of the realizations response varied dramatically, ranging from 0.3 to almost 4 based on individual taxpayer data, with implications for revenue gains or losses. Estimates of the realizations response varied widely, ranging from 0.3 to 3.8 based on individual taxpayer data, indicating significant challenges in estimation methods. The Treasury's methodology for their estimate was not specified, while the JCT considered time series results more reliable for their own elasticity estimation. Researchers faced challenges in estimating the realizations response, preferring individual data over aggregation to avoid bias and information loss. Distinguishing between permanent and transitory responses was a key issue, especially with fluctuating income and varying tax rates over time. Individuals were expected to time realizations to coincide with favorable conditions. Individuals may need to time realizations to coincide with periods of low tax rates, as income fluctuates over time. Panel data was suggested to separate elasticities in response to varying tax rates. Panel data was used to separate elasticities in response to varying tax rates. Studies reported smaller elasticities, but still above one in some cases. The Treasury chose a larger elasticity based on panel results, which differed from aggregate time series data. The panel results influenced the Treasury to choose a larger elasticity than suggested by aggregate time series data. Panel studies attempted to address transitory effects, but may not fully correct for them due to prolonged periods of income fluctuations. The panel studies attempted to control for transitory effects in income fluctuations, but the estimates could still be too large. The proposed tax cuts were not enacted at that time, but were eventually reduced in 1997 and 2003. The range of realizations elasticities for revenue-estimating purposes is broad. Researchers focused on improving the precision and reliability of estimates for capital gains taxes after a significant spike in realizations in 1986. Realizations increased sharply from $170.6 billion to $324.4 billion between 1985 and 1986, dropping to $144.2 billion in 1987. A study revealed that these gains occurred in December and were seven times higher than the previous year. A study of the significant spike in realizations in 1986 showed gains occurred in December, seven times higher than the previous year, despite a tax increase for the following years. Additional econometric studies on realizations response began in 1990, with estimates by CBO, JCT, and Treasury reported in Table 1. In 1990, several studies on realizations response to tax rates were reported in Table 1, including estimates by CBO, JCT, and Treasury. The studies show a range of elasticities, with coefficients in the second column of the table. Gravelle's study, not econometric, is also included in the results. Gravelle's study in Table 1 discusses the limit to realizations response, noting that realizations cannot exceed accruals. The study provides data on the ratio of realizations to accruals over time and uses average values. The study found that the upper limit of the realizations elasticity is 0.5, which is lower than estimates from other studies. This limit implies that individuals would sell every asset every year in the absence of taxes and transaction costs, but in reality, the elasticity is likely to be lower due to investor satisfaction with their investments. The study, conducted in 1991 and covering data from 1954 to 1989, estimated the realizations to accruals level at 46% and the tax rate at 18.4%. The upper limit and midpoint of the study were reported, indicating that investors with satisfactory portfolios are unlikely to sell their assets every year. The study conducted in 1991 estimated realizations to accruals level at 46% and tax rate at 18.4%. Recent evidence from 1989-2013 shows a similar ratio of 48% and tax rate of 17.3%, supporting limits to realizations elasticities. Dowd, McClelland, and Muthitacharoen panel study found that if all taxes were eliminated, realizations could increase 4.25 times their current value. The study found that if all taxes were eliminated, realizations could increase 4.25 times their current value, which suggests they could be no more than twice as large based on accrual levels. Panel studies could not address transitory issues like cross-section studies. Burman and Randolph's study used state tax rate variation to estimate permanent elasticity. The Burman and Randolph study used state tax rate variation to estimate the permanent elasticity, finding a small and statistically insignificant elasticity and a large transitory elasticity. Auerbach and Siegel replicated the study with similar results, falling below the upper limit of elasticities. Subsequent studies have also incorporated state tax rates. Most subsequent studies incorporated state tax rates. The Auten and Joulfaian study and the Dowd, McClelland, and Muthitacharoen study had the highest elasticities among individual panel studies. Adding state tax rates and a longer panel likely lowered their elasticities compared to earlier studies. Their approach used adjacent years to capture permanent tax rates, but this period may be too short for accurate estimates. The Dowd, McClelland, and Muthitacharoen study continued the approach of using adjacent years to capture permanent tax rates, but this period may be too short, leading to estimates that reflect transitory responses. Their sensitivity analysis produced a wide range of estimates based on different specifications, variables, and time periods. The coefficient ranged from 1.8 to 8.0 in different time subperiods, with some questionable estimates. Studies used aggregate time series data, with varying years added. More years added led to lower elasticities, but all fell within the range of studies from the 1980s. Adding more years to time series data results in lower elasticities. The time series results are consistent with studies from the 1980s, with some falling below or above the estimated limits. State studies also show results slightly above the upper limit of the Gravelle study. The study by Bakija and Gentry focused on state-level data with time controls to identify a permanent response. Results showed coefficients rising from 2.91 to 3.88 without state fixed effects. Elasticities in Table 1 were lower than those in studies from the 1980s. JCT's current coefficient was similar to the estimate used in the 1990 debate. The Treasury estimate has been reduced. The elasticity in 1990 was slightly higher due to the exclusion of small portfolio effects. The Treasury estimate has been reduced and is now similar to the JCT assumption. Both estimates appear high and likely understate the revenue from increasing the tax rate on capital gains. Table 2 compares revenue estimates for raising the tax rate by five percentage points in 2019 using elasticities from Table 1 and CBO projections. Table 2 compares revenue estimates for raising the tax rate on capital gains by five percentage points in 2019, using elasticities from Table 1 and CBO projections. The estimates are based on CBO's revenue projections for 2019, adjusted to reflect short-term gains taxed at ordinary rates. The revenue gain as a percentage of static gain ranges from a reduction of 26% to 97%. The Department of the Treasury reported revenue estimates for raising the tax rate on capital gains by five percentage points in 2019. The revenue gain ranges from $31.4 billion to $1 billion, showing a reduction of 26% to 97% of the static gain. Measures like accrual-based taxation with a look-back method could eliminate the realizations response and increase capital gains revenues. By implementing accrual-based taxation with a look-back method, capital gains revenues could increase significantly. The Auten and Joulfaian panel study, while reliable, may overstate the permanent elasticity of tax revenue. The Dowd, McClellan, and Muthitacharoen study produced the largest elasticity, indicating differing estimates from different subperiods, suggesting fragility in the estimates. Eichner and Sinai results include more years than other studies, with CBO including even more years. The elasticity of revenue gains from increasing the tax rate by five percentage points is likely below 0.5, based on various studies and calculations. These findings suggest that previous revenue-estimating assumptions may underestimate the potential revenue gain. The elasticity of revenue gains from increasing the tax rate by five percentage points is likely below 0.5, suggesting that previous assumptions may underestimate potential revenue gains. The Gravelle constraints indicate that revenue gains could be three times higher than projected by the JCT, and up to 45% larger using the upper limit. This implies that the JCT's projections may underestimate revenue gains from increasing capital gains tax rates. The technical appendix details the method of calculating taxes and modeling revenue realizations. The standard realization of revenues is based on a semi-log function for calculating taxes. The elasticity of realizations with respect to taxes can be estimated using a semi-log function. The formula for this function is log G = bt, where G is gains, t is the tax rate, and b is the tax rate coefficient. The formula for estimating the tax rate coefficient is derived by differentiating equation (1) and restating b in absolute value. The revenue equation is then written as R = tAe -bt, with the elasticity being bt. If equation (4) is logged and differentiated, the result is dR/r = dt/t (1-bt). The revenue maximizing tax rate is determined by setting the derivative of the revenue equation equal to zero, resulting in a tax rate of 1/b. For example, if b is 2, the optimal tax rate is 50%, and if b is 5, the optimal tax rate is 20%. The look-back method adjusts basis to increase taxable gain. The revenue maximizing tax rate is determined by setting the derivative of the revenue equation equal to zero, resulting in a tax rate of 1/b. The look-back method decreases basis to achieve the same net on a sale as if the tax had been paid on an accrual basis. Calculations involve variables such as growth rate, holding period, sales price, basis, and tax rate. Equations are used to determine the growth rate and find a new basis that will give the same return as accrual taxation. Accrual taxation calculates gain on realization with a new basis as S-t(S-B*), while gain on accrual is B(1+g(1-t)) T. Equating and solving for B* gives B* = [B(1+ ((S/B) 1/T -1)(1-t)) T -S(1-t)]/t. Appendix B discusses elasticities in studies of the 1980s, with reported values at a 22% tax rate. In the 1990 debate, studies on capital gains realizations and tax rates are categorized based on the approach used. Challenges in statistical studies and the debate over data types (aggregate time series vs. individual taxpayer data) are discussed. Citations for all studies are in Appendix C. In the 1990 debate, studies on capital gains realizations and tax rates are categorized based on the approach used. Concerns arise regarding the type of data to be used: aggregate time series versus individual taxpayer data. Aggregate time series results were generally smaller and more consistent, while estimates based on individual data varied widely. Individual data is preferred as it provides more detailed information compared to aggregate data. Using individual data is preferable over aggregate data due to the loss of information and potential bias caused by aggregating responses. It is challenging to control for all changes over time that can impact results, such as changes in transactions costs and discrepancies between asset prices and accruals. Time series estimates may not solely capture permanent effects, with other factors potentially influencing results in different ways. The problems with using individual data sets are severe, leading many researchers to believe that aggregate time series results are more reliable. One major issue is the capital gains tax rate, which is actually an endogenous variable influenced by realizations. Various techniques could be used to address this econometric problem. The capital gains tax rate is influenced by realizations. Different techniques can be used to address this econometric problem, such as using the first dollar tax rate, maximum statutory rates, predicted gains, or instrumental variables methods. Endogeneity of the explanatory variable is more severe in individual cross-section data compared to aggregate time series data. Individual data shows variation due to individual circumstances, while aggregate data is influenced by changes in the law. Distinguishing between permanent and transitory responses is a challenge. Tax rates fluctuate over time, leading high-income individuals to time realizations to coincide with low rates. Panel studies attempt to address this issue by averaging previous data. Since the 1980s, studies have been conducted to address the issue of individuals needing to cash in assets during periods of low income and taxes. Panel studies have attempted to create a permanent tax rate by averaging previous, current, and future tax rates, but may not fully correct for transitory effects. Various studies have used different specifications, with some results included in Table 1 and others not. References to these studies can be found in Appendix C. The section explains the results reported in Table 1 and why some studies were excluded. Slemrod and Shobe (1990) used a six-year panel to replicate previous studies, finding large elasticities exceeding 1 and up to 5. Their study highlights potential issues with previous research and the limitations of short panels. The study by Slemrod and Shobe (1990) found large elasticities exceeding 1 and up to 5 in a six-year panel study. Results varied over time periods, with some not statistically significant. They also estimated a regression related to tax rates but obtained statistically insignificant results, suggesting transitory effects. The methodology used in the study has largely been rejected, leading to the exclusion of the results. The study extends a previous time series analysis from 1954-1985 to 1989, making changes in the approach used by CBO. The authors consider using an instrumental variables technique with taxes on predicted gains as an instrument. The study suggests using an instrumental variables technique with taxes on predicted gains as an instrument to increase the coefficient and elasticity of tax rates. They also propose using the maximum tax rate as an instrument and differencing the data for higher elasticities. Differencing the data produced higher elasticities, but they were not statistically significant. Extending the time period through 1989, excluding 1986, resulted in different estimates for the predicted gains instrument and maximum rate instrument. The study compared elasticities of 0.75 and 0.77 at a 22% rate, and 1.18 and 1.16 at the maximum rate. Using the predicted gains rate or maximum rate as an instrument for time-series regression raised issues due to substantial changes in the law. The authors concluded that micro-data approaches are superior. The authors highlighted issues with using the maximum rate as an instrument for time-series regression due to substantial changes in the law. They reported a coefficient of 3.4 in Table 1. Burman and Randolph's study separated permanent and transitory effects, making it innovative since the 1980s. The Burman and Randolph study in Table 1 innovatively separated permanent and transitory effects using state tax rates from 1979-1983. They included the first dollar current tax rate as an instrument, distinguishing between taxpayers with low and high incomes. Permanent rates varied across states due to state tax rates. The authors separated permanent and transitory effects using state tax rates from 1979-1983. They found that taxpayers with low income had transitory rates below their permanent rates, while those with high income had higher rates. Permanent rates varied across taxpayers in different states due to state tax rates. The estimated elasticity was 0.18 at an 18% tax rate and 0.22 at a 22% tax rate, with a transitory elasticity of 6.45. Subsequent studies also used state tax rates in their analysis. The study by Bogart and Gentry (1995) analyzed state tax rates from 1979 to 1990 to identify permanent responses, reporting an elasticity of 0.65. Auerbach and Siegel (2000) used panel data from 1985 to 1994 to replicate the findings. Auerbach and Siegel (2000) replicated the findings of Burman and Randolph using panel data from 1985 to 1994. They reported an elasticity of 0.33 at the mean tax rate, estimated to be around 25%. With this tax rate, the elasticity was 1.126 at a 22% rate, similar to Burman and Randolph's results. They also found a transitory elasticity of 4.9 at a 22% rate. Auerbach and Siegel found a higher permanent elasticity of 1.75 compared to the transitory elasticity of 4.9 reported by Burman and Randolph. The addition of the current first dollar tax rate likely introduced a transitory element to the permanent tax rate, leading to the larger elasticity. The 1.126 coefficient is reported in Table 1 by Auerbach and Siegel, who also conducted separate regressions for very wealthy and \"sophisticated\" taxpayers. Eichner and Sinai's study extends time series analysis through 1997, excluding 1986 from the estimates. This study extends time series analysis through 1997, excluding 1986 from the estimates. The coefficient is 2.28, with an elasticity of 0.5. Excluding both 1986 and 1997 results in a coefficient of 2.18, implying an elasticity of 0.48. Different specifications were tried, including an instrumental variables method, which yielded an estimate of 3.8 and an elasticity of 0.84. The authors used different methods to estimate the elasticity of taxable income, including an instrumental variables approach based on the top marginal tax rate. The coefficient varied from 3.8 to 5.13, with elasticities ranging from 0.84 to 1.13. However, some specifications with changes in tax rates resulted in non-statistically significant coefficients. The analysis by Auten and Joulfaian (2004) uses a longer micro-data panel to estimate permanent and transitory effects of tax rate changes, with a coefficient of 2.28 reported in Table 1. The study by Auten and Joulfaian (2004) analyzes state tax rates to identify permanent effects, using adjacent years to separate permanent and transitory effects. Their estimate suggests an elasticity of 0.72 at a 20% tax rate and 0.79 at a 22% tax rate. Evans (2009) conducts a cross-section regression study with various specifications. Evans (2009) conducted a cross-section regression study using public use file data, with elasticities typically between 2 and 5. The study by Bakija and Gentry (2014) utilized a 50-year panel of state data. This study by Bakija and Gentry (2014) analyzes a 50-year panel of state data on changes in combined federal and state tax rates. The data includes state- and time-fixed effects, with identification for effects coming from changes in effective state marginal tax rates. The study controls for unobserved differences across states with state-fixed effects and conducts tests on changing specifications. Authors conducted tests on the effects of changing specifications, finding that omitting state-fixed effects and year-fixed effects raised the elasticities significantly. The study used standard panel methods over a 10-year period, with year-fixed effects to control for transitory effects from law changes. Sensitivity analysis was also provided with different specifications and time subperiods. The study conducted tests on changing specifications, finding that omitting state-fixed effects and year-fixed effects raised the elasticities significantly. It used standard panel methods over a 10-year period, with year-fixed effects to control for transitory effects from law changes. Sensitivity analysis was also provided with different specifications and time subperiods. The study by Minas, Lim, and Evans (2018) is an aggregate time series study done with Australian data from 1988 to 2015, including controls for GDP, inflation, and the stock market index.
