    "content": "Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 provides legal relief for victims of sexual abuse and harassment at educational institutions. The statute prohibits discrimination based on sex in programs receiving federal funding. The Supreme Court has ruled that schools can be held liable for damages for a deliberately indifferent response to sexual abuse or harassment by teachers. Title IX allows for legal relief for victims of sexual abuse and harassment in educational institutions. Schools can be held liable for a deliberately indifferent response to such incidents. Federal agencies like the Department of Education also enforce Title IX for instances of sexual harassment. Title IX allows for legal action against schools for sexual harassment through private rights of action or federal agency enforcement for compliance with antidiscrimination mandates tied to federal funding for educational programs. When schools receive federal funds, all operations are covered by Title IX, which does not explicitly mention sexual abuse or harassment. Department of Education has issued guidance on this issue in recent administrations. The Department of Education has issued guidance on schools' responsibilities under Title IX for addressing sexual harassment allegations. Educational institutions have developed procedures to investigate and respond to such allegations. Recently, the Department of Education proposed new regulations that would significantly change schools' responsibilities. The Department of Education proposed new regulations in 2017 that would change schools' responsibilities for responding to sexual harassment allegations. The regulations would impact how educational institutions handle Title IX requirements and enforcement by federal agencies. The report examines how federal agencies enforce Title IX, focusing on ED's guidance for schools responding to sexual harassment. It also discusses constitutional challenges against public universities for violating due process rights. Additionally, it analyzes ED's proposed regulations altering schools' Title IX responsibilities. The curr_chunk examines ED's proposed regulations regarding Title IX, emphasizing changes in schools' responsibilities to comply with the law. Title IX prohibits sex discrimination in educational programs receiving federal funding, but does not explicitly allow victims to sue for damages. Title IX prohibits sex discrimination in educational programs but does not provide a private right of action for victims. Federal courts have established the remedial scheme for victims of sexual harassment or abuse due to the absence of statutory text defining unlawful conduct. Federal courts have played a primary role in establishing the remedial scheme for victims of sexual harassment or abuse under Title IX through a private right of action. The Supreme Court interpreted Title IX to allow for a private right of action against federally-funded educational institutions for sexual harassment and later implied a damages remedy. The Court has also set the legal standard for liability under Title IX for sexual abuse or harassment by teachers and students. The Court has established the legal standard for liability under Title IX for sexual abuse or harassment by teachers and students, creating a \"high bar for plaintiffs to recover under Title IX.\" In a Title IX private right of action for damages, educational institutions are not strictly liable for a teacher's sexual harassment or abuse of a student. Title IX liability for sexual harassment or abuse by teachers or students is not based on strict liability. Liability depends on the recipient's response to the conduct, with liability only arising from a response amounting to \"deliberate indifference.\" The private right of action under Title IX is judicially implied. The private right of action under Title IX is a judicially implied remedy for victims of sex discrimination, providing specific relief or damages. Administrative enforcement focuses on the institutional policies of educational institutions. Two Supreme Court decisions outline the requirements for establishing liability under Title IX for damages. The Supreme Court decisions Gebser v. Lago Vista Independent School District and Davis N ext Friend LaShonda D. v. Monroe County Board of Education set the standard for an educational institution's liability under Title IX for damages related to sexual abuse or harassment. Liability is based on the institution's \"deliberate indifference\" in responding to such conduct, establishing a private right of action for damages. Liability under Title IX for damages related to sexual abuse or harassment is based on the funding recipient's response to discrimination, not strict liability for a principal or teacher's conduct. The Supreme Court rejected the idea of vicarious liability and instead requires proof of deliberate indifference to establish liability. Liability under Title IX is based on the funding recipient's own failure to act adequately in response to known misconduct, not the misconduct itself. The institution will only be liable if there is a showing of deliberate indifference, regardless of the severity of the conduct. The Court established this standard in Gebser by inferring how Congress would have addressed the issue. The Court inferred how Congress would have addressed the issue of liability under Title IX by analyzing the statute's administrative enforcement provision. This provision allows agencies to suspend or cut funds to a funding recipient for violating Title IX after advising them of the failure to comply. The Court determined that liability under Title IX requires actual notice to an appropriate person and a deficient response from a school official. The Court found that liability under Title IX only occurs when a school official responds to actual notice of a violation with deliberate indifference. This standard is similar to the deliberate indifference standard in cases under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The Court held that a school district cannot be held liable under Title IX for a teacher's sexual harassment of a student without actual notice and deliberate indifference. Deliberate indifference, as defined by the Supreme Court, must cause students to undergo harassment or make them vulnerable to it. This standard does not require funding. The \"deliberate indifference\" standard under Title IX, as established in Davis, requires a recipient's response to harassment to be clearly unreasonable in light of known circumstances. It does not mandate funding recipients to remedy harassment, but they can be held liable if their response is deemed clearly unreasonable. This standard goes beyond mere reasonableness and requires a plaintiff to show that the recipient's response was clearly unreasonable. The plaintiff must show that the recipient's response to sexual abuse or harassment was clearly unreasonable under Title IX. In addition to proving \"deliberate indifference,\" other threshold showings are required to succeed in a Title IX suit for damages. Before addressing \"deliberate indifference,\" Gebser mandates establishing other criteria. Gebser requires establishing \"actual knowledge of discrimination\" by an \"appropriate person\" at the funding recipient before proving \"deliberate indifference\" for a Title IX claim seeking damages for sexual harassment or abuse. Failure to show this may result in dismissal of the claim. An \"appropriate person\" is defined as someone with the authority to address discrimination and implement corrective measures. The Gebser standard requires proving \"actual knowledge of discrimination\" by an \"appropriate person\" at the funding recipient to establish \"deliberate indifference\" for a Title IX claim regarding sexual harassment or abuse. The liability standard also necessitates showing that the funding recipient had \"substantial control\" over the harasser and the harassment was severe. The Davis standard for Title IX liability requires showing \"substantial control\" by the funding recipient over the harasser and the context of the harassment, the severity of the harassment, and the resulting denial of educational access. If the harasser is under the school's disciplinary authority, the recipient may be liable for deliberate indifference to the harassment. The Davis standard for Title IX liability emphasizes the recipient's control over the harasser and the environment where the harassment occurs. The recipient may be liable for deliberate indifference if the harasser is under the school's disciplinary authority. The harassment must be severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive, leading to a denial of equal educational access for the victim-students. The severity of harassment under Title IX must be so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it denies victim-students equal access to educational resources. The Court in Davis emphasized the importance of surrounding circumstances and relationships in determining the level of harassment. Additionally, evidence of a decline in the victim's grades may indicate the impact of harassment on their education. The Court in Davis emphasized the severity of harassment under Title IX, stating that it must have a systemic effect on the victim's education. They noted that evidence of declining grades can show a potential link to harassment but clarified that a single instance of severe harassment may not constitute a systemic effect. The Supreme Court's Gebser and Davis decisions establish that educational programs receiving federal funding can be liable under Title IX for sexual abuse or harassment if they show \"deliberate indifference\" in their response. Lower courts have varied in their interpretations of the evidence required to meet this standard. Lower federal courts have varied in their interpretations of the evidence required to prove a Title IX claim, with some focusing on a \"hostile environment\" analysis for teacher-to-student harassment cases, while others look at elements like \"actual\" notice of discrimination and corrective measures by an authorized person. In Title IX cases involving student-on-student sexual harassment or assault, the plaintiff must prove severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive behavior that denies equal access to resources, with the recipient exercising substantial control over the harasser and the context of the harassment. In Title IX cases, plaintiffs must prove severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive behavior that denies equal access to resources. Federal courts vary on the evidence needed to satisfy these elements, with failure to meet any leading to dismissal of a claim. Gebser requires \"actual\" notice of discrimination, not just reasonable knowledge. In Title IX cases, plaintiffs must prove severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive behavior that denies equal access to resources. Federal courts differ on what constitutes \"actual\" notice of discrimination, with varying standards for knowledge of abuse or harassment allegations. In Title IX cases, federal courts differ on what constitutes \"actual\" notice of discrimination, with varying standards for knowledge of abuse or harassment allegations. The Eleventh Circuit addressed the question of whether complaints of two separate students about a perpetrator's previous acts of sexual harassment or abuse may constitute actual notice of that individual's conduct as to others. The standard a court applies to evaluate \"actual notice\" is determinative\u2014the claim may either proceed to the next phase of the analysis or be foreclosed altogether. In Doe v. School Board of Broward County, the Eleventh Circuit ruled that complaints from two students about a teacher's sexual misconduct raised a triable issue of the principal's actual notice of a pattern of harassment. The reports detailed multiple instances of sexual propositions, touching, and comments, indicating a potential for sexual assault. In Baynard v. Malone, the Fourth Circuit held that a school principal had no \"actual\" notice of a sixth grade teacher sexually abusing a student, despite prior reports of molestation. The evidence showed the principal had met with the teacher before the student started sixth grade. The school principal had received prior reports of a teacher molesting children before the plaintiff started sixth grade. The evidence included warnings from former students and other teachers about the teacher's behavior. The school librarian also reported a concerning incident involving the plaintiff and the teacher. The school librarian reported to the principal that she witnessed the teacher with the plaintiff sitting in his lap, their faces close together, and deemed the behavior \"inappropriate.\" The court found that while the principal should have been aware of potential abuse, there was no evidence that they knew about the student being abused, leading to the dismissal of the Title IX claim. The court dismissed the Title IX claim as the principal was aware of inappropriate behavior but not of the student being abused. Courts vary in defining \"actual\" notice for Title IX liability for sexual abuse or harassment, requiring both actual notice and reporting to an appropriate person. The Supreme Court's liability standard for Title IX requires actual notice to an appropriate person with authority to address discrimination and institute corrective measures. Federal appellate case law focuses on whether an individual had the ability to address misconduct or acted in a representative capacity within the funding recipient's hierarchy. Federal courts have varying interpretations on who qualifies as an \"appropriate person\" under Title IX, especially in the context of elementary or secondary schools. Some courts have debated whether a principal, teacher, or guidance counselor has the authority to address discrimination and take corrective action. Some federal courts of appeals have debated whether a public school principal can be considered an \"appropriate person\" under Title IX to address discrimination and take corrective action. The Third Circuit ruled in Warren ex rel. Good v. Reading School District that a school principal was deemed appropriate due to her authority to investigate teacher misconduct and initiate corrective measures. However, the Fourth Circuit reached a different conclusion in Baynard v. Malone. The Fourth Circuit ruled in Baynard v. Malone that a school principal, despite supervising teachers, was not considered an \"appropriate person\" under Title IX. The court emphasized the principal lacked the authority to hire, fire, transfer, or suspend teachers, and therefore could not address discrimination or take corrective action. Additionally, a federal court of appeals held in Salazar v. South San Antonio Independent School District that a principal directly involved in sexual abuse or harassment may also not be considered an \"appropriate person.\" The Fifth Circuit in Salazar v. South San Antonio Independent School District ruled that a school official who sexually abuses a student cannot be considered an \"appropriate person\" under Title IX, even if they would otherwise qualify. The case involved a vice principal who later became principal and sexually abused a student for several years. Despite having corrective authority, the court held that the official's actions disqualified him from being considered an \"appropriate person.\" The Fifth Circuit ruled in Salazar v. South San Antonio Independent School District that a school official who sexually abused a student cannot be considered an \"appropriate person\" under Title IX. The court reasoned that despite having corrective authority, the official's actions disqualified him from being considered an \"appropriate person\" for Title IX liability purposes. The Fifth Circuit ruled in Salazar v. South San Antonio Independent School District that a school official who sexually abused a student cannot be considered an \"appropriate person\" under Title IX. This decision rejected agency principles and emphasized evidence such as the individual's ranking in the university hierarchy and responsibilities involving receiving allegations of harassment. In cases involving Title IX, analyses focus on evidence related to the individual's university ranking, responsibilities for handling harassment allegations, and ability to address misconduct. However, even with such evidence, it may not be enough to qualify someone as an \"appropriate person.\" For instance, in Ross v. University of Tulsa, campus security officers were deemed not \"appropriate persons\" for the university to receive notice of on-campus sexual assault, despite their mandatory reporting duties. The court ruled that campus security officers' mandatory reporting of sexual assaults did not make them \"appropriate persons\" to receive notice of on-campus incidents. Their participation in investigations was also not considered sufficient to qualify them as such. The court's analysis on who may be considered an \"appropriate person\" under Title IX varies, making it unlikely for a school or university's Title IX Coordinator to categorically qualify. The determination will depend on specific characteristics and evidence related to the individual's responsibilities within the institution. Proof of \"actual notice\" to an \"appropriate person\" and deliberate indifference in response by the funding recipient are required for a discrimination case. To prove \"actual notice\" of discrimination to an \"appropriate person,\" a plaintiff must show deliberate indifference in the funding recipient's response, meaning acting unreasonably given the circumstances. Courts require more than just a lack of response or negligence to establish liability. The nature of the allegations known to the funding recipient and their actions are crucial in determining deliberate indifference. Courts analyze the nature of allegations known to the funding recipient and their response to determine if it amounts to \"deliberate indifference\" in cases of sexual harassment or abuse. Clear cases involve no effort to respond to actual notice, such as failure to investigate serious allegations. The response of funding recipients to allegations of sexual harassment or abuse is crucial in determining if there was deliberate indifference. Federal case law shows varying analyses on what constitutes deliberate indifference, with courts setting a high bar to meet. For example, in Doe ex rel. Doe v. Dallas Independent School District, the Fifth Circuit emphasized the importance of a sufficient response from the funding recipient. In a case involving sexual abuse allegations against a third-grade teacher, the school district's response was deemed not deliberately indifferent by the Fifth Circuit, despite evidence of a deficient reaction. The plaintiffs accused the teacher of abusing male students over four years, but the principal dismissed the claims and failed to take appropriate action. The principal's response to sexual abuse allegations against a teacher was deemed not deliberately indifferent by the Fifth Circuit, despite evidence of a deficient reaction. The principal failed to report the allegation to Child Protective Services and did not monitor the teacher further. However, the court found that the principal had interviewed the student, spoken with his mother, and warned the teacher about the consequences if the allegations were true. The court found that the principal's actions, including interviewing the student, speaking with his mother, and warning the teacher about the consequences of the allegations, were not considered inadequate in response to the student's claims of sexual misconduct. The Eleventh Circuit, in a similar case, ruled that a school's response to allegations of teacher misconduct was deliberately indifferent due to serious deficiencies in handling complaints. The principal received sexual harassment complaints from two students about the same teacher. The court noted the lack of action taken by the principal in response to the second complaint, despite being aware of a possible pattern. The principal failed to notify the school board's investigative unit that the allegation involved the same teacher from a previous investigation. The court concluded that the principal's actions were inadequate in addressing the complaints. The court found that the principal's response to sexual harassment complaints against the same teacher was inadequate, as they failed to take corrective measures or notify the investigative unit. This lack of action could be seen as deliberate indifference to the possibility of the teacher's misconduct. Some courts of appeals have addressed allegations of deliberate indifference not directly covered by the Court's Gebser and Davis decisions. In Simpson v. University of Colorado, Boulder, the Tenth Circuit analyzed claims of an \"official policy of deliberate indifference\" by a university in failing to provide necessary training or guidance. This involved the football program selecting players to host high school recruits to \"'show the recruits a good time.'\" During a football recruiting visit, university football players and high school recruits allegedly sexually assaulted plaintiffs. The court noted prior knowledge of sexual assaults by the coaching staff, including a rape incident two months before the plaintiffs were assaulted. The university had been warned about sexual assaults during football recruitment. The court highlighted the lack of guidance for player-hosts and resistance to recruiting reforms by the head coach, despite prior sexual assault incidents involving university football players. The university had been advised to make changes to its football recruiting program. The court found that the head coach did not provide guidance to player-hosts on appropriate behavior, despite knowledge of prior sexual assaults during recruiting visits. This lack of action created a triable issue of deliberate indifference under Title IX. In Title IX cases, proving deliberate indifference by a funding recipient is fact-intensive and requires substantial evidence. Federal agencies enforce Title IX by ensuring nondiscrimination based on sex for programs receiving federal financial assistance. In Title IX cases, federal agencies enforce nondiscrimination based on sex for programs receiving federal financial assistance, with the ultimate sanction being termination or suspension of funds for violators. Agencies issue regulations and orders to enforce the statute and monitor recipients' compliance. The Secretary of Education (ED) and another federal agency play key roles in enforcing Title IX for educational programs receiving federal funds. ED is responsible for promulgating regulations on sex discrimination in education, as it administers federal financial assistance to educational institutions. The Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division and OCR collaborate in enforcing Title IX, with OCR having primary responsibility for enforcing the statute directly against recipients of financial assistance from ED. The OCR enforces Title IX against recipients of financial assistance from ED through complaint investigations and compliance reviews. ED regulations prohibit educational institutions from discriminating based on sex in any education program or activity. Recipients of federal financial assistance operating education programs must designate an employee for compliance. The OCR enforces Title IX by investigating complaints and conducting compliance reviews to ensure recipients of federal financial assistance comply with regulations prohibiting sex-based discrimination in education programs. Recipients must designate a Title IX Coordinator and establish grievance procedures for resolving complaints promptly and equitably. OCR may also conduct periodic reviews or directed investigations to monitor compliance. OCR enforces Title IX by investigating complaints and conducting compliance reviews to ensure recipients of federal funds comply with regulations. OCR receives complaints alleging violations of Title IX and can seek informal resolution through a resolution agreement. If negotiations fail, formal enforcement measures may be taken, including funding suspension or termination. Title IX and ED's regulations do not directly address sexual harassment. OCR has issued guidance in the administrative context. The OCR enforces Title IX by investigating complaints and ensuring compliance with regulations. While Title IX and ED's regulations do not directly address sexual harassment, the OCR has issued guidance documents interpreting Title IX to prohibit sexual harassment. These documents establish distinct responsibilities for educational institutions regarding such allegations, with a different analysis than Supreme Court case law on private rights of action for sexual abuse or harassment. ED has applied a constructive notice requirement for schools to respond to Title IX liability for harassment. The OCR enforces Title IX by investigating complaints and ensuring compliance with regulations, including addressing sexual harassment. ED has applied a constructive notice requirement for schools to respond to Title IX liability for harassment, setting baseline standards for compliance. The Supreme Court has clarified that schools will only be liable for a response that is \"clearly unreasonable.\" ED holds schools responsible for sexual harassment under Title IX, even when a teacher is the perpetrator. The OCR enforces Title IX by investigating complaints and ensuring compliance with regulations, including addressing sexual harassment. Court rejected holding schools responsible for sexual harassment under theories of vicarious liability, but ED has held schools responsible for sexual harassment under Title IX where a teacher commits misconduct in the scope of their employment. In 1997, OCR released a guidance document stating that sexual harassment of students by school employees, other students, or third parties is a form of sex discrimination prohibited by Title IX. The 1997 OCR guidance defines sexual harassment under Title IX as either quid pro quo or hostile environment harassment. In the former, a school employee conditions a student's participation on unwelcome sexual conduct, while in the latter, the conduct creates a hostile educational environment. The 1997 OCR guidance explains that schools can be liable for quid pro quo harassment by an employee in a position of authority or for hostile environment harassment by employees. Schools can also be liable for sexual harassment by other students or third parties if a hostile environment exists. The 1997 OCR guidance states that schools can be held liable for sexual harassment by other students or third parties if a hostile environment exists, and the school fails to take immediate corrective action. Title IX does not make schools responsible for the actions of students but does hold them accountable for their own discrimination in addressing harassment once they are aware of it. The Supreme Court set a standard for liability in cases of harassment by a teacher in Gebser (1998) and Davis (1999), ruling that a school district is liable only when it has actual knowledge of allegations and responds with deliberate indifference. In Gebser and Davis cases, the Supreme Court established standards for school liability in cases of harassment, requiring actual knowledge and deliberate indifference. The Court also emphasized the distinction between actions leading to Title IX liability for damages and administrative requirements imposed by federal agencies. The Supreme Court established standards for school liability in cases of harassment under Title IX, requiring actual knowledge and deliberate indifference. Agencies have the authority to enforce administrative requirements that effectuate Title IX's mandate, even if they do not define discrimination under the statute. This allows agencies to impose procedures and rescind funding for violations, even if they do not lead to liability in private suits for damages. The Supreme Court set standards for school liability in Title IX harassment cases, requiring actual knowledge and deliberate indifference. While breaches may not lead to liability in private suits for damages, agencies can enforce administrative requirements to uphold Title IX, including imposing procedures and rescinding funding for violations. ED's guidance documents reaffirm the liability standard for Title IX sexual harassment violations, distinct from administrative enforcement standards. The liability standard for Title IX sexual harassment violations set by the Supreme Court is different from the standards in administrative enforcement. OCR's 2001 Revised Sexual Harassment Guidance reaffirmed the agency's 1997 standards, distinct from private damages actions. The OCR's 2001 Revised Sexual Harassment Guidance sets a stringent standard for obtaining relief in private damages actions, reaffirming the agency's 1997 standards. It applies to all educational institutions receiving federal funds and outlines compliance standards for enforcing Title IX violations. Schools must have grievance procedures for prompt resolution of sexual harassment complaints to avoid Title IX violations. The OCR's 2001 Revised Sexual Harassment Guidance emphasizes the need for prompt and effective action to address sexual harassment in educational institutions to comply with Title IX regulations. Failure to do so can result in violations of Title IX. The guidance outlines the importance of schools taking immediate steps to end harassment, prevent its recurrence, and address its effects. The 2001 Title IX regulations, issued by the ED, define sexual harassment as \"unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature.\" The guidance aims to address harassment promptly and effectively in educational institutions to comply with Title IX. The 2001 Title IX regulations emphasize moving away from specific labels for types of sexual harassment and focus on whether the harassment denies or limits a student's ability to participate in the school's program based on sex. It outlines quid pro quo harassment and hostile environment harassment as key types of harassment triggering a school's responsibilities under Title IX. In quid pro quo harassment, a teacher conditions benefits on a student's submission to sexual conduct, violating Title IX. Hostile environment harassment requires investigation into conduct serious enough to limit a student's participation in school programs based on sex. In evaluating hostile environment harassment, OCR considers all relevant circumstances, including whether the conduct was welcome. Teachers and employees can create a hostile environment, while student-on-student harassment is generally considered hostile environment harassment rather than quid pro quo harassment. The 2001 Guidance explains that a school's responsibility to address harassment by teachers or school employees depends on whether it occurs within the context of their job responsibilities and limits a student's ability to benefit from a school program. In cases of harassment by teachers or school employees, a school is responsible for discriminatory conduct that limits a student's ability to benefit from a school program. The school must stop the behavior, prevent its recurrence, and remedy the effects for the victim, regardless of whether they had notice of the behavior. The scope of an employee's job responsibilities can determine if sexual harassment occurs, with quid pro quo harassment clearly falling within this scope. OCR evaluates various factors for hostile environment harassment. In cases of harassment, the school is responsible for discriminatory conduct that limits a student's benefit from a school program. The scope of an employee's job responsibilities determines if sexual harassment occurs, with quid pro quo harassment falling within this scope. OCR evaluates factors for hostile environment harassment, even if it doesn't occur within an employee's job responsibilities. Once a school has notice of harassment, it must stop the behavior and prevent its recurrence. In cases of harassment, the school has a duty to stop the harassment and prevent its recurrence. The school is responsible for eliminating a hostile environment created by student-on-student or third-party harassment. If the school fails to take prompt and effective action after being notified of the harassment, it is in violation of Title IX. The school must end the harassment, prevent its recurrence, and remedy the effects for the student. The school is responsible for addressing and preventing harassment to create a safe environment. In cases of sexual harassment, the school must take action to stop the harassment and prevent its recurrence. The 2001 Guidance explains that schools are accountable for harassment by teachers or employees even without prior notice. Responsible employees are expected to report and address any misconduct promptly. An employee with the authority to address harassment or report misconduct is crucial in preventing a hostile environment under Title IX. Schools must take immediate action upon notice of harassment to comply with the law. The 2001 Guidance states that a school must promptly investigate and take effective action to address potential sexual harassment to prevent a hostile environment under Title IX. The 2001 Guidance emphasizes the school's responsibility to promptly investigate and address sexual harassment to prevent a hostile environment under Title IX, even if a formal complaint is not filed. Informal mechanisms may be used if parties agree. The 2001 Guidance emphasizes the school's responsibility to promptly investigate and address sexual harassment under Title IX. Informal mechanisms may be used to resolve complaints if parties agree, but certain procedures like mediation are not appropriate for cases like alleged sexual assault. Due process rights should be ensured without restricting or delaying Title IX protections for the complainant. In 2011, OCR issued a Dear Colleague Letter supplementing its 2001 Guidance on Title IX obligations for schools regarding peer-to-peer harassment. Sexual harassment includes unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature, such as advances and violence. Sexual harassment, including sexual violence, creates a hostile environment in schools. Title IX requires immediate action to address and prevent such harassment. Title IX mandates schools to promptly address and prevent sexual harassment, even if it occurs off-campus. Schools must follow established procedures when handling complaints, considering the impact of off-campus conduct on campus environment. The Letter instructs schools to consider off-campus conduct when evaluating a hostile environment on campus for harassment. It clarifies that a criminal investigation into sexual violence does not exempt a school from conducting a Title IX investigation promptly. Schools are advised to take immediate steps to protect students during a criminal investigation. The 2011 Dear Colleague Letter instructs schools to promptly resume and complete their Title IX investigations after a criminal fact-finding by police. It emphasizes the importance of grievance procedures for resolving sexual harassment complaints, including sexual violence, in a prompt and equitable manner. The 2011 Dear Colleague Letter emphasizes the importance of prompt and equitable resolution of sexual harassment complaints, including sexual violence, by using a preponderance of the evidence standard. This standard is lower than the prior \"clear and convincing\" standard used by some schools. The 2011 Dear Colleague Letter established a preponderance of the evidence standard for resolving sexual harassment complaints, which is lower than the clear and convincing standard. It also discouraged personal cross-examination in hearings and required equal appeal rights for both parties. In 2014, a supplemental Questions and Answers document further clarified schools' responsibilities regarding allegations of sexual harassment. The 2014 supplemental Questions and Answers document clarified schools' obligations under Title IX for allegations of student-on-student sexual violence, emphasizing the need for immediate investigation when potential violence is known or suspected. Title IX requires schools to promptly investigate allegations of student-on-student sexual violence and take effective steps to end the violence, eliminate a hostile environment, prevent recurrence, and remedy its effects. Title IX mandates schools to investigate and address student-on-student sexual violence promptly to end the violence, eliminate a hostile environment, prevent recurrence, and remedy its effects. Additionally, schools must protect complainants and ensure their safety through interim steps before completing an investigation, as outlined in the 2014 Q&A. This document also specifies the responsibilities of a school's Title IX Coordinator, the elements required in written grievance procedures for sexual violence complaints, and the identification of responsible employees who must report incidents. The document outlined the elements needed in a school's grievance procedures for sexual violence complaints and defined responsible employees required to report allegations to the Title IX Coordinator. It emphasized the importance of thorough investigations and the insufficiency of sanctions alone in addressing the hostile environment and preventing recurrence. The imposition of sanctions alone may not be enough to eliminate a hostile environment and prevent recurrence of sexual violence. Title IX investigations do not require the same legal standards as criminal proceedings, and schools must conduct their own investigations even if a criminal investigation is ongoing. The conclusion of a criminal investigation without charges does not relieve a school of its Title IX obligations. The conclusion of a criminal investigation without charges does not affect a school's Title IX obligations. Schools are not required to conduct hearings for allegations of sexual violence, but if they do, they cannot require the complainant to attend. The OCR discourages schools from allowing parties to personally cross-examine each other, suggesting questions be submitted to a third party for screening. Between 2011 and 2016, schools developed procedures to ensure compliance with Title IX in response to guidance from the Department of Education. The specific procedures for investigating sexual harassment allegations vary among educational institutions. Title IX allows for discretion in enforcing the statute's prohibition on sex-based discrimination. The enforcement of Title IX varies across educational institutions, with some discretion given to the Department of Education. However, this discretion is limited for state actors like public universities due to due process protections. Students facing disciplinary actions have challenged the constitutionality of these procedures in state and federal courts. Several students facing disciplinary sanctions in public universities have challenged the constitutionality of Title IX procedures in state and federal courts. They argue that the universities violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment in handling their cases. The Due Process Clause requires states to follow specific procedures when depriving individuals of life, liberty, or property. The Due Process Clause requires states to follow specific procedures when depriving individuals of life, liberty, or property, including protecting against the deprivation of certain \"property interests\" without due process. Protected property interests must originate from an independent source such as state or federal law. To establish a benefit or deprivation of liberty, individuals must demonstrate a legitimate entitlement based on existing rules or state law. Due process is required when a person's reputation is at stake due to government actions. Courts may consider state actions altering legal status as a deprivation of liberty, with varying constitutionally required procedures. Courts balance factors to determine the procedures required before depriving individuals of a protected interest, including the private interest affected, risk of error, and government interest. Individuals with a protected interest are entitled to notice and a chance to be heard before deprivation. The Supreme Court has emphasized that due process is flexible and requires procedural protections based on the specific situation. When balancing factors in cases like Mathews v. Eldridge, the severity of the deprivation plays a crucial role in determining the necessary procedures. Stronger private interests require more formal and exacting procedures to be constitutionally required. The Supreme Court has emphasized that due process requires procedural protections based on the specific situation. Stronger private interests at risk of deprivation require more formal and exacting procedures to be constitutionally required. In Goss v. Lopez, high school students challenged their suspension without a hearing, leading the Court to rule that students facing suspension must be provided with at least some form of due process. The Supreme Court ruled that students facing suspension must be given notice and a hearing, with more formal procedures required for longer suspensions or expulsions. Public universities must adhere to constitutional standards for student suspensions, while private universities are not bound by the Due Process Clause. Public universities must adhere to constitutional standards for student suspensions, while private universities are not bound by the Due Process Clause. Federal courts have ruled that students in public universities have liberty and/or property interests in their education, requiring due process including notice of charges. Federal courts have ruled that public schools must provide students with notice of charges, evidence used, and the opportunity to present their side to an unbiased decisionmaker. Due process requirements vary depending on the circumstances. Colleges have developed procedures to comply with OCR's guidance on responding to sexual harassment allegations. Several courts have issued decisions in cases brought by students challenging disciplinary procedures in federal court regarding allegations of sexual harassment. The discussion below is organized by the type of claim raised against public universities. In cases challenging disciplinary procedures for sexual misconduct, courts have addressed claims against public universities. Claims include lack of notice, denial of confrontation of witnesses, biased decision-makers, and unfair review processes. Some rulings focus on the sufficiency of a student's claim to survive a motion to dismiss. Some judicial rulings address whether a student's claim is sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss in cases of sexual misconduct at public universities. One common legal challenge is the failure to adequately notify students of the charges, but courts generally find no due process violation if timely notice of charges is provided along with a meaningful opportunity to prepare. The absence of proper notice grounds can lead to a viable due process claim for students facing disciplinary hearings. For example, a student at a university historians University,.................................................................................................... The student faced a three-year suspension from the university for sexual misconduct. A federal court ruled that the lack of notice could be a due process violation, allowing the student's claim to proceed. Another case involved a student who was expelled for misconduct not included in the initial notice of charges. The court found that the limited scope of focus provided to the student was insufficient. The federal district court ruled that the school deprived a student of a liberty interest without due process of law in a case involving sexual misconduct. The Sixth Circuit also found a due process violation when a university suspended a student for suspected sexual assault without providing necessary information. The Sixth Circuit ruled that a university violated due process when it suspended a student for suspected sexual assault without providing the evidence used in the disciplinary decision. This failure to provide evidence was deemed a constitutional violation, as schools are required to disclose evidence in significant disciplinary cases. The Sixth Circuit ruled that a school must provide evidence in significant disciplinary cases to avoid violating due process. Students have claimed due process violations for lack of cross-examination opportunities in disciplinary hearings, but courts have generally rejected these arguments. Courts have been more willing to entertain due process claims in disciplinary cases when students are denied the opportunity to challenge witness credibility. Cross-examination is not always considered necessary in civil proceedings, and the Due Process Clause does not guarantee the right to cross-examination in school disciplinary proceedings. In recent cases, students challenged university adjudicatory proceedings regarding sexual assault allegations. Accused students were allowed to submit written questions to a panel chair instead of directly cross-examining the complainant. Despite this, due process challenges to the proceedings were rejected by the reviewing district court and the Sixth Circuit. The Sixth Circuit rejected a due process challenge to a university's disciplinary hearing on sexual assault allegations. Students could submit written questions but not follow-up questions, and the panel did not ask all questions submitted. The court found this satisfied the limited cross-examination requirement. The Fifth Circuit rejected a due process challenge to a university's disciplinary proceedings where challengers argued they were denied effective cross-examination. The court noted the decision did not rely on testimonial evidence but on videos and a photo. Courts have often ruled in favor of cross-examination where credibility is critical. The Sixth Circuit ruled in favor of due process challenges when a university failed to provide cross-examination in a disciplinary hearing where credibility was crucial. The decision to suspend a student was based solely on hearsay without the opportunity for questioning. The court emphasized the importance of allowing cross-examination in disciplinary hearings to assess credibility and ensure due process. A live hearing may be necessary to address due process claims effectively. The university's decision was based on credibility, and the absence of a live hearing can lead to a due process claim. A federal court ordered a university to provide a live hearing for an accused student facing expulsion to ensure due process. The university's procedures involved private questioning by an investigator, leading to a determination of culpability without a hearing. The court found that the university violated the accused student's right to due process by reaching a determination of culpability without a hearing. The Sixth Circuit ruled that in cases where credibility is at issue, the accused student must have the opportunity to cross-examine the accuser and witnesses in the presence of a neutral fact-finder. The Sixth Circuit ruled that the university violated the accused student's due process rights by not allowing a live hearing or the opportunity to cross-examine the accuser and adverse witnesses in the presence of a neutral fact-finder. The Sixth Circuit ruled that the university violated the accused student's due process rights by not allowing a live hearing or the opportunity to cross-examine the accuser and adverse witnesses in the presence of a neutral fact-finder. Some students have also claimed they were denied the chance to present exculpatory evidence, such as physical evidence or text messages, in their defense during disciplinary hearings. The student was unable to present text messages as exculpatory evidence at a sexual assault disciplinary hearing, leading to concerns of due process violation. Courts generally assume school disciplinary panels are impartial unless actual bias is shown. School disciplinary panels are presumed to be impartial unless actual bias is proven. A plaintiff must provide evidence to overcome this presumption, such as showing statements or a pattern of bias. For example, a Fifth Circuit panel rejected a due process claim of bias in a university disciplinary hearing for sexual assault due to a lack of evidence undermining the proceedings' integrity. The court found that the victim advocate investigated charges against the accused using photo and video evidence, with no indication that a different investigator would have found different information. The university attorney advised the panel to draw their own conclusions from the evidence, but evidence of bias in decisionmakers' behavior could impact due process. The Sixth Circuit recently ruled that a student's due process claim was valid when he alleged bias in a university disciplinary hearing for sexual assault. One panel member acted as investigator, prosecutor, and judge, making biased remarks to diminish the defendant's credibility. This behavior raised concerns about due process violations. The student alleged bias in a university disciplinary hearing for sexual assault, claiming a panel member made prejudiced remarks and acted as investigator, prosecutor, and judge. This behavior raised concerns about due process violations, including lack of impartiality and pre-judgment of the case. Courts have also addressed claims of bias due to institutional pressures, such as unbalanced sexual assault training for university officials. One district court rejected a due process claim regarding biased university staff in sexual assault cases, stating the training aimed to raise awareness of sexual assault. Another court dismissed claims of railroading accused students without evidence. The court rejected a motion to dismiss a due process claim brought by an expelled student alleging biased training materials for the panel who decided his case. The court raised concerns about an assumption of guilt in the training materials, potentially compromising the panel's decision-making process. The court raised concerns about biased training materials for the panel deciding a student's case, potentially compromising the decision-making process and leading to a possible due process violation. Federal district court cases have addressed similar allegations of unfair review processes in university disciplinary proceedings. The district court found the university's new hearing process unfair to the student in a sexual assault case. Another case involved a student initially found not responsible for misconduct but later found guilty without sufficient notice or time to respond. The school was found guilty of unfairness in a sexual assault case after the student was not given proper notice or time to respond to new evidence. The appeals board reversed the initial decision without explanation or allowing the student to present their case. The student was found not responsible for sexual misconduct without a proper hearing. A university expelled a student for sexual assault despite being found not responsible initially. The presiding individual conducted off-the-record meetings with the accuser. The presiding individual overseeing the appeal expelled the student without a proper hearing, conducting off-the-record meetings with the accuser. The court ruled that this violated due process as the student was not given a fair chance to defend himself. In September 2017, OCR withdrew the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter and 2014 Questions and Answers document, stating it would begin the rulemaking process to codify schools' responsibilities under Title IX. ED continued to rely on the 2001 Guidance and issued a new Question and Answer document addressing sexual misconduct, allowing schools to resolve complaints through mediation in certain circumstances. The document issued by the Department of Education addresses how schools can handle sexual misconduct complaints, including the option of mediation. A proposed rule would change schools' responsibilities in responding to sexual harassment allegations, narrowing the definition of sexual harassment under Title IX. The proposed regulation by the Department of Education would define sexual harassment more narrowly under Title IX, require \"actual notice\" of harassment for schools to respond, only consider a school's response as a violation if it shows deliberate indifference, and introduce new procedural requirements to ensure due process during investigations. The proposed regulation by the Department of Education would define sexual harassment more narrowly under Title IX, with specific criteria for quid pro quo, hostile environment, and sexual assault. Notably, it would establish a higher threshold for proving a Title IX violation based on hostile environment. The Department of Education's proposed regulation would establish a higher threshold for proving a Title IX violation based on hostile environment harassment, deviating from past definitions of sexual harassment under Title IX. The Department of Education's proposed regulation would establish a higher threshold for proving a Title IX violation based on hostile environment harassment, defining it as \"unwelcome conduct on the basis of sex that is so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to the recipient's education program or activity.\" The proposed regulations would define a hostile environment as conduct that is severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive, denying equal access to education. Schools would only have a duty to respond to sexual harassment allegations when they have \"actual knowledge.\" The proposal establishes that schools must respond to sexual harassment allegations only when they have \"actual knowledge,\" defined as notice to a school's Title IX Coordinator or official with authority to take corrective measures. This threshold aims to align with past guidance from the Department of Education. The proposal sets a threshold for schools to respond to sexual harassment allegations, requiring \"actual knowledge\" for triggering obligations. It aligns with past Department of Education guidance and limits schools to respond only to harassment within their education program or activity. This contrasts with previous guidance that sometimes held schools responsible for harassment outside these boundaries. The proposed regulations set a new standard for schools to respond to sexual harassment allegations, requiring a response that is not \"deliberately indifferent.\" This is a departure from past guidance that required schools to process all complaints of sexual violence, regardless of where the conduct occurred. The proposed regulations introduce a new standard for schools to address sexual harassment allegations, emphasizing a response that is not \"deliberately indifferent.\" This standard aims to hold schools accountable while allowing flexibility in disciplinary decisions. Safe harbor provisions are outlined for schools in three specific situations to avoid a finding of deliberate indifference. The proposed regulations introduce grievance procedures for schools to follow when handling Title IX complaints to avoid being found deliberately indifferent. Compliance with these procedures can negate any inference of discrimination. The proposed regulations introduce grievance procedures for schools to follow when handling Title IX complaints to avoid being found deliberately indifferent. Compliance with these procedures can negate any inference of discrimination, especially in situations where supportive measures are offered to the complainant to restore access to education programs. The proposed regulations for handling Title IX complaints require schools to respond to sexual harassment cases without being deliberately indifferent. Schools must conduct a risk analysis before removing an accused individual from an educational program on an emergency basis. The proposed regulations for handling Title IX complaints require schools to respond to sexual harassment cases without being deliberately indifferent. Schools must conduct a risk analysis before removing an accused individual from an educational program on an emergency basis. The regulations also ensure that accused individuals are provided with notice and an opportunity to challenge the decision, and allow schools to place nonstudent employees on administrative leave during investigations. Due process protections for accused students are emphasized in the fact-finding process and determination of culpability. Upon receipt of a formal Title IX complaint regarding sexual harassment, a school must provide written notice to relevant parties of the allegations and available grievance procedures. The school's grievance procedures must treat complainants and respondents equitably. The proposal ensures equitable treatment for both complainants and respondents in school grievance procedures related to sexual harassment under Title IX. It mandates remedies for complainants and due process protections for respondents, with discrimination possible if either party is treated unfairly. Objective evaluation of evidence is required in the process. The procedures for handling sexual harassment under Title IX require an objective evaluation of evidence, unbiased individuals in the process, training on student safety and due process, a presumption of innocence for respondents, and details on possible sanctions, remedies, evidence standards, appeals, and supportive measures. The proposed regulations for handling sexual harassment under Title IX require schools to place the burden of proof on themselves, allow equal opportunity for both parties to present evidence, and permit parties to have their choice of advisor during proceedings. The proposed regulations for handling sexual harassment under Title IX require schools to provide equal opportunities for both parties during proceedings, including the choice of advisor, written notice of hearing details, and a live hearing with cross-examination allowed. The proposed regulations for handling sexual harassment under Title IX require schools to allow cross-examination by the party's advisor, use technology for cross-examination if requested, not rely on statements without cross-examination, provide equal opportunity to review evidence, and develop a report summarizing evidence for both parties. The proposed regulations for handling sexual harassment under Title IX require a live hearing with cross-examination by each party's advisor. Decision-making must be done by someone other than the investigator or Title IX Coordinator, preventing a single individual from both investigating and determining culpability. The new regulations for handling sexual harassment under Title IX require a live hearing with cross-examination by each party's advisor. Decision-making must be done by someone other than the investigator or Title IX Coordinator, preventing a single individual from both investigating and determining culpability. Schools can choose between a preponderance of evidence or clear and convincing standard, with consistent application for all types of conduct violations. Appeals of decisions are optional for schools. The new regulations for handling sexual harassment under Title IX require a live hearing with cross-examination by each party's advisor. Schools may allow appeals of decisions, must facilitate an informal resolution process with consent, and apply the same evidence standard for complaints against students, employees, and faculty. Title IX prohibits discrimination based on sex in educational programs. The statute of Title IX prohibits discrimination based on sex in educational programs but does not specifically address sexual abuse, harassment, or assault. Federal courts have had to determine when relief is available for individual victims of such conduct, as the statute is silent on these issues. The Supreme Court has created a remedial scheme for a private right of action to address these claims, using an approach to infer how Congress would have addressed the issue if it had been explicitly included in the statute. The Supreme Court sought to address claims regarding sexual abuse, harassment, or assault under Title IX by inferring how Congress would have handled the issue if it had been explicitly included in the statute. Federal agencies have issued guidelines on the responsibilities of educational institutions in complying with Title IX, but the sparse statutory language has led to shifting guidelines. Congress has the discretion to modify Title IX to clarify standards in private suits for damages and administrative enforcement. Congress has substantial discretion to modify Title IX to clarify standards in private suits for damages and administrative enforcement, including defining specific conduct for sexual abuse or harassment violations. Legislation could differentiate between harassment in different educational settings and distinguish between teacher and student harassment. The private right of action under Title IX has been judicially implied, not expressly codified in statute.
