It features a robust distributed reading and writing mechanism and is analytically tractable for optimal online compression. Formulated as a hierarchical conditional generative model, the memory enhances generative models trained on Omniglot and CIFAR datasets. Our memory model significantly improves generative models trained on Omniglot and CIFAR datasets compared to DNC and its variants. The basic problem of efficiently using memory in neural networks remains an open question. Slot-based external memory in models like DNC often collapses reading and writing into single slots. In models like Differentiable Neural Computers (DNCs), the slot-based external memory collapses reading and writing into single slots, limiting information sharing. Matching Networks and Neural Episodic Controller store embeddings directly, requiring memory volume to increase with stored samples. In contrast, the Neural Statistician summarizes datasets by averaging their embeddings, reducing the need for additional memory slots. The Neural Statistician BID7 summarizes datasets by averaging embeddings, which may drop information. Associative memory architectures like the Hopfield Net BID14 store data in low-energy states, providing insight into efficient memory structures. The Hopfield Net BID14 stores patterns in low-energy states, limited by recurrent connections. The Boltzmann Machine BID1 introduces latent variables but has slow reading and writing mechanisms. Kanerva's sparse distributed memory model BID15 allows fast reads and writes, dissociating capacity from input dimensionality. The paper introduces a conditional generative memory model inspired by Kanerva's sparse distributed memory. It generalizes the model with learnable addresses and reparametrized latent variables. The model solves the challenge of learning an effective memory writing operation by deriving a Bayesian memory update rule. Our proposal introduces a Bayesian memory update rule in a hierarchical generative model, adapting quickly to new data. It enriches priors in VAE-like models through an adaptive memory system, offering effective online distributed writing for compression and storage of complex data. Our proposal introduces a Bayesian memory update rule in a hierarchical generative model for effective online distributed writing, enhancing priors in VAE-like models through an adaptive memory system. The memory architecture extends the variational autoencoder (VAE) by deriving the prior from an adaptive memory store, with parameters \u03b8 for the generative model and \u03c6 for the inference model. The paper introduces a Bayesian memory update rule in a hierarchical generative model for online distributed writing. Parameters \u03b8 and \u03c6 represent the generative and inference models, respectively. The VAE's objective is to maximize log-likelihood by optimizing \u03b8 and \u03c6 for a variational lower-bound of the likelihood. The paper introduces a Bayesian memory update rule in a hierarchical generative model for online distributed writing. It aims to optimize parameters \u03b8 and \u03c6 for a variational lower-bound of the likelihood, focusing on reconstructing x using an approximated posterior sample and encouraging the posterior to be close to the prior of z. The model utilizes the concept of an exchangeable episode and trains for expected conditional log-likelihood. The training objective is the expected conditional log-likelihood BID5. The joint distribution is factorized into the marginal distribution and the posterior, allowing for writing data into memory. This approach is a principled way of formulating memory-based generative models, maximizing mutual information. Formulating memory-based generative models involves maximizing mutual information between the memory and the episode to store. The joint distribution of the generative model can be factorized, utilizing conditional independence of variables. The memory is represented as a random matrix in the model. The memory M is a K \u00d7 C random matrix with a matrix variate Gaussian distribution. The distribution is equivalent to the multivariate Gaussian distribution of vectorised M. Independence is assumed between columns but not rows of M. The memory matrix M is a K \u00d7 C random matrix with independence between columns but not rows. The addresses A are a K \u00d7 S matrix optimized through back-propagation, with rows normalized to have L2-norms of 1. The addressing variable yt computes weights for memory access, following an isotropic Gaussian distribution N(0, 1) for the prior p\u03b8(yt). The addressing variable yt computes weights for memory access using an isotropic Gaussian distribution. A learned projection transforms yt into a key vector, and weights across the rows of the memory matrix are computed. The projection is implemented as a multi-layer perception to potentially suit addressing better. The code zt generates samples of xt through a parametrised conditional distribution tied for all time steps. The code zt generates samples of xt through a parametrised conditional distribution with a memory-dependent prior. The prior's mean is a linear combination of memory rows, resulting in a richer marginal distribution. In the hierarchical model, M is a global latent variable capturing episode statistics, while local latent variables yt and zt capture local information. In a hierarchical model, M is a global latent variable capturing episode statistics, while local latent variables y t and z t capture local information for data x t within an episode. The posterior distribution q \u03c6 (z t |x t , y t , M ) refines the prior distribution p \u03b8 (z t |y t , M ) with additional evidence. The parameterised posterior distribution q \u03c6 (z t |x t , y t , M ) refines the prior distribution p \u03b8 (z t |y t , M ) with additional evidence from x t, balancing the trade-off between preserving old information and writing new information optimally through Bayes' rule. The trade-off between preserving old information and writing new information can be balanced optimally through Bayes' rule. Memory writing can be interpreted as inference, computing the posterior distribution of memory. Batch inference involves directly computing the posterior, while online inference involves sequentially accumulating evidence. The approximated posterior distribution of memory can be written as a display form, using one sample to approximate the integral. The posterior of the addressing variable is the same as in a previous section. The posterior of memory p \u03b8 (M |Y, Z) is analytically tractable in the linear Gaussian model (eq. 6), with parameters R and U updated based on the prediction error. The posterior of memory p \u03b8 (M |Y, Z) in the linear Gaussian model is analytically tractable, with parameters R and U updated using Bayes' rule. The prior parameters R 0 and U 0 are trained through back-propagation to learn the general structure of the dataset. The prior parameters of p(M), R0, and U0 are trained through back-propagation to learn the general structure of the dataset. The update rule involves inverting \u03a3z, with a complexity of O(T3). On-line updating can reduce the per-step cost by using one sample at a time. Updating using the entire episode at once is equivalent to performing the one-sample/on-line update iteratively for all observations in the episode. The update rule involves inverting \u03a3z with a complexity of O(T3). Updating using the entire episode at once is equivalent to performing the one-sample/on-line update iteratively for all observations in the episode. Intermediate updates can be done using mini-batch with size between 1 and T. The storage and multiplication of the memory's row-covariance matrix U has a complexity of O(K2), but restricting it to diagonal can reduce this cost to O(K). To train the model, a variational lower-bound of the conditional likelihood is optimized. Sampling is used for computational efficiency, with a mean-field approximation for memory. Future work includes investigating low-rank approximation of U for better cost-performance balance. The model uses a mean-field approximation for memory to improve computational efficiency. It penalizes complex addresses and deviation from the memory-based prior to learn useful representations. The model utilizes an iterative reading mechanism to decrease errors and converge to stored memory. This process involves feeding back the reconstruction multiple times, similar to Gibbs-like sampling. The model uses an iterative reading mechanism to improve denoising and sampling by converging to stored memory through feeding back the reconstruction multiple times. This process involves using q \u03c6 (y t |x t , M ) instead of q \u03c6 (y t |x t ) for addressing. Training a parameterised model with the whole matrix M as input can be costly, but it is known to be beneficial in the coding literature. The model uses iterative reading to improve denoising and sampling by converging to stored memory through feedback. Training a parameterised model with the whole matrix M can be costly, but intractable posteriors in non-tree graphs can be efficiently approximated using loopy belief-propagation. Iterative sampling with the model is likely to converge to the true posterior q \u03c6 (y t |x t , M ). Future research will aim to better understand this process. Model implementation details are in Appendix C. The model implementation details are described in Appendix C, using encoder and decoder models to evaluate improvements with an adaptive memory. The experiments use the same model architecture with variations in filters, memory size, and code size for Omniglot and CIFAR datasets. The Adam optimizer was used for training with minimal tuning, reporting the variational lower bound in all experiments. In experiments, the Adam optimizer was used with minimal tuning. The model was tested on the Omniglot dataset, which contains hand-written characters with 1623 classes. A 64 \u00d7 100 memory M and a smaller 64 \u00d7 50 address matrix A were used. 32 images were randomly sampled from the training set for simplicity. In experiments, a 64 \u00d7 100 memory M and a smaller 64 \u00d7 50 address matrix A were used. 32 images were randomly sampled from the training set to form an \"episode\". The model was optimized using Adam with a learning rate of 1 \u00d7 10 \u22124. The model was also tested on the CIFAR dataset, where label information was discarded. For the CIFAR dataset, convolutional coders with 32 features at each layer, a code size of 200, and a 128 \u00d7 200 memory with a 128 \u00d7 50 address matrix were used. The model was tested in an unsupervised setting without label information. Training process was compared with a baseline VAE model using the same encoder and decoder. The training process of the model was compared with a baseline VAE model using the same encoder and decoder. There was a modest increase in parameters in the Kanerva Machine compared to the VAE. The negative variational lower bound, reconstruction loss, and KL-Divergence were monitored during learning, showing that the model learned to use memory. Learning curves for the model and VAE on the Omniglot dataset were plotted, with stable training observed. The Kanerva Machine model showed better performance compared to the VAE model on the Omniglot dataset. It achieved lower negative variational lower-bound, improved reconstruction, and lower KL-divergence. The model learned to use memory effectively, as seen in the sharp decrease in KL-divergence around the 2000th step. The model effectively uses memory to provide a rich prior for the code, as shown by the near-zero KL-divergence for z t in FIG0. This improvement comes with a lower KL-divergence for y t, which is still lower than in a VAE. Similar training curves are observed for CIFAR training in FIG0. Previous studies also noted the importance of reducing KL-divergence for improving sample quality. The reduction in KL-divergence, rather than the reduction in reconstruction loss, was crucial for improving sample quality in experiments with Omniglot and CIFAR. At the end of training, the VAE reached a negative log-likelihood (NLL) of \u2264 112.7, comparable to results with IWAE training. The Kanerva Machine achieved a conditional NLL of 68.3 with the same encoder and decoders. Comparing results with unconditional generative models may not be fair. The Kanerva Machine achieved a conditional NLL of 68.3 with the same encoder and decoders, showcasing the power of incorporating an adaptive memory into generative models. The weights were well distributed over the memory, illustrating patterns written into the memory were superimposed on others. The weights in the memory were widely distributed, showcasing patterns being superimposed. The reconstruction process through iterative reading was demonstrated, showing the denoising effect. The study aimed to generalize \"one-shot\" generation to a batch of images with various classes and samples. In this section, the study demonstrates the generation of samples from a batch of images with different classes and samples using trained models. The sample quality improves with consecutive iterations, reflecting the conditioning patterns' statistics. Most samples stabilize after the 6th iteration, indicating the effectiveness of iterative sampling. The study shows that iterative sampling improves sample quality, with most samples stabilizing after the 6th iteration. However, this approach does not apply to VAEs due to their different structure. Figure 5 compares samples from CIFAR dataset. Conditioning images are randomly sampled and show different classes. Samples from Kanerva Machine have clear local structures, unlike blurred samples from VAE. The model can recover original images from corrupted inputs through iterative reading. Our model can recover original images from corrupted inputs through iterative reading, showing that input images can be recovered over several iterations. Despite high ambiguity, some cases produced incorrect but still reasonable patterns. The model's structure allows for interpretability of internal representations in memory, with linear interpolations between address weights expected to be meaningful.

The training curves of DNC and Kanerva machine show differences in sensitivity to random initialization and speed, with DNC plateauing with larger errors. The training curves of DNC and Kanerva machine show differences in sensitivity to random initialization and speed, with DNC plateauing with larger errors. DNCs were more sensitive to random initialization, slower, and plateaued with larger error. The test variational lower-bounds of a DNC and a Kanerva Machine were compared using the same episode storage and retrieval task with Omniglot data. The models were fit into the same framework for a fair comparison. The DNC and Kanerva Machine were compared in a training process with Omniglot data. The DNC was sensitive to hyper-parameters and random initialization, while the Kanerva Machine was robust and performed well with various settings. The Kanerva Machine showed robust performance with batch sizes between 8 and 64 and learning rates between 3 \u00d7 10 \u22125 and 3 \u00d7 10 \u22124, training fastest with batch size 16 and learning rate 1 \u00d7 10 \u22124. It is easier to train compared to the DNC due to principled reading and writing operations. The model's capacity was analyzed by storing and retrieving patterns from increasingly large episodes. The Kanerva Machine demonstrated strong performance with various batch sizes and learning rates, outperforming the DNC in terms of generalization to larger episodes. The model's capacity was tested by storing and retrieving patterns from episodes with different numbers of classes. The Kanerva Machine outperformed the DNC in generalization to larger episodes by combining slow-learning neural networks and a fast-adapting linear Gaussian model as memory. Memory is implemented as a generative model, allowing retrieval of unseen patterns through sampling. The model generalizes Kanerva's memory model to continuous, non-uniform data while maintaining an analytic form of Bayesian inference. Our model is the first to generalize Kanerva's memory model to continuous, non-uniform data while integrating with deep neural networks for modern machine learning. Unlike other models, our model quickly adapts to new data for episode-based learning. Our model learns to store information in a compressed form by taking advantage of statistical regularity in images via the encoder at the perceptual level. Our model efficiently updates memory using an exact Bayes' update-rule, combining classical statistical models with neural networks for promising memory performance. The model discussed combines classical statistical models with neural networks for efficient memory updates. Kanerva's memory model features distributed reading and writing operations with fixed addresses pointing to a modifiable memory. Kanerva's memory model involves fixed addresses pointing to a modifiable memory of uniform random vectors. Input vectors are compared with addresses using Hamming distance, with selection based on a threshold \u03c4. The memory model by Kanerva involves selecting addresses based on the hamming distance between input vectors and addresses. The selected addresses are used to store and retrieve information from memory. The process is sparse and can be iterated multiple times. Kanerva's memory model involves selecting addresses based on hamming distance. Sparse operations allow correct retrieval even with over-written content. Kanerva's model is limited by the assumption of uniform binary data distribution, which is rarely true in real-world data. The assumption of uniform binary data distribution, crucial for Kanerva's analyses, is rarely true in real-world data. The model architecture includes a convolutional encoder for image input conversion into embedding vectors. The model architecture includes a convolutional encoder with 3 blocks, each consisting of a convolutional layer with a 4x4 filter and a ResNet block. The output is flattened and projected to a 2C dimensional vector. The convolutional decoder mirrors this structure with transposed convolutional layers. The \"MLP\" boxes in the figure represent 2-layer multi-layer perceptrons with ReLU non-linearity. Adding noise to the input into q \u03c6 (y t |x t ) helps stabilize the model. Adding noise to the input into q \u03c6 (y t |x t ) helps stabilize training, possibly by restricting information in the addresses. The magnitude of the noise is not critical, using Gaussian noise with zero mean and standard deviation of 0.2 for all experiments. Different likelihood functions are used for Omniglot and CIFAR datasets. To prevent Gaussian likelihood collapsing, uniform noise U(0, 1 256 ) is added to CIFAR images during training. The differentiable neural computer (DNC) is wrapped with the same interface as the Kanerva memory for a fair comparison. During training, uniform noise U(0, 1/256) is added to CIFAR images. The differentiable neural computer (DNC) is wrapped with the same interface as the Kanerva memory for a fair comparison. DNC receives addressing variable y_t and z_t during writing, with separated reading and writing stages in experiments. During writing, the DNC discards the read-out and only keeps its state as memory. Reading involves discarding the state at each step to prevent storing new information. A 2-layer MLP with 200 hidden neurons and ReLU nonlinearity is used as the controller instead of LSTM to avoid interference with DNC's external memory. Controllers bypassing the memory output can be confusing in the auto-encoding setting. In our auto-encoding setting, we ensure that the DNC only reads-out from its memory by removing controller output that bypasses the memory. To focus on memory performance, we analyze the covariance between memory rows and compare test loss for models using full covariance matrix versus diagonal covariance matrix. The study compares models using full covariance matrix versus diagonal covariance matrix in terms of test loss. The models trained on similar machines show that those using full covariance matrices were slightly slower per-iteration but had a quicker decrease in test loss. The models focus on reconstructing solely using read-outs from the memory. The study compares models using full covariance matrix versus diagonal covariance matrix in terms of test loss.

The models focus on reconstructing solely using read-outs from the memory. The negative variational lower bound, reconstruction loss, and total KL-divergence during CIFAR training are discussed, with the advantage of the Kanerva Machine over the VAE increasing. The Kanerva Machine has an advantage over the VAE, with a linear Gaussian model defined in Eq. 6. The joint distribution and posterior distribution are derived using Gaussian conditional formulas. The update rule is rearranged from matrix variate Gaussian distribution properties. The model described in the paper utilizes samples from q \u03c6 (z t |x t ) for writing to memory and mean-field approximation during reading. An alternative approach fully exploits the analytic tractability of the Gaussian distribution, using parameters \u03c8 = {R, U, V} for memory operations."
