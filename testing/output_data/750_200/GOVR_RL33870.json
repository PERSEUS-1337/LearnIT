    "content": "The 107th Congress approved reauthorization legislation to amend and extend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) and the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act (SDFSCA) through FY2007. The President requested $324.2 million for FY2008, with $100 million for state grants and $224.2 million for national programs. For FY2007, the President requested $216.0 million for national programs only, not for state grants. For FY2007, the President requested $216.0 million for the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities program, with no funding for state grants. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $526.0 million, including $310 million for state grants, while the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $492.5 million, also with $310 million for state grants. Congress appropriated $568.8 million for the program in FY2006, with $346.5 million for state grants and $222.3 million for national programs. The program operates at FY2006 levels under a continuing resolution. The SDFSC program received $568.8 million in FY2006, with $346.5 million for state grants and $222.3 million for national programs. The program operates at FY2006 levels under a continuing resolution through February 15, 2007. The 107th Congress discussed SDFSCA reauthorization and appropriations for the program. The No Child Left Behind Act amended and reauthorized SDFSCA as Part A of Title IV\u201421st Century Schools to prevent drug abuse and violence. The SDFSCA was reauthorized as Part A of Title IV\u201421st Century Schools, authorizing funds for the SDFSC program to prevent drug abuse and violence in schools. State grants are awarded to SEAs, LEAs, and outlying areas in all 50 states, DC, and Puerto Rico. Funds also support national leadership projects to prevent drug abuse and violence among youth. National programs receive discretionary funds to prevent drug abuse and violence in schools at all educational levels. For FY2002, $650 million was authorized for state grants, with specific allocations for Guam, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and programs for Indian youth. For FY2002, $650 million was authorized for state grants, with specific allocations for Guam, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. 1% or $4.75 million is reserved for the Secretary of the Interior for Indian youth programs, and 0.2% is reserved for native Hawaiians. The remaining funds are distributed to states, DC, and Puerto Rico based on population and ESEA Title I, Part A concentration grants. No state receives less than 0.5% of the total allotted or the amount received in FY2001. The state grants for FY2001 were $428.6 million, with redistribution possible if funds are not used within two years. A 10% increase in state grant funding is required for any increase in national program appropriations. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act removed the limitation provision for FY2006. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act removed the limitation provision for FY2006 state grant funding, which needed a 10% increase in national program appropriations. For FY2007, the Administration did not propose funding for state grants. 20% of the state allotment goes to the Governor for competitive grants, with a 3% cap on administrative costs. The Governor may use up to 3% of funds for administrative costs in grants and contracts to various entities. SEAs must distribute at least 93% of funds to LEAs for drug and violence prevention programs. LEAs can use up to 2% of state funds for administrative costs. In addition to the 3% for administrative costs, SEAs in FY2002 could have used 1% of their allotment to implement a uniform management information and reporting system (UMIRS) to collect information on truancy rates, violence, and drug-related crimes in schools. The curr_chunk discusses the types of curricula, programs, and services provided by various entities in response to violence and drug-related crimes in schools, as well as the prevalence of drug use and violence among minors. SEAs are allowed to use up to 5% of funds for state activities such as capacity building, technical assistance, and program improvement. The Administration developed the PART instrument to evaluate program performance across federal agencies. In 2002 and 2006, the state grants component of the SDFSC program was rated as \"ineffective\" due to a lack of demonstrated effectiveness and funds being spread too thinly. Approximately 64% of LEAs were supported by the program. The Administration decided to terminate the state grants program due to funding being too low to support quality interventions and a lack of measurable outcomes. This decision was influenced by the PART assessment and fiscal constraints affecting the FY2007 budget. The Administration proposed to terminate the state grants program in the FY2007 budget to prioritize higher-priority national programs, including SDFSC programs. The national program component was seen as more promising in achieving results and expanding knowledge on drug and violence prevention methods. National programs were believed to provide direct support to select LEAs with sufficient funding to make a difference, allowing for progress assessment and effectiveness measurement by grantees and evaluators. The Department of Education's strategy to assess the effectiveness of state grants program includes using national survey data from the CDC's Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System. This data, along with information on program implementation, will help determine the prevalence of teen drug use and violence nationwide. The Department of Education is evaluating the effectiveness of state grants programs by using national survey data to assess the prevalence of teen drug use and violence nationwide. Funds are available for national programs to improve data collection and analysis for SDFSC programs. The ED Secretary can use funds from national programs to work with other agencies in administering programs to prevent violence and drug use among students. Up to $2 million can be reserved for evaluating the impact of the SDFSC program, and funds are also set aside for the Safe Schools/Healthy Students initiative. The National Coordinator Initiative was established in FY1999 to help LEAs recruit, hire, and train staff for SDFSC programs. In FY1999, the National Coordinator Initiative was created under national programs to recruit, hire, and train SDFSC program coordinators in middle schools. The initiative aimed to address drug experimentation and violence among middle school students. NCLBA expanded this initiative to all schools with drug and safety issues, but funding was terminated in FY2004. Funding for the National Coordinator Initiative, aimed at addressing drug and safety issues in schools, was terminated in FY2004. Grants may be awarded to school districts to reduce alcohol abuse in secondary schools. Grants may be awarded to school districts and community-based groups to reduce alcohol abuse in secondary schools and support mentoring programs for children in middle schools. Other initiatives include grants to assist localities affected by hate crimes and a School Security Technology program. The programs proposed include grants for assisting localities affected by hate crimes, creating a School Security Technology and Resource Center at Sandia National Laboratories, and establishing a National Center for School and Youth Safety. The President requested $324.2 million for the SDFSC program in FY2008 to improve school security, establish a National Center for School and Youth Safety, and provide emergency assistance to local communities in response to school safety crises. The President requested $324.2 million for the SDFSC program in FY2008 for school security, a National Center for School and Youth Safety, and emergency assistance. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $526.0 million, including $310 million for state grants and $216.0 million for national programs. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $492.5 million for the SDFSC program. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $492.5 million for the SDFSC program, including $310 million for state grants and $182.5 million for national programs. This is $276.5 million more than requested but $76.3 million less than the FY2006 appropriation. The Administration appropriated $568.8 million for the SDFSC program in FY2007, with $346.5 million for state grants and $222.3 million for national programs. The President did not request state grant funding due to fiscal constraints and an ineffective PART review. For FY2008, funding was not requested for the mentoring program. For FY2007, the President did not request funding for the mentoring program, as it was the final year of a two-year phase-out. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended $19 million for the program, matching the President's request. In FY2006, Congress appropriated $49.3 million for mentoring, but a 1% budget reduction lowered funding to $48.8 million. The Administration did not request funding for the Alcohol Abuse Reduction (AAR) program from FY2005 through FY2008, as it was considered duplicative of other activities. Congress, however, appropriated $32.7 million for AAR in FY2005 and FY2006. Funding was slightly reduced to $32.4 million in FY2006 due to a required budget reduction. In FY2007, the House did not recommend funding for AAR, but the Senate recommended $32.4 million, the same as FY2006. The House Appropriations Committee did not recommend funding for AAR in FY2007, while the Senate recommended $32.4 million, the same as the previous year. The SDFSC program operates at FY2006 levels under a continuing resolution. The Gun-Free Schools Act is part of SDFSCA, requiring states to have laws expelling students bringing weapons to school. The Gun-Free Schools Act (GFSA) requires states to have laws expelling students bringing weapons to school. Each state receiving funds under the No Child Left Behind Act must have a law mandating LEAs to expel students bringing weapons, with the option for LEA officers to modify on a case-by-case basis. States can allow expelled students to receive educational services in an alternative setting. LEAs requesting assistance through GFSA funds must assure compliance with expulsion requirements and provide details on the circumstances of expulsions. The Gun-Free Schools Act (GFSA) mandates states to expel students who bring weapons to school. Each state must report expulsion details, including the school's name, number of students expelled, and type of firearms involved, to the ED Secretary annually. LEAs must have a policy to report students with firearms to the justice system to receive GFSA funds. Exceptions include lawfully stored firearms in locked vehicles on school property or for approved activities with appropriate safeguards. During the 109th Congress, bills related to school safety and violence prevention were introduced, but most died except for H.R. 3010. This bill, the Department of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2006, was amended to require the ED Secretary to evaluate the effectiveness of violence prevention programs receiving funding. The Senate amended the Appropriations Act of 2006 to require a study on violence prevention programs funded under SDFSCA, but it did not become law. Another amendment to increase funding for the SDFSC program was ruled out of order. Other bills introduced included the Bullying and Gang Prevention for School Safety and Crime Reduction Act of 2005 and a bill to include bullying and harassment prevention in SDFSCA. Introduced were H.R. 283, the Bullying and Gang Prevention for School Safety and Crime Reduction Act of 2005; H.R. 284, amending SDFSCA for bullying and harassment prevention programs; H.R. 3655, the School Violence Prevention Act of 2005; H.R. 5295, the Student and Teacher Safety Act of 2006; S. 1974, the Drug Free Varsity Sports Act of 2005; and S. 4028, Fighting Gangs and Empowering Youth Act of 2006. H.R. 283 was introduced by Representative Sanchez on January 6, 2005, aiming to amend SDFSCA. H.R. 284, introduced on January 6, 2005 by Representative Shimkus, aimed to amend SDFSCA to include bullying and harassment prevention programs. It would also amend the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to create accountability-based programs for enhancing school safety, including research-based bullying and gang prevention programs. H.R. 284, introduced on January 6, 2005 by Representative Shimkus, aimed to include bullying and harassment prevention programs in the SDFSCA. The legislation would have defined bullying and harassment as forms of violence and mandated prevention programs. Additionally, the School Violence Prevention Act of 2005 (H.R. 3655) introduced by Representative Baca on September 6, 2005, directed the ED Secretary to revise SDFSCA guidelines for state and local prevention efforts. The Student and Teacher Safety Act of 2006 (H.R. 5295) was introduced to improve state and local prevention programs. It passed the House and was referred to the Senate HELP Committee. The act aimed to require LEAs to have policies for full-time safety personnel. The Drug Free Varsity Sports Act of 2005 (S. 1974) introduced by Senator Bill Nelson aimed to allow full-time teachers or officials to search students on school property under reasonable suspicion to prevent weapons, drugs, or dangerous materials. Non-compliant LEAs would lose SDFSCA funds after FY2008. The Drug Free Varsity Sports Act of 2005 (S. 1974) introduced by Senator Bill Nelson aimed to allow full-time teachers or officials to search students on school property under reasonable suspicion to prevent weapons, drugs, or dangerous materials. Non-compliant LEAs would have been denied SDFSCA funds after FY2008. The Fighting Gangs and Empowering Youth Act of 2006 (S. 4028) introduced by Senator Menendez would have reauthorized SDFSCA and increased state grants authorization level. The bill referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee would have reauthorized SDFSCA, increased state grants authorization level to $700 million for FY2007, authorized $400 million for national programs, required LEAs to hire gang prevention and drug prevention coordinators, and reserved $50 million for mentoring program grants. The bill would reserve $50 million for mentoring program grants, giving priority to entities serving children in rural and high crime areas, troubled homes, or schools with violence problems. It also includes an Anti-Gang Discretionary Grant of $50 million for nonprofit groups to create programs for public schools. The ED Secretary would reserve $50 million for nonprofit groups to create programs combating gang activity in schools and communities. Priority given to programs targeting teens in high crime areas. H.R. 354, the SAVE Act, introduced in the 110th Congress, would amend ESEA to address school violence. The Safe Schools Against Violence in Education Act (SAVE Act), introduced by Representative McCarthy, would allow students in unsafe school environments to transfer to a safe public school within the same district. The bill also includes provisions for counseling and removal of offenders. The bill, H.R. 354, allows students in unsafe school environments to transfer to a safe public school within the same district. It includes provisions for counseling or removal of offenders. Unlike current law, it does not use the term \"persistently dangerous\" and extends the right to attend a safe school to students who become victims on school grounds, while riding a school bus, or elsewhere. H.R. 354 allows students in unsafe school environments to transfer to a safe public school within the same district, providing counseling or removal of offenders. The bill does not use the term \"persistently dangerous\" and extends the right to attend a safe school to students who become victims on school grounds, while riding a school bus, or attending a school function. The Administration has recommended restructuring the SDFSC program in anticipation of reauthorization in the 110th Congress. The Administration has recommended restructuring the SDFSC program to focus on creating safe, drug-free, healthy, and secure school environments through effective program models. They propose consolidating national programs into one grant program focusing on emergencies, violence and drug-use prevention, school culture and climate, and other emerging needs for improving the learning environment. Congress may consider requiring K-12 schools to report school crime data to law enforcement agencies, as there is currently no federal mandate for this. Existing data on school crime is limited to self-reported surveys and academic studies, not actual crimes reported to law enforcement. DOJ's expertise in public safety could be utilized in this area. The Department of Justice (DOJ) could potentially take over responsibility for school safety and crime data collection from the Department of Education (ED) due to DOJ's expertise in public safety and crime analysis. The ED's state grant programs were found to be ineffective in a PART assessment. The Department of Justice (DOJ) could potentially take over responsibility for school safety and crime data collection from the Department of Education (ED) due to DOJ's expertise in public safety. One option is to restructure the state grant program, with ED focusing on drug and alcohol prevention, suicide prevention, and curriculum-based programs, while DOJ handles school safety, security, and emergency preparedness programs. The Department of Justice (DOJ) may oversee security and emergency preparedness programs for K-12 schools, potentially allowing them to access Department of Homeland Security (DHS) funding. Consideration should be given to including K-12 schools in national Critical Infrastructure programs to enhance safety against potential terrorist attacks. The Unsafe School Choice provision of the ESEA, as amended by the No Child Left Behind Act, could have unintended consequences for students in persistently dangerous schools. The Unsafe School Choice provision of the ESEA, amended by the No Child Left Behind Act, may lead to unintended consequences. State education officials might feel pressured to define persistently dangerous schools in a way that local schools never meet the criteria. Legal concerns could arise as definitions vary between states, leading to potential underreporting of school crime and violence by some officials. Some school officials may underreport school crime and violence to avoid being labeled as persistently dangerous, impacting their ability to receive funding for violence prevention grants. The 'persistently dangerous' component of NCLB lacks funding to help schools improve safety. The 'persistently dangerous' component of NCLB lacks funding to help schools improve safety programs, while federal and state budgets cut school safety funds that could prevent schools from being labeled as 'persistently dangerous'."
