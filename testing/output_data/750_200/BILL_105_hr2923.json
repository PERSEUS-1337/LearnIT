    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Early Hearing Loss Detection, Diagnosis, and Intervention Act of 1997\". The Act aims to establish early detection networks for hearing loss in babies, including screening before leaving hospitals and within the first 3 months of life for those not born in hospitals. The guidelines emphasize timely screening for newborns, diagnostic testing if needed before 6 months, and linkage to early intervention services. Public policy should be research-based for early hearing detection and intervention. Public policy for early hearing detection and intervention should be research-based and consider the unique needs of infants, toddlers, and children who are deaf or hard-of-hearing. Consultation with relevant public and private sectors is essential for the community system of early intervention services. Statewide early detection, diagnosis, and intervention networks are established. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will award grants to develop statewide networks for early detection, diagnosis, and intervention, focusing on newborn hearing loss detection and monitoring in birthing hospitals. The grants aim to establish universal newborn hearing detection programs in birthing hospitals and nonhospital birthing sites, develop statewide models for effective screening and referral, and collect data for research and policy development. Technical assistance, data management, and applied research are addressed in Section 4. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will provide grants for technical assistance to State agencies for infant hearing detection, diagnosis, and treatment. This includes data collection, standardized procedures for data management, and quality monitoring of programs. Develop standardized procedures for data management to ensure quality monitoring of infant hearing loss detection, diagnosis, and intervention programs. Study the costs and effectiveness of hearing detection by State-based programs to address national and State policymakers' concerns. Identify causes and risk factors for congenital hearing loss for preventive interventions. Evaluate the effectiveness of early hearing detection, diagnosis, and treatment programs. The National Institutes of Health will study the effectiveness of early hearing detection and promote data sharing for identifying causes of hearing loss. The National Institutes of Health, under the Director of the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, will conduct research on new screening techniques and technology for hearing loss, including clinical trials and intervention efficacy studies. SEC. 5. COORDINATION AND COLLABORATION. In carrying out programs under this Act, the Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration, the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Director of the National Institutes of Health shall collaborate with other Federal agencies, State and local agencies, consumer groups, individuals who are deaf and hard-of-hearing, their families, and qualified professional personnel proficient in deaf or hard-of-hearing. The curr_chunk discusses the need for qualified professionals proficient in deaf or hard-of-hearing children's language to serve this population and their families. It also mentions collaboration between various health and education professionals, organizations, and government agencies for policy development. The Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration and the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention collaborate on recommendations for policy development at Federal and State levels regarding early hearing detection, diagnosis, and treatment/intervention. They also assist States in establishing early detection, diagnosis, and intervention networks. The Health Resources and Services Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention collaborate to assist States in establishing early detection, diagnosis, and intervention networks and developing a data collection system. SEC. 6. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Authorization of appropriations for statewide early detection, diagnosis, and intervention networks is set at $5,000,000 for fiscal year 1999, $8,000,000 for fiscal year 2000, and as needed for fiscal years 2001 through 2003. Additionally, funding for technical assistance, data management, and applied research by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is authorized at $5,000,000 for fiscal year 1999, $7,000,000 for fiscal year 2000, and as necessary for fiscal years 2001 through 2003. For fiscal years 1999 through 2003, $5,000,000 is allocated for statewide early detection, diagnosis, and intervention networks, while $3,000,000 is authorized for the National Institutes of Health in 1999, increasing to $4,000,000 in 2000. Additional funding as needed for each fiscal year through 2003."
