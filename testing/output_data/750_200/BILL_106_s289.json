    "content": "The \"Faith-Based Drug Treatment Enhancement Act\" is a new law that amends Title V of the Public Health Service Act to allow services for substance abuse prevention and treatment to be provided through religious organizations. This Act may be cited as the \"Faith-Based Drug Treatment Enhancement Act\". This part applies to programs providing federal financial assistance for substance abuse prevention or treatment. It does not apply if the assistance is for a different purpose. Definitions are provided for clarity. The part applies to federal financial assistance programs for substance abuse prevention or treatment, excluding assistance for other purposes. Definitions are given for clarity, including designated award recipients, direct awards, and subawards. The term 'award' refers to receiving an award directly from the Federal Government. A 'designated subaward' is financial assistance provided by a non-Federal entity that includes Federal financial assistance. 'Designated program' is defined in subsection (a). 'Financial assistance' includes grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, or voucherized assistance. The term 'financial assistance' includes grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, or voucherized assistance. 'Program beneficiary' refers to an individual receiving program services, while 'program participant' is defined in section 582(a)(2). 'Program services' encompass treatment for substance abuse or preventive services provided under a designated program. The term 'voucherized assistance' refers to a system where beneficiaries are given documents to pay for program services of their choice from a selected organization. The term 'voucherized assistance' allows beneficiaries to choose an organization to provide program services and be reimbursed by the designated award recipient. Voucherized assistance allows program beneficiaries to select a service provider to allocate program funds. SEC. 582. RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS AS PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS. Religious organizations have the authority to be designated award recipients, make subawards to other entities, provide program services through voucherized assistance, and be service providers under designated programs. Religious organizations can be providers of services under designated programs, including accepting voucherized assistance. The term 'program participant' refers to entities that have received a direct award or subaward, regardless of whether they provide program services. This includes entities that provide program services through voucherized assistance. Religious organizations can participate in programs by accepting voucherized assistance without discrimination. The purpose is to allow them to be program participants like other nonprofits without compromising their religious character or the freedom of program beneficiaries. The establishment clause does not require social-welfare programs to discriminate against religious organizations. The First Amendment does not mandate discrimination against faith-based providers in social-welfare programs or require them to abandon their religious identity for federal program participation. Religious organizations can participate in programs on an equal basis with other nonprofits. Religious organizations can participate in social-welfare programs without discrimination based on their religious character. They are eligible for program participation on an equal basis with other nonprofit organizations and can retain their independence from government control. Religious organizations participating in social-welfare programs can maintain independence from government control over their religious beliefs and internal governance. They are not required to alter their religious symbols or artwork to be program participants. Nondiscrimination in employment is generally upheld, with exceptions outlined in paragraph (2). Religious organizations in social-welfare programs can maintain independence from government control over their beliefs and internal governance. They are not required to alter symbols or artwork to participate. Nondiscrimination in employment is generally upheld, with exceptions for employees to adhere to the organization's religious beliefs and practices. Program services must adhere to the religious beliefs, practices, and rules of the organization regarding drug and alcohol use. Program beneficiaries have the right to object to a religious organization participating in the program. If a religious organization received a direct award, they must arrange for the individual to receive program services through an alternative entity. If they received a subaward, the non-Federal entity that made the subaward will arrange for the individual to receive services through an alternative program participant. The organization must provide services according to their religious beliefs, practices, and rules regarding drug and alcohol use. If a religious organization receives a direct award, they must arrange for the individual to receive program services through an alternative entity. For subawards, the non-Federal entity that made the subaward will arrange for services through an alternative program participant. The arrangements with an alternative entity must provide services of equal monetary value. Religious organizations receiving direct awards must ensure individuals receive program services through an alternative entity of equal value. Program participants cannot discriminate based on religion when providing services to beneficiaries. Religious organizations participating in programs cannot discriminate against beneficiaries based on religion. They may require active participation in religious activities and adherence to religious rules. Religious organizations receiving federal financial assistance must adhere to fiscal accountability regulations, including auditing principles, to track the use of funds. Religious organizations receiving federal funds must keep them separate from non-Federal funds to be subject to audit. They can seek judicial review of agency actions for compliance with this section. SEC. 583 prohibits the use of funds for sectarian worship or instruction, except when the beneficiary can choose where the assistance is redeemed. SEC. 584 addresses the administration of the program and treatment of funds. (a) Funds provided under a designated program are aid to the beneficiary, not to the organization offering services. Receiving services at an organization's facilities does not mean the organization is receiving federal financial assistance. (b) States cannot prohibit the use of federal funds in religious facilities or by religious organizations participating in the program. If a State law or constitution would prevent the expenditure of State or local public funds in a religious facility or by a religious organization that is a program participant, then the State or local government must segregate the Federal funds for the designated program. SEC. 585 outlines educational requirements for personnel in drug treatment programs. The Congress finds that formal educational qualifications for counselors in drug treatment programs may hinder services. If a program participant imposes educational requirements, religious education must be considered. When a local government with a program participant imposes educational qualifications on service providers, including religious organizations, they must recognize the importance of religious education and training for personnel. Religious education should be considered equivalent to secular coursework in drug treatment or similar subjects in terms of credit. The text discusses how religious education and training should be recognized as equivalent to secular coursework in drug treatment or similar subjects for personnel qualifications in organizations providing program services. The Secretary may waive educational qualifications for a religious organization with a successful record of drug treatment for at least 3 years. The Secretary can waive educational qualifications for a religious organization with a proven 3-year record of successful drug treatment if the organization has been barred from becoming a program provider due to these qualifications, has applied for a waiver, and the government has not shown the necessity of these qualifications for the program's success."
