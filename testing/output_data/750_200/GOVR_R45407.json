    "content": "The quality of instruction is crucial for student learning, and federal policy emphasizes the importance of good pre-service preparation for teachers. Title II, Part A of the Higher Education Act of 1965 provides financial support and accountability measures to improve teacher preparation programs. Title II-A of the Higher Education Act aims to enhance teacher preparation programs through a competitive grant program and accountability measures. The 115th Congress is considering a reauthorization of the HEA, with one bill proposing to repeal all provisions in Title II. The reauthorization bill, H.R. 4508, would repeal all provisions in Title II-A of the Higher Education Act. Another bill, H.R. 6543, aims to amend and extend Title II. The authorization of appropriations for Title II-A expired in FY2011 but has been funded through various legislation, including P.L. 115-245 for FY2019. Title II-A authorities have been funded through various legislation, including P.L. 115-245 for FY2019. Congressional action to reauthorize the HEA may continue, with a focus on current programs and key issues. Teacher preparation in the U.S. historically occurs at institutions of education. The federal effort in supporting teacher preparation historically focused on institutions of higher education (IHEs). Alternative approaches to traditional programs have posed challenges to federal policy, especially regarding program quality accountability. Most U.S. teachers have been prepared at IHE-operated programs since the early 20th century. Since the early 20th century, most U.S. teachers have been trained at programs operated by institutions of higher education (IHEs), which replaced normal schools. The growth of teacher preparation programs at IHEs was accompanied by the professionalization of teacher educators and the formalized separation of pedagogy and subject-matter disciplines. The professionalization of teacher educators and the formalized split between pedagogy and subject-matter disciplines have widened with the rise of alternative routes to teacher certification, emphasizing the importance of courses in pedagogy and passing related tests. The rise of alternative routes to teacher certification has expanded subject-matter expertise, focusing on classroom instruction and management. The Higher Education Amendments of 1998 require annual reports on teacher preparation, with the most recent data from the Secretary's Tenth Annual Report for the 2012-2013 academic year. The Secretary's Tenth Annual Report for the 2012-2013 academic year provides detailed national statistics on teacher preparation. Data for the 2015-2016 academic year show that 2,106 teacher preparation providers offered 26,459 programs, enrolling 441,439 teaching candidates and producing 159,598 program completers. In the 2012-2013 academic year, 2,171 teacher preparation providers offered 26,589 programs enrolling 499,800 teaching candidates and producing 192,459 program completers. Among these providers, 69% were traditional, 22% were alternative route providers at IHEs, and 9% were alternative route providers not based at IHEs. In 2012-2013, there were 2,171 teacher preparation providers offering 26,589 programs enrolling 499,800 teaching candidates. 70% were traditional programs, 20% were alternative route programs at IHEs, and 10% were alternative route programs not based at IHEs. Among the teacher candidates, over 89% were in traditional programs, over 5% were in alternative route programs at IHEs, and nearly 6% were in alternative route programs not based at IHEs. In 2012-2013, 35% of teacher preparation program completers were from five states: Texas, New York, California, Pennsylvania, and Illinois. New York led in traditional program completion, while Texas led in alternative route programs. The Secretary's Tenth Annual report highlights key aspects of teacher preparation in the United States. New York led in traditional program completion, while Texas led in alternative route programs. Traditional programs require 100 hours of supervised clinical experience and 600 hours of student teaching. The two largest traditional teacher preparation programs, Grand Canyon University and the University of Phoenix, enroll over 30,000 prospective teachers, which is about 10 times more than the next 10 largest programs combined. The majority of enrollees in teacher preparation programs are white, non-Hispanic, with 74% at traditional programs, 65% at alternative programs based at an IHE, and 59% at alternative programs not based at an IHE. The majority of teacher preparation program enrollees are white, non-Hispanic, with 74% in traditional programs, 65% in alternative programs at an IHE, and 59% in alternative programs not at an IHE. African-American enrollees make up 18%, 16%, and 9% respectively. The most common subject areas for program completion are elementary education (42%), special education (16%), early childhood education (13%), English/language arts (9%), and mathematics (7%). The national average scaled score is 74.4% versus 60.2%, with over 95% of candidates passing state assessments. The national average scaled score was 14 percentage points above the average cut score, with 95% of candidates passing state assessments. Title II-A of the HEA includes a competitive grant program and reporting/accountability provisions for teacher preparation programs. The Teacher Quality Partnership program is authorized under Title II-A. The Teacher Quality Partnership (TQP) program, authorized under Title II-A of the HEA, aims to improve teacher preparation by funding partnerships for prospective and new teachers. It supports various teacher preparation programs and provides additional funding for school leadership activities. The Teacher Quality Partnership (TQP) program provides grant funding for teacher residency programs and school leadership activities. Approximately $42 million is allocated annually to support partnerships, with 30% for pre-baccalaureate/fifth year programs, 48% for residency programs, and 23% for both types. Awards have been given in various fiscal years, with eligibility criteria for partnerships to receive TQP grants. In FY2016, 24 grants were awarded, 12 in FY2014, and 28 in FY2009. No awards were given between FY2011 and FY2013. To qualify for a TQP award, a partnership must include a high-need local educational agency, a partner institution of higher education, and coordinate activities with other federally funded programs. Grantees must match 100% of their award with non-federal funds. TQP grantees must match 100% of their award with non-federal funds and coordinate activities with other federally funded programs. Grants are provided for implementing reforms in teacher preparation programs, including curriculum changes and using teaching research to develop teaching skills. The TQP grantees are required to implement curriculum changes, use teaching research, provide high-quality clinical education, create induction programs for new teachers, increase compensation for early childhood educators, offer professional development, and develop effective mechanisms. The TQP grants aim to support educators in obtaining degrees, providing professional development for teachers in high-need LEAs, recruiting qualified individuals into teaching, and strengthening literacy instruction skills. Grant funds are used to develop teacher residency programs based on successful models, preparing teachers for success in high-need schools and academic subjects. The TQP grants support teacher residency programs that prepare educators for success in high-need schools by offering rigorous graduate-level coursework, guided teaching apprenticeships, mentorship, and placement in targeted schools for professional collaboration. Cohort members receive a one-year living stipend or salary, repayable if they do not teach full time for at least three years. Programs must provide cohort members with a one-year living stipend or salary, repayable if they do not teach full time for at least three years in a high-need school. Grants are given to develop effective school leadership programs for aspiring superintendents, principals, and other school leaders, focusing on strong leadership skills, professional development, teaching techniques, and data evaluation. The Title II (Section 205) of the HEA authorizes the TQP program to create a school climate conducive to professional development for teachers, improve teaching and assessment skills, use data for evaluation, manage resources, engage parents and community stakeholders, and understand student learning to increase academic achievement. Grant funds must be used for a yearlong clinical education program, mentoring and induction programs, and recruiting school leaders. Title II (Section 205) of the HEA authorizes the TQP program for teacher preparation and accountability. States and IHEs must report program performance to receive HEA funds, with IHEs issuing report cards to the state and states issuing report cards to ED and the public. The HEA requires IHEs to issue report cards to the state and the public, while states must issue report cards to ED and the public. The HEA also mandates the use of state-reported information for an annual report on teacher qualifications. States must evaluate teacher preparation programs, report results, and identify low-performing programs. In 2014, states evaluated teacher preparation programs using criteria like teaching skill and pass rates on credentialing assessments. Other criteria included improving student achievement, raising entry standards, and increasing professional development opportunities. 12 states and Puerto Rico reported on teacher performance. In 2014, 12 states and Puerto Rico reported low-performing or at-risk teacher preparation programs, representing less than 3% of total programs. 30 states have never identified any programs as low-performing. In 2014, less than 3% of teacher preparation programs were identified as low-performing or at-risk. The House Committee on Education and the Workforce approved H.R. 4508, which would amend the Higher Education Act (HEA) by repealing current Title II provisions. The Aim Higher Act (H.R. 6543) was introduced as a comprehensive HEA reauthorization bill, retaining and amending current Title II provisions. H.R. 6543, the Aim Higher Act, is a comprehensive HEA reauthorization bill that includes amendments to current Title II provisions. These amendments involve changes to the TQP program, expansion of accountability provisions for institutions, and changes to accountability for states. The Aim Higher Act, a comprehensive HEA reauthorization bill, includes amendments to Title II provisions such as changes to the TQP program, expansion of accountability for institutions, and changes to accountability for states. The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions has held hearings on HEA reauthorization during the 115th Congress but has not introduced a bill to amend Title II yet. President signed a resolution nullifying regulations related to HEA and ESEA Title II funds. The President signed a resolution nullifying regulations related to HEA Title II funds, but has not introduced a bill to amend Title II yet. Congress may consider legislation to reauthorize the HEA, including provisions in Title II such as clearer guidance on provider versus program, new post-program completion measures, and additional penalties for poor performance. The reauthorization of the HEA, including Title II provisions, may involve discussions on the federal role in supporting teacher preparation programs, the mix of TQP activities, and the effectiveness of current reporting and accountability measures. Some argue for a broader federal role in teacher preparation, criticizing the current TQP program as mainly supporting demonstration projects. Some argue for expanding the federal role in teacher preparation, criticizing the current TQP program for focusing on demonstration projects. Others believe teacher training should be a state and local responsibility, with no federal involvement in setting standards. There is debate over the optimal mix of activities supported by the TQP program. Some argue for expanding federal involvement in teacher preparation, with debate over the optimal mix of activities supported by the TQP program. Traditional routes to teaching advocate for enhancements like supervised clinical practice and assessments, while alternative routes seek fewer restrictions on TQP partners and more emphasis on in-service supports like induction and mentoring for teachers. Some argue for expanding federal involvement in teacher preparation, with a focus on in-service supports such as induction and mentoring for teachers. There are calls for greater accountability in teacher preparation programs, as current reporting and accountability measures are seen as inadequate. Less than 3% of programs are identified as low-performing, and there are debates on tying program evaluations to student performance outcomes. Some argue for expanding federal involvement in teacher preparation, focusing on in-service supports like induction and mentoring. There are calls for greater accountability in teacher preparation programs, with debates on tying program evaluations to student performance outcomes. Some believe current reporting requirements are burdensome for state and local administrators."
