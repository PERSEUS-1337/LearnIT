The \"Flood Control Act of 1944\" aimed to promote economic development in the US. The Oahe Dam Project, a part of this program, benefits the national economy but flooded Cheyenne River Sioux Reservation land.

The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe Equitable Compensation Act (Public Law 106-511; 114 Stat. 2365) created the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribal Recovery Trust Fund to provide compensation to members who lost land due to the Oahe Dam and Reservoir Project. The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribal Recovery Trust Fund aims to compensate tribe members who lost land due to the Oahe Dam and Reservoir Project and to capitalize the fund.
