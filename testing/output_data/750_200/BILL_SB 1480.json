    "title": "SB 1480",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 254.5 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to require claims for property tax exemptions to be filed by February 15th each year with the assessor. Approval is contingent upon the claimant obtaining an organizational clearance certificate. Financial statements are only necessary if requested by the assessor. The assessor reviews claims for welfare and veterans' organization exemptions to ensure property meets requirements. Considerations include justifying capital investments for plant expansion and serving community interests. The assessor may audit the owner or operator to verify if they meet the requirements for property tax exemption, including justifying capital investments for plant expansion and ensuring property is used for exempt activities. The assessor may deny a claim for the welfare exemption on a property, even if the claimant has an organizational clearance certificate. If the property is found ineligible, the assessor must notify the claimant in writing that they can seek a refund of property taxes by filing a claim with the county, and if denied, they can file a refund action in superior court. An applicant granted a welfare exemption for property exempted under specific sections is not required to reapply in subsequent years if there are no changes in ownership or use by a governmental entity or nonprofit corporation. Notification to the assessor is required by February 15 if the applicant becomes ineligible or no longer owns the property. If the applicant becomes ineligible for the welfare exemption or no longer owns the property before the lien date, they must notify the assessor by February 15. Prior to the lien date, the assessor must annually send a notice to applicants exempt from filing an annual application. The notice, in a prescribed form, will detail circumstances where the property may lose exemption eligibility and remind applicants to inform the assessor if the property is no longer eligible. The assessor must annually send a notice to exempt applicants before the lien date, detailing circumstances where exemption eligibility may be lost and reminding them to inform if the property is no longer eligible. The notice for maintaining eligibility for welfare exemption must be followed to avoid additional contact for verification. Upon indication of incorrect granting of welfare or veterans' organization exemption, the assessor will reassess eligibility and cancel the exemption if property no longer qualifies. If a welfare or veterans' organization exemption is incorrectly allowed on the property, an escape assessment will be made for the amount of the exemption, with interest and a penalty of 10% of the escape assessment, not exceeding $250, for failure to notify the assessor. The board reviews the assessor's administration of welfare and veterans' organization exemptions to ensure proper implementation. Section 1840 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended. Section 1840 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to allow counties, cities, and municipal corporations to request a review, equalization, or adjustment of property assessments by the board. Applications must be submitted in writing by November 30 or within 60 days of receiving a tax bill for assessments made outside the regular period. Every application must present the necessary facts to the board, with a copy filed with the assessor. The board will provide notice and a hearing upon receiving a timely application, as per their rules. Failure to file on time will result in the applicant being barred from relief under Section 11 of Article XIII or this section. Section 4674 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended. Any excess proceeds from a delinquent tax sale trust fund not claimed by parties of interest may be transferred to the county general fund after a specified period. County may deduct costs before transfer. The county may deduct costs of maintaining redemption and tax-defaulted property files, as well as administering and processing claims for excess proceeds before transferring any unclaimed funds to the county general fund."
