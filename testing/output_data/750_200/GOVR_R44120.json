    "content": "The House and Senate Armed Services Committees annually review national defense authorization bills with provisions affecting military personnel, retirees, and their families. Differences between the two versions are resolved by a conference committee. Congressional staff receive numerous requests for information on these bills. This report highlights personnel-related provisions. The report summarizes key personnel-related issues in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 (FY2016 NDAA), comparing House and Senate versions. It highlights differences between S. 1356 and H.R. 1735, both passed by Congress and signed by the President. The FY2016 NDAA was passed by Congress and signed by the President, after an earlier version was vetoed due to exceeding defense spending caps imposed by the Budget Control Act of 2011. The President objected to legislation allowing defense spending to exceed the BCA cap for FY2016, but signed the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 which raised spending caps for both defense and nondefense. The FY2016 NDAA was modified to comply with the revised spending caps while retaining military personnel provisions. The FY2016 NDAA was modified to comply with revised spending caps while retaining military personnel provisions. The amended version of S. 1356, which became the revised FY2016 NDAA, was passed by the House and Senate and signed by the President. The Congressional Budget Office issued cost estimates for these bills on various dates in 2015. Contact information for CRS analysts is provided for more detailed background information and analysis of the issues discussed. The FY2016 NDAA was modified to comply with revised spending caps while retaining military personnel provisions. Contact information for CRS analysts is provided for more detailed background information and analysis of the issues discussed. Some issues previously addressed in the Carl Levin and Howard P. 'Buck' McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 (P.L. 113-291) are designated with an asterisk in relevant section titles of this report. The authorized active duty end-strengths for FY2001 were Army (480,000), Navy (372,642), Marine Corps (172,600), and Air Force (357,000). Congress increased Army and Marine Corps personnel strength in response to wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, but began reversing these increases in anticipation of troop withdrawals. In anticipation of troop withdrawals from Iraq and Afghanistan, Congress began reversing the increases in military personnel strength after FY2006. End-strengths for the Air Force and Navy have been declining since 2001. In FY2015, authorized end-strengths were: Army (490,000), Navy (323,600), Marine Corps (184,100), and Air Force (312,980). Due to budget constraints, the Army plans to reduce active personnel to 420,000-450,000 by FY2017, while the Marine Corps plans to reduce to 175,000-182,000 in FY2017-2019. The Administration requested to reduce Army personnel to 420,000-450,000 by FY2017, while the Marine Corps plans to decrease to 175,000-182,000 by FY2019. The final bill authorized end-strengths aligned with the Administration's request, except for the Air Force, which was 3,715 higher. The final bill authorized end-strengths aligned with the Administration's request, except for the Air Force, which was 3,715 higher. Section 402 of the initial Senate-passed bill (H.R. 1735) would have repealed 10 U.S.C. 691, allowing the Secretary of Defense to reduce personnel below authorized levels. The final bill (P.L. 114-92 / S. 1356) allowed the Secretary of Defense to reduce personnel in active and reserve components by up to 3% and 2% respectively, and to decrease National Guard and Reserve personnel on active duty by up to 10%. Additionally, Service Secretaries could reduce personnel by up to 2% below authorized end-strengths. Section 402 adjusted minimum end-strengths required by 10 USC. Section 402 of the final bill (P.L. 114-92 / S. 1356) expanded the Secretary of Defense's authority to reduce personnel by up to 2% below authorized end-strengths, adjusting minimum requirements downward. This change allows for a greater decrease compared to the previous limit of 0.5%. The overall authorized end strength of the Selected Reserves has declined by about 5% over the past 14 years, with reductions in Navy Reserve strength being a significant factor. Between FY2001 and FY2015, there were shifts in authorized end strengths for the Selected Reserves, with significant reductions in Navy Reserve, Air Force Reserve, and Coast Guard Reserve. For FY2016, the Administration proposed reductions in authorized Selected Reserve end strength for three reserve components: Army National Guard (-8,200), Army Reserve (-4,000), and Marine Corps Reserve (-300). Navy Reserve and Air National Guard saw increases in authorized end strength. The Administration proposed reductions in authorized Selected Reserve end strength for three reserve components: Army National Guard (-8,200), Army Reserve (-4,000), and Marine Corps Reserve (-300). Increases were proposed for Navy Reserve (+100), Air National Guard (+500), and Air Force Reserve (+2,100), with no change for the Coast Guard Reserve. The enacted bill's end-strengths matched the Administration's request. The military pay raise is a topic of increasing concern due to the overall cost of military personnel and the need to recruit and retain high-quality personnel. Section 1009 of Title 37 provides for an automatic annual increase in basic pay indexed to the Employment Cost Index. The proposed increase for 2016 is 2.3%, unless Congress passes a law to provide otherwise. The FY2016 military pay raise is set to increase by 2.3% based on the Employment Cost Index, unless Congress or the President specifies otherwise. The President's Budget requested a 1.3% raise, aligning with DOD's plan to limit pay increases through FY2020. The ECI will increase by 2.3% per year in the next four years according to the DOD Budget Request Overview. Outyear pay raise planning factors assume limited pay raises through FY 2020, with increases of 1.3% in FY 2017, 1.5% in FY 2018 and FY 2019, and 1.8% in FY 2020. The House bill did not specify the rate of increase in basic pay but emphasized the importance of robust compensation programs for the military. The committee supports a 2.3 percent military pay raise for fiscal year 2016 to keep pace with private sector pay increases. The initial Senate version set the pay increase at 1.3% for lower-ranking servicemembers. President Obama set the pay raise for 2016 at 1.3% for officers below the grade of brigadier general or rear admiral lower half. The final bill froze the basic pay of generals and admirals at 2014 levels. President Obama set a 1.3% pay raise for officers below the rank of brigadier general or rear admiral lower half in 2016. However, the enacted bill froze the basic pay of generals and admirals at 2014 levels. Military retirement system is a funded, noncontributory, defined benefit system providing a monthly annuity. The Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission (MCRMC) was established by the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2013 to provide recommendations on modernizing pay and benefits for servicemembers. The Commission delivered its final report to Congress on January 29, 2015, and many of its proposed changes were included in the enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356). The Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission delivered its final report and recommendations to Congress on January 29, 2015. Congress included many proposed changes in the enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356), transitioning the military retirement system to a blended defined-benefit, defined-contribution system with government matching contributions through the Thrift Savings Plan. The military retirement system is transitioning to a blended defined-benefit, defined-contribution system with reduced benefits and a new retention incentive. Existing servicemembers and those entering before January 1, 2018 will be grandfathered into the current system, while others can elect the new system. COLA adjustments were first enacted in 2013. The new military retirement system allows servicemembers with less than 12 years of service as of December 31, 2017 to elect the new system, repealing COLA adjustments enacted in 2013. The issue of sexual assault in the military has received significant attention in recent years. Congress has made changes in previous NDAAs, but challenges persist. The FY2014 DOD Annual Report on Sexual Assault in the Military found that 4.3% of women and 0.9% of men in the military experienced unwanted sexual contact in 2014. The FY2014 DOD Annual Report on Sexual Assault in the Military revealed that 4.3% of women and 0.9% of men in the military experienced unwanted sexual contact in 2014. Among those who reported unwanted sexual contact, 53% faced social retaliation, including adverse administrative action, professional retaliation, and punishment for reporting an infraction. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) highlighted the need for the DOD to improve care for male sexual assault victims. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) addresses concerns about retaliation and male victims of sexual assault, enhancing the Special Victims' Counsel Program and modifying requirements for judicial proceedings, reporting, and sentencing in sex-related offenses. This is in response to the Government Accountability Office's (GAO) call for the DOD to improve care for male sexual assault victims. On January 24, 2013, the Department of Defense rescinded its 1994 Direct Combat Exclusion Rule to allow women to serve in previously restricted combat occupations by January 1, 2016. Contact [author name scrubbed] for more information. The Department of Defense rescinded its 1994 Direct Combat Exclusion Rule to allow women in combat roles by January 1, 2016. Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter later announced that all military occupations were open to women with no exceptions. Congress established requirements for gender-neutral occupational standards in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994. The Department of Defense removed barriers for women in combat roles by rescinding the 1994 Direct Combat Exclusion Rule. Congress mandated gender-neutral occupational performance standards in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994. The Carl Levin and Howard P. ''Buck'' McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 emphasized that performance standards must be related to actual duties and measure individual capabilities. The FY2016 NDAA added criteria for developing combat unit readiness standards. The FY2016 NDAA introduced additional criteria for combat unit readiness standards, requiring DOD to validate unit-level performance. Changes in assignment policies for females must be notified to Congress under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7652, with a shortened waiting period for review before implementation. The FY2016 NDAA introduced new criteria for combat unit readiness standards, requiring DOD to validate unit-level performance. Changes in assignment policies for females must be notified to Congress with a shortened waiting period for review before implementation, reducing in-session time for Congress to act on proposed changes. The congressionally mandated Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission found weaknesses in financial literacy programs for military servicemembers, potentially impacting readiness. Improving financial literacy could save the DOD between $13 million and $137 million. Contact [author name scrubbed] for more information. Enhancing financial management training programs for military servicemembers could save the DOD between $13 million and $137 million annually. The enacted bill includes provisions for financial literacy training at various career points and life changes. Financial literacy training is required for servicemembers at different career points and life changes. Statutory requirements for enlistment differ between active and reserve components. Contact [author name scrubbed] at x[phone number scrubbed] for more information. The eligibility requirements for military enlistment in the United States include being a national of the US, a lawful permanent resident, or a person described in the Compact of Free Association. The Military Accessions Vital to National Interest (MAVNI) program allows exceptions for enlistment if deemed vital to national interest. The Military Accessions Vital to National Interest (MAVNI) program allows enlistment if deemed vital to national interest, based on Section 12102 of Title 10. The enacted bill did not link eligibility requirements for the reserve and active components. In 2004, Congress established the Reserve Educational Assistance Program (REAP) to provide enhanced educational benefits to reservists called to active service. The Post\u20109/11 GI Bill, approved four years later, offered more generous benefits, leading to a recommendation to terminate REAP by the Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission. The Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission recommended terminating the Reserve Educational Assistance Program (REAP) due to the more generous benefits offered by the Post-9/11 GI Bill. The enacted bill established a sunset date for REAP four years after the date of enactment, allowing current recipients to exhaust their entitlement. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) established a sunset date for REAP four years after enactment, allowing current recipients to continue using the program. Reference(s): For more information on REAP and the Post 9/11 GI Bill, see CRS Report RL30802, Reserve Component Personnel Issues: Questions and Answers. For more detailed information, see CRS Report R42785, GI Bills Enacted Prior to 2008 and Related Veterans' Educational Assistance Programs. The discussion in the curr_chunk focuses on the initial Senate passed bill (H.R. 1735) regarding the entitlement of individuals undergoing discharge or release from the Armed Forces to a verification card for their military service. The curr_chunk discusses the provision in a bill to provide a \"Recognition of Service ID Card\" to honorably discharged veterans one year after the enactment of the Act. The card would identify the bearer as a veteran and include their name and photograph. The Secretary of Defense may negotiate with national retail chains to ensure acceptance of the ID card for discounts on services, products, and pharmaceuticals. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) did not include a provision for a \"Recognition of Service ID Card.\" Veterans can use state-issued ID cards to show their veteran status in 44 states and the District of Columbia. Since January 2014, honorably discharged members of the Uniformed Services can obtain an ID card through the DOD-VA eBenefits web portal. President Obama signed the Veterans Identification Card Act of 2015 into law on July 20, 2015. President Obama signed the Veterans Identification Card Act of 2015 into law on July 20, 2015, requiring the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to provide identification cards to veterans who demonstrate their military service with official documents. Congress is interested in recruiting and retaining high-quality personnel for the armed forces through incentives like recruiting bonuses and educational benefits. The military uses recruiting bonuses and incentives like educational benefits to attract qualified applicants. Chapter 5 of Title 37 of the United States Code contains various bonus and incentive pay authorities. Proposed legislation would allow service secretaries to develop additional recruitment incentives for officers, warrant officers, and enlisted personnel, subject to congressional review and approval. Proposed legislation would allow service secretaries to develop additional recruitment incentives for officers, warrant officers, and enlisted personnel, subject to a 30-day congressional review and approval period. The enacted bill incorporated the House provision. More information on recruitment and retention can be found in CRS Report RL32965. The Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) of 1994 provides reservists with the right to reemployment after military service, with exemptions for certain types of duty. In 2011, Congress created new mobilization authorities for reservists in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 (P.L. 112-81), allowing 120-day activations for disaster response and 365-day activations for preplanned missions. These activations are not exempt from the five-year cumulative limit. The new mobilization authorities for reservists allow 120-day activations for disaster response and 365-day activations for preplanned missions. Activations under these authorities are not exempt from the five-year cumulative limit, but a provision in the House-passed bill exempts military duty from counting towards the limit for reemployment protection under USERRA. A veteran is defined as someone who served in active military, naval, or air service under conditions other than dishonorable. Active service typically refers to full-time service for most VA benefits. Active service for VA benefits includes full-time service in the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, Public Health Service, or National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. It also covers active duty for training resulting in injury or death, as well as inactive duty for training leading to disability or death from an injury incurred. Members of the National Guard and reserves must be activated for active duty military service to meet the statutory definition of a veteran. Reservists become eligible for retirement after 20 years of qualifying service. Reservists qualify for retirement after 20 years of service but may not be considered veterans unless they have completed the required active service. The House-passed bill honored reservists as veterans but did not grant additional benefits. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) recognized reservists qualifying for reserve retirement as \"honored veterans,\" without additional benefits entitlement. For more information on veterans' eligibility and burial benefits, refer to CRS Reports R42324 and R41386. The Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009 established a pilot Career Intermission Program (CIP) allowing 20 officers and enlisted personnel per year to take a break from their military career for up to 3 years. For more information on Reserve Component personnel issues and retirement benefits, refer to CRS Report RL30802. The pilot Career Intermission Program (CIP) allows 20 officers and enlisted personnel per year to take a break from their military career for up to 3 years. This program aims to help servicemembers address work/life balances or pursue broadening opportunities without negatively impacting their military career progression. The Department of Defense initiated the CIP to retain high-performing servicemembers. The Career Intermission Program (CIP) was initiated by the Department of Defense to provide career flexibility for high-performing servicemembers and increase retention rates. Participants accept additional service obligations, with a final assessment due to Congress by March 1, 2016. The enacted bill would remove prohibitions on program participation. The Career Intermission Program (CIP) was created by the Department of Defense to offer career flexibility for high-performing servicemembers and boost retention rates. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) would eliminate restrictions on program participation by members of the Armed Forces under certain agreements or receiving retention bonuses. Section 523 also removes the limit on the number of annual participants in the program. Congress has been focused on enhancing recruitment, retention, and career management for the acquisition workforce in recent years. In recent years, Congress has been focused on improving recruitment, retention, and career management for the acquisition workforce. Suggestions include providing incentives for high-performing military personnel to seek acquisition assignments and enhancing professional military education in acquisition. The Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986 created incentives for officers to be educated in this area. Military acquisition professionals oversee funding for defense programs, and there is a need for qualified personnel in these roles. The Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986 incentivized officers to be educated and experienced in joint matters, tying promotions to joint professional military education and service in joint assignments. The NDAA extends joint duty credit to include acquisition-related assignments and allows officers to pursue a dual career track in combat arms and acquisition fields. The NDAA allows officers to pursue a dual career track in combat arms and acquisition fields, with joint professional military education including acquisition matters.

Section 1585 of Title 10, United States Code authorizes the Secretary of Defense to regulate carrying firearms for DOD civilian employees and military servicemembers on military bases. Current DOD policies restrict carrying government-issued firearms to personnel on duty. Personal firearms are prohibited for military servicemembers on military bases, following an armed attack on a Marine Corps recruiting center and U.S. Naval Reserve Center on July 16, 2015. Following recent active shooter incidents at military installations, there are discussions about the adequacy of force protection measures and the need to potentially modify DOD policies to allow servicemembers to carry firearms. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) would require DOD to review its current regulations on carrying firearms for DOD civilian employees and military servicemembers on military bases. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) would broaden authority for servicemembers to carry firearms for force protection measures. This process would give more flexibility to commanders to establish protocols for servicemembers to carry appropriate firearms. The Purple Heart is awarded to members of the Armed Forces killed or wounded in action by weapon fire, friendly fire, or intentional terrorist attacks. In April 1995, a domestic terrorist bomb attack in Oklahoma City killed 168 people and injured over 650, including six servicemembers. The bombing at the P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City killed 168 people and injured over 650, including six servicemembers. There is a debate over whether these servicemembers should be eligible for the Purple Heart due to the nature of the attack being domestic terrorism. Eligibility for the Purple Heart was expanded in the FY2015 NDAA to include servicemembers wounded and killed in the 2009 terrorist attacks at Little Rock, AR and Fort Hood, TX. Initial concerns over awarding the Purple Heart in these situations included anti-Muslim overtones. The FY2015 NDAA expanded Purple Heart eligibility to include servicemembers wounded in terrorist attacks. Section 571 redefined criteria for attacks by foreign terrorist organizations. The FY2015 NDAA expanded Purple Heart eligibility to include servicemembers wounded in terrorist attacks inspired by foreign terrorist organizations. However, servicemembers who were victims of the Oklahoma City bombing will not be eligible for the Purple Heart under the enacted bill. The issue of military working dogs (MWDs) has received congressional and media attention over the years with Congress enacting laws related to the transfer and adoption of MWDs. In November 2000, Congress passed \"Robby's Law\" (P.L. 106-446) to end the euthanizing of military working dogs and facilitate their adoption by law enforcement agencies and former handlers. The NDAA for FY2012 expanded eligibility to adopt military working dogs, including handlers, family members, and limited liability claims. Military working dogs were classified as \"equipment,\" and interested individuals paid for transportation. The NDAA for FY2013 allowed for the transfer of retiring military working dogs to the 341st Training Squadron in Lackland, Texas, or for adoption at another location. The current law does not mandate the transfer of retired MWDs from overseas back to the United States. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) requires the transfer of retiring military working dogs located overseas to the United States and gives adoption priority to former handlers. It changes \"may\" to \"shall,\" ensuring that all MWDs are retired only after being returned to the U.S., facilitating their domestic transfer to qualified adopters. The enacted bill requires all military working dogs to be retired only after they are returned to the United States, facilitating their domestic transfer to qualified adopters. Opponents argue that the transfer of retiring MWDs from abroad will be costly due to lack of appropriated funds. The President's FY2015 budget proposal included $1 billion in cuts to the Defense Commissary System over a three-year period, starting with a $200 million reduction in FY2015. However, funding for the commissary was fully restored in the FY2015 NDAA, which added $100 million to the budget and required a study of possible cost reductions. The FY2016 budget proposal included cutting $300 million in subsidies for commissaries, reducing the budget from $1.3 billion to $400 million in three years. This could lead to reduced operating days and hours for commissary patrons and increased costs for goods and services. Authorized patrons include active duty military members, retired personnel, and disabled veterans. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) includes provisions for budget-neutrality for the DeCA and military exchange system, requiring a report from the Secretary of Defense by March 1, 2016. Authorized patrons for commissaries include active duty military members, retired personnel, disabled veterans, and DOD civilians stationed overseas. The Committees on Armed Services of the House and Senate must submit a plan by March 1, 2016, to achieve budget-neutrality for the DeCA and military exchange system. The plan should focus on meeting benchmarks like customer service satisfaction, product quality, and sustaining discount savings for eligible patrons by October 1, 2018. It should also include potential modifications to the commissary and exchange systems, such as privatization or closure of redundant facilities, and explore different pricing structures to enhance benefits. The Defense Secretary is required to submit a report analyzing pricing options for commissaries, potential closures of redundant facilities, and the impact on Morale, Welfare, and Recreation programs. This report is in response to Section 634 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015, which called for a review of management, food, and pricing options for the Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA). The enacted bill requires a review of management, food, and pricing options for DeCA, including using variable pricing in commissary stores, implementing a program for more private label products, converting the defense commissary system, and reducing second-destination funding. The Comptroller General of the United States is required to submit a report on the Commissary Surcharge, Non-appropriated Fund, and Privately-Financed Major Construction Program to the Committees on Armed Services. The enacted bill mandates a review of management, food, and pricing options for DeCA, including variable pricing and private label products. The Comptroller General of the United States must submit a report on the Commissary Surcharge, Non-appropriated Fund, and Privately-Financed Major Construction Program to the Committees on Armed Services within 180 days. References include CRS Report R43806 and the Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission Final Report. The Administration proposed changes to TRICARE in its FY2016 budget request, including replacing current health plan options with a consolidated plan, increasing copays for pharmaceuticals, and establishing a new enrollment fee for future enrollees in the TRICARE-for-Life program. The Administration proposed changes to TRICARE in its FY2016 budget request, including a consolidated plan, increased copays for pharmaceuticals, and a new enrollment fee for future TRICARE-for-Life enrollees. However, none of the Administration's proposals were adopted, and recommendations for TRICARE changes from the Military Compensation and Retirement Compensation Modernization Commission were not endorsed or adopted in the House- or Senate-passed versions of H.R. 1735. The President did not endorse the recommendations for TRICARE changes from the Military Compensation and Retirement Compensation Modernization Commission, and they were not adopted in the House- or Senate-passed versions of H.R. 1735. Congress may consider major changes to TRICARE in the future, but the committee feels it is prudent to take a deliberate approach to enacting TRICARE reform legislation. The committee must better understand the implications of any plan to transform TRICARE. The committee has recommended provisions in this Act to improve access to care, deliver better health outcomes, enhance the experience of care for beneficiaries, and control health care costs in TRICARE. These provisions lay the foundation for comprehensive TRICARE modernization and reform legislation in the near future. The joint explanatory statement further emphasizes the need for comprehensive reform of the military health care system. The joint explanatory statement accompanying the enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) emphasizes the need for comprehensive reform of the military health care system in fiscal year 2017 to improve access, quality, and experience of care for beneficiaries, maintain medical readiness of health professionals, and ensure long-term viability and cost effectiveness. The current system is outdated and must be reformed to meet future needs of the Department of Defense, servicemembers, families, and retirees. The current military healthcare system needs comprehensive reform to modernize and improve access, quality, and cost-effectiveness. Increases to fees and co-pays will be necessary for this reform effort. The FY2015 National Defense Authorization Act addresses selected military personnel issues, including TRICARE pharmacy program details for beneficiaries. Active duty servicemembers have no pharmacy copayments at military pharmacies or TRICARE retail network pharmacies. Military pharmacies provide a 90-day supply of formulary medications for free. Military pharmacies offer a 90-day supply of formulary medications for free, prescribed by civilian and military providers. Non-formulary drugs are generally not available. The DOD policy favors generic medications over brand-name ones. The 2015 NDAA allowed a one-time $3 increase in pharmacy copays and mandated refills for maintenance drugs to be filled through mail order or military pharmacies. The Administration's FY2016 budget proposed annual copayment increases from 2016 to 2025. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) includes smaller pharmacy copayment increases than initially proposed. It introduces a one-time increase in copays for prescriptions filled at retail pharmacies and through mail order. Copays for generic and formulary brand name drugs are raised, with generic drugs increasing from $8 to $10 at retail pharmacies. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) includes smaller pharmacy copayment increases for prescriptions filled at retail pharmacies and through mail order. Copays for generic and formulary brand name drugs are raised, with generic drugs increasing to $10 and formulary brand name drugs increasing to $24 at retail pharmacies. For mail order prescriptions, copays for formulary drugs increase to $20 and for non-formulary drugs to $49. CBO estimates that section 702 would reduce direct spending by about $1.5 billion over 10 years. Personnel Issues: Recent news articles highlighted concerns about the quality of health care in the military health system. Secretary of Defense Hagel ordered a 90-day review resulting in an action plan. Some Members of Congress are interested in the plan's implementation. Sections 711 and 731 to 735 of the Senate-passed bill (H.R. 1735) aimed to increase visibility of health quality metrics through public access and reports to Congress, requiring an estimated $95 million. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) aims to increase visibility of health quality metrics through public access and reports to Congress, requiring an estimated $95 million over 2016-2020. Access to contraception remains a concern for Service members according to the 2014 annual report of the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Service. The Advisory Committee on Women in the Service reported challenges with Service members' access to reproductive health care. TRICARE covers various forms of birth control when prescribed by a TRICARE-authorized provider, including contraceptive diaphragms, intrauterine devices, prescription contraceptives, and surgical sterilization. Condoms and nonprescription methods are not covered. The bill requires the Secretary of Defense to establish clinical practice guidelines for contraception methods and counseling within one year. TRICARE covers birth control pills, pregnancy tests, and surgical sterilization, but not condoms or nonprescription spermicidal products. The bill mandates the establishment of clinical practice guidelines for contraception methods and counseling for DOD health care providers within one year. It also ensures that all women in the Armed Forces have access to comprehensive counseling on contraception methods. Contact: [author name scrubbed], x[phone number scrubbed]."
