    "content": "After years of experience in peacekeeping and peacebuilding, analysts emphasize the importance of establishing a secure environment for sustainable peace. Instability in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Haiti has prompted Congress to explore effective security measures, including the use of military forces for initial security and law enforcement in peacekeeping operations. The use of international civilian police (CivPol) has increased significantly in peacekeeping operations, with their effectiveness being recognized as superior to military forces for law and order tasks. Despite their importance in establishing security and maintaining stability in post-conflict environments, their controversial use remains a topic of debate. The Committee in its March 2004 Report recognized the importance of United Nations peacekeeping operations in promoting stability in post-conflict situations. Policymakers have acknowledged issues with CivPol use and are considering improvements to the existing system and building new U.S. and international CivPol capabilities. Advocates propose facilitating recruitment and rapid deployment of qualified police for law enforcement. Advocates are proposing reforms to improve international CivPol capabilities, including recruitment and deployment of qualified police for post-conflict missions. Key documents recommend mechanisms to enhance existing CivPol systems and approaches. Key documents, including the Clinton Administration's PDD-71 and the UN's Brahimi Panel report, recommended mechanisms to improve CivPol systems and approaches for peacekeeping operations. The United Nations' Brahimi Panel report in August 2000 addressed issues with the U.N. civilian police system, recommending reforms such as creating a reserve CivPol force and diversification. Some recommendations have been implemented while others are still being discussed. Advocates propose creating a reserve CivPol force, diversifying international police forces with units of police with military skills, and establishing more robust civilian response mechanisms to enhance law enforcement systems. The proposal includes a \"stability package\" of legal professionals to improve law enforcement systems in post-conflict operations, aiming to reduce reliance on U.S. military forces. The report discusses the evolution and challenges of using international police in peacekeeping operations. (Appendix A provides a chart summary of operations, while Appendix B details the expansion of policing in U.N. and U.S.-led efforts.) The report discusses the current mechanisms for providing CivPols to international operations, recommendations for improving those systems, and the status of their implementation. It also assesses various approaches to resolve ongoing problems and provides options for the U.S. Congress for system improvements. The report may be updated if necessary. The international community has increasingly relied on CivPols for various functions in international peace operations. Between 1994 and 2000, the number of international civilian police participating in U.N. operations (UNCIVPOLs) increased fourfold. As of February 29, 2004, there were 4,655 international civilian police, including 476 Americans, assisting with law enforcement tasks in U.N. operations. As of February 29, 2004, there were 4,655 international civilian police, including 476 Americans, assisting with law enforcement tasks in U.N. peacekeeping missions. Some analysts suggest deploying international civilian police to Afghanistan, Iraq, and Haiti for post-conflict police force training. The United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom are working to establish indigenous police forces in Iraq and Haiti. As of February 29, 2004, five UNCIVPOL were deployed to Afghanistan. U.S. assistance for law enforcement abroad is governed by Section 660 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, which prohibits aid for foreign police forces, prisons, or intelligence programs, with some exceptions. International civilian police forces have been used for various purposes since the late 19th century, with recruits from multiple nations monitoring and supervising local situations. Assistance in post-conflict scenarios is provided on a case-by-case basis due to the lack of specific statutory authority to regulate and fund such aid. International civilian police forces, with recruits from multiple nations, have been used since the late 19th century to monitor, supervise, train, advise, and assist local forces. They support human rights, monitor, advise, report, and train (SMART functions). Sometimes armed with arrest powers, they assist in restructuring and expelling undesirable members. The international forces have been armed and granted arrest powers for policing in peacekeeping operations, evolving through five phases to establish security. The first two phases involved expanding U.N. activities from monitoring mandates. The evolution of international peacekeeping operations has involved expanding U.N. activities from monitoring mandates to include training components and substantial reform of police institutions. Subsequent phases included the addition of specially constituted forces. The evolution of international peacekeeping operations has involved expanding U.N. activities to include training components and reforming police institutions. Subsequent phases included the addition of specially constituted constabulary units and expanding mandates to provide international police with executive authority. The evolution of international peacekeeping operations has involved expanding U.N. activities to include training components and reforming police institutions. This evolution reflected the international community's growing awareness of the broad range of security needs and types of assistance required by indigenous police forces in peace operations. Policymakers and analysts increasingly view ensuring public security as the responsibility of countries and organizations involved in interventions, to be provided jointly with indigenous personnel. Policymakers and analysts are focused on improving mechanisms for implementing peacekeeping mandates by addressing gaps in public security. This includes the need for clear mandates and standards for effective implementation. Recent legislative proposals aim to address two identified problem areas in public security. The first gap, labeled as a system gap, pertains to deficiencies in recruitment and training mechanisms, particularly within the United Nations, which struggles to recruit well-trained and professional policemen due to diverse policing standards among volunteer countries. The United Nations faces challenges in recruiting well-trained and professional policemen due to diverse policing standards among volunteer countries. Some recruits lack basic skills and engage in corruption, despite efforts to weed out unsuitable candidates. Additional training is needed to improve personnel skills for complex missions. Despite efforts to recruit personnel with all necessary skills, problems persist in finding individuals with the required expertise. Analysts argue that additional training is essential to enhance policing skills and professionalism, as well as to improve collaboration among officers. Furthermore, there are three security gaps hindering the international community's ability to establish law and order in post-conflict situations, with deficiencies in recruitment and training systems exacerbating these gaps. The deployment gap in post-conflict situations can be problematic when police forces are not deployed quickly or in sufficient numbers. This gap has been observed in various international missions, such as in Cambodia in the 1990s. Deficiencies in recruitment and training systems can worsen these security gaps. In international missions like in Cambodia in the 1990s, deployment of police forces faced delays, hindering their ability to carry out mandated tasks. Despite some improvements in deployment times, gaps still exist in reaching authorized mission sizes. The deployment of police forces in international missions still faces delays in reaching authorized sizes and lacks specialized skills. There is an enforcement gap where deployed police lack necessary skills for security and policing operations. The deployment of police forces in international missions faces challenges due to a lack of specialized skills needed for security and policing operations. In particular, military skills are required for constabulary functions in hostile situations, as well as investigative and intelligence-gathering skills to combat organized crime. Peacekeeping operations have been compromised when military forces were not available to assist police due to shortages or mandate limitations. Additionally, an institution gap exists where indigenous law enforcement systems lack sufficient personnel and institutions for effective law enforcement. Since the end of the Cold War, the international community has provided international police assistance through multilateral and unilateral mechanisms to address the gap in indigenous law enforcement systems lacking adequate personnel and institutions for effective law enforcement. The international community has provided police assistance through various mechanisms, with the United Nations being a key player. The UN international civilian police system is the main mechanism for international civilian police assistance in multilateral operations, with 4,655 UNCIVPOL officers from 65 nations serving in eight UN missions as of February 29, 2004. About a fifth of countries provide two-thirds of these officers. As of February 29, 2004, 4,655 UNCIVPOL officers from 65 nations were serving in eight U.N. missions. Jordan is the largest contributor with 553 officers, followed by the United States with 476. Other countries with over 100 officers include India, Germany, Turkey, Ukraine, Nepal, Malaysia, Romania, Pakistan, Argentina, Poland, and the United Kingdom. The majority of UNCIVPOL officers, 3,508, were serving in Kosovo, the largest mission, with other missions in Liberia, East Timor, Sierra Leone, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The United States provided police assistance in U.S. peacekeeping operations in Somalia and Haiti in the 1990s. They also led police training programs in Somalia through the Justice Department's ICITAP. The United States led police training programs in Somalia through the Justice Department's ICITAP. European Union member states and organizations like OSCE and EU have also provided police assistance in Somalia. The OSCE and EU have taken the lead in specific police missions, providing training assistance and support in various countries. The EU assumed responsibility for the police mission in Bosnia in 2003 and launched the PROXIMA mission in the former Yugoslav region. The EU took over the police mission in Bosnia from the United Nations in 2003 and launched the 200-strong PROXIMA mission in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia on December 15, 2003. U.N. Member States contribute police personnel voluntarily for peacekeeping operations based on international standards for democratic community policing and human rights. The U.N. philosophy of CivPol is based on international standards for democratic community policing and human rights. The Charter-driven principles of peacekeeping governing civilian police include consent, impartiality, and minimal use of force. The Department of Peacekeeping Operations provides political and executive direction to all components of the operation in the field, including the police mission. The Civilian Police Division is responsible for policy and planning of civilian policing within the UNDPKO. The Civilian Police Division (CPD) within the UNDPKO oversees civilian policing activities, assists Member States with recruitment, and manages deployment of international civilian police officers. Training is handled by the UNDPKO training unit as CPD lacks a budget for it. UNCIVPOL personnel in the field are under the command of the UNCIVPOL Police Commissioner. The UNDPKO training unit handles training as the CPD lacks a budget for it. UNCIVPOL personnel in the field are under the command of the UNCIVPOL Police Commissioner. The Brahimi Panel report identified issues with recruitment, training, and deployment of police personnel in U.N. peacekeeping. It recommended actions to strengthen the U.N.'s capacity for rapid deployment of UNCIVPOLs. The Brahimi Panel report recommended actions to strengthen the U.N.'s capacity for rapid deployment of UNCIVPOLs, including the establishment of a \"ready roster\" of qualified CivPols by each police-contributing Member State and the development of an on-call list of experts for advance mission planning. Additionally, regional partnerships for joint police training and the identification of a national point of contact on CivPol matters in each country were suggested. Between March 1998 and mid-August 2000, the UNDPKO held three conferences with police-contributing nations to address problems with recruitment, training, deployment, and related issues in U.N. policing operations. Donor countries reached near consensus on proposals to improve the U.N. system, including the incorporation of CivPol personnel under the U.N. standby. The Brahimi Panel and UNDPKO seminar recommendations included incorporating CivPol personnel under the U.N. standby system, improving training, pre-positioning equipment for rapid deployment, and addressing organizational impediments. Despite some implementation, analysts note significant issues with the UNCIVPOL system. Since the Brahimi Panel and UNDPKO seminar recommendations, some progress has been made in reforming the operational and internal management of UNDPKO. However, significant problems persist with the UNCIVPOL system, particularly in recruitment, training, and deployment. The recommended reforms aim to address these issues, but constraints on implementation remain. The Brahimi Panel report highlighted the need for a new approach in UNCIVPOL operations, emphasizing the importance of qualified law enforcement personnel and a doctrinal shift. The report also addressed issues with recruitment, training, and deployment within the UNCIVPOL system. The Brahimi Panel report emphasized the need for a doctrinal shift in UNCIVPOL operations, requiring more qualified law enforcement personnel to work alongside rule of law experts to strengthen institutions. This shift would stress U.N. Member States to provide specialized police experts. The Brahimi Panel report highlighted the need for a shift in UNCIVPOL operations, requiring more specialized police experts. However, implementing this approach is controversial within the U.N. CivPol system, as it may infringe on Member States' sovereignty perceptions. The United Nations has taken steps towards using more rule of law experts in peacekeeping operations by creating a new unit, but progress is seen as \"lagging\" according to a recent report. The UNDPKO received only two out of six requested posts for planning rule of law operations, limiting its effectiveness. Progress towards integrating rule of law-related components is seen as \"lagging\" as the UNDPKO only received two out of six requested posts for planning rule of law operations. This hinders the deployment of missions with a substantial criminal justice component, similar to the situation three years ago. The current ad hoc system of recruiting civilian police from various UN Member nations presents three problems, with specific reforms proposed by the Brahimi Panel report and the UNDPKO seminar addressing the first two issues. The United Nations faces challenges in recruiting police officers with necessary skills and experience, as well as in developing a comprehensive civilian police strategy. The United Nations struggles to recruit police officers with specialized skills due to the absence of a comprehensive civilian police strategy, making it difficult to determine mission needs and necessary skills. This complicates the recruitment process for suitable civilian police personnel. The United Nations requires Member States to provide civilian police officers who meet basic criteria for UNCIVPOL missions, including age, years of service, language proficiency, driver's license, and medical standards. Executive authority missions require officers with firearms experience. Pre-selection testing and induction are also part of the recruitment process. Since 1996, the United Nations has sent Selection Assistance Teams (SATs) to guide Member States in selecting police candidates, focusing on language, driving, and firearms skills. Some civilian police personnel still do not meet basic selection criteria despite U.N. efforts. The United Nations has sent Selection Assistance Teams to help Member States choose police candidates, focusing on language, driving, and firearms skills. Some civilian police personnel still do not meet basic criteria, leading to high repatriation costs and deployment delays. Recruitment for specialized skills remains challenging. Recruitment for specialized skills, such as training, investigations, organized crime, forensics, drug trafficking, and police intelligence, has been challenging. The UNDPKO has had better success recruiting for general skills than for specialists. Recommendations have been made for advance recruitment of personnel to improve the quality of recruits and speed up deployment. The Brahimi Panel Report recommended establishing a national \"ready roster\" of pre-selected and trained CivPol personnel for quick deployment under the U.N. System of Standby Arrangements. Success in implementing these recommendations has been mixed. The report recommended the creation of \"national pools\" of police officers, including retired officers meeting requirements. The UNDPKO seminar suggested enhancing UNSAS with an effective ready roster of international police personnel. The U.N. Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations noted progress in strengthening UNSAS for military, civilian police, and civilian personnel. The March 2003 U.N. report welcomed progress in strengthening UNSAS for military, civilian police, and civilian personnel. However, the December 2003 evaluation found that too few states have created national pools of candidates for international operations. The report recommended replacing 'bidding for slots' with real candidates with professional experience and familiarity with UN rules and procedures. The Brahimi Panel Report recommended maintaining an \"on-call list of 100 police officers and related experts\" for advance mission planning and early deployment. In February 2002, UNDPKO established a 100-person on-call roster of civilian police personnel for new missions. As of March 2004, 10 out of 89 police-contributing Member States have nominated individuals for the on-call lists. The United Nations has made efforts to improve recruitment for specialists by including substantive skills in selection criteria since spring 2003. These skills relate to management, planning, training, mentoring, and operations such as criminal investigations, forensic analysis, and traffic control. Analysts have criticized the lack of standardized criteria for determining the number of civilian police needed for U.N. missions, as highlighted in a 2001 audit. The 2001 audit criticized UNDPKO for not consistently applying assessment systems to match skills appropriately for specific missions, leading to civilian police personnel performing non-policing functions and reducing the number available for policing duties in UN missions. The 2001 audit criticized UNDPKO for not consistently matching skills for specific missions, leading to civilian police personnel performing non-policing functions and reducing the number available for policing duties in UN missions. Nearly 18 percent of civilian police in UNMIBH and UNMIK, and 10 percent in UNTAET, were assigned to mission headquarters, with administrative functions accounting for eight percent of total police officers. Training varies among police-contributing Member States, with some considering it inadequate, leading to a lack of uniformity in experience and standardized training that can undermine effectiveness. The lack of uniformity in experience and standardized training among well-qualified personnel can undermine the effectiveness of a UNCIVPOL mission. The police component may comprise officers from up to 40 countries who have little relevant training or mission-specific briefings, leading to varied policing practices and doctrines. Member States are responsible for providing pre-deployment training for missions. Member States are responsible for providing pre-deployment training to civilian police personnel for missions. In-theater training covers standard procedures, safety, security, human rights, computer, and local language training. Challenges include a lack of experienced trainers, resources, and national training programs. Member States face challenges in providing adequate pre-deployment training for civilian police personnel for missions. Recommendations include developing regional partnerships for joint police training exercises and utilizing U.N. educational materials for rapid deployment readiness. The Stimson Center suggests using U.N. educational materials for pre-training personnel for rapid deployment. Efforts have been made by the UNDPKO Training Unit to improve pre-deployment training through the development and distribution of training publications. UNDPKO has developed common training standards, including standardized \"generic training modules\" to ensure uniformity in the competence of deployed peacekeepers, including police. PDD-71 highlighted training as an area where the United States could enhance the capabilities of other nations in CivPol operations. Training specialists visit Member States to provide resources and advice on pre-deployment training programs. PDD-71 emphasized the importance of training in enhancing the capabilities of other nations in CivPol operations. It called for the State Department's INL office to provide tailored training packages to U.S. and international CIVPOL when requested by the organizing body or contributing state. The State Department's INL office is tasked with providing tailored training packages to U.S. and international CIVPOL when requested. A new CivPol program aims to invite foreign police officers to train with the U.S. contingent, although specific arrangements have not been finalized. Deployment of UNCIVPOL is a complex process involving defining mission needs and rapid recruitment. The deployment of UNCIVPOL is a complex process involving defining mission needs, rapid recruitment, and procurement of material and equipment from various nations. Historically, deployment times have ranged from six to eighteen months due to resource limitations. The Brahimi Report identified reasons for deployment delays, including the lack of a standing police force. The Brahimi Panel and UNDPKO seminar recommendations aimed to address the lack of a reserve corps of mission leadership, unreliable standby arrangements, and insufficient ready equipment for peacekeeping missions. The Brahimi Panel set a deployment period of four to 12 weeks for peacekeeping missions, with full deployment recommended within 30 days for traditional missions and within 90 days for complex missions. The Brahimi Panel report recommended full deployment within 30 days for traditional peacekeeping missions and within 90 days for complex emergencies after a Security Council authorization. There are uncertainties about meeting the 30-90 day rapid deployment time frame for military and police personnel due to constraints on rapid deployment identified by the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations. The Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations identified constraints on rapid deployment, including the U.N. system's limited capacity for concurrent missions, civilian standby arrangements, and the need for contributing states' political will. Reforms are underway to improve the United Nations System for Standby Arrangements for quicker deployment in the future. The United Nations is reforming its standby arrangements to deploy more rapidly in the future. This includes developing a roster of civilian police personnel and improving procurement and management of deployment stocks at the U.N. Logistics Base in Italy. However, there is no program in place to prepare UNCIVPOL for rapid deployment. The United Nations is reforming standby arrangements for rapid deployment, including developing a roster of civilian police personnel. However, there is no program to prepare UNCIVPOL for rapid deployment. Many U.N. Member States lack the capability to deploy rapidly. The U.S. CivPol program is managed by the Department of State's Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs. Unlike other countries, the United States does not have a large national police force to draw from. The United States does not have a large national police force like most other countries. Instead, the State Department recruits civilian police personnel on a case-by-case basis through a commercial contractor. DynCorp International has been the sole supplier of civilian police personnel, but a new arrangement with DynCorp and Civilian Police International LLC will be initiated in April 2004. In February 2004, the State Department contracted DynCorp and Civilian Police International LLC to maintain rosters of up to 2,000 personnel for deploying CivPol personnel. Another contract was issued in March to PAE Government Services, Inc., and HomeLand Security Corporation for the same purpose. These companies will use the rosters to bid on contracts for deploying personnel. The U.S. CivPol program is funded through various State Department bureaus and the Peacekeeping account. Officers receive a base salary of $50,000-100,000, with additional allowances for U.N. missions. Total costs vary by mission, ranging from $100,000 per officer in Kosovo. The total cost of U.S. CivPol personnel varies by mission, with recent annual costs ranging from $100,000 per officer in Kosovo to $150,000-$175,000 per officer in Iraq. Expenses in Kosovo cover salary, equipment, transportation, and MWR support, while in Iraq, it also includes security, food, and housing costs. United Nations covers expenses in Kosovo. The cost of providing security, food, and housing for U.S. CivPol personnel in Iraq is higher compared to Kosovo. The Congressional Budget Office estimated the incremental cost per troop for soldiers in Iraq, ranging from $179,000 to $206,000 based on rotation schedules. Deploying reserve component soldiers in Iraq costs considerably more than maintaining them in peacetime. As of March 27, 2004, 1,016 U.S. CivPol and support personnel were involved in international CivPol missions, with deployments in Kosovo, Liberia, East Timor, and Sierra Leone under U.N. missions, as well as contributions in Afghanistan. Deploying reserve component soldiers in Iraq costs considerably more than maintaining them in peacetime. As of March 27, 2004, 1,016 U.S. CivPol and support personnel were involved in international missions in various countries. The United States also provided police officers for missions in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Israel. Policymakers have acknowledged challenges in recruiting qualified personnel and have implemented reforms to enhance response capacities. The U.S. faces challenges in recruiting qualified CivPol personnel. PDD-71 aims to improve operational activities and enhance response capacities. Issues include matching skills with mission requirements, training inconsistencies, and professionalism levels. The U.N. civilian police system faces challenges such as inefficiency in matching skills with mission requirements, training inconsistencies, and deployment lag. Analysts stress the need for improvement despite positive perceptions of the U.S. civilian police program. The Department of State has issued contracts to establish a reserve cadre of up to 2,000 U.S. law enforcement personnel for international police service. The State Department has issued contracts to establish a reserve cadre of up to 2,000 U.S. law enforcement personnel for international police service, aiming to facilitate rapid deployment of well-qualified CivPols. The contractor is responsible for recruitment, training, and procurement services to eliminate the need for repeated recruitment and training activities. The State Department has awarded contracts to establish a reserve cadre of up to 2,000 U.S. law enforcement personnel for international police service. The new civilian police program aims to expedite deployment by eliminating the need for repeated recruitment and training activities. Multiple companies will be involved in the program, raising questions about its efficiency. Technical advisors will assist in establishing institutional capabilities in police, judicial, and corrections systems. The State Department's new civilian police program aims to expedite deployment by awarding contracts to multiple companies. Questions have been raised about the efficiency of the process due to the involvement of multiple companies. Concerns include additional costs, delays, and unclear application of original RFP provisions. The new civilian police program by the State Department aims to expedite deployment by awarding contracts to multiple companies. Recruitment methods are unclear as new contracts have not been made public. DynCorp recruits police officers from state and local law enforcement agencies for international police service. Some police officers leave their jobs to perform international police service, including recent retirees. The system faces challenges in recruiting due to overextended municipal and state forces, exacerbated by call-ups of U.S. military reserve forces. Analysts suggest that the current contracting system has not consistently brought in high-quality recruits. Analysts suggest that the United States could recruit a more professional and qualified police force by providing compensation to state and municipal governments for detailing officers to international missions. This would require new legal arrangements as currently, there are no financial incentives for law enforcement agencies to participate in international police service. Some argue that recruiting individual U.S. police officers for international missions has led to a less cohesive U.S. police contingent within UNCIVPOL forces. Analysts also claim that the U.S. selection criteria may not accurately reflect mission requirements, which currently include U.S. citizenship and eight years of law enforcement experience. The requirements for U.S. police officers for international missions include U.S. citizenship, eight years of law enforcement experience, an unblemished record, a valid driver's license, physical and psychological fitness, a valid U.S. passport, and English proficiency. Some missions also require proficiency with a 9mm handgun. The Department of State is meeting its recruitment goals for basic skills and is improving its processes. The Department of State is meeting recruitment goals for basic skills and is improving processes. For missions in Kosovo, East Timor, and Iraq, qualifications were expanded to include two years of specialized experience. The State Department CivPol cadre program aims to address the issue of recruiting high-quality personnel, with nearly 55% of the cadre being specialists. The CivPol cadre program bid solicitation emphasized that 55% of the cadre would be specialists with specific qualifications including interpersonal, leadership, training, and negotiation skills, knowledge of international police standards, and experience in multicultural environments. Selected individuals would receive annual training in essential policing skills to attract high-quality officers to the program. The State Department aims to provide training to attract high-quality officers to the CivPol cadre program, with the goal of helping officers achieve career advancement. However, the funding for training all members of the program is uncertain. Training for U.S. CivPols is challenging due to varying levels of skills and professionalism among recruited police officers. Training for U.S. CivPols faces challenges due to inconsistencies in skills and professionalism among recruited police officers. The current program includes pre-deployment training called Police Assessment, Selection, and Training (P.A.S.T), covering topics like United Nations, peace operations, and ICITAP. The pre-deployment training curriculum for U.S. CivPols covers various topics such as United Nations, peace operations, mission overview, civil-military relations, team building, lifestyle in the mission, human rights, logistical support, personal safety, defensive tactics, and use of police equipment. Candidates also undergo driving, language, and firearms tests. The training curriculum is being improved according to bid solicitation documents for the new State Department CivPol cadre program. The new State Department CivPol cadre program includes training in driving, language, and firearms tests. The improved curriculum aims to meet Police Officer Standards and Training certification requirements and international principles of democratic policing and human rights. Ongoing training will cover policing skills, specialized training, and annual additional training. The new CivPol cadre program includes training in driving, language, and firearms tests. Additional training will be provided annually. Deployment of the U.S. CivPol contingent to a U.N. operation can occur within 30-45 days following a U.N. Security Council authorization. Training costs may increase under the new three-contractor cadre system due to higher annual trainees and facilities for pre-deployment training. The United States fulfills the deployment requirement for the CivPol cadre program within 30-45 days of U.N. Security Council authorization. However, proposed legislation calls for deployment capability within 15 days. Analysts question if the U.S. can maintain this capability under the new system. The contractor will maintain a database of commercial sources for the program. The contractor for the CivPol cadre program would maintain a database of commercial sources for equipment on standby, potentially reducing deployment time. They would also provide advanced logistical and administrative support for the U.S. police contingent, enhancing operational capabilities. It is unclear if these provisions still apply under the new system's contracts. The team deploying in advance of the U.S. CivPol contingent may face delays due to new bidding processes for each mission. European countries typically deploy police from their national forces for international CivPol operations, except for the United Kingdom and the United States. European governments have been aware of the need for reform in their deployment practices for several years. European governments have recognized the importance of reforming their deployment systems to improve international CivPol capabilities. The EU has set goals to enhance the quality and timeliness of European contributions to U.N., OSCE, and EU police missions, including developing a 5,000 civilian reserve police force for international peace operations. Member States agreed to develop a 5,000 civilian reserve police force for international peace operations by 2003, within the context of the European Security and Defense Policy. The police capabilities would include civil status and police forces capable of performing constabulary functions. In June 2001, the G\u00c3\u00b6teborg European Council adopted a Police Action Plan to establish common requirements for selection and training of police. The EU established the Rapid Reaction Mechanism (RRM) to provide flexible funding for civilian crisis management operations. As of late February 2004, EU Member States committed up to 5,000 police officers for crisis management operations, with 1,400 available for rapid deployment within 30 days. Member States also agreed to provide up to 13 rapidly deployable, integrated police teams. In November 2003, personnel from 22 European countries attended a joint exercise in Italy to test the interoperability of integrated police units at the headquarters level. The EU launched its first ESDP mission on January 1, 2003, the EU Police Mission in Bosnia and Hercegovia (BiH), with commitments from Member States to provide up to 13 rapidly deployable, integrated police units and headquarters units for police missions. The EU launched its first ESDP mission on January 1, 2003 in Bosnia and Herzegovina, aiming to establish sustainable policing arrangements. The mission consists of 500 police officers and 70 civilian experts from 33 states, with an annual budget of US $47.2 million. Additionally, on December 15, 2003, the EU began its second police mission in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia with 200 police and civilian personnel. On December 15, 2003, the EU launched its second police mission in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia with 200 police and civilian personnel. The budget for the first year is US$18.6 million, with all EU Member States except Portugal participating. Analysts are skeptical about the EU's crisis management and rapid reaction capabilities improving significantly. The EU's reformed crisis management and rapid reaction capabilities may not substantially improve its ability to respond, with skepticism about Member States' willingness to surrender national sovereignty. The OSCE is also enhancing its operational capabilities, deploying CivPols in eight countries as of February 25, 2004. The OSCE's Rapid Expert Assistance and Cooperation Teams (REACT) program was created at the Istanbul Summit in 1999 to deploy experts in conflict prevention, crisis management, and post-conflict missions in eight countries. Policing activities focus on training, reform, and development of local police rather than basic monitoring functions. The REACT program, established in April 2001 by the OSCE, aims to deploy qualified civilian experts, including CivPols, within two to eight weeks for specific missions related to promoting security in various areas such as human rights, rule of law, and economic stabilization. Since its establishment in April 2001, the OSCE's REACT program has made efforts to implement and enhance the program by creating national websites for recruitment and providing mechanisms for receiving applications. Some OSCE participating States prefer not to nominate specific individuals until field requirements are known, citing efficiency, legal, and privacy concerns. The OSCE developed standards for educational and experience requirements to identify needed skills for its activities. A staffing matrix based on past and current field activities assists participating States in recruiting qualified candidates, with a focus on recruiting CivPols through REACT for advising, mentoring, and development functions. The OSCE recruits qualified CivPols through REACT for advising, mentoring, and development functions. General minimum requirements include graduation from a police training school, active police experience, English communication skills, negotiation, mapping, and first aid experience. Desired skills include liaison experience with non-law enforcement organizations and proficiency in operating police radio equipment. Mission-specific requirements focus on specific skills. In the 108th Congress, Members introduced bills to strengthen U.S. and international capabilities for CivPol missions. H.R. 1414 aims to improve UNCIVPOL capabilities, while H.R. 2616 addresses issues with U.S. CivPol capabilities and proposes creating capabilities within NATO. OSCE recruits law enforcement administrators with extensive experience and expertise for police management roles. H.R. 1414, H.R. 2616, and S. 2127 aim to enhance international civilian police capabilities, including within NATO, to respond to crises abroad. Analysts suggest options to improve training, constabulary functions, and law enforcement institutions. H.R. 1414 proposes significant reforms to enhance the effectiveness and rapid deployment of UNCIVPOL, addressing recruitment and training issues. It calls for the establishment of a professional United Nations civilian police corps (UNCPC) and requests a report from the U.N. Secretariat. The bill proposes reforms to enhance UNCIVPOL effectiveness by establishing a professional United Nations civilian police corps (UNCPC) for rapid deployment to peace operations within 15 days of a U.N. Security Council authorization. The bill proposes the establishment of a United Nations civilian police corps for rapid deployment to peace operations with appropriate resources and staffing. The bill proposes the establishment of a United Nations civilian police corps with appropriate resources, including funding, equipment, training, logistical support, and staffing. It aims to address deployment and enforcement gaps in police missions. The bill proposes creating a professional U.N. police corps to address deployment and enforcement gaps in police missions, ensuring adequate funding and specifying a size for the proposed UNCPC. This would allow the United Nations to take responsibility more effectively for maintaining a secure environment and reduce the need for combat soldiers in civilian police tasks. The bill proposes establishing a professional U.N. police corps to enhance peacekeeping efforts by reducing the reliance on combat soldiers for civilian police tasks. Opponents are concerned about the cost and feasibility of a standing corps. The United States may be hesitant to support a standing U.N. police corps due to concerns about increased assessed contributions and sustainability if funded through voluntary contributions. Analysts also worry about the U.N.'s limited management capacity and potential infringement on national sovereignty. H.R. 2616, the Winning the Peace Act of 2003, proposes new mechanisms for providing security in post-conflict situations during reconstruction efforts. The bill proposes the establishment of a U.S. civilian police reserve to provide security in post-conflict situations and upgrade the current U.S. CivPol system. This reserve would serve as an interim police force overseas and train indigenous civilian police forces. The bill proposes equipping indigenous civilian police forces and establishing a U.S. civilian police reserve for post-conflict situations. It also suggests creating a NATO mechanism for military and policing services in reconstruction scenarios. The bill proposes training and equipping selected NATO units to provide security in reconstruction situations. It suggests establishing an \"integrated security support component\" within NATO for this purpose, authorizing the President to commit personnel capable of serving as a police force for civilian security. The tasks specified for the selected units include constabulary skills for controlling belligerent groups and crowds, as well as policing, investigative, and intelligence skills for apprehending targeted persons or groups. The proposed legislation aims to enhance international capabilities for post-conflict reconstruction by establishing a civilian police reserve to bridge deployment gaps and support police investigations. The proposed legislation aims to establish a civilian police reserve to expedite the deployment of U.S. civilian police in post-conflict reconstruction. There is debate over whether to follow the State Department's private sector model or create a new U.S. government reserve force. Proponents of the private contractor model argue that it is preferable for quicker response times and avoiding new government bureaucracies. Opponents raise concerns about potential limitations in dedication and adaptability of commercial contractors in military and policing operations. Proponents of a government-sponsored reserve argue that it symbolizes U.S. commitment better, is more responsive to policy, and could be a more cohesive and accountable force compared to a private contractor. Proponents argue that a government-sponsored reserve would be more cohesive, accountable, and better able to guarantee the quality of recruits compared to a private contractor. Additionally, it could easily draw qualified CivPol personnel from local and state police departments through a compensation system. A government-sponsored reserve force may be more effective and reliable than a contractor model, especially if reservists train together regularly and coordinate with military forces. This could be easier to establish under a government-created model. A NATO constabulary capability could bridge the enforcement gap by providing necessary skills in post-conflict situations. However, some question whether NATO, a military organization, is the appropriate venue for a force with policing functions. Many analysts argue that using military forces for policing functions may send inappropriate signals to civil authorities and the local population. Some critics argue that creating a reserve within NATO for policing functions may duplicate existing EU structures and strain US-European relations. Analysts suggest additional provisions in the bill for equipment, training, and coordination with the military to avoid delays in deployment. Some critics argue that the deployment of U.S. and other police reservists may be delayed without prior equipment commitment. They also believe that standardized training is necessary to avoid policing style discrepancies. Critics are skeptical about the need for U.S. police officers' involvement in international reserves. Some critics are skeptical of the need for police reserves and the involvement of U.S. police officers in international forces. S. 2127 aims to strengthen civilian rule of law and other capabilities through reorganizing government structures. The Stabilization and Reconstruction Civilian Management Act of 2004 (S. 2127) aims to reorganize government structures to enhance the capacity of civilian foreign affairs agencies to respond to overseas crises. It proposes $80 million to hire personnel for a Response Readiness Corps and maintain a Response Readiness Reserve roster. The Stabilization and Reconstruction Civilian Management Act of 2004 proposes creating a Response Readiness Corps and Reserve roster consisting of federal employees and non-government personnel trained for missions. Within three years, 10% of State Department and USAID personnel would be trained for this force. Senator Lugar's bill aims to address delays in deploying rule of law personnel. Senator Lugar's bill aims to address delays in deploying rule of law personnel by improving the training and professionalization of CivPol personnel. The legislation does not specify the types of personnel to be recruited or the extent of expertise needed in areas such as stability and reconstruction. Improved training and professionalization of CivPol personnel could help bridge deployment gaps. Pre-deployment training has not kept pace with the increasing scope and mandate of police missions, leading to adjustments being made in the field on a case-by-case basis. PDD-71 proposed maintaining the capacity to provide tailored training packages to CivPol when requested. The capacity to provide tailored training packages to U.S. and international CivPol when requested by the organizing body or contributing state, with appropriate funding available. Some analysts suggest increased funding for police training due to the prohibitive costs for many nations. The State Department's new CivPol cadre bid solicitation proposal includes a provision for U.S. training of foreign police personnel, but no decisions have been made yet. The bid solicitation proposal includes a provision for U.S. training of foreign police personnel, with no decision made on the program or arrangements yet. The content and scope of the program may depend on available funding. Another option is to increase international capability for constabulary forces, as proposed in H.R. 2616 to incorporate a unit within NATO. H.R. 2616 proposes incorporating a unit within NATO capable of performing constabulary functions, which involve tasks requiring less force than combat but more than routine law enforcement activities. Constabulary tasks include regulating peoples' movements for safety, intervening in civil violence, and dispersing unruly public demonstrations. Constabulary forces are essential for handling hostile situations like looting, riots, and civil disturbances. They are trained in both military and policing skills, making them valuable in post-conflict areas. They can deploy rapidly as formed units and often have their own communication and logistical support when on peacekeeping missions. Constabulary forces are crucial for handling hostile situations like looting, riots, and civil disturbances. They can deploy rapidly as formed units with their own communication and logistical support. Some analysts suggest establishing specialized paramilitary units for peacekeeping operations, similar to the Italian carabinieri, French gendarmerie, and Spanish Guardia Civil. Constabulary forces, like the Italian carabinieri, French gendarmerie, and Spanish Guardia Civil, are essential for handling hostile situations. However, these resources can be strained by high deployment rates in U.N. peacekeeping operations. Some suggest the U.S. army should develop its own constabulary force to support military police in peacekeeping operations. The U.S. army faces shortages in its Military Police capability during high peacekeeping deployment rates. Army leaders have been hesitant to restructure the service for peacekeeping operations, prioritizing its primary warfighting mission. However, with interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq, questions arise on the effectiveness of military forces in winning wars without establishing peace. Proponents argue that adaptable Army forces can handle security tasks in various conflict environments, reducing the need for combat soldiers in policing activities and speeding up post-conflict withdrawal. Constabulary forces can reduce reliance on combat soldiers for policing activities and shorten withdrawal time from post-conflict situations. Analysts are unsure if other countries would enhance their constabulary capabilities or if countries without such capabilities would develop them for deployment abroad. Some analysts suggest developing a \"U.S. Force for Stability\" to address the institution gap in peace operations by creating rapidly deployable units of law enforcement and rule of law personnel for sustainable security. Several analysts have urged the development of U.S. and international capabilities to rapidly deploy a full range of rule of law professionals, including judicial branch officials and prison personnel, in addition to police. The United States currently deploys personnel with experience in justice and corrections systems through Department of Justice contracts funded by the State Department's INL CivPol program. The State Department's new CivPol cadre program aims to create a capability within CivPol to deploy such personnel, but many analysts believe the current system does not provide the full range of necessary security. Robert S. Perito, a special advisor at the USIP, advocates for integrating military and civilian personnel to form a \"U.S. force for stability\" as part of intervention forces. Perito proposes a \"U.S. force for stability\" consisting of military, civilian, and rule of law professionals to address security gaps in post-conflict interventions. Perito proposes a model where military, civilian, and rule of law professionals work concurrently to provide security in post-conflict interventions. Military shifts to perimeter security after combat, while civilians take over law enforcement functions when conditions permit. The model proposed by Perito involves a shift in military roles from combat to perimeter security after major combat operations. Constabulary units, consisting of military and civilian personnel, are responsible for internal security and suppressing civil disorder. Civilian police and justice experts then join forces to maintain public safety and restore the rule of law, with a transition towards a civilian-led approach over time. Perito's model involves a transition from military to civilian control for law enforcement functions, similar to NATO and U.N. forces in Kosovo. Recommendations include deploying civilian personnel alongside combat forces for nation-building tasks. The report suggests integrating civilian personnel with combat forces for nation-building tasks and recommends creating a standing interagency stabilization and reconstruction team within the government. It also proposes the establishment of an Agency for Stability Operations reporting directly to the Secretary of State. The report recommends creating an Agency for Stability Operations under the Secretary of State to manage a Civilian Stability Operations Corps and Reserve for rapid deployment. Proponents argue that deploying rule of law personnel early is crucial for security during operations. Many analysts argue that early deployment of rule of law personnel is essential for security and long-term stability in intervened or post-conflict countries. This approach could allow for the earlier withdrawal of military personnel. However, implementing such a force would require significant changes in current U.S. practices, including developing constabulary capabilities and increasing the number of military police. The development of significant constabulary capabilities, including an increased number of military police, is necessary for early deployment of rule of law personnel in intervened or post-conflict countries. The proposed international civilian police component would recruit constabulary and police personnel from a new federal agency, potentially controversial due to restructuring military forces. Arguments on government-employment versus government-contracted models for CivPol are discussed. The model for CivPol deployments is discussed, favoring federalizing the stability force rather than hiring through private contractors. The ease of deployment will depend on recruitment and hiring methods. Perito favors federalizing the CivPol component of the stability force for recruitment and hiring personnel, which may affect their rapid deployability. The availability of personnel for immediate deployment may depend on the recruitment arrangements and benefits provided. Law enforcement and rule of law personnel, like the U.S. military reserve component, may need benefits such as pensions and salaries for training. Sources include Peacekeeping Fact Sheets from the U.N. Department of Peacekeeping Operations, EU Police fact sheets, and OMIK information from the OSCE website. The curr_chunk provides references to various sources related to policing in peace operations, including publications by the United Nations, OSCE, and other authors. It excludes some U.N. civilian police missions with fewer numbers. The curr_chunk discusses the history of international police missions dating back to the late 1800s, including deployments to the Ottoman Empire and Albania. It also mentions the first use of U.N. civilian police in a peacekeeping operation in 1960. The first use of U.N. civilian police in a peacekeeping operation occurred in 1960 during the U.N. Operation in the Congo, where Ghanaian and Nigerian contingents were deployed to assist the Congolese police in maintaining order. Additionally, in 1962-63, the United Nations provided a U.N. Temporary Executive Authority (UNTEA) to administer West New Guinea during the transition from Dutch to Indonesian rule, recruiting Philippine police officers to assist the local force. The U.N. Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) was the first operation to use the term UNCIVPOL and establish a multilateral U.N. police force. UNFICYP CivPols assisted Cypriot police in maintaining order and security in sensitive areas to diffuse tensions. Monitoring mandates were predominant in post-cold war operations like in Cambodia in the late 1980s to early 1990s. Deployment and institution gaps were recognized during this period. The earliest post-cold war operations focused on monitoring local police officers in Namibia and the Western Sahara from 1989 to early 1992. The United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) in Namibia monitored the electoral process for South West Africa's independence. The United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) in Namibia monitored the electoral process for South West Africa's independence during the Cold War period. UNTAG set the model for future missions in the early 1990s by focusing on accompanying local police, investigating public complaints, and supervising police investigations. The United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) in Namibia set the model for future missions by focusing on accompanying local police, investigating public complaints, and supervising police investigations. UNTAG was followed by the U.N. Mission for the Referendum in Southwest Sahara (MINURSO) in 1991, where a temporary administration was established to carry out a referendum on the former Spanish colony's future status, which has been delayed due to opposition by Morocco. Other monitoring missions in Angola and Cambodia faced challenges with less established institutions and fragile peace accords. Monitoring missions in Angola and Cambodia faced challenges in less established institutions and fragile peace accords. Additional police monitors were deployed in the new states created by the break-up of Yugoslavia, but their missions were overwhelmed by armed conflict due to inadequate mandates and insufficient numbers. The U.N. Transition Administration in Cambodia (UNTAC) was a large peacekeeping operation with a monitoring mandate. However, it faced challenges due to inadequate mandates and insufficient military forces. The focus of the UNTAC police unit shifted to investigating complaints of political violations. The UNTAC police mission in Cambodia shifted its focus to investigating complaints of political liberties and human rights violations. The U.N. Secretary-General's representative granted arrest powers to CivPols in January 1993, establishing an UNTAC jail. However, these actions were deemed too late to make the operation effective. Deployment to the field took around 10 months, contributing to the operational challenges faced in Cambodia. Deployment delays in Cambodia hindered the effectiveness of the UNTAC operation, with a 10-month delay in full deployment noted as a hindrance. The insufficient number of authorized police further impacted the mission, leading to a shift from ensuring law and order to monitoring elections. The UNTAC police mission in Cambodia shifted its focus from ensuring law and order to monitoring elections. Training for Cambodian police and judiciary was recognized as necessary, with limited resources leading to makeshift training by civil police. Analyses of the operation highlighted the development of an \"institution gap\" within UNTAC. Analyses of the UNTAC operation led to the concept of an \"institution gap\" due to the lack of an independent judicial system. Integrated \"justice packages\" were proposed to address this issue, including police reform and training components added from 1992-1994. Reform of police forces became a pivotal element in the U.N.'s efforts. Police reform in El Salvador was a key element in the U.N. Observer Mission, with international support providing unprecedented levels of assistance to establish civilian control over security forces. This reform was established through peace accords in January 1992, following mediation by the United Nations. The peace accords in January 1992 established the reform role for international police forces in El Salvador, ending a decade-long civil war. The United Nations mediated the accords, calling for the creation of a new National Civilian Police force and the reform of the judicial system. ONUSAL provided UNCIVPOLs in March 1992 to cooperate in the security affairs. In 1991, human rights monitors were dispatched before a cease-fire in El Salvador. UNCIVPOLs were provided in March 1992 to assist in the transition and accompany National Police officers. ONUSAL oversaw the formation of a new police academy and force during a two-year transition period. During the ONUSAL police operation, the new police academy and force were established with international assistance. Despite encountering significant problems, the success of the police force was considered crucial for the country's reconciliation and democratization processes. The success of the ONUSAL police operation in establishing a new police force was seen as crucial for reconciliation and democratization, despite facing significant challenges. This success convinced contributing governments of the importance of civilian police deployment in peacekeeping operations. Subsequent missions also focused on training and reform mandates. Subsequent missions in the next few years had training and reform mandates. The Mozambique civilian police operation, ONUMOZ, began in December 1992 with a focus on monitoring and a small training assistance component for the Mozambican police. ONUMOZ was a precursor to later training and police reform missions. International support for police reform in Mozambique came after the formal UN operations, with follow-up programs conducted through bilateral training, notably by the Spanish Guardia Civil. Similar training and reform efforts were seen in Rwanda, Somalia, and Haiti by international forces. In Somalia and Haiti, international forces led by the U.S. made efforts to provide humanitarian assistance and restore order. The U.S.-led United Task Force (UNITAF) in Somalia established an interim Auxiliary Security Force despite lacking a specific mandate under the Security Council resolution. The U.S.-led UNITAF in Somalia established an interim Auxiliary Security Force to enforce local laws and be controlled by the community, present in 17 cities and towns. It aimed to eliminate the need for UNITAF troops to serve as police, freeing them for other duties and reducing friction with the local population. The ASF in Somalia aimed to eliminate the need for UNITAF troops to serve as police, allowing them to focus on other duties. This would reduce friction with the local population, minimize casualties, and enable Somalis to deal with criminal activity. Additionally, it would create jobs and income for unemployed Somalis. The police force was encouraged to act independently, with allied military forces available as backup near police stations. The Somalipolice were respected by the population and encouraged to act independently, with allied military forces as backup. UNITAF, the United Nations, and individual nations provided substantial assistance to the ASF, including salaries, equipment, and refurbishing police stations. Italian, Dutch, and German police experts also supported the new force with uniforms and equipment. The ASF received support from UNITAF, including uniforms, nightsticks, and vehicles from Saudi Arabia. Training, weapons, and joint patrols were provided by military forces from Morocco, Botswana, and the United Arab Emirates. The World Food Program supplied food rations for ASF members and their families. UNOSOM II took over from UNITAF in May 1993, with 5,000 ASF members operating in Mogadishu and 17 other cities and towns. In December 1993, UN announced plans to re-establish a 10,000 member Somali police force by the end of 1994, despite challenges from General Mohamed Farah Aidid's faction. However, UN efforts to reconstruct the police, courts, and prisons in Somalia faced obstacles due to staffing and funding issues. It took almost a year after UNITAF left for UNCIVPOL members to arrive. The U.N. efforts to rebuild the Somali police force faced challenges due to staffing and funding issues. It took almost a year for UNCIVPOL members to arrive, and cultural differences among them hindered the development of a coherent program. Training programs for Somali police officers collapsed amid escalating violence and insecurity. The ICITAP training programs for Somali police officers collapsed in 1994 due to escalating violence and insecurity, leading to the withdrawal of ICITAP and UNCIVPOLs. The UNITAF ASF was successful in providing protection to citizens, but its effectiveness was attributed to UNITAF's support during times of uncontrollable violence. The success of UNITAF in providing protection during uncontrollable violence was attributed to their commitment. By the end of the 1990s, there was a recognized need for police institution development and reform. The Brahimi Panel Report in August 2000 recommended a shift in the use of civilian personnel in peace operations to focus on building local police capacity. UNOSOM II's lack of commitment to support UNCIVPOLs contributed to the development of a new approach to law enforcement in Somalia and Haiti. In Somalia and Haiti, institutional gaps were identified due to UNOSOM II's lack of commitment to support UNCIVPOLs, leading to the concept of a law enforcement gap. Analysts observed that a strong police force alone may not be sufficient to control violence in post-conflict situations without a widely-accepted peace accord, sometimes requiring military intervention to maintain law and order. The lack of a widely-accepted peace accord may necessitate military force to maintain law and order, either as the primary response to high violence or as a supplement to police forces in lower violence situations. The Somalia operation highlighted issues with international civilian police forces in the absence of an effective cease-fire, the challenges of UNCIVPOL missions in training local police, and the impact of institutional gaps and political settlements on overall effectiveness. The lack of a political settlement and institutional gaps can undermine police reform efforts in the long run, as seen in Haiti where U.S. and U.N. efforts faced challenges in creating a new national police force. The International Police Monitoring Force (IPM) was formed with 820 monitors from 20 countries to develop and train a new Haitian national police force. IPM vetted former members of Haiti's armed forces for an interim public security force. IPM members were authorized to carry arms, use force, and make arrests. The subsequent UNCIVPOL under the UN Mission in Haiti took over monitoring and training functions. Three follow-on UN missions were sent to Haiti. The UN Mission in Haiti (UNMIH) took over monitoring and training functions from the International Police Monitoring Force (IPM). Three follow-on UN missions were sent to Haiti over the next five years to professionalize the Haitian police. Analysts highlight coordination between military forces and civilian police to maintain public security while the Haitian National Police (HNP) was trained and deployed. The United States adjusted rules of engagement to allow military forces to detain and shoot those committing serious offenses when IPMs were slow to deploy with sufficient strength and organization. The United States adjusted rules of engagement to allow military forces to detain and shoot those committing serious crimes in Haiti. MNF military police conducted patrols and provided training to interim public security forces before the planned deployment of the HNP. Unlike Somalia, there was a smooth transition in Haiti between military and civilian police forces. In Haiti, the transition between the U.S.-led MNF and the U.N. operation was smooth. UNMIH military forces helped bridge the law enforcement gap by providing rapid backup and assistance to police stations. They also contributed to stability through military patrols to deter crime and violence, while UNCIVPOLs shifted from law enforcement to mentoring and training roles as the HNP deployed. The UNMIH military forces in Haiti helped bridge the law enforcement gap by providing rapid backup and assistance to police stations. UNCIVPOLs transitioned to mentoring and training roles as the HNP deployed, while UNMIH military forces monitored HNP performance. The institutional gap, including overcrowded prisons and a corrupt judicial system, hindered the establishment of public security. The United Nations had full responsibility for international police assistance in Bosnia from 1995-2002 under the mandate of the December 1995 Dayton Accords. This role was carried out through the International Police Task Force (IPTF), a component of the U.N. Mission to Bosnia and Hercegovina (UNMIBH), focusing on monitoring and training to support the joint government established to end the conflict among Bosnia's competing populations. The United Nations had full responsibility for international police assistance in Bosnia from 1995-2002 through the International Police Task Force (IPTF) under the UN Mission to Bosnia and Hercegovina (UNMIBH). The IPTF monitored, advised, trained, and facilitated law enforcement activities to maintain public order and support the Bosnian government authorities. The International Police Task Force (IPTF) had the mission to assess threats to public order, advise on law enforcement agencies' capabilities, organize effective civilian law enforcement agencies, and accompany Bosnian law enforcement personnel. In January 2003, the European Union took over police monitoring and training in Bosnia through the EU Police Mission (EUPM) after the IPTF proved inadequate in ensuring public order. The International Police Task Force (IPTF) with 1,721 unarmed CivPols lacked enforcement powers and struggled to maintain public order among hostile groups in Bosnia. Concerns about their effectiveness were raised during the Dayton negotiations, leading to calls for a stronger mandate and a policing role for NATO peacekeeping forces. Control of certain areas of Sarajevo was transferred in early 1996, prompting concerns about the relocation of residents. The early 1996 transfer of control of certain areas of Sarajevo tested the IPTF and IFOR. IFOR provided assistance to the IPTF, helping to plan the operation and compensate for the slow deployment of personnel. Despite only one death during the relocation, there were incidents of gutting and burning. The slow deployment of IPTF personnel in Sarajevo led to an \"enforcement gap\" as they lacked authority and resources. The burning and booby-trapping of dwellings resulted in a flight of Bosnian Serbs from the suburbs, causing a perception of U.N. failure and loss of credibility for the understaffed IPTF without law enforcement powers. The IPTF in Bosnia faced challenges due to slow deployment, lack of authority, and resources, leading to a perception of U.N. failure and loss of credibility. The enforcement gap was addressed by the development of specialized units within the IPTF, including paramilitary forces. The development of specialized units within the IPTF in Bosnia, including paramilitary forces from foreign nations like France, Italy, and Spain, aimed to address the enforcement gap and maintain public order. In the early 1990s, international CivPols were integrated without special functions. By the late 1990s, specialized police units were recognized to bridge the gap between military and unarmed police monitors. The Multinational Specialized Unit (MSU) was formed in Bosnia in 1998 to protect officials and maintain public order. Successful experiences in Bosnia led to the formation of similar units in Kosovo and East Timor. The formation of specialized police units in Bosnia in 1998 led to successful experiences, prompting the creation of similar units in Kosovo and East Timor. The mandates granted executive authority powers to international civilian police in Kosovo and East Timor in 1999, allowing them to carry arms and make arrests. After the coalition air war against Serbia, NATO and the United Nations took responsibility for stabilizing Kosovo and providing security through KFOR and UNMIK. NATO provided military presence while the UN handled civil administration, including policing. OSCE oversaw operations under the UNMIK structure. In Kosovo, UNMIK took responsibility for civil administration functions, including policing, while the OSCE oversaw and trained the Kosovo Police Service. In East Timor, UNTAET provided complete civil administration from October 1999 to May 2002 during its transition to independence from Indonesia. With Indonesia's withdrawal from East Timor, a security vacuum was filled by U.N. forces and the Australian-led INTERFET. The mandate for executive authority in such situations is seen as problematic by many analysts. Some argue that executive authority is necessary in the absence of a local police force. In situations where local police forces are deemed unsuitable, decisions on the need for executive policing will be made on a case-by-case basis, considering sovereignty concerns and the limited availability of international civilian police personnel. Practitioners and policymakers will decide on executive policing based on vetting and sovereignty considerations."
