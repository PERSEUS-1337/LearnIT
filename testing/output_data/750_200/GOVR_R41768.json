    "content": "The federal parity law aims to ensure that coverage terms for mental health and substance use disorder services are no more restrictive than those for medical and surgical services. It consists of two laws: the Mental Health Parity Act of 1996 and the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008. These laws require certain coverage terms to be equal between mental health services and medical services. The federal mental health parity requirements ensure that coverage terms for mental health and substance use disorder services are on par with medical and surgical services. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 did not modify these specific coverage terms. The federal parity law mandates equal coverage terms for mental health and substance use disorder services compared to medical and surgical services. It applies to certain plan types and was expanded by the ACA to include additional plan types. The ACA expands federal parity law to include Qualified Health Plans (QHPs), individual market plans, and Medicaid benchmark plans. QHPs offered in the Exchanges must comply with federal parity law. The ACA requires all Qualified Health Plans (QHPs) to comply with federal parity law in the same manner as health insurance issuers and group health plans. QHPs will be available in both the small group and individual markets, and may also be offered outside of an Exchange. Plans offered through the individual market must also comply with federal parity law. Medicaid can be provided through traditional state plan benefits or benchmark coverage. Medicaid may be offered through traditional state plan benefits or benchmark coverage, including Medicaid managed care plans. The ACA requires Medicaid benchmark and benchmark-equivalent plans to partially comply with federal parity law for mental health and substance use disorder services. Federal parity law exemptions apply to small fully insured and self-insured plans, traditional fee-for-service Medicaid, and traditional fee-for-service Medicare. Table 1 outlines the coverage arrangements affected by federal parity law. The federal parity law contains an exemption for small employer group health plans and \"groups of one.\" It does not apply to traditional fee-for-service Medicaid due to certain coverage structure limitations. Federal parity law does not apply to traditional fee-for-service Medicare, but federal law requires copayments for covered Medicare Part B outpatient mental health services to be 20% of the Medicare-approved amount by 2014. The law aims to mitigate disparities in coverage terms for mental health and substance use disorder services. The federal parity law aims to address disparities in coverage terms between mental health and substance use disorder services and medical and surgical services. It does not mandate the coverage of mental health and substance use disorder services, but requires parity with medical and surgical services if they are covered, known as a mandated offering parity approach. The ACA did not change the fundamental approach to federal parity law, which requires parity with medical and surgical services for mental health and substance use disorder services if covered. However, the ACA introduced broader changes that mandate coverage of these services. The ACA also established Exchanges where individuals and employers can purchase health insurance plans. The ACA requires the establishment of Exchanges where individuals and employers can purchase health insurance plans. Plans offered in the Exchanges must meet requirements, including the Essential Health Benefits Package (EHBP) which includes Essential Health Benefits (EHB) and specified tiers of coverage. The Secretary of HHS defines the items and services included in the EHB. The ACA mandates the Secretary of HHS to define the Essential Health Benefits (EHB) included in the Essential Health Benefits Package (EHBP). The EHB must cover 10 categories of services, including mental health and substance use disorder services. Benefits in the EHB should be comparable to those in a typical employer plan, as determined by a survey conducted by the Department of Labor (DOL) and reported to the HHS Secretary. The Department of Labor (DOL) conducted a survey on employer-sponsored coverage as required by the ACA and reported the results to the HHS Secretary. The report found that most health plans offer inpatient and outpatient mental health and substance use disorder treatment. The specific services included in the Essential Health Benefits (EHB) will be determined through the rulemaking process. The Essential Health Benefits (EHB) will include mental health and substance use disorder services, determined through the rulemaking process. The HHS Secretary has discretion to add benefits beyond the 10 required categories. HHS released an informational bulletin in December 2011 outlining their approach to defining essential health benefits. The HHS released a bulletin outlining a proposal for states to define Essential Health Benefits using benchmark health insurance plans. States can choose from four options for the benchmark plan. The HHS proposed that states define Essential Health Benefits using benchmark health insurance plans. States can choose from four options for the benchmark plan, which would have a scope of services comparable to a typical employer plan. The HHS Secretary requested the Institute of Medicine to conduct a study on determining the Essential Health Benefits. The Institute of Medicine conducted a study on determining Essential Health Benefits (EHB) without recommending specific services. The Affordable Care Act mandates coverage for mental health and substance use disorder services through either the Essential Health Benefits Package (EHBP) or EHB for all plans. The ACA mandates coverage of Essential Health Benefits (EHB) or Essential Health Benefits Package (EHBP) for new plans in the individual and small group markets, QHPs, and Medicaid benchmark plans. The ACA requires Medicaid benchmark and benchmark equivalent plans to cover Essential Health Benefits (EHB) starting January 1, 2014. Grandfathered and large group plans outside of the Exchanges are not mandated to offer EHB. Health reform law changes will impact access to mental health and substance use disorder services by requiring more plans to cover these services. The ACA requires more plans to cover mental health and substance use disorder services, potentially leading to voluntary compliance with federal parity laws to stay competitive in the market."
