    "content": "The Bush Administration released The Budget of the U.S. Government, Fiscal Year 2008 on February 5, 2007, as required by law. The budget documents provide detailed information on budget estimates, historical data, budget authority, and the Administration's economic forecast. The Budget of the U.S. Government, Fiscal Year 2008, released by the Bush Administration on February 5, 2007, includes historical budget data, detailed budget authority, outlay and receipt data, selected analysis of specific budget-related topics, and the Administration's economic forecast. It contains descriptions of policy proposals and expectations from FY2007 through FY2012, as well as information on budget policies for FY2012 through FY2017. The documents also address long-term fiscal issues and provide historical data on appropriations, outlays, revenues, and other budget items. The congressional budget process begins once the Administration submits its budget to Congress. Congress revises proposals as it interacts with Members of Congress and economic conditions change. The FY2008 budget resolution was adopted on May 17, 2007, and appropriation bills were considered shortly afterwards. By late July, all twelve regular appropriation bills for FY2008 had cleared the House Appropriations Committee. By late July, all twelve regular appropriation bills for FY2008 had cleared the House Appropriations Committee and most of the Senate Appropriations Committee. The House passed all twelve regular appropriations bills by August 5. The Senate passed some bills in July and mid-September but failed to pass the remaining eight by the end of FY2007. In October, the Senate passed the defense and Commerce-Justice-Science appropriations bills. The House passed a continuing resolution to fund the government until November 16. The House passed a continuing resolution (H.J.Res. 52) on September 26 to fund the government until November 16, which the Senate passed the following day. The President signed the continuing resolution on September 29 (P.L. 110-92). Congress approved the Labor-HHS-Education bill (H.R. 3043, S. 1710) and the Defense bill (H.R. 3222, P.L. 110-116) in November. The President vetoed the Labor-HHS-Education bill but signed the Defense bill, which provided $459 billion in non-emergency budget authority. He had stated he would veto most appropriation bills due to funding levels or policy disagreements. The President threatened to veto many appropriation bills due to funding levels or policy disagreements, complicating the appropriations process. Congress passed multiple funding extensions and an omnibus appropriations bill to keep the government funded. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of FY2008 (P.L. 110-161) provided $555 billion in discretionary budget authority, signed by the President on December 26. Budget estimates for FY2008 varied among CBO, OMB, and Congress. Budget estimates for FY2008 from CBO, OMB, and Congress can vary due to different assumptions and techniques. Estimates are expected to change with new data or economic conditions. The CBO's first budget report for FY2008 projected a baseline deficit of $98 billion, down from the previous year. The report also forecasted a surplus in FY2012 and FY2017. CBO baseline projections are based on specific assumptions that result in higher revenue estimates and slower growth in discretionary spending. The CBO baseline projections incorporate key assumptions such as constant discretionary spending in inflation-adjusted terms, expiration of tax cuts after 2010, and the lapse of the AMT \"patch.\" These assumptions lead to higher revenue estimates and significant growth in receipts after 2010. The CBO baseline projections show that federal deficits are expected to grow rapidly beyond the 10-year forecast window due to the retirement of the baby boom generation and rising healthcare costs. The report includes estimated budgetary effects of selected policies not included in baseline estimates. The CBO baseline projections show federal deficits growing rapidly due to the retirement of the baby boom generation and rising healthcare costs. The estimated budgetary effects of selected policies not included in baseline estimates include making the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts permanent, indexing the AMT for inflation, increasing discretionary appropriations at the rate of GDP growth, and freezing total discretionary appropriations at FY2007 levels. These policies impact receipts and outlays. In March 2007, CBO analyzed the President's budget proposals, forecasting higher revenues and smaller outlays. The projected FY2008 deficit was $226 billion, lower than the President's budget estimate of $239 billion. By FY2012, CBO projected a $31 billion deficit, contrasting with the Administration's expected $61 billion surplus. The difference in forecasts is mainly due to medium-term projection uncertainty. Over five years (2008-2012), CBO estimated a cumulative deficit of $790 billion based on the President's proposals. President Bush's FY2008 budget aimed to extend and make permanent tax cuts, reducing estimated receipts by almost $600 billion between FY2008 and FY2012. The CBO's cumulative deficit estimate for the same period was $790 billion, while the President's budget had a cumulative net deficit estimate of $514 billion. The difference in forecasts is mainly due to medium-term projection uncertainty. The President's proposals in the FY2008 budget aim to reduce estimated receipts by almost $600 billion between FY2008 and FY2012. The Administration estimates that its proposals would reduce mandatory spending by $96 billion over five years and by $309 billion over 10 years, including proposed policy changes and personal accounts for Social Security. The Administration's budget proposes personal accounts for Social Security, estimating a cost of $637 billion over 10 years. It predicts five-year savings of $59 billion and 10-year increases of $359 billion, mainly due to the introduction of personal Social Security accounts. Limited information is provided for years beyond FY2012, with estimates of revenue and mandatory spending changes for FY2008 through FY2017. The President's budget proposal includes estimates of revenue and mandatory spending changes for FY2008 through FY2017, with projections omitting data for years beyond FY2012. The proposal aims to eliminate, reduce, or reform 141 programs, cutting $22 billion of budget authority in FY2008 compared to FY2007. The Administration's Mid-Session Review (MSR) in July featured the same proposals as the President's FY2008 budget, with estimates showing a $19 billion higher deficit than the February estimate. Technical reestimates, economic changes, and minor policy differences account for the changes in the budget outlook. The Mid-Session Review (MSR) in July showed a $19 billion higher deficit than the February estimate, with minor policy differences accounting for the changes. The increase in the five-year deficit estimate was mainly due to fast growth in Medicare and Medicaid spending, driven by rising health care prices and hospital patient volumes. CBO analyzes spending for appropriations legislation based on budget specifications, known as \"scoring.\" The CBO analysis of FY2008 appropriations showed $932.8 billion in nonemergency discretionary budget authority, matching the President's request. Non-defense discretionary budget authority totaled $473.5 billion. The FY2008 budget had $932.8 billion in budgetary authority, matching the President's request. Non-defense discretionary budget authority was slightly higher than defense discretionary budget authority. The McConnell Amendment added $70 billion in emergency funding for wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Senate Budget Committee reported a resolution specifying expenditures and revenues for a FY2008 deficit estimated at $249 billion. The Senate budget resolution (S.Con.Res. 21) projected a $249 billion deficit for FY2008, $10 billion more than the President's proposal. It aimed for a $132 billion surplus in FY2012, with higher discretionary spending levels than the President's proposal. The resolution also included extending expiring tax cuts, as long as the lost revenues were offset. The House Budget resolution (H.Con.Res. 99) aimed to extend expiring tax cuts with offsets, projecting a FY2008 deficit of $213 billion and a FY2012 surplus of $153 billion. The Senate resolution had similar totals, with amendments reducing the expected FY2012 surplus to $1 billion. All proposals required offsets to continue the tax cuts. The House, Senate, and President's proposals all aim to balance the budget in FY2012, assuming minimal military operation funding post-FY2008. They also anticipate more middle-income taxpayers being subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax. The House, Senate, and President's proposals assume higher war costs in projections and anticipate more middle-income taxpayers subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax. They also project little growth in discretionary spending over five years and assume the expiration of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts unless costs are offset. The House and Senate budget resolutions assume the expiration of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts unless costs are offset, leading to a significant increase in tax revenues after 2010. Budget projections aim for statistical unbiasedness and accuracy, focusing on estimating the costs of policy changes consistently. Budget forecasts are constructed to estimate the costs of policy changes consistently. Actual outcomes may differ from baseline estimates due to technical factors, economic conditions, and model assumptions. OMB and CBO provide measures of forecast accuracy. Changes in economic conditions and government policies impact budget estimates and projections. The structure of the economy and advancements in econometric techniques also play a role. Stable trends like population demographics, such as the retirement of baby boomers, affect spending for programs like Medicare and Social Security. Many baby boomers will retire in the next decade, leading to higher spending for Medicare and Social Security. Budget estimates also depend on factors that are difficult to predict, such as future productivity growth and business cycles. Financial market trends can be volatile and small changes in economic conditions can greatly impact budget estimates. According to CBO estimates, a 0.1% decrease in real GDP growth rate would increase the deficit by $61 billion cumulatively. Changes in budget estimates are influenced by factors like GDP growth rate, government policies, and accuracy of previous forecasts. A 0.1% decrease in real GDP growth rate could increase the deficit by $61 billion over five years and $273 billion over 10 years. Government policies like extending military operations or allowing tax cuts to lapse can also impact the budget outlook. The President's FY2008 budget includes measures to assess the accuracy of previous forecasts. The analysis of the budget includes examining the accuracy and statistical bias of previous forecasts. The accuracy of forecasts tends to decrease as the forecast window extends to later years due to potential policy and economic changes. OMB analyzed a quarter century of February budget estimates and found that the standard deviation for the current fiscal year was $71 billion, while the corresponding five-years-ahead forecast had a standard deviation of $289 billion. This led to the computation of upper and lower bounds for deficit projections using these standard deviations. The Administration's $61 billion point estimate for the FY2012 surplus is imprecise, with a gap between upper and lower bounds of over $1.1 trillion for deficit projections. CBO analyzes the accuracy of its budget estimates and provides explanations for differences with OMB projections. The CBO provides detailed explanations for differences in budget projections compared to OMB. The Senate and House passed their versions of the FY2008 budget resolution with similar directions outlined. The House and Senate passed their versions of the FY2008 budget resolution with similar directions, including additional domestic spending and accommodating the Administration's war funding request. Rules were put in place to require offsets to new tax cuts or mandatory spending increases to maintain deficit neutrality. Conferees were appointed in early May to resolve differences between the House and Senate versions, leading to an agreement announced on May 16 and adopted by both chambers on May 17, 2007. The conference agreement on the FY2008 budget resolution was announced on May 16 and adopted by both the House and Senate on May 17, 2007. It set discretionary spending at $954 billion, above the President's request. This led to the drafting of FY2008 appropriations bills by the Appropriations Committees, with the House clearing its first bill in early June and the Senate following in mid-June. In FY2008, the House and Senate Appropriations Committees approved most of the 12 regular appropriations bills. The Senate passed three more bills in October, including the Labor-HHS-Education bill (H.R. 3043, S. 1710) vetoed by the President, and the Defense bill (H.R. 3222) signed by the President. The President indicated a potential veto for most of the remaining appropriations bills. In FY2008, Congress passed a continuing resolution (H.J. Res 52) to fund government operations until November 16, which the President signed. The Defense Appropriations Act of 2008 extended funding for government operations from November 16. In FY2008, Congress passed a continuing resolution (H.J. Res 52) to fund government operations until November 16, which the President signed. The Defense Appropriations Act of 2008 extended funding until December 14. Congress then passed another continuing resolution (H.J.Res. 69) on December 14, which extended funding for another week. On December 19, Congress passed an omnibus appropriations bill (H.R. 2764) that included 10 remaining regular appropriations bills. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of FY2008 (P.L. 110-161) provided $555 billion in discretionary budget authority, signed by the President on December 26. The Administration's budget proposed FY2008 outlays of $2,902 billion, $84 billion above the CBO baseline. Both the Administration and CBO issued projections of future federal outlays. The Administration's FY2008 budget proposed $2,902 billion in outlays, rising to $3,246 billion in FY2012. The proposals aimed to increase funding for defense and homeland security, limit non-defense discretionary spending, and slow the growth of some mandatory programs like Medicare and Medicaid. Total mandatory spending would increase according to projections by the CBO and budget resolutions passed by Congress. The Administration's FY2008 budget proposed increasing security discretionary spending by 1% annually and slowing the growth of some mandatory programs like Medicare and Medicaid. Total mandatory spending would rise under the proposals, with outlays increasing by $118 billion above the FY2007 estimate. Total outlays would grow by 16.6% between FY2007 and FY2012, exceeding the FY2008 baseline by $150 billion. The Administration's FY2008 budget proposes a $150 billion increase in outlays compared to the FY2008 baseline, with most of the increase going towards security activities, including funding for defense, homeland security, and foreign affairs. Additional funding is allocated for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, with a slight increase in non-security discretionary spending and a reduction in mandatory spending. The Administration's FY2008 budget proposes a $150 billion increase in outlays compared to the baseline, with most going towards security activities. This includes funding for defense, homeland security, and foreign affairs, as well as additional funding for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. There is also a slight increase in non-security discretionary spending and a reduction in mandatory spending. The budget shows a $7 billion increase in net interest payments due to increased federal borrowing, leading to an overall $118 billion increase in outlays from FY2007 to FY2008. The Administration's proposals aim to reduce outlays from 20.2% of GDP in FY2007 to 20.0% of GDP in FY2008. The Administration's proposals aim to reduce outlays from 20.2% of GDP in FY2007 to 20.0% of GDP in FY2008. By FY2012, outlays are projected to fall to 18.3% of GDP, the lowest since FY1960. Non-defense discretionary spending is expected to decrease by 0.7% of GDP over five years, while defense spending is projected to decrease by 1.1% of GDP. Mandatory programs will increase their share of GDP by 0.3%, and net interest will fall by 0.2% of GDP. Medicare and Medicaid are expected to grow slightly as percentages of GDP despite proposals to trim their growth. The Administration's budget proposes to increase defense spending by 6.0% from FY2007 to FY2008, with a projected decrease to $546 billion by FY2012. Non-defense discretionary spending for FY2008 exceeds the current services baseline estimate by $19 billion over five years. The Administration's proposed non-defense discretionary spending for FY2008 exceeds the current services baseline estimate by $19 billion. Over five years, the estimates show a decrease in non-defense discretionary spending, with the Administration's budget projecting a drop to $493 billion by FY2012. As a percentage of GDP, non-defense discretionary spending is expected to decrease from 3.7% in FY2007 to 2.8% in FY2012. The Administration planned to reduce non-defense discretionary spending from 3.7% of GDP in FY2007 to 2.8% in FY2012. Mandatory spending would grow by 4.2% from FY2007 to FY2008, with proposals to reduce mandatory outlays by $10 billion in FY2008 by slowing the growth of activities like Medicare and Medicaid. The budget proposed reducing total mandatory spending by almost $60 billion over five years, with mandatory spending projected to reach $1,923 billion in FY2012. Federal debt has been increasing rapidly in recent years. The President's FY2008 budget projected a rise in net interest outlays by $22.1 billion from FY2007 to FY2008, reaching 10.8% of GDP in FY2012. Federal debt has been growing rapidly, with proposed net interest outlays in FY2008 exceeding the current services baseline estimate by $7.8 billion. The Administration's policy proposals would increase FY2012 net interest outlays by almost $30 billion above the estimate. Net interest payments as a percentage of GDP are expected to remain relatively stable. The Administration's policy proposals would increase FY2012 net interest outlays by almost $30 billion above the estimate, with payments as a percentage of GDP expected to remain stable. CBO projections show federal outlays rising to 20.8% of GDP in FY2008 before easing back to 20.0% in FY2012. According to CBO projections, federal outlays would increase by $1.55 trillion over the FY2008-FY2017 period if discretionary spending grew at the same rate as the economy. Conversely, keeping discretionary spending fixed at FY2007 levels would result in a $1.65 trillion drop in federal outlays. Defense spending is expected to rise from $547 billion in FY2007 to $599 billion in FY2008, including regular and supplemental funding. Defense spending is projected to increase from $547 billion in FY2007 to $599 billion in FY2008, with baseline assumptions showing a rise to $684 billion in FY2012 and $773 billion in FY2017. Spending as a percentage of GDP is expected to decrease gradually over the 10-year period, from 4.0% in FY2007 to 3.6% in FY2017. Alternative scenarios with troop withdrawals from Iraq and Afghanistan would result in lower spending. Defense spending is projected to increase from $547 billion in FY2007 to $599 billion in FY2008, with a gradual decrease in spending as a percentage of GDP over the 10-year period. Alternative scenarios of troop withdrawals from Iraq and Afghanistan show lower spending trajectories, with potential savings of $1.25 trillion by withdrawing all but 30,000 troops by 2010. According to CBO projections, non-defense discretionary spending is expected to increase from $495 billion in FY2007 to $619 billion in FY2017, saving about $750 billion in projected discretionary spending and interest costs by 2013. This spending as a percentage of GDP is projected to decrease from 3.6% in FY2007 to 2.9% in FY2017. The CBO and Administration projections show discretionary spending's relative size shrinking over time. Mandatory spending is projected to increase from $1,457 billion in FY2007 to $2,598 billion by FY2017, with little change in its share of GDP. The CBO baseline projections show that mandatory spending will increase from 10.6% to 12.1% of GDP by FY2017. Net interest is projected to grow from $235 billion to $253 billion in FY2008. The federal debt's growth is expected to slow with smaller deficits in later years, leading to reduced net interest payments. Net interest payments are forecasted to peak at $292 billion in FY2012 and decrease to $278 billion by FY2017. Projected net interest payments are expected to peak at $292 billion in FY2012 before easing back to $278 billion in FY2017. The Senate Budget Committee's FY2008 budget resolution proposed outlays of $2,927 billion for FY2008, rising to $3,229 billion in FY2012. This included defense funding matching the President's request for FY2008, with domestic spending exceeding the Administration's proposal. The Senate Budget Committee's FY2008 budget resolution proposed outlays of $2,927 billion for FY2008, rising to $3,229 billion in FY2012, with domestic spending exceeding the Administration's proposal. The House passed their version of the FY2008 budget resolution with no changes, providing $2,933 billion in outlays in FY2008, rising to $3,252 billion in FY2012. The conference agreement included $2,937 billion in FY2008 outlays, including funding for ongoing military operations overseas. The conference agreement on May 17, 2007, included $2,937 billion in FY2008 outlays, with projected outlays rising to $3,255 billion in FY2012. Figure 1 displays spending by category as percentages of GDP from the Administration's July 2007 Mid-Session Review, showing actual outlays for defense, non-defense, mandatory, and net interest spending from FY2000 through FY2006. According to the Administration's proposals, defense and non-defense spending as a share of GDP will decline over the FY2007-FY2012 period. The Administration's proposals from FY2007 through FY2012 show a decline in defense and non-defense spending as a share of GDP, while mandatory spending is projected to increase. The downturn in discretionary spending after FY2008 depends on assumptions that non-defense discretionary spending will fall and no additional spending will be provided for ongoing military operations beyond FY2008. Limited reductions in mandatory spending keep it stable as a share of GDP. The President's proposed limited reductions in mandatory spending from current service baseline levels keep mandatory spending as a share of GDP stable. The FY2012 introduction of private Social Security accounts proposed by the President would lift mandatory spending relative to GDP above the current services level. Figure 2 shows four alternative paths for outlays as a percentage of GDP through FY2017. The Administration's outlook, based on CBO data, shows proposed reductions in discretionary spending and moderate growth in mandatory programs. By FY2012, spending would be below its FY2000 level as a percentage of GDP. The Administration's proposed reductions in discretionary spending and moderate growth in mandatory programs aim to lower spending to just below its FY2000 level as a percentage of GDP by FY2012. Outlays in the Mid-Session Review are slightly higher than in the February budget due to reestimation, not policy changes. The alternative estimate assumes discretionary appropriations will grow with the overall economy and factors in troop deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan. The alternative estimate assumes a decrease in discretionary spending and troop deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan, leading to higher outlays, deficits, federal debt, and net interest payments. The alternative estimate projects a rise in outlays, primarily due to increased net interest payments, reaching 21.1% of GDP in FY2017. Federal receipts are forecasted to grow uncertainly, influenced by economic conditions, with recent years showing unexpected revenue growth. Federal receipts have shown rapid growth in recent fiscal years, increasing from 16.3% of GDP in FY2004 to 18.4% in FY2006. OMB and CBO projections indicate uncertainty in future receipts as a share of GDP, ranging from 18.4% to 18.7% over the FY2008-FY2012 period. In FY2006, federal receipts remained stable at around 18.4-18.7% of GDP from FY2008 to FY2012. Receipts were projected to increase to 19.8% of GDP in FY2012 once the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts expire. The President's proposals aimed to extend and make permanent most of the expiring tax cuts, leading to a rise in receipts by $767 billion over five years. The Administration estimated that making the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts permanent would reduce cumulative receipts by $374 billion from baseline levels between FY2008 and FY2012 and by $1,617 billion between FY2008 and FY2017. This would result in a reduction of receipts by an estimated $599 billion in the first five years and by $1,854 billion over 10 years. The Administration's proposals for receipts would reduce baseline levels by $599 billion in the first five years and $1,854 billion over 10 years. The budget included relief from the Alternative Minimum Tax through FY2008 at a cost of $48 billion in that year. Receipts from the President's July 2007 Mid-Session Review for FY2007 through FY2012 are shown in Figure 3, with estimates close to those in February budget documents. Actual receipts as a percentage of GDP for FY2000 through FY2006 are also displayed. Excise and other receipts were less than 1% of GDP for all years shown. Corporate income is also mentioned. Actual receipts as a percentage of GDP for FY2000 through FY2006 are shown in February budget documents. Excise and other receipts were less than 1% of GDP for all years. Corporate income taxes stabilized near 2% of GDP under the Administration's projection. Social Insurance receipts remained stable from FY2006 through FY2012. Individual income taxes fell from over 10% of GDP in FY2000 to 7% in FY2004, but regained some lost share under the Administration's proposals. The proposals included extending relief from the alternative minimum tax for FY2007 and FY2008. The Administration's proposals for FY2007 and FY2008 included extending relief from the alternative minimum tax (AMT) to prevent middle-class taxpayers from being subject to it. The estimated cost of temporary AMT \"fixes\" was $9.1 billion in FY2007 and $47.9 billion in FY2008. CBO projected that indexing AMT thresholds for inflation would cost about $55 billion annually over the next 10 years. The President's budget aimed to limit the AMT's reach but did not provide cost estimates for a five-year fix. The President's budget aims to limit the reach of the alternative minimum tax (AMT) but does not include estimates for a five-year fix, which could cost about $55 billion annually over the next 10 years. This omission increases federal receipts by $50 billion to $60 billion a year, with total receipts expected to remain near 18.3% of GDP. CBO's baseline revenue estimates, excluding tax cuts, are higher, reaching over 19.8% of GDP in FY2012 and 20.1% in. CBO's baseline revenue estimates project an increase to over 19.8% of GDP in FY2012 and 20.1% in FY2017, excluding the extension of tax cuts. Extending expiring tax provisions could reduce revenues by $418 billion over five years and $1,937 billion over 10 years. Extending all expiring tax cuts would further reduce revenues by $870 billion in the first five years and $3,178 billion over 10 years. CBO estimated that limiting the expanding coverage of the AMT alone would reduce revenues by $280 billion over five years and by $570 billion over 10 years. Differences in economic assumptions between the Administration and CBO estimates produced most of the revenue variances. The Administration and CBO estimates differed mainly in economic assumptions, leading to significant revenue differences in the last three years. CBO's estimates of the President's revenue policy proposals were $479 billion smaller over five years. The President's budget projected $14,826 billion in cumulative revenues, while CBO's reestimates put it at $14,524 billion, 2% less. CBO's March report presented revised revenue baseline estimates that differed slightly from January estimates, showing slower growth in receipts using alternative policy estimates. This alternative estimate includes extensions of expiring tax cuts, AMT adjustments, and interactions with tax cut extensions, resulting in greater revenue losses. The CBO's alternative revenue assumptions interact with tax cut extensions and AMT reform, leading to significant revenue losses. By FY2017, the alternative projection falls $560 billion below the baseline. In FY2017, the alternative projection falls $560 billion below the baseline, requiring revenue offsets to prevent deficit growth or surplus decline. The House and Senate budget resolutions do not include extending expiring tax provisions without offsetting costs. The conference agreement allows for extending some tax cuts under certain conditions and offsetting revenue losses relative to baseline levels. The House and Senate budget resolutions do not include extending expiring tax provisions without offsetting costs. The conference agreement allows for extending some tax cuts under certain conditions and offsetting revenue losses relative to baseline levels. The H.Rept. 110-153 included the ability to extend expiring tax cuts with conditions and offset revenue losses. Federal receipts as a percentage of GDP are shown historically and projected for FY2000-FY2010. The CBO's revenue estimates and the President's revenue estimates remain fairly close through FY2012, with receipts rising to slightly above 19% of GDP in FY2017. OMB's MSR projects slightly larger receipts than the February budget over the five years, assuming the extension of tax cuts and an adjustment to the AMT. The OMB's MSR projects slightly larger receipts than the February budget over the five years, assuming the extension of tax cuts and an adjustment to the AMT. Deficits occur when federal spending exceeds receipts, increasing government debt and net interest payments. Surpluses occur when revenues exceed spending. President enacts policies leading to federal deficits when spending exceeds receipts, increasing government debt and interest payments. Surpluses occur when receipts exceed outlays, reducing public debt. Running surpluses during strong economic growth is seen as beneficial. The last federal surplus was in FY2001 at $128 billion or 1.3% of GDP. FY2007 saw a total deficit of $163 billion, slightly below CBO's estimate. Administration and CBO projections of deficits and surpluses are summarized in Table 5. Table 5 summarizes Administration and CBO projections of federal deficits and surpluses. The actual FY2007 total deficit was $163 billion, slightly below CBO's estimate. The FY2007 on-budget deficit was $344 billion. The President's February budget proposed a deficit of $239 billion for FY2008 and a small surplus in FY2012. The Administration's baseline estimates showed surpluses appearing in FY2010, two years earlier than the budget reaches a surplus. The Administration's current service baseline estimates show surpluses appearing in FY2010, two years earlier than the budget reaches a surplus. The FY2007 deficit fell slightly while the FY2008 deficit grew slightly compared to the estimates in the President's FY2008 budget. The MSR deficit estimates in subsequent years remain slightly larger than those in the original budget, with the budget reaching a small surplus in FY2012. The Administration's budget shows a small surplus in FY2012, requiring limits on discretionary spending and slower growth of entitlement spending to meet deficit reduction goals. Some of the President's proposals would increase spending or reduce receipts, necessitating larger spending reductions in other areas of the budget. The federal deficit is projected to decrease according to CBO's January 2007 baseline estimates. The Administration opposes using tax increases to reduce the deficit. CBO's January 2007 baseline estimates project a decrease in the federal deficit through FY2011, with surpluses expected from FY2012 to FY2017. The baseline assumes no fix to the AMT expansion and the expiration of tax cuts in 2010, which would boost revenues significantly. The CBO baseline projections show a decrease in the federal deficit through FY2011, with surpluses expected from FY2012 to FY2017. Alternative scenarios suggest a less optimistic fiscal outlook, with a growing deficit from FY2007 through FY2017 when different policy assumptions are considered. The CBO baseline projections indicate a decreasing federal deficit through FY2011, followed by surpluses from FY2012 to FY2017. Alternative scenarios, including limiting AMT coverage, extending tax cuts, and increasing discretionary spending, show a growing deficit reaching 3.6% of GDP by FY2017. In FY2012, CBO projected a small deficit of 0.3% of GDP, while the Administration projected a small surplus. The House and Senate budget resolutions for FY2008 had deficits similar to the President's budget, with the Senate showing a surplus just below $1 billion and the House with a surplus of $153 billion by FY2012. The Senate resolution for FY2012 had a surplus just below $1 billion, while the House resolution had a surplus of $153 billion. The difference in surpluses is due to different policy assumptions. The conference agreement on the budget resolution showed a deficit of $252 billion in FY2008, turning into a surplus of $41 billion by FY2012. Deficit or surplus estimates as shares of GDP are shown for FY2007 through FY2017. The data on shares of GDP from FY2000 to FY2006 and estimates for FY2007 to FY2017 are provided by CBO and OMB. The average deficit from FY1966 to FY2006 is 2.3% of GDP. The President's policy proposals include increased defense spending, controls on domestic discretionary spending, slower growth in Medicare and Medicaid, no additional AMT relief after FY2008, and personal accounts for Social Security in FY2012. The proposed defense budget only includes minimal funding for wars in Iraq and Afghanistan in FY2009. The proposed defense budget includes minimal funding for wars in Iraq and Afghanistan in FY2009, with no assumptions for subsequent years. Administration projections show a decline in the deficit as a share of GDP, reaching a slight surplus in FY2012. CBO and OMB deficit projections indicate an improving federal fiscal situation, with deficits falling in proportion to the economy. The CBO projection based on alternative policy assumptions shows a rapid deterioration in the federal government's fiscal conditions, reaching a deficit of 3.6% of GDP by FY2017. This outlook is less optimistic than OMB and CBO baseline projections. The OMB, CBO, and GAO agree that the current federal fiscal policies are unsustainable due to the aging population and rising healthcare costs. This leads to constantly rising deficits and a federal debt burden that spirals out of control. The OMB, CBO, and GAO agree that current federal fiscal policies are unsustainable due to the aging population and rising healthcare costs, leading to constantly rising deficits and a federal debt burden that ultimately spirals out of control. According to CBO projections, keeping future federal outlays at 20% of GDP would require drastic reductions in all spending other than Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid, with the rest of the budget needing to be cut by more than half by 2030 to keep overall spending close to current levels. The CBO report on the long-term fiscal outlook warns that federal spending on mandatory programs like Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security is projected to reach 15% of GDP. To maintain overall spending close to 20% of GDP, drastic budget cuts of more than half would be necessary. The aging population and rising healthcare costs will continue to drive up demand for resources, posing a challenge to fiscal stability in the coming decades. The CBO report warns of an increasing demand for resources to finance federal spending on mandatory programs like Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. Fiscal stability in the future may require significant spending cuts and tax increases. The current structure of major entitlement programs will create an unsustainable burden on the budget by 2050. By 2050, spending on Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid is projected to exceed 15% of GDP, more than twice the spending on all other programs combined. The long-term fiscal gap between Social Security and Medicare programs poses challenges for the federal government's budget. The long-term fiscal gap between Medicare outlays and revenues is larger than estimates for Social Security. Projections for Medicare and Medicaid spending are sensitive to changes in medical inflation and unexpected events. The long-term fiscal gap between Medicare outlays and revenues is influenced by projections for medical inflation and unexpected events, such as hurricanes or economic downturns. Policy, demographics, and healthcare costs will determine the budget outlook, with the retirement of the baby boom generation and rising healthcare costs putting pressure on federal programs for the elderly. Without policy changes, these programs could overwhelm the federal budget. The rising healthcare costs will strain the federal budget, potentially overwhelming it without policy changes. This could limit the government's flexibility and hinder the economy's ability to support expanded programs."
