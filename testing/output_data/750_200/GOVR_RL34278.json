    "content": "During the first session of the 110th Congress, the Administration requested $196.5 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations for FY 2008, with $189.3 billion for military operations and $6.9 billion for international affairs. Congress had approved $86.8 billion for defense and $1.5 billion for international affairs by December 2007. $102.5 billion for defense and $5.4 billion for international affairs are still pending approval. Congress is expected to address these requests in a spring 2008 supplemental appropriations bill. The Administration requested emergency supplemental FY2008 appropriations for military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere in February 2007. Additional requests were made for MRAP vehicles in July 2007 and emergency defense and international affairs funding in October 2007. Congress began considering FY2008 supplemental appropriations in fall 2007, with outstanding requests to be addressed in a spring 2008 bill. In fall 2007, Congress considered FY2008 supplemental appropriations for military operations. The Army and Marine Corps faced budget challenges due to high operational pace in Iraq. Regular FY2008 defense appropriations were approved in November. Administration officials expressed concerns about funding delays impacting operations. The base budget for Army and Marine Corps operation and maintenance was quickly draining, leading to concerns about running out of money by February and early April. Extending operations without supplemental funding was a key issue, with options including transferring funds from other accounts or invoking the \"Feed and Forage Act.\" The \"Feed and Forage Act\" was invoked to extend military operations, with a $70 billion \"bridge fund\" approved by Congress to temporarily resolve funding issues. The bill provided 37% of the requested amount, mainly for Army and Marine Corps operation and maintenance. Funding in the FY2008 appropriations act covered military personnel and operation and maintenance for the Army. Officials estimate that funding from FY2008 appropriations acts will last until mid-June for personnel and end of June/early July for operation and maintenance. The Defense Department can extend operations by slowing obligations, transferring funds, invoking the Feed and Forage Act, or using other authorities. Up to $11.4 billion in transfer authority is available. The Administration requested $141.7 billion in emergency supplemental funding for the Defense Department, $3.3 billion for the State Department and international affairs, and $325 million for other agencies for FY2008. The Administration complied with Section 1008 of the FY2007 national defense authorization act by submitting a defense request for estimated full year costs of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan along with the President's FY2008 budget. The Defense Department estimated the full-year costs of continuing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan at about the same pace as in 2006, acknowledging that it was a rough projection of current costs. The Defense Department estimated the full-year costs of continuing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan at about the same pace as in 2006. The Administration proposed a surge in troops to Iraq not reflected in the budget, leading to additional requests for funding for military operations. The White House requested an additional $45.9 billion for military operations, economic assistance, and embassy security in an amendment to the FY2008 budget. This included $42.3 billion for the Department of Defense and $3.6 billion for international affairs programs. The total emergency supplemental appropriations for FY2008 were $195.6 billion, mainly for military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other conflicts. The Administration requested $45.9 billion for military operations, economic assistance, and embassy security in an amendment to the FY2008 budget. This included $42.3 billion for the Department of Defense and $3.6 billion for international affairs programs. The total emergency supplemental appropriations for FY2008 were $195.6 billion, mainly for military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other conflicts. Congressional debate focused on supplemental appropriations for FY2007 before shifting to FY2008 funding. The President vetoed an initial FY2007 supplemental appropriations bill, but a compromise bill was approved and signed into law. Congress approved a compromise FY2007 supplemental appropriations bill, H.R. 2206, providing $99.5 billion for the Department of Defense, $6.1 billion for international affairs, and $14.5 billion for domestic programs. The bill was signed into law as P.L. 110-28. This funding was in addition to a $70 billion \"bridge fund\" included in the regular FY2007 defense appropriations act. Congressional action on FY2008 emergency supplemental funding began in September. Congress quickly provided $5.2 billion in emergency funding for Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles in September 2007, as part of the FY2008 emergency supplemental funding. This was in addition to the $70 billion \"bridge fund\" included in the regular FY2007 defense appropriations act. In September 2007, Congress allocated $5.2 billion for MRAP vehicles as part of the FY2008 emergency supplemental funding. In November 2007, the FY2008 defense appropriations bill was approved, providing $460 billion for Defense Department activities, including $27.4 billion for Army and $4.8 billion for Marine Corps operations. Additional $11.6 billion was allocated for MRAP vehicles. The House approved a bill providing $50 billion for military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere, with funding for Army and Marine Corps operations. The House approved a $50 billion bill for U.S. military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. It required the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq within 30 days and limited the mission of remaining forces. The Senate refused to close debate on a motion to proceed to consideration of H.R. 4156, effectively killing the measure. They also rejected a substitute offered by Senator McConnell to provide $70 billion for the Defense Department without requiring withdrawal from Iraq. The Senate rejected a substitute offered by Senator McConnell to provide $70 billion for the Defense Department without requiring withdrawal from Iraq. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates warned of potential operational limitations without additional funding. The Defense Department announced the need to cease operations at all Army bases by mid-February 2008, leading to furloughs for government employees and contractors. $4.5 billion was transferred to the Army for extended operations, but additional funding was still needed to avoid halting essential operations for the Army and Marine Corps. The House approved amendments to the Senate-passed foreign operations appropriations bill, providing $485 billion in regular and emergency appropriations for FY2008 programs. The House approved amendments to the Senate-passed foreign operations appropriations bill, providing $485 billion in regular and emergency appropriations for FY2008 programs. An additional amendment approved $31 billion in emergency defense appropriations, mainly for Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) in Afghanistan and other areas, excluding Iraq. Army and Marine Corps operation and maintenance funding was allocated solely for OEF, except for force protection expenses that could be used elsewhere. On December 18, 2007, the Senate adopted an amendment to provide $70 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations for the Department of Defense for overseas operations, without restrictions on where the funds could be used. The House then approved the Senate amendment on December 19, 2007, clearing the bill. On December 19, 2007, the House approved the Senate amendment to provide $70 billion for overseas military operations, resolving a funding dispute. The President signed the appropriations bill into law on December 26, 2007, preventing a shutdown of Army and Marine Corps operations in early 2008. In early 2008, the Defense Department warned of running out of money for Army and Marine Corps operations. Secretary of Defense Gates mentioned a possible shutdown of Army bases by mid-February, leading to furloughs. The consolidated appropriations act provided $70 billion for defense, averting a shutdown until at least June 2008. It allocated $35.2 billion for Army and $4.0 billion for Marine Corps operations. The consolidated appropriations act provided $35.2 billion for Army and $4.0 billion for Marine Corps operations, in addition to regular FY2008 Defense Appropriations Act funding. This supplemental funding sustains Army operations until the end of June 2008 and Marine Corps operations until the end of August. The Army is projected to exhaust its military personnel account by mid-June. The Army is projected to exhaust its military personnel account by mid-June, before running out of operation and maintenance funds. The Defense Department may extend operations by transferring funds or slowing down Army and Marine Corps operations. $11.4 billion is available for fund transfers between accounts. The Defense Department has $11.4 billion available for fund transfers between accounts, which could extend Army operations for up to another month without slowing down operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Defense Department has $11.4 billion available for fund transfers to extend Army operations for up to another month in Iraq and Afghanistan. Congress provided a $70 billion FY2008 bridge fund, but the underlying controversy remains. The Defense Department could also use the Feed and Forage Act or other authority to allocate financing for support activities among the services. This would reduce financial flexibility for other unexpected needs. In FY2008, the Defense Department proposed transferring $4.1 billion to the Army to extend its operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Congress has been concerned about the Department's flexibility to delay or avoid shutting down operations without full-year defense appropriations. The Department may rely on regular defense funds for day-to-day activities and war-related operations, but these funds were projected to be exhausted by February for the Army and early April for the Marine Corps. The Defense Department proposed transferring $4.1 billion to the Army to extend operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Without supplemental appropriations, operations could have been extended for about another month by transferring limited additional amounts to the Army and Marine Corps and slowing down spending. Other alternatives, such as invoking the Feed and Forage Act or assigning the Navy and Air Force to pay costs of Army support operations abroad, might have sustained operations longer. The Defense Department proposed transferring $4.1 billion to the Army to extend operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Alternative funding sources like the Feed and Forage Act or using Navy and Air Force funds for Army support operations abroad could sustain operations longer, but each has limitations and disadvantages. These options may reduce financial flexibility, disrupt day-to-day operations, and weaken congressional controls on fund usage. The FY2008 state department, foreign operations appropriations bill, part of the consolidated appropriations act, P.L. 110-161, includes regular FY2008 appropriations for international affairs and emergency supplemental funds. The bill raises concerns about weakening congressional war powers and eroding controls on fund usage by using Navy and Air Force funds to support Army operations. The consolidated appropriations act, H.R. 2764, P.L. 110-161, provides regular FY2008 appropriations for international affairs and emergency supplemental funds totaling $1,473.8 million. Of this amount, $965 million is allocated for the State Department and $508.8 million for foreign operations. $5.4 billion of the Administration's emergency request is still pending consideration. Supplemental funds for State Department accounts include $781.6 million for Diplomatic and Consular Programs. Supplemental funds for State Department accounts in the consolidated appropriations act include $781.6 million for Diplomatic and Consular Programs\u2014$575.0 million for operations and $206.6 million for worldwide security protection; $468.0 million for Contributions to International Peacekeeping for activities in Darfur; $12.0 million for International Broadcasting. Supplemental funds for Foreign Operations accounts include $115 million for Global Health & Child Survival; $110 million for International Disaster Assistance. Supplemental funds for Foreign Operations accounts include: $115 million for Global Health & Child Survival; $110 million for International Disaster Assistance; $20.8 million for USAID Operating Expenses for Iraq; $542.6 million for Economic Support Fund; $200 million for Migration and Refugee Assistance; $100 million for Foreign Military Financing; and $35 million for Peacekeeping Operations. See Appendix for a summary table comparing funding in the House bill to the request. The House bill includes supplemental funds for various Foreign Operations accounts, such as Global Health & Child Survival, International Disaster Assistance, USAID Operating Expenses for Iraq, Economic Support Fund, Migration and Refugee Assistance, Foreign Military Financing, and Peacekeeping Operations. Table 2 provides a summary of defense supplemental appropriations proposals, including the Administration request and House-passed bills. The final $70 billion emergency funding legislation included reporting requirements but no change in Iraq policy. Other Iraq policy amendments were proposed during congressional debate. The original House-passed bill included a $50 billion bridge fund for Iraq policy, requiring troop withdrawal within 30 days and completion by December 15, 2008. It allowed for a residual force for protection, training, and targeted attacks on terrorist groups. The House bill included a residual force in Iraq for protection, training, and targeted attacks on terrorist groups. It extended prohibitions on torture to all government agencies and required deployed units to be fully ready. H.R. 4156 stated Congress's desire to end the war in Iraq quickly and bring troops home, while prohibiting the deployment of units abroad without presidential certification. The bill prohibited the deployment of units abroad without presidential certification and required an immediate redeployment of U.S. forces from Iraq. It set a goal of completing the transition to a limited presence by December 15, 2008, with restricted missions focused on protecting U.S. facilities and civilians. The bill set a goal of transitioning U.S. forces in Iraq to a limited presence by December 15, 2008, with restricted missions focused on protecting U.S. facilities, armed forces, and civilians. Quarterly reports were required on plans for the transition, and a comprehensive regional stability plan for the Middle East was due by February 15, 2008. Congressional consideration of additional funding was not to begin until the first quarterly report on the transition of U.S. forces was submitted. Funding for the U.S. mission in Iraq was contingent on the submission of quarterly reports on the transition of U.S. forces and a regional stability plan for the Middle East by February 15, 2008. Additional quarterly reports with performance measures for military and political stability in Iraq were required throughout the fiscal year. Senators proposed an amendment to shift the U.S. mission in Iraq by the end of 2008. An amendment was proposed to shift the U.S. mission in Iraq by the end of 2008 to focus on training, equipping, and supporting Iraqi security forces, as well as counterterrorism operations. The Senate failed to approve an amendment to shift the U.S. mission in Iraq by the end of 2008 to focus on training Iraqi forces and counterterrorism operations. The vote was 50-45, reflecting no change in Senate support for the war in Iraq. Feingold, Reid, Leahy, Dodd, Boxer, Kennedy, Kerry, Harkin, Whitehouse, Wyden, Durbin, Schumer, Obama, Sanders, Menendez, Lautenberg, and Brown proposed an amendment for troop withdrawal from Iraq within 90 days and cutting off funding after nine months. The Senate rejected the measure with a vote of 24-71. The approved $70 billion \"bridge fund\" for FY2008 did not include withdrawal language but required a detailed report from the Secretary of Defense. The approved FY2008 funding did not mandate U.S. forces withdrawal from Iraq. Instead, it required the Secretary of Defense to provide regular reports on stability in Iraq. The reports must include criteria for safe troop withdrawal. The Administration requested $196.5 billion in additional funds. The Administration requested $196.5 billion in additional funds for military operations, international affairs, and other activities in FY2008. This included $141.7 billion for military operations abroad, $3.3 billion for international affairs programs, and $325 million for other agencies. The funding did not mandate U.S. forces withdrawal from Iraq but required regular reports on stability and criteria for safe troop withdrawal. The White House requested $5.3 billion for MRAP vehicle procurement, $45.9 billion for military operations abroad and international affairs programs in FY2008. The total request was $189.3 billion for military operations, $6.9 billion for international affairs, and $325 million for other agencies. The Administration requested a total of $189.3 billion in FY2008 for military operations, $6.9 billion for international affairs programs, and $325 million for other agencies. The funds were designated as \"emergency\" spending to bypass spending caps in the congressional budget resolution. The FY2008 budget resolution exempted emergency funds from spending caps, but the definition of emergency spending was restrictive. The FY2008 budget resolution exempted emergency funds from spending caps, but with a restrictive definition. S.Con.Res. 21 allows adjustments of up to $124.2 billion for overseas deployments and related activities, avoiding a point of order in the Senate for exceeding budget limits. Supplemental appropriations bills can exceed budget limits in the Senate without raising a point of order. The FY2007 supplemental bill included funds for disaster relief, farm programs, energy assistance, children's health insurance, and a minimum wage increase. It was expected to include additional funds for Hurricane Katrina recovery. The FY2008 supplemental appropriations bill included measures to increase the minimum wage and address hurricane recovery. Appropriators provided funding for non-defense programs in the second FY2008 continuing resolution. The second continuing resolution (CR) for FY2008, attached to the defense appropriations bill, included additional funds for veterans health programs, community development in Louisiana, FEMA Disaster Relief Fund, and wildfire management. Congress also allocated $16.8 billion for MRAPs in previous resolutions. In FY2008, Congress allocated $16.8 billion for Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles. The first continuing resolution and defense appropriations bill provided $16.8 billion for MRAPs, with $5.2 billion for production and deployment in the first resolution and $11.6 billion in the defense appropriations bill. The omnibus appropriations bill signed into law includes $11.6 billion for MRAPs as emergency appropriations, along with funding for Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, Afghan security forces, Iraqi forces, Iraqi Freedom Fund, joint IED defense, and weapons procurement. The omnibus appropriations bill signed into law includes $4.3 billion for joint IED defense and $6.1 billion for weapons procurement, with the flexibility to transfer up to $4 billion between accounts in the bridge fund. This funding trend continues to provide larger amounts to the Defense Department through supplemental appropriations, totaling $189.3 billion for military operations in FY2008. Supplemental appropriations for the Department of Defense have increased significantly over the years, reaching $171.3 billion in FY2007. The rise in funding cannot be solely attributed to military operations, as troop levels have fluctuated. The rise in funding for the Department of Defense, reaching $171.3 billion in FY2007, cannot solely be attributed to military operations. Troop levels in Iraq and Afghanistan have fluctuated, with a surge in troops in Iraq in 2007. The increase in funding is largely due to investments in repairing or replacing equipment lost in military operations and upgrading equipment for ground forces. Weapons procurement funding has seen the largest increase, growing from $19 billion in FY2005 to a requested $64 billion in FY2008. Operation and maintenance funding has also increased for equipment repairs. The Department of Defense funding has increased significantly, with a rise in investments for repairing and upgrading equipment for ground forces. There have been increases in funding to train and equip Afghan and Iraqi military forces, as well as for reorganizing the Army and increasing troop levels. The Defense Department's functional breakdown shows large increases in force protection funding and smaller increases in support for foreign security forces. The Defense Department has seen significant funding increases, with a focus on force protection and reconstitution. Initially, there was hesitation to support Army requests for reconstitution funding, but Congress insisted on adding funds for new equipment. \"Reconstitution\" traditionally refers to repairing and replacing combat-worn equipment to restore the force. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld preferred the term \"reset\" over \"reconstitution\" to describe restoring the force to a condition that planned changes would have brought it to, without necessarily adding to funding requirements. The Defense Department has resumed using the term \"reconstitution\" to encompass upgrades and fixes to the force, especially for the Army and Marine Corps, including addressing equipment shortfalls and adding transportation and communications equipment to combat units. The Defense Department has resumed using the term \"reconstitution\" to encompass upgrades and fixes to the force, especially for the Army and Marine Corps. The upgrades include addressing equipment shortfalls, adding transportation and communications equipment to combat units, and fully equipping Guard and reserve units with newer weapons and support systems for overseas operations. The Defense Department has resumed using the term \"reconstitution\" to encompass upgrades and fixes to the force, especially for the Army and Marine Corps. These upgrades include addressing equipment shortfalls, adding transportation and communications equipment to combat units, and fully equipping Guard and reserve units with newer weapons and support systems for overseas operations. Congress has generally supported steps to upgrade ground forces, with questions raised about specific equipment funding requests in the FY2007 war supplemental. The Administration withdrew requests for new aircraft to replace lost ones in combat operations, reallocating funds for the troop surge. The amended defense request includes funding for MRAPs and costs of maintaining additional Army and Marine combat teams. The October 22 budget amendment allocated $6.3 billion for maintaining additional Army and Marine combat teams in Iraq until December 2007, with plans to return to pre-surge levels by July. It also included $1 billion for Iraqi security forces, $100 million for factory reopening in Iraq, and $242 million for the Commanders Emergency Response Program in Afghanistan. The budget amendment includes $956 million for construction in Iraq and Afghanistan, $8.8 billion for equipment repair and replacement, and $1 billion for Navy P-3 aircraft radar detection equipment. The budget amendment includes $1 billion for Navy P-3 aircraft radar detection equipment and $5.4 billion to restock equipment inventories of combat support units. Defense Department officials state this is part of the amount needed to make up shortfalls in inventories due to equipment cross-leveling for deployments. The budget amendment includes $2.5 billion for various initiatives, such as fuel price increases, accelerating construction of facilities to replace Walter Reed Army hospital, improving Army medical facilities and services, and supporting soldier and family programs. The Administration's FY2008 budget included $35.1 billion for international affairs, with an additional emergency supplemental request of $6.897 billion. This funding is primarily for State Department operations and foreign assistance. The emergency supplemental request for international affairs spending is $6.897 billion, with the largest portion allocated for State Department operations and foreign assistance in Iraq and Afghanistan. Additional funding is also requested for programs in Mexico, the West Bank and Gaza, North Korea, Sudan, and Pakistan. The State Department estimated $3.220 billion for various programs in Iraq and Afghanistan, including Diplomatic and Consular Programs, Worldwide Security Upgrades, staff housing, and contributions to international organizations and peacekeeping activities. The State Department's emergency supplemental request for international affairs spending is $6.897 billion, with $2.1 billion allocated for Diplomatic and Consular Program funding for Iraq Operations. Foreign Operations comprise $3.678 billion, including $350 million for P.L. 480 food assistance. Nearly half of the total foreign operations package was allocated for assistance in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Bush Administration has been criticized for relying too heavily on emergency supplemental funds for international affairs budgets. The Bush Administration has faced criticism for relying heavily on emergency supplemental funds for international affairs budgets, particularly for Iraq and Afghanistan. Some argue that these expenses should be incorporated into regular appropriations. However, the Administration defends the need for emergency requests due to rapidly changing events and unforeseen emergencies. In February 2007, the FY2008 State Department emergency supplemental request included $1.882 billion for Diplomatic and Consular Programs in Iraq. The FY2008 State Department emergency supplemental request included $1.882 billion for Diplomatic and Consular Programs in Iraq. The Administration later amended the request, adding nearly $1.3 billion for various programs, bringing the total emergency funds requested for FY2008 to $3.220 billion in addition to the regular budget request of $7.317 billion for the Administration. The FY2008 State Department emergency supplemental request included $3.220 billion for the Administration of Foreign Affairs, with $2.120.6 billion designated for emergency needs in Iraq. This funding also covers security needs, such as local guards and compound guards. The FY2008 State Department emergency supplemental request included $2.523 billion for Iraq operations, with $978.7 million allocated for security needs like local guards, compound guards, regional security, personal security details, armored vehicles, physical and technical security equipment, support for special agents and counterterrorism training, and overhead cover protection. Another $907.1 million would go toward Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs), covering salaries and other expenses. The FY2008 State Department emergency supplemental request included $2.523 billion for Iraq operations, with funding allocated for security needs like local guards, compound guards, regional security, personal security details, armored vehicles, counterterrorism training, and overhead cover protection. Additionally, $907.1 million was designated for Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs), covering salaries, operations, living accommodations, medical support, information technology, vehicles, security, and leases of space in Baghdad. The FY2008 emergency supplemental request for the Department of State included funding for securing facilities, high threat protection teams, unbudgeted security costs for other agencies, and fully armored vehicles for the embassy and PRTs. Other expenses covered U.S. staff housing in Afghanistan, assessments for U.N. activities combatting terrorism, and contributions for international peacekeeping activities in Darfur. $53 million for U.S. assessments for U.N. activities combatting terrorism, and $723.6 million for U.S. Contributions for International Peacekeeping activities in Darfur. Congress provided regular and supplemental funding for the Department of State and the Broadcasting Board of Governors in Division J of the Consolidated Appropriation Act (P.L. 110-161), totaling $1.262 billion in supplemental funds for the Department of State\u2014$781.6 million for State's Diplomatic and Consular Programs (D&CP) and $468.0 million for U.S. Contributions to International Peacekeeping (CIPA). The emergency supplemental amounts are less than what the Administration had requested. The emergency supplemental funding for the Department of State includes $575.0 million for Iraq operations and $206.6 million for worldwide security protection. The State Department applied $206 million to the FY2008 base request, leaving $162.4 million pending for security protection in Afghanistan. The appropriation does not specify allocation for the emergency funds, but at least $550.4 million is to be used for a new United Nations/African Union hybrid. The emergency supplemental funds include $390 million for Darfur and $78 million for FY2008 U.N. Peacekeeping funds. $333.6 million is still pending for Darfur. Additionally, $12.0 million is allocated for the BBG in the consolidated appropriation. No specific funds were requested for international broadcasting in the Administration's emergency supplemental request. The Administration's emergency supplemental request included funds for international broadcasting, with no specific allocation mentioned. The Foreign Operations portion of the request totaled $3.678 billion, sent to Congress in two tranches. The first request of $1.367 billion was accompanied by the President's budget, and an amended request of $2.311 billion, including P.L. 480 food aid, was sent on October 22nd. Approximately one-third of the request consisted of $2.217 billion in Economic Support Funds for Iraq, Afghanistan, and West Bank/Gaza. The emergency supplemental request included funds for various countries such as Iraq, Afghanistan, West Bank/Gaza, North Korea, Sudan, and Pakistan. The request also included anti-narcotics funding for Mexico and Central America, Migration and Refugee Assistance for Iraqi and Palestinian refugees, and International Disaster and Famine Assistance for programs in Iraq. Total funding requested was $3.678 billion. The emergency supplemental request included $80 million for programs in Iraq to assist internally displaced persons, $5 million for the Afghanistan Presidential Protection Service, $350 million for P.L. 480 food aid in the Horn of Africa, Kenya, Sudan, and a $30 million contingency fund. Congress approved $1.123 billion in emergency supplemental funds for foreign operations in addition to regular FY2008 funding. The omnibus bill approved $1.123 billion in emergency supplemental funds for foreign operations in addition to regular FY2008 funding. The amounts approved for emergency funds are often less than requested, making it unclear which parts of the request will be funded. Congress approved $115 million for Global Health & Child Survival and $110 million for International Disaster Assistance. The legislation does not specify where all the funds should be directed, giving some discretion to the Administration. Supplemental funds approved by Congress include $115 million for Global Health & Child Survival, $110 million for International Disaster Assistance, $20.8 million for USAID Operating Expenses, $542.6 million for Economic Support Fund, $200 million for Migration and Refugee Assistance, and $100 million for Foreign Military Financing. For Iraqi and Palestinian refugees in Lebanon, West Bank, and Gaza, $230 million was requested for Refugee Assistance. $100 million was allocated for Foreign Military Financing, and $35 million for Peacekeeping Operations. No additional funds were provided for counter-narcotics programs in Mexico and Central America, as well as West Bank and Gaza. Over $42 billion in U.S. funds had been appropriated for Iraq reconstruction until the omnibus FY2008 appropriations bill. The Administration did not request security assistance for FY2008. In FY2008, funding for Iraq reconstruction was expected to come from an emergency supplemental measure as the Administration did not request security assistance in its regular Defense budget proposal. Congress rejected the Administration's request for Iraq funding in both the House and Senate versions of the State and Foreign Operations legislation. The Administration's FY2008 emergency supplemental appropriations request included $4.9 billion for Iraq reconstruction, with $3.7 billion allocated for DOD reconstruction appropriations to fund training Iraqi troops and reconstruction grants. The Commander's Emergency Response Program (CERP) primarily funds the training and equipping of Iraqi troops and reconstruction grants. It allows military commanders to support local economic activities and infrastructure projects with minimal bureaucratic hurdles. Recently, CERP has also paid salaries to the Sons of Iraq. The Commander's Emergency Response Program (CERP) funds training, equipping Iraqi troops, and reconstruction projects with minimal bureaucratic hurdles. Recently, CERP paid salaries to the Sons of Iraq. Additionally, a $100 million request was added to the DOD-funded Iraq Freedom Fund for the Task Force to Improve Business and Stability Operations in Iraq, aiming to stimulate the economy and create employment by rehabilitating state-owned enterprises. The FY2008 emergency supplemental request under the State and Foreign Operations appropriations budget would direct $1.2 billion toward Iraq to stimulate the economy and create employment by rehabilitating state-owned enterprises. Challenges include lack of electricity, insecure environment, and lack of enthusiasm from U.S. companies. The FY2008 emergency supplemental request allocates $1.2 billion to Iraq, with funds designated for Economic Support, International Narcotics and Law Enforcement, Migration and Refugee Assistance, and International Disaster and Famine Assistance. The Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) receive support from ESF, with 31 teams in total, including 13 embedded PRTs in combat battalions in Baghdad and Anbar province to stabilize secured areas. The ePRTs, embedded with U.S. combat battalions in Baghdad and Anbar province, aim to stabilize secured areas by supporting local economic projects with ESF-funded grants, job training, and micro-loan programs. They also help increase the capacities of local government officials to spend Iraqi-owned capital funds for infrastructure programs. ESF at the national level supports Ministerial capacity development, agriculture and private sector reform, and democratization efforts. The October budget revision added $25 million to the ESF supplemental request and proposed authorization for a new Iraq enterprise fund based on the model created for east Europe and the former Soviet Union. Enterprise funds are U.S. government-funded bodies that provide loans or equity investments to small and medium businesses, supporting private sector growth and mortgage lending markets. The Polish Fund, an example of an enterprise fund in former communist countries, successfully made profitable investments to help companies grow post-communism. However, some funds have been less successful due to poor investment risks or competition from other funding sources. Critics question the usefulness of these funds for development purposes. The INCLE account would largely support rule of law and corrections programs, including prison construction and judicial reform. The MRA request aims to address the refugee crisis in the region caused by millions of Iraqis fleeing the country or being displaced. The MRA request aims to address the refugee crisis in the region caused by millions of Iraqis fleeing the country or being displaced. It includes providing medical care, food, shelter, and other relief to refugees and displaced people. FY2008 emergency funds were also requested for operational costs for staffing and administering reconstruction programs. Congress provided $1.9 billion for security reconstruction aid in Iraq, but rejected most regular requests for economic reconstruction in the omnibus appropriations. Congress rejected most economic assistance to Iraq in the omnibus appropriations, providing only $250 million for humanitarian programs such as demining, refugee assistance, disaster relief, and war victim funds. The Congress appropriated $10 million for the rescue of Iraqi scholars and 24% of the total International Affairs budget supplemental request for Iraq reconstruction. This brings the total Iraq reconstruction funding since 2003 to $44.8 billion. The Administration is seeking the remainder of the funding for PRT operations and programs. The Administration is seeking additional funding for Iraq reconstruction and PRT operations. Afghanistan's political transition was completed in 2005, but insurgent threats escalated in 2006, raising concerns about U.S. stabilization efforts. The political transition in Afghanistan was completed in 2005, with successful elections and a new constitution adopted. Afghan citizens have gained new personal freedoms, especially in the northern and western regions, previously forbidden under the Taliban. Women are now participating in economic and political life.
