    "content": "The Act titled \"Teacher Voluntary Early Retirement Incentive Act of 2001\" provides voluntary early retirement incentive plans for governmental and higher education employees. The Act \"Teacher Voluntary Early Retirement Incentive Act of 2001\" allows voluntary early retirement plans for government and higher education employees, with provisions for supplemental benefits that may be reduced or eliminated without violating age discrimination laws. The Act allows for supplemental benefits to be provided to employees based on age at retirement, as long as the employer does not reduce or eliminate non-supplemental benefits based on age, and the supplemental benefits are in addition to any retirement or severance benefits offered to all employees within the past year. The Teacher Voluntary Early Retirement Incentive Act of 2001 allows employees to elect to retire after attaining the minimum age and meeting non-age based conditions, with a 180-day window to make the decision. Retirement cannot be required sooner than 180 days after the election. The Teacher Voluntary Early Retirement Incentive Act of 2001 allows employees less than 180 days to elect retirement, with no requirement for retirement to occur sooner than 180 days after the election. Employees not eligible for maximum benefits due to age must have had a previous opportunity to receive them. The amendment made by subsection (a) applies to determining violations of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 for early retirement plans in educational agencies or institutions. The amendment made after January 1, 1996, applies to certain sections of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967. SEC. 3. Retiree medical benefits coordinated with Medicare and other governmental and employer benefit plans; voluntary early retirement incentive plans maintained by local educational agencies. \"A voluntary early retirement incentive plan maintained by a local educational agency in coordination with a defined benefit plan maintained by a state or agency thereof shall itself be subject to the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967.\" The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 deems a plan maintained by a state as a defined benefit plan. The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 allows for coordination of retiree medical benefits with Medicare benefits. The Employment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 provides medical benefits for retired participants that may be affected when they are eligible for Medicare benefits or a state employee benefit plan. The amendments apply to determining eligibility for early retirement incentive plans maintained by local educational agencies or employee benefit plans. Section 14101 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (20 U.S.C. 8801) and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1002(3)) address violations of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (29 U.S.C. 623) related to early retirement incentive plans for retired participants. No inference can be made regarding the status of such plans before or after the effective date of the amendment. The local educational agency's defined benefit plan, as defined in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, may be considered a defined benefit plan for various purposes, including the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967."
