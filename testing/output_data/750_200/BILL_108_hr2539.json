    "content": "The \"Violence Against Children Act of 2003\" may be cited as such. Congress finds that individuals under 18 account for a significant portion of crime victims, especially in sex crimes and kidnappings. Adolescents aged 12-17 are more than twice as likely to be victims of violent crime compared to adults. Only 28% of crimes against children are reported, leading to a significant underreporting of abuse cases. Approximately 1,200 children die from abuse annually, with around 879,000 children being victims of abuse, which has long-lasting negative effects. Child abuse has long-lasting negative effects on children and families, including delayed development, depression, substance abuse, and increased likelihood of experiencing or perpetrating domestic violence as an adult. Most local agencies lack resources to protect children and families adequately. Failure to pay child support is a form of neglect, leading to children living in poverty. Failure to provide financial support for children can lead to them living in poverty, resulting in inadequate education, lack of quality healthcare, and affordable housing. TITLE I--ENHANCED FEDERAL ROLE IN CRIMES AGAINST CHILDREN: Enhanced penalties for crimes against children. Chapter 110 of title 18, United States Code, is amended to include a new section on violence against children. It states that anyone who willfully injures or attempts to injure a person under 18 years of age by force or threat of force can face imprisonment for up to 10 years and fines. If death results from the offense, the perpetrator can be imprisoned for any term of years or for life. If death results from the offense or if the offense includes kidnapping, aggravated sexual abuse, or an attempt to kill, the perpetrator shall be imprisoned for any term of years or for life, and fined accordingly. These circumstances apply if the conduct occurs during the travel of the defendant or the victim. The defendant or victim's travel across state lines or using interstate commerce, or employing a firearm in connection with the offense, will result in penalties under this section, including imprisonment and fines as specified in section 1111 of this title. The offense under this section may result in penalties under section 1111 of this title if it involves interstate commerce or foreign commerce.
