    "content": "Facing pressure to reduce the federal budget deficit, some in the 112th Congress saw international affairs spending, including foreign aid, as expendable. Others believed a strong foreign affairs budget was crucial for national security and foreign policy goals, potentially saving money by avoiding costly military interventions. Congress considered budget cuts to address costs. Congress considered the FY2013 Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Agencies appropriations in the context of the Budget Control Act of 2011, delaying passing most appropriations bills until after the start of the new fiscal year. The House passed legislation (H.R. 933) on March 6, 2013, to fund federal programs. The House passed legislation (H.R. 933) on March 6, 2013, to fund federal programs for the remainder of FY2013, which was signed into law on March 26, 2013 (P.L. 113-6). This included the State-Foreign Operations appropriation, supporting international affairs programs and activities. The international affairs budget (Function 150) covers various programs and activities, such as foreign economic and security assistance, contributions to international organizations, State Department and USAID operations, public diplomacy, and international broadcasting. However, some programs like food aid and certain commissions are funded through different appropriations bills. The Trade Commission and Foreign Claims Settlement Commission, funded through the Commerce-Science-Justice appropriation, are international affairs programs not funded through the State-Foreign Operations appropriations bill. International commissions like the International Boundary and Water Commission are funded through the State-Foreign Operations bill. A chart illustrating the organizational structure of the State-Foreign Operations appropriations bill is provided in Appendix A. Abbreviations of terms used throughout this report are in Appendix B. The focus is on the accounts funded through the State-Foreign Operations appropriations bill. The report focuses on accounts funded through the State-Foreign Operations appropriations bill and provides appropriations figures for the international affairs budget. Congressional activity related to the appropriations bill is summarized, including President Obama signing the FY2013 Defense and Military Construction/VA, Full Year Continuing Resolution. The FY2013 Defense and Military Construction/VA, Full Year Continuing Resolution, P.L. 113-6 funds State-Foreign operations at FY2012 levels, excluding sequestration. President Obama signed the Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2013, H.J.Res. 117 into law, funding the government until March 27, 2013. On September 22, 2012, the Senate passed H.J.Res. 117 and on September 13, 2012, the House passed H.J.Res. 117, a continuing resolution funding the federal government until March 27, 2013. It provided 0.612% more than FY2012 levels for State and Foreign Operations non-OCO funded activities, with OCO-designated activities funded at the FY2012-enacted level. The annualized State-Foreign Operations funding rate under the CR was estimated to be $53.52 billion. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved its FY2013 State-Foreign Operations appropriations bill, providing $52.3 billion with $2.3 billion in Overseas Contingency Operations funds. The State Department and Related Agencies received $16.3 billion, including $1.6 billion for OCO, while Foreign Operations were funded at $36.0 billion with $709.8 million in OCO funds. On the other hand, the House Appropriations Committee approved its FY2013 State-Foreign Operations appropriations bill. The House Appropriations Committee approved its FY2013 State-Foreign Operations appropriations bill totaling $48.5 billion, with $8.2 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO). This amount was 12% less than requested and 9% below the FY2012 estimated levels. The bill allocated $15.8 billion for the Department of State and Related Agencies accounts, including $2.9 billion in OCO funding, and $32.9 billion for Foreign Operations accounts, including $5.4 billion in OCO funding. The House Appropriations Committee approved $48.38 billion for State-Foreign Operations, with $8.2 billion in OCO funds, 12% below the Administration's request. The Senate allocated $53.02 billion for the same, following FY2013 budget authority caps. The Senate Appropriations Committee adopted its initial FY2013 subcommittee allocations, allocating $53.02 billion for State-Foreign Operations, including $3.2 billion in OCO funds. The Obama Administration submitted its FY2013 budget request seeking a 2.6% increase for the Department of State-Foreign Operations and Related Agencies. The Administration's priorities on foreign affairs funding for FY2013 aligned with congressional priorities. The Obama Administration's FY2013 budget proposal requested $54.9 billion for State-Foreign Operations, including $46.6 billion for core budget and $8.2 billion for war-related Overseas Contingency Operations. This represented a 2.6% increase over FY2012 funding levels. The Obama Administration's FY2013 budget proposal requested a 2.6% increase in funding for State-Foreign Operations, including a 4.5% increase in State Department accounts and a 0.1% increase in Foreign Operations accounts. The budget also included $770 million for the Middle East and North Africa Incentive Fund (MENA IF) to support Arab Spring countries, and $800 million for the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund (PCCF) despite concerns about past funding disbursement. The FY2013 budget proposal sought $800 million for the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund (PCCF), despite concerns about past funding disbursement and U.S.-Pakistan relations. The request included a slight increase in State Department Administration of Foreign Affairs funding, a decrease in bilateral economic aid, and a small increase in security assistance funding. In FY2013, there was a slight increase in State Department Administration of Foreign Affairs funding, a decrease in bilateral economic aid, and a small increase in security assistance funding, making up more than 85% of the total State-Foreign Operations funding requested. The State Department and Related Agencies budget request for FY2013 included funding for State Department operations, International Organizations, International Peacekeeping activities, International Broadcasting, and entities like the National Endowment for Democracy and the U.S. Institute of Peace. The Administration requested a 4.5% increase in funding to a total of $18.8 billion, with $14.1 billion allocated for Administration of Foreign Affairs. The FY2013 budget request for the State Department and Related Agencies totaled $18.8 billion, with $14.1 billion designated for Administration of Foreign Affairs. The focus was on supporting military-to-civilian transitions in Iraq, State Department-led efforts in Afghanistan and Pakistan, internal reorganizations under the QDDR, and personnel issues. The State Department has taken over all U.S. programs in Iraq after the military's departure in 2011, marking a significant transition. They are now responsible for a wide-ranging policy agenda and facing personnel issues. In late 2011, the State Department took over U.S. programs in Iraq from the military, facing a wide-ranging policy agenda and personnel issues. For FY2013, they requested $2.7 billion for State Operations in Iraq, 23% less than FY2012, reflecting a normalization of U.S. presence. The Administration's plan to \"normalize\" the U.S. presence in Iraq includes reducing the State Department presence by 25% in fall 2012, cutting security contracts, and completing construction projects funded in FY2012. The FY2013 request for $2.7 billion for State Operations in Iraq is 23% less than FY2012. The House appropriations bill allocated $2.8 billion for State Department operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. The House appropriations bill allocated $2.8 billion for State Department operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan in FY2012. The Senate Appropriations Committee bill provided $2.1 billion for Department of State operations in Iraq in FY2013, reflecting reforms outlined in the QDDR. The FY2013 budget request reflected reforms from the QDDR, including the establishment of a new Bureau of Energy Resources and elevation of the Office of the Coordinator for Counterterrorism to a Bureau. The Office of the Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization activities were absorbed into the Bureau of Conflict and Stabilization in 2011 without additional funding from Congress. The Office of the Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization activities were absorbed into the Bureau of Conflict and Stabilization without additional funding from Congress. Funding for the State Department's operations in support of the Counterterrorism mission has increased significantly. The Administration requested funds for 12 new positions within the Bureau of Counterterrorism in addition to existing staff. The Bureau of Energy Resources also sought 22 new positions in the FY2013 budget request. The Bureau of Energy Resources requested additional funding to strengthen market incentives, enhance human resource expertise on energy matters, and engage more broadly on U.S. global energy priorities. The Administration's funding request included plans to establish regional hubs in Istanbul, Singapore, Johannesburg, and Rio de Janeiro. However, the House Appropriations Committee recommendation did not include the additional $5.4 million and 22 new positions. The House Appropriations Committee did not include the additional $5.4 million and 22 new positions for the Bureau of Energy Resources. The Senate Appropriations Committee report did not mention this Bureau, but funding within the D&CP could support new hires. The Administration's FY2013 request for the Bureau of Conflict and Stabilization Operations (CSO) saw a significant increase in funding. Staffing levels would decrease as part of a restructuring to make the Bureau more agile and expeditionary. The Bureau of Conflict and Stabilization Operations is undergoing a restructuring to become more agile and expeditionary, with staffing levels decreasing by 64 positions. The Civilian Response Corps model is also being modified to fund experts only when deployed, reducing the number of members by 76. This reorganization aims to increase deployment capacity while reducing overhead costs. The House Appropriations Committee's FY2013 proposal reduced the number of Civilian Response Corps members by 76. It allowed the Secretary of State to transfer funds to Conflict and Stabilization Operations, with $8.5 million in OCO funding. The Senate Appropriations Committee did not provide funding for CSO but authorized transfers from Diplomatic & Consular Program funding and the Complex Crisis Fund. The Administration requested $10 million from the Complex Crisis Fund and $2.5 billion for additional human resources in the Diplomatic & Consular Program in FY2013. This included $24.9 million to increase State's staffing by 121 new positions as part of the \"Diplomacy 3.0\" initiative. The \"Diplomacy 3.0\" initiative aimed to increase the number of Foreign Service Officers by 25% from 2008 to 2014. The proposed FY2013 funding would have allowed for an 18% growth in FSOs and the hiring of 82 additional FSOs and 39 civil servants. Due to budget constraints, the goal of 25% growth was postponed beyond 2014. Additionally, $81.4 million was requested for the final phase of Overseas Comparability Pay implementation for FSOs. The Administration requested $81.4 million for the final phase of Overseas Comparability Pay (OCP) for Foreign Service Officers (FSOs) beyond 2014. Prior to 2009, FSOs transferring abroad experienced a 23.1% cut in basic pay compared to locality pay in Washington, DC, leading to recruitment challenges and increased attrition. Foreign Service employees were significantly impacted by the Overseas Comparability Pay (OCP) issue, affecting diplomatic readiness and competitiveness. Congress approved prior OCP adjustments, reducing pay differentials by 70%. The FY2013 request aimed to bring comparability pay levels to Washington, DC rates. The House Appropriations Committee did not allocate funds for hiring above attrition in FY2013. The House Appropriations Committee did not provide funding for hiring above attrition in FY2013 and rejected the department's request for overseas comparability pay extension. The Senate Appropriations Committee also did not include overseas comparability pay authority or funding in its FY2013 proposal. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees did not include overseas comparability pay authority or funding in their FY2013 proposals. In October 2011, UNESCO voted to admit Palestine as a full member, sparking a U.S. policy debate due to American opposition to Palestinian statehood outside of negotiations with Israel. U.S. law prohibits funding to any U.N. agency accepting Palestinians as full members. U.S. assessed contributions to UNESCO account for 22% of its budget. The U.S. has withheld its contributions to UNESCO, which account for 22% of the organization's budget, since Palestine was admitted as a full member in 2011. The Administration sought almost $80 million for UNESCO in 2012, but the House committee report stated that U.S. contributions would be withheld. The House plans to withhold U.S. contributions to UNESCO and Economic Support Funds to the Palestinian Authority if they gain full membership in the United Nations. The Senate also includes similar restrictions on funding to UNESCO and other U.N. entities granting membership to the Palestinian Authority. Both proposals involve reduced funding. The House and Senate plan to restrict U.S. funding to UNESCO and other U.N. entities granting membership to the Palestinian Authority. The proposals involve reduced funding for International Organizations and Programs (IO&P) account, which is a significant part of U.S. foreign assistance programs. The Foreign Operations budget includes bilateral and multilateral U.S. foreign assistance programs managed by USAID, State Department, and other agencies. It also covers contributions to major multilateral financial institutions and funds for various development agencies. The Foreign Operations budget includes U.S. contributions to major multilateral financial institutions like the World Bank and U.N. entities, as well as funds for the Export-Import Bank. The budget request for FY2013 was $36.07 billion, a slight increase from FY2012. This request emphasized ongoing foreign assistance initiatives such as the Global Health Initiative and Food Security Initiative. The FY2013 budget request for Foreign Operations was $36.07 billion, slightly higher than the FY2012 level of $36.03 billion. The request focused on ongoing foreign assistance initiatives like the Global Health Initiative, Food Security Initiative, and Global Climate Change Initiative, as well as funding for war-related states like Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. There was also a call for a new regional funding account for political transitions in the Middle East and North Africa. House and Senate committee actions suggested differing priorities, including restrictions on funding for international family planning programs and aid conditions for certain countries and entities. The FY2013 budget request for Foreign Operations was slightly higher than the previous year, focusing on ongoing initiatives like the Global Health Initiative and funding for war-related states. Congressional debates also centered on policy issues such as restrictions on funding for international family planning programs and aid conditions for certain countries. The use of foreign assistance as a democracy promotion tool received scrutiny due to recent popular uprisings in the Middle East and North Africa. The use of foreign assistance as a democracy promotion tool in the Middle East and North Africa has come under scrutiny, especially after the fall of regimes in Egypt and Libya. Members of Congress have expressed interest in supporting uprisings against undemocratic regimes but are concerned about accountability and unintended consequences. The Administration proposed a $770 million Middle East and North Africa Incentive Fund (MENA IF) in its FY2013 budget to support effective U.S. engagement in the region. This fund would include $65 million for the Middle East Partnership Initiative (MEPI) and $5 million for the Office of Middle East Programs (OMEP), with the remaining $700 million as unallocated funds. The Administration proposed a $770 million Middle East and North Africa Incentive Fund (MENA IF) in its FY2013 budget to support effective U.S. engagement in the region, including $65 million for the Middle East Partnership Initiative (MEPI) and $5 million for the Office of Middle East Programs (OMEP). The remaining $700 million would have been unallocated funds intended to provide incentives for beneficiary countries to move toward democracy, with flexibility to support Arab Spring countries in transition. The funds could have been used for humanitarian relief, U.N. peacekeeping activities, or bilateral loans. The Administration proposed a $770 million Middle East and North Africa Incentive Fund (MENA IF) in its FY2013 budget to support effective U.S. engagement in the region. Some Members of Congress expressed concerns about the proposed MENA IF, which some believe would have given the Administration too much discretion and Congress too little opportunity for oversight. The House committee bill provided no funding for a new account, but would have allocated $175 million within the Economic Support Fund (ESF) account and $25 million in the Foreign Military Finance account for \"Middle East Response,\" including the funding of MEPI and OMEP. The House committee bill allocated $175 million in the ESF account and $25 million in the Foreign Military Finance account for \"Middle East Response,\" with $50 million for Jordan and $75 million unallocated. The Senate committee report included $1 billion for MENA IF, increasing MEPI funding to $70 million. Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan have been top U.S. aid recipients due to their strategic significance in the Global War on Terror. For FY2013, the Administration requested $6.8 billion for aid to Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan, with $2.1 billion designated for Iraq, including $1.8 billion as OCO. The funding included $1 billion for the Police Development Program in Iraq. The Administration requested $1 billion for the Police Development Program in Iraq for FY2013, emphasizing its importance in U.S. security engagement in the region. Despite concerns about potential reductions, the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad reaffirmed the program's significance in the U.S.-Iraqi relationship. Baghdad rejected doubts about the Police Development Program in Iraq, calling it vital for the U.S.-Iraqi relationship. The House legislation expressed support for the program but did not allocate specific funds, instead requiring a report on revised personnel, scope, and costs. The House report stated that funding for the Police Development Program in Iraq would continue within the INCLE program, while the Senate did not include funding for the PDP due to Iraqi disinterest and inadequate planning. The Administration requested $2.5 billion for Afghanistan in FY2013, with almost half designated as OCO, representing a 7.6% increase from FY2012. The Administration requested $2.5 billion in foreign operations funds for Afghanistan in FY2013, with almost half designated as OCO, reflecting a 7.6% increase from FY2012. The increase was for infrastructure programs, economic growth investments, and justice sector programs transitioning to civilian management. The House legislation did not specify total funding for Afghanistan and required security certification for aid workers, while the Senate bill included $1.8 billion for foreign operations. The Senate bill included $1.8 billion in foreign operations funds for Afghanistan, stating that less funding than requested would be needed as the Afghan government takes control of more programs. The Administration's FY2013 budget requested $2.2 billion in foreign operations funds for Pakistan, including $800 million for the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund (PCCF) designated as OCO, reflecting a 6% increase from FY2012. The FY2013 budget requested a 6% increase in foreign operations funds for Pakistan, focusing on energy, economic growth, stabilization, education, and health. The House legislation did not specify an aid level for Pakistan, while the Senate bill included $842.3 million for Pakistan, including $50 million for the PCCF. The Senate bill for FY2013 included $50 million for the PCCF in Pakistan, with new conditions on aid including withholding $33 million in FMF until Dr. Shakil Afridi is released from prison. The budget request also included $7.9 billion for the Global Health Initiative. The budget request for FY2013 included a reduction of $300 million in global health funding, with decreases in all areas except for international family planning and the Global Fund to Fight HIV, Tuberculosis. The FY2013 budget proposed reductions in global health funding, with increases for international family planning and the Global Fund. The House provided slightly more funding than requested, while the Senate proposed even more for the Global Health Initiative. The Senate proposed $8.5 billion for global health, including $1.7 billion for the Global Fund, which is 8% more than requested and 4% more than the FY2012 level. Feed the Future, the Obama Administration's food security initiative, remains a priority with a FY2013 request of $1.1 billion in Foreign Operations funds. The President pledged $3.5 billion over three years at a G-8 summit in 2009 to address global hunger. The FY2013 request included $134 million for the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program. The House proposal supported the goals of Feed the Future, allocating $99.8 million for GAFSP. The Senate recommended $1.2 billion for agricultural assistance. The FY2013 request for programs supporting the Global Climate Change Initiative (GCCI) was $770 million, with funds flowing through various appropriations accounts. The initiative focuses on climate change adaptation, clean energy technologies, and greenhouse gas reduction. The Global Climate Change Initiative (GCCI) receives funding from various sources, including multilateral funds and World Bank Trust Funds. The initiative focuses on climate change adaptation, clean energy technologies, and greenhouse gas reduction. The House and Senate had differing views on GCCI funding in their FY2013 proposals. The House and Senate had differing views on GCCI funding in their FY2013 proposals. The House legislation recommended zero funding for the Clean Technology Fund and Strategic Climate Fund, while providing half of the requested funds for the Global Environment Facility. The Senate committee recommended $111 million for Sustainable Landscapes, a pillar of the GCCI, and allocated funds for multilateral climate change programs. The Senate showed strong support for multilateral climate change funds, allocating $139.4 million for the GEF, $100.0 million for the Strategic Climate Fund, and $300.0 million for the Clean Technology Fund, exceeding the Administration's request. There was also a request for $643 million for family planning and reproductive health activities in FY2013, which has been a topic of contentious debate in Congress for over three decades. Recent congressional debate focuses on two key issues: the \"Mexico City policy\" and U.S. funding of the UN Population Fund (UNFPA). The Mexico City policy, established in 1984 by President Reagan, required foreign NGOs receiving USAID family planning assistance to refrain from promoting abortion. This policy has been rescinded and reinstated by various Administrations, with the most recent rescission in 2009 by President Obama. Proposed FY2013 House legislation aimed to codify the Mexico City Policy. The Mexico City Policy, established in 1984, has been rescinded and reinstated by past Administrations. The FY2013 House legislation proposed to codify this policy, while the Senate bill did not include such language. Previous Administrations have also suspended grants to UNFPA due to coercive family planning practices in China. The George W. Bush Administration suspended U.S. contributions to UNFPA from FY2002 to FY2008. The George W. Bush Administration suspended U.S. contributions to UNFPA from FY2002 to FY2008. President Obama resumed U.S. contributions in 2009, with a request for $39 million for UNFPA for FY2013. The proposed FY2013 House legislation included $461 million for family planning and reproductive health activities, while the Senate legislation included $700 million, with $44.5 million for UNFPA. Both bills included the Kemp-Kasten amendment. The Senate legislation included $700 million for family planning and reproductive health, with $44.5 million for UNFPA. The Administration proposed dissolving the AEECA account in FY2013, cutting funding for programs currently funded through AEECA by 18% from FY2012. Funding for these programs would come from ESF. The House and Senate proposed merging AEECA funds with ESF, GHP, and INCLE accounts, with no signal of reduced support for the region or the Coordinator of U.S. Assistance to Europe and Eurasia. Both proposals allow funds from ESF and other accounts to assist countries eligible for AEECA aid, without specifying a minimum funding level. During the Cold War, foreign aid and diplomatic programs focused on anti-communism, economic development, trade promotion, education, health care, human rights, and environmental protection. Post-Cold War, the focus shifted to broader policy interests. Since the early 1990s, U.S. foreign policy objectives shifted to include stopping nuclear weapons proliferation, curbing illegal drug production, promoting peace in the Middle East, achieving regional stability, protecting religious freedom, and countering human trafficking. The focus further changed after the 9/11 attacks to emphasize national security objectives in foreign aid and diplomatic programs. Following the 9/11 attacks, U.S. foreign aid and diplomatic programs shifted towards emphasizing national security objectives, particularly in efforts to counter terrorism. President Bush's 2002 National Security Strategy established global development as a key component of U.S. national security, alongside defense and diplomacy. Foreign assistance budget justifications began to prioritize the war on terrorism, focusing on aid to 28 \"front-line\" states. In 2002, foreign aid budget prioritized the war on terrorism, focusing on assistance to 28 \"front-line\" states. Reconstruction programs in Afghanistan and Iraq dominated the budget, highlighting the use of aid for national security. State Department efforts focused on diplomatic security and public diplomacy in Muslim communities, while aid to combat HIV/AIDS increased significantly under the Bush Administration. The Bush Administration prioritized aid for national security, focusing on reconstruction in Afghanistan and Iraq. They also increased aid to combat HIV/AIDS globally through initiatives like PEPFAR and the MCC. The Obama Administration continued these initiatives, including massive global health funding and assistance to countries with good governance. The Obama Administration continued foreign aid initiatives, including the MCC and global health funding. Funding for these initiatives was requested within Overseas Contingency Operations in regular appropriations bills. The first ever Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review was completed in 2010, naming USAID as the leading agency for development assistance and identifying reforms. In 2010, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) was named the leading government agency for development assistance. The Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review (QDDR) identified reforms for the Department of State, including the establishment of the Bureau of Energy and elevating the Office of the Coordinator for Stabilization and Reconstruction. The Department of State proposed changes in funding for Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan in its FY2012 budget, requesting an extension of OCO funds. The use of OCO funds was extended to include costs of the Department of State and USAID in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. Congress expanded the OCO designation in the FY2012 State-Foreign Operations appropriations legislation. The Budget Control Act of 2011 specified that OCO funds do not count toward the budget. The Budget Control Act of 2011 allowed for the use of Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funds to prevent war-related funding from impacting core international affairs activities. However, OCO funds are subject to automatic across-the-board reductions starting January 2, 2013. This approach is similar to past use of supplemental international affairs appropriations. The Budget Control Act of 2011 allowed for the use of Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funds to prevent war-related funding from impacting core international affairs activities. Significant emergency supplemental funds for foreign operations were appropriated in FY2002-FY2010 for activities in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere, and were not counted toward subcommittee budget allocations. The Obama Administration criticized this practice and pledged to request funds for these activities through the regular budget process starting in FY2010. In FY2010, base funding for international affairs saw a sharp increase, with supplemental funds requested for activities in Haiti, Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan. FY2011 was the only year in the last decade where all international affairs funding was part of the base budget before the OCO approach was adopted in FY2012. Unlike supplementals, OCO allows all funding to be considered in the regular appropriations process simultaneously. In FY2013, OCO funding was requested by the Administration for international affairs, with $8.24 billion designated as OCO, 5% less than FY2012. The House legislation designated $8.3 billion as OCO, while the Senate bill designated $2.3 billion. The Senate bill allocated $2.3 billion as OCO funding, 72% less than requested by the Administration. State Department-Foreign Operations funding had been increasing until FY2011, with a spike in FY2004 due to reconstruction funds for Iraq and Afghanistan. State Department-Foreign Operations funding increased until 2011, except for a spike in FY2004 for Iraq and Afghanistan reconstruction. In FY2011, Congress reduced foreign affairs spending to cut the deficit. FY2012 and FY2013 funding remained steady due to deficit reduction efforts. Adjusted for inflation, funding was below FY2009 levels. See Table 2 and Figure 3 for past decade appropriations in current and constant dollars. Table 3 and Figure 4 show State Department funding over the past decade. In recent years, State Department and related agencies funding has trended upward at a steeper rate than overall foreign affairs spending, reflecting efforts by the George W. Bush and Obama Administrations to increase human resource capacity at the Department of State. The George W. Bush and Obama Administrations aimed to boost human resource capacity at the Department of State. Foreign aid appropriations have shown a similar trend to the overall State-Foreign Operations budget over the past decade. Israel and Egypt were the top recipients of U.S. foreign aid before 9/11 and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Foreign aid funding levels off in recent years, with Israel, Egypt, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan being top recipients. Assistance to Iraq has decreased due to completed reconstruction activities. Pakistan has moved up the list due to security and economic aid to combat extremist organizations. Funding for these countries includes temporary OCO appropriations. In recent years, foreign aid funding has remained stable, with Israel, Egypt, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan as top recipients. Israel received $3,100 million in Foreign Military Financing (FMF), while Afghanistan received $2,505 million, with $1,237.9 million designated as OCO funds. Pakistan ranked third at $2,228 million, including $800 million for PCCF and $928 million within ESF. Iraq moved up to fourth place in the FY2013 request. In FY2013, foreign aid to Africa would have decreased by 10% to $6.4 billion, aid to the Near East would have increased by 12% to $9.0 billion, and aid to South Central Asia would have increased by 6% to $5.3 billion. 88% of the aid to South Central Asia was requested for war-related costs. In FY2013, aid to South Central Asia increased by 6% to $5.3 billion, with 88% allocated for war-related costs in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Near East region continued to prioritize assistance to Israel, Iraq, Egypt, and Jordan. Europe and Eurasia saw a 14% decline due to progress in the region and other global priorities. The Western Hemisphere's decline was due to reduced funding for Colombia. East Asia and Pacific aid remained low and consistent. In East Asia and Pacific, aid remained low and consistent with past years. Congress has shown interest in various aid sectors like education, trade capacity, maternal and child health, and biodiversity. Administrations now include a section in their budget requests addressing these key interest areas. Allocation data was not provided by the Administration, making it difficult to compare year-to-year requested funds. The Administration's budget request for FY2013 addressed key interest areas, but did not provide allocation data for comparison. Comparing past and present requested levels gives an indication of the Administration's priorities. Out of 23 sectors, the FY2013 request was lower than FY2012 for all but five, including major initiatives like Food Security and Global Climate Change. The FY2013 budget request showed decreases in funding for various sectors, including Food Security and Global Climate Change. However, there were increases in funding for Gender Funding and Science, Technology, and Innovation compared to the previous year. In FY2013, there were decreases in funding for Food Security and Global Climate Change, but increases in Gender Funding (up by 330%) and Science, Technology, and Innovation (up by 85%) compared to the previous year."
