    "content": "The Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) administers retirement, survivors, disability, unemployment, and sickness benefits for railroad workers and their families. The RRB system is separate from Social Security but closely coordinated. Lifelong railroad workers receive RRB annuities instead of Social Security benefits; those with non-railroad employment receive benefits from either RRB or Social Security Administration based on their railroad service length. Railroad workers with non-railroad employment receive benefits from RRB or Social Security based on their railroad service length. To qualify for an RRB annuity, a worker needs at least 10 years of covered railroad work or five years after 1995. Family members of insured railroad workers receive RRB annuities equal to or greater than Social Security benefits. If not eligible for RRB annuity, railroad work counts towards Social Security benefits. RRB annuities consist of tier I and tier II components. The two basic components of RRB annuities are tier I and tier II. Tier I amounts are equivalent to Social Security benefits and increase annually with a cost-of-living adjustment. Tier II retirement amounts are paid in addition to tier I and other retirement savings plans offered by railroad employers. Tier II retirement amounts are paid in addition to tier I amounts and any private pension and retirement savings plans offered by railroad employers. They are similar to private pensions and are based solely on covered railroad service. Tier II amounts are increased annually by 32.5% of the Social Security COLA. The surviving spouses (and in some cases former spouses) of railroad workers may be eligible to receive widow or widower annuities from RRB after the worker's death. RRB survivor annuities are generally higher than comparable Social Security benefits since families of railroad workers may be entitled to tier II amounts as well as tier I amounts. The Railroad Retirement and Survivors' Improvement Act of 2001 (P.L. 107-90) allows widows and widowers of railroad workers to receive annuities based on the worker's RRB annuity. Surviving spouses may be eligible for up to 100% of the worker's annuity at full retirement age, with reduced annuities available as early as age 60. Additionally, a widow(er) caring for a deceased worker's child under age 16 may receive an annuity of up to 75% of the worker's tier I amount plus 100% of the worker's tier II amount. The Railroad Retirement and Survivors' Improvement Act of 2001 (P.L. 107-90) increased initial annuities for qualifying railroad employees' widows(er)s. Other provisions in the law include investment flexibility for retirement funds and reduced vesting requirements for tier II annuities. The Railroad Retirement and Survivors' Improvement Act of 2001 increased annuities for railroad employees' widows(er)s, with changes to vesting requirements and tax structure. The new rules apply to widows(er)s receiving annuities from February 2002 onwards, and some who started before may also benefit. The 2001 law increased annuities for qualifying widow(er)s by adding a new guaranty amount, initially set at 50% of the employee's tier II amount. This raised the total initial minimum amount to 100% of the employee's tier I and tier II amounts. The 2001 law increased annuities for qualifying widow(er)s by adding a new guaranty amount, initially set at 50% of the employee's tier II amount. The total initial minimum amount after the 2001 law is 100% of the tier I and tier II amounts the employee would have received at the time the widow(er) begins to receive an annuity. Both the widow(er)'s tier I amount and regular tier II amount are increased each year based on Social Security COLA adjustments. The 2001 law increased annuities for qualifying widow(er)s by adding a new guaranty amount, initially set at 50% of the employee's tier II amount. Each year, tier I amounts are increased by the same amount as the Social Security COLA, and regular tier II amounts are increased by 32.5% of the Social Security COLA. The dollar amount of each year's COLA is offset by an equal reduction to the guaranty amount. This results in a widow(er)'s annuity staying the same in nominal terms but declining in real terms. When the guaranty amount is reduced to zero, the widow(er) will begin to receive an increase in their total monthly annuity for the first time. The 2001 law increased annuities for qualifying widow(er)s by adding a new guaranty amount, initially set at 50% of the employee's tier II amount. The widow(er) will begin to receive an increase in his or her total monthly annuity for the first time when the guaranty amount is ultimately reduced to zero. In 2005, the average aged widow(er) annuity awarded was $1,416 per month in real 2005 dollars, an increase from $1,138 per month in 2001. The average aged widow(er) annuity awarded increased from $1,138 to $1,416 per month in real 2005 dollars by 2005. An illustration of widow(er) annuities under current and prior law shows a widow's initial annuity would have been $1,150 under prior law and $1,300 under current law. The widow's total annuity amount is $150 more than under prior law, with tier I and regular tier II amounts needing to exceed her initial minimum for COLAs to increase her total annuity. The widow's total annuity will not increase due to COLAs until her tier I and regular tier II amounts exceed her initial minimum. Her total annuity remains at $1,300 between 2006 and 2012, but the components change yearly. Tier I increases from $1,000 in 2006 to $1,023 in 2007, while regular tier II increases from $150 to $151. The widow's guaranty amount decreases by $24 from $150 to $126 annually. The widow's total annuity will not increase due to COLAs until her tier I and regular tier II amounts exceed her initial minimum. Her total annuity remains at $1,300 between 2006 and 2012, but the components change yearly. Tier I increases from $1,000 in 2006 to $1,023 in 2007, while regular tier II increases from $150 to $151. The widow's guaranty amount decreases by $24 annually, reaching $126 in 2007. The widow's total annuity will increase due to COLAs once her tier I and regular tier II amounts exceed her initial minimum. Her total monthly annuity under current law will be $1,323 in 2012, higher than the $1,300 in 2011. The amount of her total monthly annuity will remain the same under both current and prior law, with no changes in 2012 and subsequent years. Under prior law, the widow's monthly annuity in 2006 would have been $1,150, consisting of tier I and tier II amounts. However, under current law, her total annuity in 2006 would be $1,300, including the guaranty amount. The guaranty amount decreases annually as tier I and tier II amounts increase."
