    "content": "The bill is titled the \"Freedom to Fish Act\" and includes findings related to fishing rights. Congress finds that recreational fishing is a popular outdoor sport with over 50 million participants nationwide, contributing $116 billion annually to the economy and supporting over 1.2 million jobs in the United States. Recreational anglers contribute significantly to local economies and conservation efforts, providing over $500 million annually to State fisheries programs. The Federal Government supports public access to public lands and waters for recreational purposes while maintaining conservation principles. This is reflected in various acts such as the National Forest Management Act and the Wilderness Act. Recreational fishery resources can usually be preserved without limiting public fishing access. The Recreation Act of 1978 emphasizes managing recreational fishing resources without restricting public access through various measures like take limits, size requirements, and closed seasons. A clear policy is needed to show anglers that recreational fishing can be managed without unnecessary prohibitions. Additionally, a comprehensive policy on marine protected areas is necessary for resource maintenance. A clear policy is needed to manage recreational fishing resources without unnecessary prohibitions, while also implementing a comprehensive policy for marine protected areas to maintain a balance between recreational fishing and sustaining fishery resources. The United States promotes sound conservation of fishery resources by ensuring federal regulations prioritize access for recreational anglers, involve anglers in regulatory procedures, and impose limitations on access only when scientifically necessary for conservation. SEC. 4. MAGNUSON-STEVENS FISHERY CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT ACT AMENDMENTS. Section 303(a) of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act is amended to limit closures of geographic areas for recreational fishing unless it is proven that recreational fishing is causing a specific conservation problem and no other conservation measures will suffice. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act limits closures of areas for recreational fishing unless proven necessary for conservation, with specific criteria and periodic reviews required for assessment. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act requires periodic reviews to assess the need for area closures to recreational fishing based on scientific information, with closures to be lifted once the conservation condition no longer exists. Technical amendments are also made to specific paragraphs within the Act. SEC. 5. Amendment to the National Marine Sanctuaries Act. Amendment to the National Marine Sanctuaries Act includes changes to fishing regulations within the exclusive economic zone, allowing Regional Fishery Management Councils to draft and revise necessary regulations. The Council must draft regulations in accordance with the Magnuson Act standards. Regulations can apply to a fishery within a State if approved by the Governor or determined by the Secretary after a hearing. The Secretary can determine if a State's actions will negatively impact the goals of the Act after a hearing in accordance with regulations. The Secretary can regulate a fishery within a State's boundaries, and if so, the State can request a hearing in accordance with regulations. The State can request a hearing under section 554 of title 5, United States Code before the Secretary regulates a fishery within the State's boundaries. The State can request a hearing under section 554 of title 5, United States Code before the Secretary regulates a fishery within the State's boundaries. If the Secretary assumes responsibility for regulating a fishery within a state, the state can later apply for reinstatement of its authority over that fishery. The Secretary must promptly terminate the regulation if the reasons for assuming it no longer exist."
