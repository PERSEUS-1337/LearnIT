    "content": "The Obama Administration pursued the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) free trade agreement negotiations as part of its Asia-Pacific strategy. The 12 countries concluded negotiations in late 2015, signed the agreement in February 2016, aiming to liberalize trade and investment with broad implications for U.S. relations in the region. Congress played an active role in oversight and consultations during the TPP negotiations. The TPP negotiations involved Congress oversight and consultations, with formal negotiating objectives set in Trade Promotion Authority legislation. Implementing legislation would be required for the TPP to take effect in the U.S. The agreement's potential impacts are a topic of debate in Congress, with proponents highlighting its strategic significance beyond just economic benefits. Trade Representative Michael Froman emphasized the strategic significance of the TPP, which goes beyond just economic benefits. The agreement is seen as a tool for the United States to exert influence in the region and beyond, strengthening alliances and partnerships while creating conditions for other policy tools. The TPP is viewed as a way for the United States to strengthen regional alliances, maintain leadership in the Asia-Pacific region, enhance national security, and drive economic growth. China's economic rise is a key factor in analyzing U.S. influence in the region. China's economic rise and trade initiatives in the region are key factors in analyzing U.S. influence in the Asia-Pacific region. Some analysts believe China is trying to create a regional order that reduces U.S. presence and power. Some analysts argue that China's initiatives aim to minimize U.S. presence in the region, while others see the TPP as a way for the U.S. to maintain leadership in Asia and establish trade norms with China in mind. Concerns exist that framing the TPP as a counter to China could be counterproductive and create negative perceptions of U.S. intentions in the region. Some argue that U.S. and Chinese trade goals in the region may complement each other rather than compete. Trade agreements involve economic and political elements, creating a challenge in balancing policy priorities. Opponents of the TPP believe focusing on its strategic aspects diverts attention from its potential impact on the U.S. economy. The TPP agreement's strategic elements are debated, with critics arguing it distracts from its impact on the U.S. economy. Proponents highlight strategic implications that are hard to quantify but significant. This report focuses on strategic arguments in the Asia-Pacific region. The report focuses on the strategic implications of the TPP agreement in the Asia-Pacific region, with particular emphasis on implications for Asia. It also raises strategic issues for Congress to consider when examining the final TPP agreement and potential future legislation. The United States signed its first FTA with Israel in 1985, with political solidarity weighing more heavily than economic value. In the 2000s, FTAs with Bahrain, Morocco, and Oman were seen as based on security and foreign policy objectives, particularly in combating terrorism. The first U.S. FTA in Asia with Singapore entered into force in 2004, emphasizing strategic interests in liberalizing trade. The Obama Administration and TPP proponents argue that U.S. trade policy initiatives in Asia, especially the TPP, hold significant geostrategic importance. The Obama Administration and TPP proponents emphasize the geostrategic importance of U.S. trade policy initiatives in Asia, particularly the TPP, as a way to shape a global economic order that reflects American interests and values. The TPP is seen as a test of U.S. credibility in the region. The TPP is a key economic initiative in the Asia-Pacific region and a test of U.S. credibility as a regional leader. Its approval by Congress is crucial for the U.S. to maintain its leadership role in Asia and signal active integration into the region's economic and diplomatic structures. The TPP is seen as a key signal of US integration into Asia's economic and diplomatic structures, with many in the Asia-Pacific region supporting the agreement. Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong emphasized the strategic significance of the TPP at a regional security conference in May 2015, stating that its completion would strengthen links across the Pacific. Proponents argue that the TPP is crucial for developing regional institutions that promote cooperation and peaceful conflict resolution. The U.S. strategy aims to strengthen regional institutions for cooperation and peaceful conflict resolution by promoting international rules and norms. The TPP is seen as a way to advance global prosperity and enhance diplomatic and security interests. The Administration's arguments for TPP include diplomatic and security interests, with Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter emphasizing its importance. Proponents believe the agreement will strengthen U.S. alliances in East Asia, but critics question how it would enhance security partnerships in the region. Some critics argue that the strength of security partnerships in East Asia depends more on countries' assessment of their security interests rather than on trade agreements like the TPP. For example, the impact of the South Korea-United States Free Trade Agreement on their fundamental interests in the region is unclear. The short-term strength of the U.S.-South Korea alliance is likely determined by various factors. The short-term strength of security partnerships in East Asia is determined by countries' assessment of their security interests rather than trade agreements like the TPP. The future of alliances like the U.S.-South Korea and U.S.-Japan is influenced by factors such as threats from China or North Korea, rather than trade agreements. Japan's strategic decisions drive its cooperation with the United States, while the impact of the TPP may be more significant for countries with less close relationships with the U.S., like Vietnam. The TPP may have a larger impact on countries like Vietnam, where a successful outcome in the negotiations could support reform-oriented decisionmakers by requiring deeper market-oriented institutional changes. Approval of the TPP could also signal closer ties and more normal relations with the United States for Vietnamese leaders. Failure to approve the agreement could have consequences. Approval of the TPP by Vietnamese leaders could signal closer ties with the United States and promote a global order reflecting shared interests and values. Failure to approve the agreement may impact Vietnam's perception of the US as a reliable partner, particularly in the economic realm. The TPP aims to establish a rules-based trading system based on transparency, openness, and non-discrimination. The TPP aims to establish a rules-based trading system founded on transparency, openness, and non-discrimination. Proponents argue that the trade rules of the TPP can indirectly impact U.S. security relationships by signaling key partnerships and locking in the United States' Pacific presence. Implementing the TPP would help to \"lock-in\" the United States' Pacific presence, signaling key partnerships and prioritizing the Pacific Rim for U.S. policymakers. Failure to pass the TPP could be seen as a decline in U.S. interest in the region and a lack of leadership. The United States' declining interest in the region and inability to assert leadership is causing concern in Asia, especially with China's rise and North Korea's growing capabilities. Failure to pass the TPP could create an influence vacuum that China may fill, challenging U.S. credibility and influence in the region. The TPP's rejection by Congress could lead to a loss of trust and cooperation in relationships like that between the United States and Japan. Proponents argue that the TPP will enhance U.S. influence in shaping trade and investment globally. The TPP's rejection by Congress could impact U.S. influence on global trade. Proponents believe TPP rules will boost economic growth and encourage market opening among member countries, influencing trade regimes and addressing new barriers. The United States aims to update trade rules and address new barriers in markets like the US and Japan through the TPP, with the goal of influencing future negotiations and updating existing trade rules. This aligns with the US's historical efforts to expand economic engagement through trade for broader growth and prosperity. The United States has historically led trade liberalization efforts to promote economic growth and prosperity through negotiations like the GATT. The WTO was established as a result, but the current Doha Round of negotiations has stalled due to member differences. The WTO Doha Development Agenda (Doha Round) trade negotiations have stalled due to member differences. Global commerce has evolved with technology, leading to the need for new trade rules addressing digital trade and state-owned enterprises. Countries like the United States are pursuing bilateral and regional agreements like the TPP to address these issues and promote further liberalization. The TPP is a significant agreement involving 12 economies, accounting for 37% of global GDP. It allows for new countries to join and could provide cover for domestic reform agendas in emerging economies. The TPP could provide political cover for domestic reform agendas in emerging economies, incentivizing reforms to gain access to the U.S. market. Proponents argue that it could also promote internationally recognized worker rights and environmental protection practices. Additionally, the TPP could create competitive pressure for non-participating countries, driving further trade and investment liberalization. The TPP could create competitive pressure for non-participating countries, potentially leading to further trade and investment liberalization in the region. However, some experts argue that the TPP, as it stands, does not include key Asian economies like China, India, and Indonesia, limiting its ability to establish comprehensive trade and investment rules in the Asia-Pacific. Several large Asian countries, including Indonesia, the Philippines, South Korea, and Thailand, have expressed interest in joining a \"second round\" of TPP members once the agreement is implemented, potentially expanding the TPP's influence. Taiwan has also shown interest in membership, but many Asian nations face domestic opposition to joining. Many Asian nations, including South Korea and Colombia, may seek entry into the TPP in the future. Proponents believe mega-regionals like TPP and T-TIP could influence global trade negotiations. The TPP and T-TIP could impact global trade negotiations by setting new rules beyond the WTO, potentially influencing future WTO negotiations. Critics fear these bilateral and regional agreements may divert attention from multilateral efforts, potentially undermining the WTO's legitimacy. The shift of trade negotiations away from the WTO could undermine the organization's legitimacy, impacting future trade liberalization efforts. Mega-regionals may complicate the trading system with differing rules, diverging from the multilateral approach of the WTO. The TPP negotiations are part of ongoing trade negotiations in the Asia-Pacific region, with the RCEP being another significant negotiation involving ASEAN members and six other nations. The United States is not part of the RCEP negotiations. The United States does not have an FTA with ASEAN and has not shown interest in joining the RCEP negotiations. A comparison between ASEAN trade agreements and the finalized TPP indicates potential differences in terms of trade liberalization, intellectual property rights, investment, and labor and environmental provisions. The TPP includes disciplines on state-owned enterprises, a topic not likely to be included in RCEP. The RCEP has less extensive intellectual property rights, investment, and labor and environmental provisions compared to the TPP. Some argue that RCEP could challenge U.S. trade rules through the TPP, while others believe both agreements can lead to economic growth in the region. Seven countries are in both RCEP and the TPP, aiming for compatibility and synergy between the two agreements. The TPP is at a more advanced stage than RCEP, with negotiations concluded. A delay in TPP ratification could impact the sequencing of the two agreements. All 12 TPP countries and 11 RCEP countries are also members of APEC. The implementation process for TPP could impact the sequencing of agreements. All 12 TPP countries and 11 RCEP countries are members of APEC, which has discussed creating a Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP) since 2006. China and the United States support this goal, with both TPP and RCEP seen as possible pathways to the FTAAP. China's role in TPP debates and broader U.S. policy is significant. China's inclusion in or exclusion from the TPP may have important implications for the United States and the Asia-Pacific region. President Obama and TPP proponents argue that China's growing international influence increases the strategic importance of completing the proposed TPP. Some analysts suggest that China is trying to create a regional order that minimizes U.S. presence. The proposed TPP is seen as a way for the United States to counter China's efforts to create a regional economic order that may not align with U.S. interests. The agreement would allow the U.S. to shape economic development in line with its own interests by establishing rules and norms for other regional nations to follow. The proposed TPP aims to shape economic development in line with U.S. interests by creating rules and norms for other regional nations to follow. It is believed that the TPP's size and economic importance could influence China's economic and diplomatic decisions in ways favorable to U.S. interests. President Obama emphasized the importance of enforceable labor standards, environmental standards, IP protections, and non-discrimination against foreign firms in the TPP. The completed TPP could encourage China to adopt international norms in labor, environment, IP protections, and non-discrimination against foreign firms. It may also provide political cover for reformers in China to push for deeper economic reforms. Some argue that portraying China as an outlier in regional economic development is unnecessary and may exaggerate the situation. Some argue that portraying China as an outlier in regional economic development is unnecessary and may overstate the influence of Chinese initiatives on regional trade and investment rules. They stress that China's economic initiatives could benefit Asia's economic development, especially in infrastructure and investment needs. China's economic initiatives in Asia could benefit regional development, but the United States risks being seen as obstructionist if it opposes these initiatives. Other Asian nations have their own trade policies and are unlikely to adopt policies that are not in their interest. China's leaders are focused on transforming their nation into a prosperous major power through a strong economy, defense, and global role. They are implementing policies to strengthen the economy and expand China's global economic influence, including the One Belt, One Road initiative to connect with Europe and the Middle East. China is constructing the \"One Belt, One Road\" initiative to create new trade linkages with Europe, the Middle East, central Asia, and Southeast Asia. New financial institutions like the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and Silk Road Fund will provide capital for this initiative. China aims to increase the overseas use of its currency, the renminbi, to simplify transactions for supporting economic development projects. China aims to increase the overseas use of its currency, the renminbi, to support economic development projects and enhance its global economic stature. Chinese leaders also see the establishment of RCEP as a foundation for a broader FTAAP, reflecting Chinese leadership in regional rules and norms. They seek to reform multilateral institutions to align with today's geopolitical situation. China is actively promoting reforms in international institutions like the United Nations, IMF, and World Bank, as well as establishing the AIIB to offer an alternative model. It remains uncertain whether the AIIB will align more with existing institutions or take a distinct path. China's efforts to reshape economic institutions are mirrored in diplomatic and security spheres, where Beijing aims to reduce U.S. influence. China has tried to transform CICA into a new Asian security system to counter the U.S. alliance network. Additionally, China has engaged in extensive construction in disputed areas. China aims to establish a new Asian security system to counter the U.S. alliance network and has undertaken construction in disputed areas like the South China Sea. China's views on the TPP have evolved, with initial concerns about U.S. dominance and exclusion from the talks. China's initial concerns about U.S. dominance and exclusion from the TPP talks have softened since Japan joined in April 2013. President Obama clarified that the TPP is not aimed at containing or disadvantaging China, but rather hopes for China to adopt fair practices. China's criticisms of the U.S. role in the TPP process have softened since Japan joined in April 2013. Chinese officials have expressed openness to negotiations on the TPP, stating that various FTA arrangements can foster a just and free international trade order. U.S. officials have welcomed China to join the TPP, although differences in standards and provisions remain a point of contention. U.S. officials have expressed openness for China to join the TPP, although Chinese officials have concerns about implementing the standards and provisions. President Obama mentioned China's interest in participating in the TPP in 2015. Analysts believe the U.S. aims to integrate China more deeply into trade liberalization and establish new trade rules beyond the WTO system. The United States aims to liberalize trade and establish new trade rules beyond the WTO system. A former Obama Administration official suggests that high-standard agreements like the TPP could hold China to stricter rules and deter attempts to weaken existing trade rules. Negotiations for a bilateral investment treaty with China are ongoing, potentially boosting investment flows and paving the way for China's future participation in the TPP. Congress has been actively involved in guiding and overseeing the TPP since the U.S. joined in 2008. Since the United States joined the TPP in 2008, Congress has played a direct role in guiding and overseeing the negotiations. Congress approved legislation to renew U.S. Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) in 2015 to establish U.S. trade negotiating objectives and provide for the expedited consideration of legislation to implement U.S. trade agreements concluded by the President. Congress will have a direct role in considering TPP and implementing legislation. As Congress considers the TPP agreement and its strategic elements, it might examine various issues. TPP proponents argue that the proposed agreement is part of a broad foreign policy strategy to promote respect for international rules and norms in the Asia-Pacific region, reinforcing U.S. leadership in the region. The TPP proponents argue that accepting the rules and disciplines of the agreement will strengthen U.S. leadership in the Asia-Pacific region and encourage nations to adopt a more U.S.-supportive foreign policy outlook. Congress should consider these strategic arguments when evaluating the broader implications of the TPP. Deeply weighing the strategic arguments surrounding the TPP is crucial for Congress, as it involves trade-offs and implications for U.S. leadership in Asia. The debate should consider how strategic benefits are tied to economic growth and whether concerns outweigh the agreement's importance for U.S. leadership. The TPP's strategic impact depends on membership expansion and balancing trade liberalization with establishing rules. Some argue it is crucial for U.S. leadership in Asia, while others see it as an opportunity for broader multilateral trade policy goals. The TPP's strategic impact depends on membership expansion and balancing trade liberalization with establishing rules. Congress may need to consider the implications of failed ratification on U.S. leadership in the region. Failure to ratify and implement the TPP agreement would hinder strategic goals and potentially impact U.S. leadership and credibility in the Asia-Pacific region. The lengthy process of negotiating the TPP could delay the formation of an alternative agreement. Other countries in the region are pursuing their own trade arrangements, raising questions about the implications for countries outside the TPP. The TPP's 12 participating countries do not include several strategically and economically important countries in the Asia-Pacific region. Observers urge the U.S. to expand economic engagement beyond TPP membership to prevent neglecting other countries. Congress should consider if current U.S. economic initiatives in Asia are enough to further U.S. influence in the region. Analysts have mixed views on how \"mega-regional\" negotiations like the TPP may impact the multilateral trading system. Some see it as an opportunity for the U.S. to advance new trade rules and disciplines. Some analysts view mega-regional agreements like the TPP as a chance for the US to introduce new trade rules, but there are concerns about potential negative impacts on the WTO and non-participating countries. Congress needs to consider if the TPP will support global trade liberalization or lead to fragmentation of the trading system. They may also need to decide on pursuing new global trade initiatives to ensure the TPP encourages progress at the global level. Congress may need to consider pursuing new global trade initiatives to ensure the TPP encourages progress at the global level and address concerns about potential negative impacts on the WTO and non-participating countries."
