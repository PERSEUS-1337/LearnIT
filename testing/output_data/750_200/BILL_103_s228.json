    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Children's Bicycle Helmet Safety Act of 1993\". The Congress finds that millions of Americans ride bicycles regularly, leading to thousands of head injuries and deaths annually. A significant portion of these incidents involve children under 15, resulting in substantial societal costs. Universal use of bicycle helmets in the United States could have prevented 2,600 deaths and 757,000 injuries from head injuries annually. Only 5 percent of children in the country who ride bicycles wear helmets. A child with a head injury costs society $4.5 million over their lifetime. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration can provide grants to promote bicycle helmet use among individuals under 16. Grantees have flexibility in designing effective programs. Grants under section 3 can be used to enforce laws on bicycle helmet use, assist in acquiring helmets, educate on helmet importance for safety, or a combination of these activities. Bicycle helmets manufactured 9 months after this Act must conform to interim standards like the ANSI standard \"Z90.4-1984\" and the Snell Memorial Foundation standard \"B-90\" until a final standard is established. The Consumer Product Safety Commission will establish a final standard for bicycle helmets within 60 days of the enactment of the Act, based on interim standards like ANSI \"Z90.4-1984\" and Snell Memorial Foundation \"B-90\". The Consumer Product Safety Commission will establish a final standard for bicycle helmets, including provisions to protect against helmets coming off, address injury risks to children, and add appropriate provisions. Sections 7 and 9 of the Consumer Product Safety Act will not apply, and section 11 will not apply to any standard issued under this proceeding. The final standard for bicycle helmets, developed by the Consumer Product Safety Commission, will not be subject to certain provisions of the Consumer Product Safety Act. Until the final standard takes effect, non-conforming helmets will be considered in violation of safety standards. The final standard for bicycle helmets, developed by the Consumer Product Safety Commission, will be considered a consumer product safety standard under the Consumer Product Safety Act. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is authorized to receive appropriations of $2,000,000 for fiscal year 1994, $3,000,000 for fiscal year 1995, and $4,000,000 for fiscal year 1996 for a grant program. An \"approved bicycle helmet\" is defined as one that meets interim and final standards set by the Consumer Product Safety Commission."
