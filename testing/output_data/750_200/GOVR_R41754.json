    "content": "The Senate Appropriations Committee reported a bill appropriating funds for the Departments of Transportation and Housing and Urban Development for FY2013. The bill recommends $3.210 billion for activities funded under the Community Development Fund account, including HUD's Community Development Block Grant Program and Section 108 loan guarantees. The President's budget proposal for FY2013 includes $3.143 trillion for discretionary spending. The President's FY2013 budget proposal includes $1.3 trillion for discretionary spending, with $3.143 billion allocated for the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Community Development Fund account, supporting the Community Development Block Grant program for neighborhood revitalization and economic development. The Community Development Block Grant program supports state and local government-directed neighborhood revitalization, housing rehabilitation, and economic development activities with formula-based grants allocated to various communities. The Obama Administration's budget request for FY2013 includes $3.143 billion for these activities. The Obama Administration's budget request for FY2013 includes $3.143 billion for activities funded under the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Community Development Fund (CDF) account, representing 8.9% of the total discretionary budget authority requested. The proposed budget would increase funding for CDF account activities by 4.5% or $135 million, reinstating funding for the regional planning initiative (SCI) and transferring funding for Section 4 capacity building activities. The Obama Administration's FY2013 budget request includes an increase in funding for the Community Development Fund (CDF) account activities. This increase would be achieved by reinstating funding for the Administration's regional planning initiative (SCI) and transferring funding for Section 4 capacity building activities. Specifically, the Administration is requesting $100 million for its Sustainable Communities Initiative and transferring funding for the Capacity Building for Community Development and Affordable Housing (Section 4) program. The Obama Administration's FY2013 budget request includes an increase in funding for the Community Development Fund (CDF) account activities. This includes transferring funding for the Affordable Housing (Section 4) program to the CDF account, with a requested budget of $2.948.1 billion for the CDBG formula component. The Administration's FY2013 budget requests $60 million for Indian tribes, similar to FY2012 appropriations. Funding for SCI program activities is recommended to be reinstated, with a request for $100 million in FY2013. The SCI program was initially proposed in FY2010 and funded at $150 million. $46 million would be awarded to regional organizations in 25 metropolitan areas for Regional Integrated Planning Grants. Funds totaling $46 million would support SCI's components: Regional Integrated Planning Grants for up to 25 metropolitan areas and Community Challenge Grants for up to 50 communities. The grants aim to integrate planning requirements for sustainable communities in collaboration with federal agencies like DOT and EPA. Grant awards focus on housing, transportation, economic development, energy, and land use planning. Community Challenge Grants totaling $46 million will be awarded to up to 50 communities to reform building codes and zoning ordinances for sustainable growth. Additionally, $8 million will fund research on the benefits of housing-transportation integration by HUD, DOT, and EPA. The Administration is requesting funds for a joint HUD, DOT, and EPA research initiative to evaluate benefits of various efforts, including long-term benefits of grants. $3 million would be set aside for technical support for residential energy modeling system and common energy standards. The CDBG Section 108 Loan Guarantee program allows states and communities to use their annual CDBG allocation to attract private capital for economic development, housing, and infrastructure projects. They can borrow up to five times their allocation for 20 years through bond issuance. The CDBG Section 108 Loan Guarantee program allows communities to borrow up to five times their annual allocation for 20 years through bond issuance. The proceeds must support job creation and meet national CDBG program goals, benefiting low or moderate income persons or addressing urgent threats. The program's budget proposes doubling the loan commitment. The Administration's budget proposes doubling the CDBG Section 108 Loan Guarantee program's loan commitment ceiling from $240 million in FY2012 to $500 million in FY2013. This increase in funding aims to help local governments finance job creation activities by charging a fee-based assessment to borrowers accessing the program. The Administration proposes revamping the CDBG Section 108 Loan Guarantee program by charging a fee-based assessment to borrowers, eliminating the need for a credit subsidy. Congress rejected this proposal in favor of maintaining the status quo. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $3.210 billion for CDF activities in FY2013, including $3.100 billion for CDBG formula grants. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $3.210 billion for CDF activities in FY2013, including $3.100 billion for CDBG formula grants. Additionally, the bill supports the Administration's $60 million funding request for Indian tribes and recommends $50 million for SCI activities, half of the Administration's request. The Senate committee bill recommends $50 million for SCI activities, half of the Administration's request. It also calls for HUD to allocate $12.5 million to SCI in communities with populations less than 500,000. Additionally, the bill supports converting Section 108 loan guarantees to a fee-based program and increasing the loan guarantee commitment to $500 million for FY2013. Funding for Section 4 activities remains at $35 million. The House Appropriations Committee reported the Transportation and Housing and Urban Development and Related Agencies Appropriations act on June 20, 2012, recommending $3.404 billion for activities funded under the CDF account, including $3.344 billion for CDBG formula grants. This is 13% more than the previous year's appropriation. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $3.344 billion for CDBG formula grants in the CDF account, which is 13% more than the previous year's appropriation. H.R. 5972 supports the Administration's $60 million funding request for Indian tribes but does not include a set-aside for SCI activities, instead recommending just over $2 million for closeout and evaluation of previous SCI awards. The House bill recommends just over $2 million for closeout and evaluation of previous SCI awards, noting that the program is unauthorized and lacks support from the House Financial Services Committee. H.R. 5972 also supports $6 million in loan subsidies for a loan guarantee ceiling of $244 million, in line with the Senate bill provisions. The House bill recommends funding for Section 4 activities at $35 million and opposes transferring the program from its current account. Amendments to reduce funding for CDBG and Section 108 loan guarantee programs were not approved during floor debate on the bill. During the House bill debate, multiple amendments proposing funding reductions or elimination of the CDBG and Section 108 loan guarantee programs were defeated by votes. During the House bill debate, amendments proposing funding reductions or elimination of the CDBG and Section 108 loan guarantee programs were defeated by votes. Another amendment that sought to allow a higher percentage of Neighborhood Stabilization Program funds for demolition activities was challenged and ruled as legislation in an appropriation bill. Congress debated the Administration's budget recommendations for FY2012 with a focus on reducing federal spending to address the deficit. During the FY2012 budget debate, Congress focused on reducing federal spending to address the deficit while also supporting programs like CDBG for community economic development and job creation. In the FY2012 budget debate, supporters of CDBG emphasized its role in community economic development and job creation. The Obama Administration proposed restructuring the CDF account by reducing funding for CDBG formula grants and eliminating the Neighborhood Initiative and Economic Development Initiative programs. The FY2012 budget proposed reducing funding for CDBG formula grants, eliminating funding for the Neighborhood Initiative and Economic Development Initiative programs, and transferring the Sustainable Communities Initiative to a new account. The total funding level recommended was $3.804 billion, representing a 14.5% reduction from FY2010 but an 8.6% increase from FY2011. The Administration also requested an 11.5% increase in funding for FY2012. The Administration requested an 11.5% increase in funding for the CDBG states and entitlement communities formula components of the CDF account for FY2012, totaling $3.684 billion. Additionally, funding for CDBG grants to insular areas and Indian tribes was requested at $7 million and $65 million, respectively. Rural Innovation Grants and Guam were also allocated $25 million and $23 million, respectively. The Administration requested $25 million for Rural Innovation Grants and $23 million for Guam to address community development needs related to military relocations. Economic Development Initiatives and Neighborhood Initiatives grants were not included in the budget. The Administration's FY2012 budget did not include funding for Economic Development Initiatives and Neighborhood Initiatives grants, programs subject to congressional earmarks. The Administration recommended transferring the SCI programs to a new stand-alone account and requested an appropriation of $150 million to support Regional Integrated Planning Grants. The Administration's budget proposed funding for Regional Integrated Planning Grants in metropolitan areas to support sustainable community development. This included Community Challenge Grants for reforming building codes and land use ordinances, as well as Housing-Transportation Integration Research. The program's loan commitment was also set to double. The Administration proposed doubling the loan commitment ceiling for an EPA research initiative to help local governments finance job creation activities. They also suggested charging a fee-based assessment to borrowers accessing the program to eliminate the need for an appropriated credit subsidy. Congress rejected the proposal. The Administration proposed revamping the program by charging a fee-based assessment to borrowers, eliminating the need for an appropriated credit subsidy. Congress rejected the proposal in favor of maintaining the status quo. The House Appropriations Subcommittee on THUD approved a draft bill recommending $3.501 billion for CDF activities, including $3.466 billion for CDBG formula grants. The House Appropriations Subcommittee on THUD approved a draft bill recommending $3.501 billion for CDF activities in 2011, with $3.466 billion allocated for CDBG formula grants to states, local governments, and insular areas, and $35 million for Indian tribes. The draft report accompanying the bill suggested maintaining overall CDF appropriations at the FY2011 funding level, but noted a recommendation in the FY2012 Budget Resolution to eliminate the program due to it not being considered a core federal government function. The THUD draft bill did not eliminate funding for the CDBG program but suggested states and local communities use more of their own taxes for community development. The draft bill proposed shifting CDF funding priorities, including reducing funding for CDBG Indian Tribes from $64 million to $35 million. It also recommended rejecting the Administration's Sustainable Communities Initiative. The subcommittee draft bill proposed reducing funding for CDBG Indian Tribes from $64 million to $35 million and recommended maintaining the current structure of Section 108 loan guarantees with $6.8 million in credit subsidies to support $275 million in loans. The bill recommended reducing CDF funding to $3.0 billion, with an additional $400 million for CDBG supplemental disaster assistance. The proposed reduction included lowering the percentage of funds grantees could use for administrative expenses from 20% to 10% of their CDBG allocation. The proposed reduction in CDF funding to $3.0 billion, with an additional $400 million for CDBG supplemental disaster assistance, was $500 million less than FY2011 appropriations. The Senate bill recommended $2.851 billion for CDBG formula funding, a 13.7% reduction from FY2011 levels. The Senate recommended $90 million for the Sustainable Communities Initiative, which was $60 million less than requested by the President. Senator Inouye submitted an amendment to consolidate three appropriations measures into a Minibus, which was approved by the Senate on November 1, 2011. The Senate approved a Minibus appropriations measure on November 1, 2011, including an amendment by Senator Coburn to restrict the use of grants for repaying federal loans. This amendment affects the CDBG program and its Section 108 loan guarantee program. The CDBG program allows funds to be used as collateral for Section 108 loan guarantees. States and communities use CDBG funds to cover revenue shortfalls for bond repayments. A conference was requested to reconcile differences in the House and Senate versions of H.R. 2112, which was approved and signed into law as P.L. 112-55 on November 18, 2011. The conference version of H.R. 2112 was approved by the House and Senate on November 17, 2011, and signed into law as P.L. 112-55 on November 18, 2011. P.L. 112-55 allocated $3.308 billion for CDF activities, including $300 million for CDBG disaster activities. The act provided funds for core CDBG programs, with $60 million for Indian Tribes and $2.948 billion for formula grants to states, entitlement communities, and insular areas. The $2.948 billion for CDBG formula grants is 10.7% less than FY2011, 19.6% less than requested by the President, and 15% less than recommended by the House. The $2.948 billion allocated for CDBG formula grants in FY2012 is 10.7% less than FY2011, 19.6% less than requested by the President, and 15% less than recommended by the House. Other CDF activities funded in previous years were not directly funded for FY2012, reflecting congressional efforts to reduce federal spending. The decline in CDBG funding and elimination of funding for other programs in P.L. 112-55 reflects congressional efforts to reduce federal spending. The act included provisions on federal grants and administrative expenses, as well as a directive for a study on the effectiveness of block grant programs. The act in P.L. 112-55 reduced expenses from 20% to 10% and mandated a study on the effectiveness of CDBG and HOME block grant programs. HUD was required to submit progress reports on grantee accountability within specific timeframes. The department is working to improve grantee accountability in CPD programs. The Administration's proposal to convert Section 108 loan guarantees to a fee-based program was not supported for the third year. P.L. 112-55 maintained the program's structure and appropriated $5.952 million in credit subsidies for $240 million in loan guarantee commitments. The act P.L. 112-55 provided $5.952 million in credit subsidies for $240 million in Section 108 loan guarantee commitments. It also included $400 million in CDBG supplemental disaster assistance for recovery efforts in areas declared disasters in 2011. The act prohibited states from diverting proceeds from the sale of notes backed by loan guarantees to other communities. The act P.L. 112-55 allocated $400 million in CDBG supplemental disaster assistance for states and local governments to manage recovery efforts in areas declared disasters in 2011. These funds were to be used for disaster relief, housing restoration, infrastructure, and economic revitalization. Eligible recipients had to submit a detailed disaster recovery plan to receive the funds. The act P.L. 112-55 allocated $400 million in CDBG supplemental disaster assistance for states and local governments to manage recovery efforts in areas declared disasters in 2011. HUD could waive certain provisions for CDBG funds, except for fair housing, nondiscrimination, labor standards, and environmental review. Grantees had to explain why a waiver was necessary for recovery efforts. $100 million of the $400 million was exempted from spending limits. The Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act for FY2011 allocated $3.508 billion for the Community Development Fund (CDF), with $100 million exempted from spending limits. The Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act for FY2011 allocated $3.508 billion for the Community Development Fund (CDF), with a mandatory rescission of 0.2% and a discretionary transfer of 1% to the Department's Transformation Initiative. This reduced the CDF account's total appropriation to $3.501 billion, approximately 16% below the amount appropriated for FY2010. The CDF, which includes the Community Development Block Grant program, was targeted for significant budget reductions in earlier legislation. The House-passed H.R. 1 bill aimed to reduce funding for CDBG activities by 62.5% below the FY2010 level as part of efforts to cut the federal budget deficit. It would have decreased total funding for discretionary programs by $61 billion compared to the Obama Administration's request. The House-passed H.R. 1 bill aimed to reduce funding for CDBG activities by 62.5% below the FY2010 level as part of efforts to cut the federal budget deficit. It would have decreased total funding for discretionary programs by $61 billion compared to the Obama Administration's request. The bill failed to win Senate approval, leading to renewed negotiations between the Obama Administration and House and Senate leadership. After weeks of negotiations, President Obama signed into law P.L. 112-10 on April 15, 2011. President Obama signed into law P.L. 112-10, the Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act for FY2011, on April 15, 2011, after negotiations to avoid a government shutdown. The act allocated $3.508 billion for CDF activities, including $3.343 billion for CDBG formula funds. The Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act for FY2011 allocated $3.508 billion for CDF activities, with $3.343 billion for CDBG formula funds. A 0.2% mandatory cut reduced the CDF account by $7 million to $3.501 billion, and a 1% discretionary transfer moved $35 million to HUD's Transformation Initiative. The CDF account received $3.501 billion for FY2011, which is 21.3% less than the previous year's allocation and 20.1% less than the Administration's request. This amount includes adjustments for a 0.2% rescission and a 1% transfer to HUD's Transformation Initiative. The FY2011 CDF account received $3.501 billion, 21.3% less than FY2010 and 20.1% less than the Administration's request. This includes funding for the CDBG program, with formula-based grants for various entities. P.L. 112-10 reduced CDBG formula grants by 16.4%. The FY2011 CDF account received $3.501 billion, 21.3% less than FY2010 and 20.1% less than the Administration's request. This includes funding for the CDBG program, with formula-based grants for various entities, insular areas, and Indian tribes. P.L. 112-10 reduced funding for CDBG formula grants by 16.4% and for the Sustainable Communities Initiative by 33%. The House passed H.R. 1, which would have further reduced the CDF account by 66.3% below the FY2010 funding level. The House passed H.R. 1, reducing the CDF account by 66.3% below the FY2010 funding level of $4.450 billion. It prohibited funds for earmarks and the Sustainable Communities Initiative. Allocation instructions for the CDBG program were not included in the bill. Senator Inouye submitted an amendment to H.R. 1, allocating 70% of funds to entitlement communities and 30% to states and Puerto Rico for distribution to nonentitlement communities. The House-passed version of H.R. 1 did not provide specific allocation instructions for the CDBG program. Senator Inouye submitted S.Amdt. 149 to H.R. 1, proposing $4.230 billion for CDF activities, with $3.990 billion for the CDBG program. The amendment aimed to freeze CDBG formula grant funds at the FY2010 level, with $7 million for insular areas and $40 million for Indian tribes. The Senate bill also included funding for the Rural Innovation Fund and University Community. The Senate bill proposed $4.230 billion for CDF activities, with $3.990 billion for the CDBG program. Funding for insular areas and Indian tribes was set at $7 million and $40 million, respectively. The FY2011 CDBG appropriations totaled $3.296 billion, a decrease from the previous year. In FY2012, allocations for entitlement communities and states decreased by 10.7% to $2.942 billion. In FY2012, funding for entitlement communities and states decreased by 10.7% to $2.942 billion. The average grant amount for entitlement communities declined by 29.1% from $2.4 million in FY2010 to $1.7 million in FY2012. Average state allocation also decreased by 25.4% to $17.3 million for FY2012. The average state allocation for entitlement communities declined by 25.4% from $23.2 million in FY2010 to $17.3 million in FY2012. The reductions in CDBG funding are less than the 62.5% reduction proposed in H.R. 1, which would have significantly impacted long-term community and economic development plans. The proposed funding reduction in H.R. 1 would have impacted community and economic development plans, forcing states and local governments to postpone or terminate activities supporting job creation, public facilities, and services. Non-profit organizations serving as CDBG sub-grantees would also see reduced resources, affecting public services like homeless shelters and job counseling for low and moderate-income individuals. The reduction in funding for the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program, including homeless shelters, public safety activities, and job counseling, disproportionately affects low and moderate-income households. The FY2012 appropriations for the CDBG program are the lowest in over a decade, leading to delays in projects and reduced support for community-based organizations. The reduction in funding for the CDBG program impacts entitlement communities, causing delays in projects and reduced support for community-based organizations. Table 5 shows the actual distribution of CDBG formula funds to states and entitlement communities for FY2010, FY2011, and FY2012. The distribution of CDBG formula funds to states and entitlement communities for FY2010, FY2011, and FY2012 was impacted by reductions in funding. P.L. 112-10 reduced allocations by 16.4% below FY2010 levels, while P.L. 112-55 decreased allocations by 25.1% below FY2011 amounts. 70% of the funds for CDBG eligible activities is allocated to cities and urban counties meeting requirements. In FY2011, CDBG funds are allocated to entitlement communities and states. 70% goes to cities and urban counties meeting population thresholds, while the remaining 30% is distributed to nonentitlement communities. Funds are awarded using statutorily based formulas. Formula A allocates funds to metropolitan cities and urban counties based on population, poverty, and overcrowded housing factors. Formula B, enacted with the passage of the Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1977, P.L. 95-128, allocates funds to metropolitan cities and urban counties based on population growth lag factor and each community's share of poverty. The distribution of CDBG funds to states is governed by a two formula system, with Formula A using population, poverty, and overcrowded housing to allocate funds, and Formula B using poverty housing built before 1940 and persons living in poverty. The CDBG program uses two formulas to allocate funds based on population, poverty, and overcrowded housing in nonentitlement areas. HUD is required to use the most recent Census Bureau data and OMB reports for each fiscal year, starting from FY2012. Starting from FY2012, HUD will use updated Census Bureau data from the 2010 Decennial Census and the 2005-2009 American Community Survey (ACS) five-year estimates to allocate CDBG funds. This annual update will better reflect demographic changes. Prior to FY2012, HUD used 2000 Decennial Census data for allocations. HUD used 2009 population estimates and 1960 census data for FY2011 CDBG allocations. A study in December 2011 analyzed the impact of switching to 2010 Census and ACS data on fund distribution. The study assumed constant eligible entities and appropriations from FY2011 to FY2012 to isolate the data source change's effect on fund distribution. Communities in Puerto Rico, the Mid-Atlantic, and Pacific/Hawaii regions saw a decline in CDBG allocations due to changes in data sources, while those in the Rocky Mountain, Great Plains, and Midwest regions were positively impacted. Entitlement communities in the Rocky Mountain, Great Plains, and Midwest regions would see an increase in CDBG allocations due to new data sources. Principal cities of metropolitan areas and urban counties would receive a larger share of funds, while funding for other entitlement cities would decrease. These changes are driven by shifts in poverty and overcrowding rates. The report shows a 3.1% decline in funding, with New Mexico and Puerto Rico experiencing the largest decreases. Changes are driven by increasing poverty in urban counties and pre-1940 housing in central cities. The report includes a comparison of funding allocations for entitlement communities in FY2011. The report compares funding allocations for entitlement communities in FY2011, analyzing the CDF account's funding history from FY2000 to FY2011. It discusses the three primary components of the CDF account and shows a graphic representation of the distribution of funds. Total appropriations for the CDF account fluctuated between $5.112 billion from FY2000 to 2010, excluding special appropriations for disasters, mortgage foreclosures, and economic recovery. Total appropriations for the CDF account fluctuated between $5.112 billion for FY2001 and $3.772 billion for FY2007, with FY2011 seeing the lowest funding in over a decade. The funding level for the CDBG-formula component has been a point of debate, with supporters advocating for increased funding due to a decline in appropriations. Critics argue that funding for the CDBG program has declined in both current and constant dollars, exacerbated by the increased number of entitlement communities. Supporters push for increased funding, citing the need to justify the program's PART score and the growing number of eligible grant recipients. Critics argue that increased funding for the CDBG program has not been justified based on the program's PART score and the need to reduce domestic discretionary spending to address the federal budget deficit and national debt. The average grant amount allocated to CDBG entitlement communities declined by 26.7% from FY2000 to FY2010, with a decrease in total appropriations annually from FY2001 to FY2008. However, there has been an increase in total appropriations from FY2009 to FY2010, but the average allocation has been steadily declining. Since FY2008, the average allocation has increased by 9% to $2.2 million. The average allocation for CDBG entitlement communities declined by 26.7% from FY2000 to FY2010, with a decrease in total appropriations annually from FY2001 to FY8. However, there was an increase in total appropriations from FY9 to FY10, but the average allocation has been steadily declining. Since FY2008, the average allocation increased by 9% to $2.2 million, but for FY2011, the estimated average allocation is $1.9 million, 34.5% less than FY2000. This decline is due to fewer dollars appropriated and an increase in the number of entitlement communities. The number of CDBG entitlement communities increased from 1,012 to 1,167 from FY2000 to FY2011. In FY2010, $1.183 billion was allocated to states, which was 7.4% less than in FY2000 but 7.6% more than in FY2009. The average state allocation declined during this period. The average state allocation for CDBG formula grants declined from $25.5 million in FY2002 to $19.1 million in FY2011, with a slight rebound to $23.2 million in FY2010. In inflation-adjusted constant dollars, program funding decreased by 40% from $4.235 billion in FY2000 to $2.545 billion in FY2011. In constant dollars, program funding for CDBG formula grants declined by 40% from $4.235 billion in FY2000 to $2.545 billion in FY2011. The CDF includes various programs with smaller appropriations, narrower objectives, and fewer direct recipients, some of which complement the larger formula grant program while others meet different agency objectives or are earmarked for specific activities. Some CDF programs complement the larger formula grant program, while others meet different agency objectives or are earmarked for specific activities. Funding for CDF set-aside programs fluctuated significantly from FY2000 to FY2011, with Congress appropriating $647 million in FY2001 but only $61 million in FY2007. Earmarks in the CDF account were eliminated in FY2007, and $509 million was appropriated in FY2010. In FY2001, Congress appropriated $647 million for CDF set-asides, which decreased to $61 million in FY2007. Funding for CDF set-aside activities in FY2010 amounted to $509 million, with a focus on Economic Development Initiative (EDI) and Neighborhood Initiative (NI) earmarked accounts. However, funding for these accounts was eliminated in FY2011 due to Congress's decisions on categorical grant programs. In FY2000 to FY2011, Congress made decisions on categorical grant programs, including funding reductions, transfers, and earmarks for programs like EDI and NI. Funding for CDF set-asides fluctuated, declining by 59.4% from FY2000 to FY2008, rebounding in FY2009 and FY2010, before declining significantly in FY2011. Funding for CDF set-asides fluctuated, declining by 59.4% from FY2000 to FY2008, rebounding in FY2009 and FY2010, before declining significantly in FY2011. Congressional earmarked projects funded by the EDI and NI programs were dominant in CDBG-related appropriations, sparking debate over earmarks in recent Congresses. Since FY2007, EDI and NI earmarks have been included in legislation appropriating funds for CDF activities, dominating CDBG-linked set asides programs in FY2008 and FY2009. Congress did not fund NI and EDI earmarks in FY2011. In FY2008 and FY2009, Congress allocated double the amount for NI and EDI earmarks compared to other set-aside activities. Congress has utilized the CDBG program's framework to provide additional funds for disaster relief, recovery, and mitigation efforts, as well as to address issues like abandoned properties caused by the mortgage foreclosure crisis. The Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP) aims to reduce abandoned and foreclosed properties by providing funds to states and communities for acquisition, rehabilitation, and resale. This initiative also supports job creation in response to the economic recession under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). Under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), disaster relief and Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP) funding were allocated based on specific criteria. CDBG disaster funds were only given to communities designated as disaster areas by presidential declaration, with Congress deciding on additional funding beyond FEMA's typical allocation. NSP-1 and NSP-3 funds were allocated in rounds to address abandoned properties and job creation. Funds from the Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP-1 and NSP-3) were allocated to states based on mortgage-related factors. Each state had to distribute a portion of these funds to local governments with high rates of mortgage issues. The Neighborhood Stabilization Program allocated funds to local governments with high rates of mortgage issues, with specific thresholds for direct allocation. NSP-2 funds were awarded competitively to various entities, including for-profit partners. On March 1, 2011, Representative Gary Miller introduced the Neighborhood Stabilization Termination Act, H.R. 861, to rescind $1 billion in NSP-3 funds. The House Financial Services Committee's Subcommittee on Insurance, Housing, and Community Opportunity held a hearing on NSP and federal foreclosure mitigation programs on March 2, 2011. On March 9, 2011, the committee considered and approved H.R. 861 during a markup session. On March 9, 2011, the House Financial Services Committee approved an amendment to H.R. 861 requiring HUD to publish a notice of termination of the NSP program on its website within five days of the bill's enactment. The notice directs citizens to contact their representatives and officials regarding foreclosure impacts on communities. Representative Miller sponsored H.R. 861 during the markup session. During a subcommittee hearing and markup session on March 2 and March 9, 2011, Representative Miller criticized the NSP-3 program as ineffective and a waste of taxpayers' dollars, arguing for its funding to be rescinded due to the need to reduce federal debt. Other Members defended the program, stating it has successfully helped communities combat the negative impacts of the mortgage foreclosure crisis. HUD's NSP program aims to combat the negative impacts of the mortgage foreclosure crisis by supporting communities and property values. Assistant Secretary M\u00e1rquez stated that NSP is expected to impact 100,000 properties, with 36,000 units already under construction. The program is estimated to support over 93,000 jobs nationwide and reduce the supply of abandoned and blighted housing. The NSP program aims to combat the mortgage foreclosure crisis by supporting communities and property values. It is estimated to impact 100,000 properties and support over 93,000 jobs nationwide. The House passed the measure on March 16, 2011."
