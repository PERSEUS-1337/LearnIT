The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) does not directly address identity theft but could assist victims in removing negative information from their credit files. $2,000,000 is allocated for the investigation and prosecution of identity theft and fraud cases for FY2005 and the following 4 fiscal years. The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) protects consumer rights regarding credit reports, ensuring accuracy and proper use of information. Consumers can take legal action for violations, including improper disclosure of information. The FCRA allows consumers to sue for violations, such as inaccurate information disclosed by credit reporting agencies. Victims of identity theft can also take legal action for agencies failing to verify information accurately. Consumers have up to two years after discovering a violation to file a lawsuit under the FCRA. The FACT Act, signed in 2003, amended the FCRA to allow consumers to file suit within two years of discovering a violation or five years of the violation occurring. This includes provisions to prevent identity theft and create a national standard for addressing consumer concerns. Credit card issuers are required to comply with these new provisions. Consumer concerns about identity theft and fraud are addressed by new provisions in the FCRA. Credit card issuers must follow specific procedures when a request for a new card is made shortly after a change of address. To prevent identity theft, credit card numbers on receipts are truncated, and social security numbers can be truncated on credit reports upon request by consumers who are victims or anticipate becoming victims of identity theft.

Additionally, victims can request information about the alleged crime from businesses upon verification of their identity. Business entities must provide victims of identity theft with copies of application and transaction records upon request and verification of identity. The Fair Credit Billing Act allows consumers to dispute unauthorized charges made by impostors.

The President's Identity Theft Task Force recommended a plan to crack down on criminals trafficking in stolen identities, protect personal information, assist law enforcement in prosecuting identity thieves, educate consumers and businesses on protection, and increase safeguards on personal data. The plan focuses on improving data security, making it harder for identity thieves to obtain consumer data, helping victims recover, and deterring theft through aggressive prosecution and punishment. The President's Identity Theft Task Force recommended closing gaps in federal criminal statutes to prosecute identity theft-related offenses more effectively. Recommendations include amending identity theft statutes to prosecute thieves targeting corporations, adding new crimes to aggravated identity theft offenses, and updating statutes on electronic theft. The recommendations from the President's Identity Theft Task Force include amending statutes to prosecute identity theft targeting corporations, adding new crimes to aggravated identity theft offenses, updating electronic theft laws, penalizing creators of malicious software, enhancing sentences for identity thieves affecting multiple victims, and implementing the REAL ID Act of 2005. The Real ID Act of 2005, implemented by the Department of Homeland Security, establishes standards for state-issued driver's licenses and identification cards to meet federal requirements. This includes incorporating specific information and security features, verifying the identity and legal status of applicants, and ensuring the source of documentation. The Real ID Act of 2005 sets standards for state-issued driver's licenses and identification cards, including security features, identity verification, and document source verification. States can request extensions until December 31, 2009, with the possibility of a second extension until May 10, 2011 for meeting security benchmarks. The Real ID Act of 2005 allows states to request extensions for compliance with security benchmarks until May 10, 2011. The rule mandates replacing non-compliant licenses with REAL ID cards by specific deadlines based on birth dates. Effective March 31, 2008."
