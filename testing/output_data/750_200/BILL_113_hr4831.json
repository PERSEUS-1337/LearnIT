Federal matching payments for state new manufacturing jobs training tax credits are provided. The Secretary of the Treasury will make quarterly payments to eligible community colleges based on new manufacturing job withholding matches for trainees. The withholding match is determined by amounts remitted by participating manufacturing employers. The term \"eligible community college\" refers to a public institution of higher education that primarily awards 2-year associate's degrees acceptable for credit towards a baccalaureate degree, located in a state with a new manufacturing jobs training tax credit program in effect. State new manufacturing jobs training tax credit program is a program established by a State government that provides incentives for eligible community colleges and manufacturing employers to sign contracts for training tax credits. The State new manufacturing jobs training tax credit program allows eligible community colleges and manufacturing employers to sign contracts for training tax credits. If an eligible community college and manufacturing employer sign a contract for an eligible trainee, State income taxes withheld by the employer on behalf of the trainee will be remitted to the college for qualified training costs. The eligible community college will receive remitted amounts as payment for education provided, and for State income tax liability purposes, the remitted amounts will be treated as payment of income taxes owed by the eligible trainee. A contract must meet specific requirements to qualify. A qualified contract between an eligible community college and a manufacturing employer in the same state must meet all state program requirements and ensure direct provision of training by the college to eligible trainees. The contract requires the eligible community college to provide qualified training to individuals designated by the employer, without charging tuition or fees. The employer must hire these individuals for full-time employment at a job site within the State. The employer must hire individuals for full-time employment at a State job site, paying them a wage of at least 175 percent of the Federal minimum wage or the State program amount. The employer will also remit State income taxes as per the program. The employer will remit State income taxes withheld on behalf of the individual to the community college for training costs specified in the contract. Qualified training will be provided to each individual, including all costs for equipment or instructional materials, and must be reasonable by market standards. Qualified training refers to education or training that equips individuals with the necessary skills for employment. The individual must have education, skills, license, or certification required for the job they will be employed in. The individual must have education, skills, license, or certification required for the job they will be employed in, aligned with industry standards determined by the State for new manufacturing jobs training tax credit program eligibility. To be eligible for the program, the employer must demonstrate that each trainee is hired for a new job, not a recalled, replacement, or existing job within the past year. The employer must show that each trainee is hired for a new job within the past year, not a job that previously existed in the employer's business or a similar one that was closed or reduced, resulting in a net increase in employment. Only U.S. employees are considered for this requirement. The employer must demonstrate that each trainee is hired for a new job within the last year, leading to a net increase in employment for the employer. Only U.S. employees at job sites in the United States are considered for this requirement. Aggregation rules apply for determining a single employer under specific sections of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. For the State new manufacturing jobs training tax credit program, employers and eligible community colleges can collaborate with local workforce investment boards to find individuals to hire and train. An eligible trainee is defined as an individual hired for a new job within the last year, leading to a net increase in employment for the employer. An eligible trainee is an individual who received qualified training through an eligible community college under a State new manufacturing jobs training tax credit program and is employed full-time by the employer who was part of the training contract. An eligible trainee must be employed by the employer who was part of the training contract at a job site in the same State as the community college, at a qualifying wage, in a job that meets specific requirements, and where qualified training is necessary. An eligible manufacturing employer must employ individuals in manufacturing, have facilities in the US, and be classified in sectors 31, 32, or 33 of the NAICS. Appropriations are made as necessary to implement this section. Appropriations are made from the Treasury as necessary to carry out the section regarding remission of State income tax withholdings for eligible manufacturing employers sending funds to community colleges. The section allows employers to remit State income tax withholdings to eligible community colleges for trainees, without it being treated as income for the trainee under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. For tax purposes, amounts remitted by employers for State income tax withholdings on behalf of eligible trainees are treated as income of the trainee under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. These amounts can be deducted as State income taxes paid by the trainee."
