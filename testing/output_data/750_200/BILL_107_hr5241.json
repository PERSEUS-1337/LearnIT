An estimated 165,000 children with disabilities live with foster care parents, while nearly 4,000,000 individuals with mental retardation or developmental disabilities live with their families. Additionally, almost 25% of the Nation's elders rely on others for help due to multiple chronic disabling conditions. Approximately 25% of the Nation's elders have multiple chronic disabling conditions, requiring assistance with daily living. Around 600,000 Americans die at home each year, relying on extensive family caregiving. 42% of individuals in the US needing daily assistance are under 65, and there are insufficient resources to replace family caregivers with paid workers, which would cost $200 billion annually. Approximately 75% of family caregivers are women, facing emotional, physical, and financial hardships. They often struggle to find information on available respite care, which is insufficient and mainly targets lower-income individuals.
