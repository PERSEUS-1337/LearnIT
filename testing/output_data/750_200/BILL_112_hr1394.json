    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Act of 2011\". It includes findings related to lung cancer. Congress finds that lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death, with 28% of all cancer deaths attributed to it. In 2010, there were 222,520 new cases and 157,300 deaths from lung cancer. Projections suggest a significant increase in lung cancer incidence by 2030, especially among women and men, as well as minority communities. Lung cancer incidence is projected to increase significantly by 2030, especially among women, men, and minority communities. It causes more deaths annually than colon, breast, prostate, and pancreatic cancers combined. The 5-year survival rate for lung cancer is only 15%, the lowest among major cancers, despite being the least funded in research dollars per death. In 2001, the Lung Cancer Progress Review Group of the National Cancer Institute highlighted the underfunding of lung cancer research compared to other major cancers, despite its significant health impact. They emphasized the need for an integrated multidisciplinary research program but no comprehensive plan has been developed. The President's National Cancer Advisory Board Report of 2010 identified radon as the second leading cause of lung cancer, along with 15 other environmental contaminants strongly associated with the disease. Hormonal and genetic factors may also play a role in the onset of lung cancer, which is the most stigmatized cancer and often blamed on patients regardless of smoking history. Lung cancer is highly stigmatized and often blamed on patients, even if they never smoked. Nearly 20% of lung cancer patients are non-smokers, and 60% are former smokers who quit long ago. It is the sixth leading cause of cancer death in non-smokers, with two-thirds of cases occurring in women. It is the leading cause of cancer death in the general population and across all major ethnic groups. (11) Lung cancer is the top cause of cancer death in various ethnic groups, with a higher impact on African-American males. (12) Military personnel and workers exposed to carcinogens have an increased risk of lung cancer. (13) Only 16 percent of lung cancer cases are diagnosed. Exposure to silica, arsenic, uranium, beryllium, and battlefield fuel emissions increases lung cancer risk. Early detection of lung cancer could save over 70,000 lives annually in the US. No targets for early detection or treatment were included in \"Healthy People 2010\" or \"Healthy People 2020\". A study published in Population Health Management Journal in 2009 found that early detection of lung cancer could save over 70,000 lives annually in the United States. A National Cancer Institute study in 2009 projected that the economic impact of lung cancer could exceed $433 billion by 2020, but a 4% annual decline in mortality could cut that amount in half. In 2010, the National Cancer Institute released initial results from the National Lung Screening Trial, a large-scale randomized national trial comparing the effects of different screening methods. The National Lung Screening Trial compared low-dose CT scans to standard chest x-rays for lung cancer screening, showing a 20% reduction in lung cancer deaths among CT scan participants. The Congress emphasizes the need for a national public health priority to reduce lung cancer mortality and calls for a comprehensive program coordinated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services to address all aspects of lung cancer among current smokers, former smokers, and non-smokers. Additionally, an amendment is proposed to the Public Health Service Act to establish a Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Program. The Congress calls for a Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Program under the Public Health Service Act to address all aspects of lung cancer among smokers and non-smokers. The Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Act of 2011 mandates the Secretary to implement a comprehensive program within 180 days in consultation with various health agencies and stakeholders. The Cancer Advisory Board, established under the Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Act of 2011, aims to reduce lung cancer mortality by 50% by 2020. The program includes strategic research grant prioritization by the National Cancer Institute and funding for the Airway. The lung cancer mortality reduction program aims to reduce lung cancer mortality by funding research programs on predispositions to lung cancer, interrelationships with other diseases, and diagnosis and treatment. The provision of funds to expedite the development of screening, diagnostic, surgical, treatment, and drug testing innovations to reduce lung cancer mortality through imaging as a biomarker. The National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering intervenes in lung cancer research. The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences receives funds for lung cancer research programs. The National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities collaborates on lung cancer prevention and management research. The National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, and the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities collaborate on lung cancer research and outreach programs. Funding is provided to the Food and Drug Administration to establish quality standards for facilities conducting computed tomography screening for lung cancer. The Lung Cancer Early Detection Program provides funds for facilities conducting computed tomography screening, revises standards for technological advances, and conducts annual surveys to review compliance and accuracy. The Lung Cancer Early Detection Program funds early detection services for high-risk populations and enables research on workplace contaminants associated with lung cancer. The Lung Cancer Early Detection Program funds services for high-risk populations and research on workplace contaminants linked to lung cancer. State plans under the National Comprehensive Cancer Control Program must include measures to reduce lung cancer risk and mortality. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality reviews early detection methods, diagnostic protocols, and treatment for lung cancer annually. The Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Program aims to address the burden of lung cancer on women, minorities, rural, and underserved populations through cooperation and coordination of various health programs within the Department of Health and Human Services. This includes ensuring updated guidelines for early detection, diagnostic protocols, and treatment methods, as well as tobacco control and cessation programs. The Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Program focuses on addressing lung cancer burden on women, minorities, rural, and underserved populations by coordinating tobacco control and cessation programs within the Department of Health and Human Services. The Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Program focuses on addressing lung cancer burden on specific populations by coordinating tobacco control programs within the Department of Health and Human Services. SEC. 5. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AND THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS. The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs will coordinate with the Secretary of Health and Human Services in developing and implementing programs for reducing lung cancer mortality among military personnel and veterans with increased risk due to smoking history and carcinogen exposure during active duty service. Increased risk for lung cancer among military personnel and veterans due to smoking history and carcinogen exposure during active duty service; implementing coordinated care programs for those diagnosed with lung cancer. The text chunk \"SEC. 6. LUNG CANCER SCREENING DEMONSTRATION PROJECT.\" is about a specific project related to lung cancer screening. (a) Sense of the Congress.--Congress believes a national computed tomography lung cancer screening demonstration project should be conducted quickly to assess public health infrastructure needs and develop an effective, safe, equitable, and efficient screening process.\n(b) Demonstration Project in General.--Within 1 year of enacting this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with other relevant agencies, must initiate the demonstration project. The Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with other relevant agencies, will establish a Lung Cancer Computed Tomography Screening and Treatment Demonstration Project. The Lung Cancer Computed Tomography Screening and Treatment Demonstration Project, also known as the demonstration project, aims to identify optimal risk populations for screening, develop effective and cost-efficient screening processes, ensure quality controls, and integrate health information technology for rapid learning. The Secretary will select various healthcare centers to carry out the Lung Cancer Computed Tomography Screening and Treatment Demonstration Project, which aims to integrate health information technology and rapid learning into the healthcare system. Quality standards and guidelines for licensing of tomography will be established. The Secretary will establish quality standards and guidelines for licensing facilities conducting computed tomography screening for lung cancer to ensure equipment and interpretation reliability. The Secretary will set standards for facilities conducting lung cancer screening scans to ensure equipment reliability and accuracy. The demonstration project will run for 5 years, with reports to Congress on costs and progress. SEC. 7. LUNG CANCER ADVISORY BOARD.
