The Congress recognizes the Department of Energy's unique mathematics and science capabilities that contribute to education. There is a need to enhance collaboration between the Department of Energy, other federal agencies, and the mathematics and science education community, which includes nationally recognized teachers. Elementary and secondary school mathematics and science teachers can provide insight into effective education programs. A pilot program has confirmed the effectiveness of outstanding teachers serving in professional staff capacities in the Senate and the House of Representatives. The Act establishes a national fellowship program for exceptional math and science teachers, known as \"Albert Einstein Fellows\". The Act defines key terms such as \"contractor\" as a nonprofit educational organization selected by the Secretary, \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of Energy, \"elementary school\" and \"local educational agency\" as per the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, and \"outstanding\" in relation to teachers. The term \"outstanding\" for elementary or secondary school mathematics or science teachers refers to those who have received national or state recognition comparable to prestigious awards like the Presidential Award for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching or have participated in programs like the Woodrow Wilson Fellowship. The term \"secondary school\" is defined as provided by section 1471(21) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. Teachers who have received national or state recognition comparable to prestigious awards or have taken a sabbatical leave to participate in the fellowship program are considered outstanding. The Fellowship Program is authorized under Section 5. The Albert Einstein Distinguished Educator Fellowship Program allows for 10 outstanding math or science teachers to receive fellowships each fiscal year, with the possibility of reducing the number of fellowships based on available funding. The Secretary may reduce the number of fellowships awarded if funding is insufficient, with priority given to selected individuals. The Secretary may award fellowships to 2 outstanding elementary or secondary school mathematics or science teachers in the Senate, 2 in the House of Representatives, and 1 each in the Department of Energy, Department of Education, National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation, and Office of Science and Technology Policy. The Albert Einstein Distinguished Educator Fellowship Program is administered by the Secretary through contracts with various agencies like the National Science Foundation, the Office of Science and Technology Policy, and NASA. Fellowships are awarded for 10 months to coincide with the academic year. The contractor is responsible for administering the Albert Einstein Distinguished Educator Fellowship Program, including developing and managing the application process and promoting the program to teachers in various recognition programs. The contractor is responsible for developing and administering the screening process for the Albert Einstein Fellowship Program to select outstanding math and science teachers. The contractor is responsible for developing and administering the screening process for the Albert Einstein Fellowship Program, including final selections, orientation, reporting, and evaluation of fellowship recipients. An annual report and evaluation must be submitted to the Secretary by August 31 each year.
