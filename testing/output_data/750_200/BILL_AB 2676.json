    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 17052.6 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to allow a credit against the \"net tax\" for expenses related to household and dependent care services necessary for gainful employment. The credit amount is determined based on the Internal Revenue Code, with a percentage of the allowable federal credit without considering federal tax liability. For taxable years before January 1, 2003, the percentage of the allowable federal credit is determined for household and dependent care services necessary for gainful employment. The federal credit percentage for adjusted gross income levels varies as follows:\n- $40,000 or less: 63%\n- Over $40,000 but not over $70,000: 53%\n- Over $70,000 but not over $100,000: 42%\n- Over $100,000: 0%\nFor taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2003, and before January 1, 2016, the percentages are:\n- $40,000 or less: 50%\n- Over $40,000 but not over $70,000: 43%\n- Over $70,000 but not over $100,000: 34%\n- Over $100,000: 0%\nFor taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, and before January 1, 2019, the percentages remain the same. For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2019, the federal credit percentage for adjusted gross income levels is as follows:\n- $40,000 or less: 65%\n- Over $40,000 but not over $70,000: 50%\n- Over $70,000 but not over $100,000: 34%\n- Over $100,000: 0% Adjusted gross income determines the percentage of credit: \n- $40,000 or less: 50%\n- Over $40,000 but not over $70,000: 43%\n- Over $70,000 but not over $100,000: 34%\n- Over $100,000: 0%\nAdjusted gross income is computed as per Section 17024.5. The credit is limited accordingly. The credit authorized by this section is limited to employment-related expenses for household and dependent care services necessary for gainful employment, earned income subject to tax under this part, and compensation received by members of the Armed Forces for active services. Compensation received by members of the Armed Forces for active services is considered earned income subject to tax, regardless of domicile. Additionally, a child, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code, is modified to meet age requirements. For tax purposes, a custodial parent is defined as the one providing over half of a child's support during the year. This designation allows the child to be considered a qualifying individual for tax benefits. The child must receive over half of their support from parents who never married and lived apart during the last six months of the year. The child must also be in the custody of one or both parents for more than half of the year. Amendments to this section apply to taxable years starting in 2002 and 2011. The amendments made to this section by Chapter 14 of the Statutes of 2011 apply to taxable years starting on or after January 1, 2011. This act provides for a tax levy and will take immediate effect."
