    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Local Energy Supply and Resiliency Act of 2013\". Congress finds that a significant amount of energy in the United States is released as waste heat from power plants, industrial facilities, and buildings. This waste heat can be recovered and used for building heating or industrial processes. The waste heat generated in the United States can be recovered and utilized for building heating, industrial process cooling, or electricity generation. Additionally, renewable energy resources can be harnessed to meet local thermal and electric energy needs, enhancing energy supply reliability and resiliency. Local energy infrastructure can enhance energy supply reliability and security in the United States by utilizing waste heat and renewable energy resources. This helps reduce reliance on fossil fuels, lowers air pollution and carbon dioxide emissions, and strengthens industrial competitiveness. District energy systems offer various benefits such as reducing air pollution and carbon dioxide emissions, increasing energy supply resiliency and security, and keeping energy dollars in local economies to create jobs. They also provide infrastructure for delivering thermal energy from combined heat and power systems to end users, tapping waste heat and renewable energy resources. District energy systems deliver thermal energy from a CHP system to end users, serving various facilities like colleges, hospitals, and downtown areas. They help reduce peak power demand, power transmission constraints, and meet air conditioning needs through thermal storage and CHP systems. District energy systems involve generating power near load centers with a CHP system and meeting air conditioning demand through chilled water delivery. Evaluation and implementation of these systems are complex and often require technical assistance to overcome barriers. The Act aims to promote the use of waste heat and renewable energy to reduce fossil fuel consumption, enhance energy supply resiliency, and reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Lack of capital funding is a major obstacle to implementing these initiatives. The Act aims to promote the use of waste heat and renewable energy to reduce fossil fuel consumption, enhance energy supply resiliency, reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, strengthen industrial competitiveness, and retain more energy dollars in local economies. It also aims to facilitate the implementation of local energy infrastructure through technical assistance for project evaluation, design, and development. The Act aims to promote local energy infrastructure by providing technical assistance for project evaluation, design, and development, as well as facilitating low-cost financing through loan guarantees. The Act aims to promote local energy infrastructure by providing technical assistance for project evaluation, design, and development, as well as facilitating low-cost financing through loan guarantees. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The Act aims to promote local energy infrastructure by providing technical assistance for project evaluation, design, and development, as well as facilitating low-cost financing through loan guarantees. The term \"combined heat and power system\" refers to generating electric energy and heat in a single system that meets efficiency criteria by recovering conventionally rejected heat. The term \"district energy system\" provides thermal energy to buildings from one or more plants for space heating and air conditioning. The term \"local energy infrastructure\" refers to a system that recovers or produces thermal or electric energy from waste or renewable resources. The term \"infrastructure\" refers to a system that recovers or produces useful thermal or electric energy from waste energy or renewable resources, generates electricity using combined heat and power systems, distributes electricity in microgrids, stores thermal energy, and distributes thermal energy via district energy systems. A microgrid is a group of interconnected loads and distributed energy resources that can operate independently or connect to the main grid. Renewable energy resources include biomass. Renewable energy resources include closed-loop and open-loop biomass, gaseous or liquid fuels from biomass, geothermal energy, municipal solid waste, and solar energy. The term \"renewable thermal energy\" refers to heating or cooling energy from renewable sources, natural cooling sources like cold lake or ocean water, or other renewable thermal energy sources as determined by the Secretary of Energy. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Energy. Thermal energy is heating or cooling energy used for various purposes. Waste energy is energy that is contained in certain sources. Waste energy refers to energy contained in various sources such as exhaust gases, hot liquids, or pressure drops in gas systems. The waste energy, which includes exhaust gases, hot liquids, and pressure drops in gas systems, is not being utilized in existing facilities or new facilities. The waste energy, including exhaust gases, hot liquids, and pressure drops in gas systems, is not being utilized in existing or new facilities if it is not conventionally used in comparable systems. The technical assistance program outlined in Section 4 aims to utilize waste energy in facilities that is not conventionally used in comparable systems. The Secretary will establish a program to provide technical assistance to help eligible entities identify opportunities for using waste or renewable energy resources in local energy infrastructure. The program will provide technical assistance for identifying opportunities to use waste or renewable energy resources, including assessment, utility interconnection, negotiation of contracts, permitting, marketing, business planning, financial analysis, and engineering design. Information dissemination will be included in the program. The program offers technical assistance for utilizing waste or renewable energy resources, including engineering design and information dissemination. Nonprofit or for-profit entities are eligible for assistance, and eligible costs can be covered upon application. The program provides grants to eligible entities to cover costs such as initial assessments, feasibility studies, and guidance on overcoming barriers to implementing local energy infrastructure. The program offers grants to eligible entities for overcoming barriers in implementing local energy infrastructure, including financial, contracting, siting, and permitting issues. Applicants must submit an application to the Secretary for technical assistance. The Secretary seeks applications for technical assistance on a competitive and periodic basis. Priority is given to projects that maximize fossil fuel elimination and enhance energy infrastructure resilience to extreme weather events and power grid failures. The Secretary seeks applications for technical assistance to enhance energy infrastructure resilience to extreme weather events, power grid failures, and fossil fuel elimination. The program aims to minimize environmental impact, promote renewable energy resources, increase industrial competitiveness, and create local jobs. Rules and procedures for program administration must be adopted within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The Secretary will adopt rules and procedures for the program established under this section within 180 days of the Act's enactment. $150,000,000 is authorized to be appropriated for fiscal years 2014 through 2018 for this program. SEC. 5. LOAN GUARANTEES FOR LOCAL ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE. This section introduces the Local Energy Infrastructure Loan Guarantee Program under Title XVII of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The Secretary may provide loan guarantees for commercial or innovative projects defined as 'local energy infrastructure' under the Local Energy Supply and Resiliency Act of 2013. $4 billion of loan guarantee authority under section 1703 is reserved for this purpose, and unobligated funds from section 1703 may be used for loan guarantees under this section. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 allows for loan guarantees under section 1703 for local energy infrastructure projects. $4 billion is reserved for this purpose, and unobligated funds from section 1703 can be used for these guarantees. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 allows for loan guarantees for local energy infrastructure projects under section 1703. Section 103(16) of the Community Development Banking and Financial Institutions Act of 1994 is amended to include local energy infrastructure as defined in the Local Energy Supply and Resiliency Act of 2013."
