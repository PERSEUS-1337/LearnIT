    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 7522.02 of the Government Code is amended. On January 1, 2013, this article applies to all state and local public retirement systems and their participating employers, including various specific systems and individual retirement plans offered by public employers. This article applies to state and local public retirement systems, including individual retirement plans offered by public employers, subject to the Internal Revenue Code and California Constitution. Compliance with relevant tax laws is required for administration. The article applies to state and local public retirement systems, including individual retirement plans offered by public employers, subject to tax laws and the California Constitution. However, certain entities exempted by specific sections of the California Constitution are not affected by this article if they are still participating employers in a state-governed retirement system. Any retirement plan approved before January 1, 2013, by voters of excluded entities remains unaffected. The article applies to state and local public retirement systems, including individual retirement plans offered by public employers, subject to tax laws and the California Constitution. However, certain entities exempted by specific sections of the California Constitution are not affected by this article if they are still participating employers in a state-governed retirement system. Any retirement plan approved before January 1, 2013, by voters of excluded entities remains unaffected. Notwithstanding paragraph (1), this article shall not apply to a public employee whose interests are protected under Section 5333(b) of Title 49 of the United States Code until a federal district court rules that the United States Secretary of Labor, or his or her designee, erred in determining that the application of this article precludes certification under that section, or until January 1, 2016, whichever is sooner. If a federal district court upholds the Secretary of Labor's determination that this article prevents certification under Section 5333(b) of Title 49, it won't apply to certain public employees. Additionally, the article won't apply to a multiemployer plan regulated by ERISA if the public employer joined before January 1, 2013. The benefit plan under this article applies to new public employees as defined in Section 7522.04. Individuals who switched public employers after January 1, 2013, will be under the retirement plan of the subsequent employer if they had concurrent membership or reciprocity within the previous six months. An individual who changed employment positions before January 1, 2013, and switched to a different defined benefit plan in another public retirement system offered by the employer will be subject to that plan as if they were first employed before December 31, 2012. If a public employer offers a defined benefit pension plan with a lower benefit factor before January 1, 2013, they can continue to offer that plan instead of the required one after that date. If they adopt a new plan on or after January 1, 2013, it must meet the requirements of the article or be certified by the retirement system's chief. New members of the defined benefit plan may only participate in the lower cost defined benefit formula that was in place before January 1, 2013, or a formula that meets the requirements of this article and is approved by the Legislature. If a public employer offers a retirement benefit plan consisting solely of a defined contribution plan before January 1, 2013, they may continue to do so instead of the defined benefit pension plan required by this article. However, if the employer adopts a new defined benefit pension plan or formula on or after January 1, 2013, it must meet the requirements of this article or be certified by the retirement system's chief actuary and board to have no greater risk or cost than the required formula, and approved by the Legislature. The employer's retirement benefit plan must have no greater risk or cost than the defined benefit formula required by the Legislature. New members can only join a defined contribution plan that meets the article's requirements. Employers can offer a defined contribution plan with or without a defined benefit plan after January 1, 2013. If the Cities of Brea and Fullerton form a joint powers authority after January 1, 2013, they may provide employees with the same defined benefit plan they had before joining the authority. This applies to employees from the City of Brea, City of Fullerton, or other specified cities who are not new members and are hired by the joint powers authority within 180 days of the common power being exercised. Employees from specified cities who are not new members and are hired by a joint powers authority within 180 days of a common power being exercised. On or before January 1, 2017, a city in Orange County contiguous to Brea or Fullerton may join the joint powers authority, with a limit of three cities. New members joining after January 1, 2013, must adhere to the requirements of the article for their defined benefit plan. The Judges\u2019 Retirement System and Judges\u2019 Retirement System II are exempt from certain defined benefit formula and compensation limitations. This article does not grant membership in a public retirement system to those ineligible under its rules. Public retirement systems must comply with the article's requirements by January 1, 2013."
