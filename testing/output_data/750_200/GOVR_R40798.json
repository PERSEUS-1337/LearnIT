The labor force includes employed and unemployed individuals in the civilian noninstitutional population age 16 and older. Unemployment refers to people actively searching for work in the four weeks before the Current Population Survey. The unemployment rate is calculated mathematically. The unemployment rate is determined by the Census Bureau through the Current Population Survey. It can fluctuate based on changes in the number of jobless workers and the size of the labor force. During a recession, the labor force may shrink as discouraged workers stop looking for jobs, while it may grow if people perceive economic improvement. During a recession, the unemployment rate can rise even when the economy shows signs of improvement. This is because discouraged workers may reenter the labor force, but if hiring doesn't keep up, the unemployment rate will increase. Firms are cautious about hiring until they are confident in sustained economic growth. During a recession, firms are cautious about hiring until they are confident in sustained economic growth. Job growth may not occur immediately upon the economy showing signs of a turnaround. Labor market analysts generally utilize the Current Employment data for job information. The Current Employment Statistics program is a key source of job data used by labor market analysts. It surveys nonfarm employers monthly to gather information on the number of jobs. This data is considered more accurate than the Current Population Survey for employment trends. The Business Cycle Dating Committee relies on changes in national output and employment trends for their analysis. The Business Cycle Dating Committee uses national output and employment trends to determine recessions. The U.S. economy has had 10 recessions since World War II, with varying severity in GDP decline and duration. Unemployment rates continued to rise during and after each recession, peaking at the bottom of the business cycle in some instances. The unemployment rate peaked at the bottom of the business cycle in three instances: 7.9% in October 1949, 7.8% in July 1980, and 10.8% in November 1982. In the remaining seven recessions, the rate peaked after they had ended, with some instances of climbing for a few months into the economic recovery. The unemployment rate peaked at the bottom of the business cycle in three instances: October 1949, July 1980, and November 1982. In the remaining seven recessions, the rate peaked after they had ended, with some instances of climbing for a few months into the economic recovery. The unemployment rate did not peak until well into the economic recovery in three instances, rising for nine months after one recession, 15 months after another, and 18 months after the third. Job growth failed to ensue until after the end of all 10 recessions. After the end of all 10 recessions, sustained job growth did not occur immediately. In most cases, the number of jobs fluctuated for months before steady growth began within three to five months of the start of the recovery. However, in some instances, like the July 1990-March 1991 recession, job growth did not commence until 12 months after the recession ended. The delayed improvement in the labor market following the 1990-1991 and 2001 recessions led to jobless recoveries, with employment failing to show consistent improvement for well over a year. Many observers believe the nation is experiencing another jobless recovery, despite private sector employment starting to rise in January 2010. The economy has been experiencing another jobless recovery, with private sector employment starting to rise in January 2010, but overall job growth has been dampened by fiscal problems in local governments."
