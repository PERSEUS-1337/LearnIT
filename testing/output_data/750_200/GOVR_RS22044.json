    "content": "The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) provides federal funding to states for education of children with disabilities, requiring states to offer a free, appropriate public education (FAPE) to all such children. Prior to P.L. 105-17 in 1997, states had to ensure participation of children with disabilities in private schools. Prior to P.L. 105-17 in 1997, states had to ensure that children with disabilities enrolled in private schools received equitable participation in program benefits comparable to those provided to public school students. The vague statute led to differences among states, localities, and courts. The IDEA Amendments of 1997 addressed the disparities among states and courts regarding services for children with disabilities in private schools. The previous \"equitable participation\" standard was rejected in favor of a new approach. The IDEA Amendments of 1997 replaced the \"equitable participation\" standard with a new approach for providing special education and related services to children with disabilities in private schools. This new approach ensured that children with disabilities enrolled in private schools received appropriate services funded by federal funds under Part B of IDEA. The IDEA Amendments of 1997 replaced the \"equitable participation\" standard with a new approach for providing special education services to children with disabilities in private schools. These services could be provided on the premises of private schools, including parochial schools, and the statutory provisions relating to \"child find\" were applicable to children enrolled in private schools. The 2004 reauthorization further clarified the responsibilities of local educational agencies to ensure fair and equitable services for these children. The Senate and House reports highlight changes in the responsibilities of local educational agencies to ensure fair and equitable services for children with disabilities in private schools. These changes aim to clarify existing policies and address contentious issues. The Committee emphasizes changes in responsibilities of local educational agencies regarding children with disabilities in private schools. A child with a disability can be placed in a private school by the LEA or SEA to meet FAPE requirements, with costs covered by the LEA. Parents can unilaterally place their child in a private school, with costs not covered by the LEA unless certain findings are made. IDEA mandates services for children in private schools. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA includes changes to provisions for children placed in private schools by parents, with services required even if not paid for by the LEA. Children with disabilities in private schools are entitled to special education services consistent with the district's offerings. Children in private schools are entitled to special education services consistent with the district's offerings, with specific requirements for parentally placed children. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA added a provision that children must be located in the school district served by the LEA to protect LEAs from working with private schools across district lines. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA added a provision to protect LEAs from working with private schools across district lines, generating controversy due to its disproportional effect on LEAs with large concentrations of private schools and potential conflicts with state laws. There are five requirements for children parentally placed in private schools. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA added a provision to ensure equal funding for parentally placed private school children, emphasizing direct services over indirect services. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA emphasizes direct services for parentally placed private school children, focusing on instructional activities and related services rather than professional development. A new provision requires thorough child find process to determine the proportionate amount for children with disabilities in private schools. The final regulations under the 2004 reauthorization of IDEA emphasize direct services for parentally placed private school children, including a discussion on proportionate share calculation. The new law allows services to be provided on the premises of private, including religious schools. A provision on supplementing funds, not supplanting them, is added, requiring state and local funds to supplement federal funds for children with disabilities. LEAs must maintain records and report the number of children evaluated to the SEA. The new law emphasizes direct services for parentally placed private school children, including on-site services at private, religious schools. LEAs must supplement federal funds for children with disabilities and maintain records of evaluations and services provided. The requirement for finding children with disabilities remains the same as in previous laws. The new law emphasizes direct services for parentally placed private school children with disabilities, including on-site services at religious schools. Provisions are added for equitable participation, activities, cost, and completion period. Child find is designed to ensure accurate count and participation of private school children with disabilities, with costs not factored into spending obligations. The new law emphasizes direct services for parentally placed private school children with disabilities, including on-site services at religious schools. Provisions are added for equitable participation, activities, cost, and completion period. Child find activities for parentally placed private school children with disabilities must be completed in a comparable time period to public school students. LEAs must consult with private school officials and parents to determine the proportionate amount of federal funds available for serving parentally placed private school children with disabilities. The new law emphasizes direct services for parentally placed private school children with disabilities, including on-site services at religious schools. Provisions are added for equitable participation, consultation process among LEA, private school officials, and parents, determination of federal funds, and provision of special education services. The new law emphasizes direct services for parentally placed private school children with disabilities, including on-site services at religious schools. Provisions are added for equitable participation, consultation process among LEA, private school officials, and parents, determination of federal funds, and provision of special education services. Services for private school children with disabilities will be provided, with details on types of services, apportionment of funds, decision-making process, and written explanations if services are not provided. The consultation procedure is similar to that in the No Child Left Behind Act. The new law requires a written affirmation of consultation signed by private school representatives. If representatives do not sign, the LEA must forward documentation to the SEA. Private school officials can submit complaints to the SEA if they feel consultation was not meaningful or timely. Compliance procedures are also added by P.L. 108-446. Private school officials have the right to submit complaints to the SEA if they believe the LEA did not consult meaningfully or consider their views. If dissatisfied with the SEA's decision, they can escalate the complaint to the Secretary of Education. The 2004 reauthorization includes a specific section on providing equitable services. The 2004 reauthorization includes a specific subsection on providing equitable services for pupils attending private schools. Services must be secular, neutral, and nonideological, and funds for these services are controlled and administered by a public agency. The new law specifies that the cost of reimbursement for a child unilaterally placed in a private school by parents cannot be reduced or denied for failure to provide notice if the school prevented the parent from doing so. The new law states that reimbursement cannot be reduced or denied if the school prevented the parent from providing notice, the parents were not informed of the notice requirement, or compliance would likely harm the child. It also includes provisions for illiterate parents and serious emotional harm. The law states that reimbursement cannot be reduced or denied if the parent is illiterate or compliance with the notice requirement would likely harm the child. The issue of private school reimbursement for parents of a child with a disability who never received special education services from the school district is not addressed in the statute. In a recent Supreme Court decision, it was ruled that parents of a child with a disability are entitled to private school reimbursement. In a recent Supreme Court case, the Court upheld that parents of a child with a disability are entitled to private school reimbursement, even if the student never received special education services from the school district. This decision does not set a precedent for lower courts, and the issue remains unsettled."
