    "content": "The Act titled \"Cord Blood Education and Awareness Act of 2009\" includes sections on public education campaigns, patient informed consent, professional education, targeted education grants, and authorization of appropriations. Section 2 outlines the findings of the Act. Congress finds that leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma are responsible for a significant number of deaths in the United States, especially among children and young adults. Up to 16,000 leukemia patients annually require a bone marrow transplant but lack a suitable donor. Umbilical cord blood stem cells have been effectively used in treating various blood diseases, with a 1 in 4 chance of a newborn baby's cord blood cells being a perfect match for a sibling in need. Over the last 20 years, more than 14,000 transplants worldwide have utilized cord blood cells, which are rich in stem cells like marrow and blood. Cord blood cells have been used in over 14,000 transplants worldwide in the last 20 years. They are a rich source of stem cells for transplantation, especially for children, with lower rates of graft versus host disease compared to bone marrow. Cord blood cells have also been effective in treating nonmalignant blood, immune, and metabolic disorders. Cord blood cells contain various types of stem cells that can differentiate into different cell types in the body, including those for bones, heart, liver, and nervous system. They have been shown to reduce inflammation and promote tissue repair, making them valuable for treating various disorders such as aplastic anemia, sickle cell anemia, severe combined immunodeficiencies, and leukodystrophies. Clinical research and experimental use of autologous cord blood cells is ongoing to treat type 1 diabetes, brain injury, and cerebral palsy. Preclinical studies show promise in treating hearing loss, renal failure, spinal cord injury, and congenital heart valve defects. Over 90% of cord blood cells from more than 4,000,000 births in the US each year are available for potential use. In 2005, the Institute of Medicine recommended that donors be provided clear information about their options for cord blood banking. Less than one quarter of states require expectant parents to receive information about banking cord blood in public or private banks. The Institute of Medicine recommended that donors be provided with clear information about their options for cord blood banking, including a balanced perspective on different banking options. Informed consent should be obtained before labor and delivery, after adequate disclosure of information. The public education campaign is outlined in Section 3. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will develop a publication on umbilical cord blood within a year of this Act. It will explain the value and uses of cord blood for individuals, regardless of biological relation, and discuss the differences in using cord blood. The publication on umbilical cord blood will explain the differences between using one's own cord blood cells and related or unrelated cord blood stem cells in disease treatment, as well as public and private cord blood banking options for mothers. The options for handling umbilical cord blood after delivery include donating to a public bank, storing in a private family bank, storing for family members in need, or discarding. The medical processes involved in collecting cord blood, criteria impacting family consideration of umbilical cord blood banking, options for ownership and future use of donated cord blood, and the average cost of public and private cord blood banking. Options for ownership and future use of donated umbilical cord blood, average cost of public and private cord blood banking, availability of public and private cord blood banks in the US, accredited private cord blood banks, availability of free family banking and sibling donor programs for medical needs. The curr_chunk discusses the availability of free family banking and sibling donor programs for medical needs. It also mentions the specific racial and ethnic groups in need of publicly donated cord blood samples based on medical data. SEC. 4. PATIENT INFORMED CONSENT DOCUMENT. The Secretary must develop a patient informed consent document regarding cord blood disposition within a year of this Act's enactment. The document will include information on cord blood banking options and the medical value of cord blood stem cells in disease treatment. The patient informed consent document will include information on cord blood banking options, the medical value of cord blood stem cells in disease treatment, and a declaration of a woman's chosen option for the disposition of a child's cord blood stem cells. SEC. 5. Duty of certain professionals to disclose information and obtain informed consent from pregnant patients. Effective 1 year after the enactment of this Act, healthcare professionals providing prenatal care must disclose information about umbilical cord blood banking to pregnant women before the third trimester or at the first visit. This information should be provided at least 2 weeks before the woman's estimated due date. Healthcare professionals must disclose information about umbilical cord blood banking to pregnant women before the third trimester or at the first visit. Written informed consent regarding disposition of cord blood stem cells must be obtained not later than 2 weeks before the woman's estimated due date. Medicaid regulations are amended to accommodate these requirements. The Social Security Act is amended to require healthcare professionals providing ambulatory prenatal care to pregnant women to disclose information about umbilical cord blood banking and obtain written informed consent before the woman's estimated due date. Healthcare professionals providing ambulatory prenatal care to pregnant women must comply with requirements for furnishing care and enforcement methods. If a State fails to comply, the Secretary may intervene. The Secretary may reduce payments to a State if it fails to comply with informing pregnant women about blood cord banking. This applies to both Medicaid and CHIP programs. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 is amended to include informing pregnant women about blood cord banking in employer group health plans. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 is amended to include informing pregnant women about blood cord banking in employer group health plans. A group health plan providing benefits for prenatal care must require healthcare professionals to comply with the requirements for informing pregnant women about blood cord banking. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 is amended to include informing pregnant women about blood cord banking in employer group health plans. Healthcare professionals must comply with the requirements for informing pregnant women about blood cord banking. The amendments apply to agreements and arrangements entered into or renewed on or after the enactment of this Act. The Secretary will create educational materials on umbilical cord blood stem cells for healthcare providers offering prenatal services. Additionally, targeted education grants will be provided. The Secretary may grant funds for targeted education on umbilical cord blood stem cells, focusing on current and accurate information and banking options. Targeted groups include healthcare providers, ethnic minorities, families with genetic disease history, and populations affected by specific conditions. Targeted groups for education on cord blood stem cells include families with genetic disease history and populations affected by specific conditions. Authorization of appropriations for carrying out the Act: $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2010 and $5,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2011 to 2014."
