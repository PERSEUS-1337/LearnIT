    "content": "The 112th Congress used TPA authority to pass implementing bills for U.S. FTAs with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea in 2011. Other trade negotiations that may require TPA include the Doha Development Round, TPP, TTIP, and TISA. Congress has granted the President TPA/fast track authority for over 40 years. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) and the Trade in Services Agreement (TISA) are trade agreements that Congress has granted the President fast track authority for over 40 years. This authority allows Congress to consider implementing legislation quickly and vote on it without amendment, as long as certain negotiating objectives and consultation requirements are met. TPA balances Congress's constitutional authority over trade policy with giving the President negotiating leverage. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) and the Trade in Services Agreement (TISA) are trade agreements that Congress has granted the President fast track authority for over 40 years. This authority allows Congress to consider implementing legislation quickly and vote on it without amendment, as long as certain negotiating objectives and consultation requirements are met. TPA balances Congress's constitutional authority over trade policy with giving the President negotiating leverage. The expiration of TPA raises questions about its renewal and the evolving nature of trade negotiations. The expiration of TPA raises questions about its renewal and the evolving nature of trade negotiations, which have become more partisan in Congress. The debate surrounding TPA renewal involves the constitutional powers of Congress and the President, as well as the need for cooperative flexibility in negotiating trade agreements. The partnership between Congress and the executive branch on trade policymaking can be strengthened or strained. The evolution of Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) shows that the partnership between Congress and the President on trade policymaking can be strengthened or strained. The U.S. Constitution gives Congress authority over foreign trade regulation, while the President has exclusive authority to negotiate trade agreements. The Constitution assigns no specific responsibility for trade to the President, but grants exclusive authority to negotiate treaties. Congress historically set tariff rates for foreign trade, with tariffs being the main trade policy instrument and revenue source. During the early period, tariff rates on imported products were set as the main trade policy and revenue source. Congressional debates often revolved around protectionist tariffs favored by northern manufacturing regions versus low tariffs advocated by southern commodity exporting regions. The President's role in trade policy involved negotiating bilateral treaties for friendship, commerce, and navigation, including commitments to most-favored-nation treatment. In the 1930s, the \"Smoot-Hawley\" Tariff Act drastically changed U.S. trade policy by imposing high tariff rates in response to the Great Depression. This led to retaliatory tariffs from major trade partners, severely restricting trade and worsening the effects of the depression. The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act in the 1930s led to retaliatory tariffs by major U.S. trade partners, worsening the effects of the depression. In response, Congress enacted the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934 (RTAA), allowing the President to enter into trade agreements reducing tariffs within pre-approved levels. The Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934 (RTAA) authorized the President to implement reduced tariffs on an MFN basis without additional legislation. Congress delegated expanded trade agreements authority to the President to lessen political pressure from special interests. The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act was the last general tariff legislation passed by Congress, now only applied to imports from a few countries like Cuba. The Tariff Act, the last general tariff legislation passed by Congress, now only applies to imports from Cuba and North Korea without MFN status. Congress delegated tariff-cutting authority to the President but retained broader trade authority, subjecting trade agreements to periodic review and renewal. Presidential reciprocal trade agreements authority for tariff reductions was renewed 11 times until 1962. Under the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, Congress granted the President authority for five years to enter into agreements that negotiated the reduction or elimination of tariffs, shifting trade negotiations from bilateral to multilateral forums. Under the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, Congress granted the President authority to negotiate tariff reduction agreements for five years. This act expanded Congress's role in the negotiating process by requiring the President to submit each concluded agreement for congressional review. The GATT Kennedy Round (1963-1967) was the last round focused on tariff reduction, and the act allowed the President to conclude it. During the GATT Kennedy Round, member countries reached agreements on nontariff barriers, including customs valuation and antidumping practices. These agreements would have required changes in U.S. laws beyond tariff modifications. During the GATT Kennedy Round, member countries reached agreements on nontariff barriers, including customs valuation and antidumping practices. Congress opposed U.S. adherence to these agreements, leading to the creation of fast track authority for trade agreements. The Kennedy Round highlighted the increasing importance of addressing nontariff barrier rules in future trade negotiations. The Kennedy Round highlighted the need for changes in nontariff barrier rules in future trade agreements, leading to the creation of fast track authority for trade agreements. Concern over presidential encroachment on legislative authority prompted Congress to seek a legislative remedy, resulting in the expiration of tariff modification authority in 1967. The Nixon Administration sought new negotiating authority for the Tokyo Round in the GATT, which Congress granted in the Trade Act. The Nixon Administration sought new negotiating authority for the Tokyo Round in the GATT, which Congress granted in the Trade Act of 1974 (P.L. 93-618). The act provided the President with the authority to enter into trade agreements that reduced or eliminated tariffs within certain parameters. Implementing legislation was required for agreements that required changes in U.S. law beyond tariff modifications. The Trade Act of 1974 granted the President authority to enter trade agreements, but implementing legislation was needed for agreements requiring changes beyond tariff modifications. Some in Congress argued that subjecting implementing legislation to debate and amendment procedures would defeat the purpose of delegating trade authority to the President. U.S. trading partners might be reluctant to negotiate agreements subject to unlimited congressional debate and amendment. The Trade Act of 1974 granted the President authority to enter trade agreements, but implementing legislation was needed for agreements requiring changes beyond tariff modifications. Some argued that subjecting implementing legislation to debate and amendment procedures would defeat the purpose of delegating trade authority to the President. U.S. trading partners might be reluctant to negotiate agreements subject to unlimited congressional debate and amendment. As a solution, Congress agreed that each chamber would suspend its ordinary legislative procedures and give negotiated agreements an up-or-down vote. The Trade Act of 1974 allowed the President to enter trade agreements, but implementing legislation was required for agreements needing more than tariff changes. Congress agreed to expedite the consideration of trade agreements by suspending normal legislative procedures, limiting debate and amendments, and requiring consultation with relevant committees. Congress also accredited 10 Members as advisers to the U.S. negotiators. The Trade Act of 1974 allowed the President to enter trade agreements, with provisions for 10 Members of Congress as advisers to the U.S. negotiators. This established \"fast track\" trade negotiating authority, leading to agreements on NTBs during the Tokyo Round of the GATT. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 was the first trade implementing bill passed by Congress under expanded trade agreements authority and expedited procedures. The legislative procedures established in 1974 have not changed and are ensconced in Sections 151-154 of the Trade Act of 1974. Congress has revised these provisions over the years, although they are subject to time limits. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 granted \"fast track trade negotiating authority\" and the ability to enact tariff modifications, subject to time limits. Congress extended the presidential authority to proclaim tariff modifications until January 2, 1982, and extended the authority to enter into agreements until January 2, 1988. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 extended presidential authority to enter into agreements on nontariff barriers until January 2, 1988, without extending tariff modification authority. This act allowed for negotiation and implementation of bilateral free trade agreements, considering the U.S.-Israel and U.S.-Canada FTAs. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 extended presidential authority to address nontariff barriers and negotiate bilateral free trade agreements, including the U.S.-Israel and U.S.-Canada FTAs. The legislation waived the 90-day notification requirement for the U.S.-Israel FTA but required notification to Congress 60 days prior to negotiations with other countries. Expedited procedures could be denied if either House Ways and Means or Senate Finance Committees disapproved within 60 days. Tariff modifications beyond a certain threshold had to be subject to approval. The OTCA extended the President's authority to enter into trade agreements before June 1, 1993, with expedited procedures only for agreements before June 1, 1991. Agreements after that date but before June 1, 1993, could be approved under expedited procedures if the President requested an extension and it was not disapproved. The OTCA allowed the President to enter trade agreements with expedited procedures before June 1, 1993. Agreements after that date but before June 1, 1993, could be approved under expedited procedures if the President requested an extension and it was not disapproved by Congress. Congress could also withhold a trade agreement from fast track consideration if the USTR failed to consult adequately. Under the OTCA provisions, Congress expanded trade negotiation objectives and passed implementing legislation for NAFTA in 1993. Congress extended authority for the Uruguay Round with H.R. 1876, signed into law in July 1993, until April 16, 1994. The extension had strong congressional support in both the House (295-126) and the Senate (76-16). The fast track authority for trade agreements was extended until April 16, 1994, with strong congressional support in both the House (295-126) and the Senate (76-16). This extension did not change any other aspects of the fast track authority. Congress did not approve new authority until the Trade Act of 2002 (H.R. 3009; P.L. 107-210) after the expiration in 1994, marking the longest hiatus since its initial approval in 1974. In 1997, legislation to renew fast track was reported out by both the Senate Finance and House Ways and Means Committees but was pulled before a floor vote due to lack of support. In September 1998, the House failed to pass legislation renewing fast track authority due to disagreements over negotiating objectives for labor and environmental issues. Republicans and the Clinton Administration could not agree on the scope of coverage for these issues. The House failed to pass legislation renewing fast track authority in September 1998 due to disagreements over negotiating objectives for labor and environmental issues. Republicans wanted more limited coverage than Democrats and the WTO did not launch new negotiations in 1999. President George W. Bush requested renewal of fast track authority in 2001, renaming it as \"trade promotion authority (TPA)\" to counter negative connotations. The renewed fast track authority, renamed as trade promotion authority (TPA) by George W. Bush, was included in the Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002. It maintained the structure of previous trade agreements authority and added new language for labor and environmental provisions. Labor groups and many Members of Congress were concerned about the lack of enforceable labor standards in trade agreements. The Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002, renamed TPA by George W. Bush, defined principal negotiating objectives but did not require enforceable labor standards in trade agreements. It established the Congressional Oversight Group for consultation and passed in the House by a narrow margin. The House version of the BPTA (H.R. 3005) passed by one vote (215-214) along party lines, with Republicans supporting and Democrats opposing. The legislation was combined in the Senate with other trade acts and passed 66 to 30. The final bill, H.R. 3009, the Trade Act of 2002, was adopted by both the House (215-212) and Senate (64-34), approving implementing legislation for various Free Trade Agreement countries. The proposed BCTPA legislation, modeled on the Bipartisan Comprehensive Trade Priorities Act of 2014, was introduced for Free Trade Agreement countries including Chile, Singapore, Australia, Morocco, the Dominican Republic, Central American countries, Bahrain, Oman, Peru, Colombia, Panama, and South Korea. Reported by the Senate Finance Committee and House Ways and Means Committee in April 2015. The legislation, known as TPA-2015, was reported by the Senate Finance Committee and House Ways and Means Committee in April 2015. It contains updated negotiating objectives on various trade aspects and passed on May 22 by a vote of 62-37. The TPA-2015 legislation contains updated negotiating objectives on trade aspects such as goods, services, agriculture, intellectual property rights, regulatory practices, and digital trade. It also includes provisions on labor, environment, currency manipulation, localization, state-owned enterprises, and human rights. If enacted, TPA-2015 will expire on July 1, 2021, unless an extension disapproval resolution is passed by July 1, 2018. The TPA-2015 legislation includes updated negotiating objectives on trade aspects like goods, services, agriculture, intellectual property rights, and digital trade. It also covers provisions on labor, environment, currency manipulation, and human rights. It may be used to consider agreements from negotiations like TPP, T-TIP, TISA, and EGA. The TPA-2015 legislation aims to reduce trade barriers at the WTO to promote the environment and support trade negotiations by defining policy priorities and ensuring adherence to objectives through consultation with Congress. The TPA-2015 legislation aims to ensure the executive branch adheres to objectives by requiring consultation with Congress and defining terms for trade agreements. It also reaffirms Congress's authority over trade agreements. The Trade Act of 1974 established \"fast track trade negotiating authority\" to tighten Congress's control over trade agreements negotiation and implementation, especially for agreements involving nontariff barriers (NTBs). This process changed from presidential proclamation to requiring congressional approval for agreements that required changes to domestic law. The Trade Act of 1974 established \"fast track trade negotiating authority\" for agreements involving nontariff barriers (NTBs). TPA includes expedited procedures for moving trade implementing legislation through Congress, available only for qualifying trade implementing bills under Section 2103 of the Trade Act of 2002. The expedited procedures for trade implementing bills under TPA require meeting certain conditions, including progress in meeting negotiating objectives and approval of the agreement and administrative action. Congress has specified that the bill must only contain necessary changes to implement the agreement. Congress has expedited procedures for trade implementing bills under TPA, allowing for necessary changes to implement trade agreements. This conveys a congressional priority in controlling approval and implementation. The President is granted authority to proclaim the agreement into force after ensuring partner countries have taken required measures. The Trade Act of 2002 grants Congress the authority to allow the President to proclaim trade agreements into force after ensuring partner countries comply with the agreement's provisions. The process includes notifying Congress 90 days before signing the agreement and allowing for a 60-day review period. The Trade Act of 2002 grants Congress the authority to allow the President to proclaim trade agreements into force after ensuring partner countries comply with the agreement's provisions. This process includes providing opportunity for congressional review before the agreement is signed, notifying Congress of required changes to U.S. law within 60 days of signing, and transmitting the final legal text of the trade agreement to Congress after it is entered into. The Trade Act of 2002 allows Congress to approve trade agreements by following specific procedures, including submitting an implementing bill, a statement of administrative action, and supporting statements. If Congress is satisfied with the requirements, expedited legislative procedures are followed for the implementing bill to become law. The Trade Act of 2002 allows Congress to approve trade agreements through expedited legislative procedures, requiring immediate action on the bill sent by the White House. Key rules include mandatory introduction in both houses, automatic discharge from committees, limited floor debate, and no amendments allowed. The Trade Act of 2002 allows Congress to approve trade agreements through expedited legislative procedures, including automatic discharge from committees, limited floor debate, and no amendments allowed. Congress defines trade negotiation objectives in TPA legislation to emphasize the importance of trade for U.S. foreign economic and security policy. The Trade Act of 2002 allows Congress to approve trade agreements through expedited legislative procedures, emphasizing the importance of trade for U.S. foreign economic and security policy. Congress defines trade negotiating objectives in three categories: overall objectives, principal objectives, and other priorities, which the Administration is expected to honor for trade agreement implementing legislation to be considered under expedited rules. The Trade Act of 2002 allows Congress to approve trade agreements through expedited legislative procedures, emphasizing the importance of trade for U.S. foreign economic and security policy. Congress establishes trade negotiating objectives in three categories: overall objectives, principal objectives, and other priorities. Overall objectives set broad goals for trade negotiations, while principal objectives provide specific goals like reducing trade barriers and protecting intellectual property rights. The Trade Act of 2002 emphasizes the importance of trade for U.S. foreign economic and security policy. Congress establishes trade negotiating objectives, including reducing trade barriers, protecting intellectual property rights, promoting transparency, fair regulatory practices, combating corruption, enforcing environmental and labor laws, and providing for dispute settlement. The language defining trade negotiating objectives has been contested in the past, leading to controversy in the renewal of Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) in 2002. The 2002 renewal controversy over Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) reflected the importance of TPA negotiating objectives as a template for future trade agreements. The labor provisions, a key focus in negotiating objectives, sparked contentious debate due to the decision not to include enforceable standards in TPA. The decision not to include minimal enforceable standards in TPA led to contentious debate over both TPA and the FTAs that later adopted the TPA language on labor, particularly evident in the 2005 debate on the CAFTA-DR implementing bill. The structure of trade agreements mirrors TPA objectives, making the vote on renewing TPA/fast track authority critical in Congress. The renewal of TPA/fast track authority is a critical trade vote in Congress. The President must consult regularly with Congress, including the Congressional Advisory Groups, and meet notification and consultation requirements. The President must follow specific notification and consultation requirements before commencing trade negotiations, including notifying Congress at least 90 days prior to starting negotiations and consulting with relevant committees and advisory groups. The President must conduct specific notifications and consultations before entering into trade agreements, including notifying Congress at least 90 days prior to doing so and consulting with relevant committees and advisory groups. Before entering into trade agreements, the President must notify Congress and consult with relevant committees and advisory groups. Additionally, the President must notify revenue committees 180 days in advance of any potential changes to U.S. trade remedy laws, submit private sector advisory committee reports within 30 days of notifying Congress, provide trade agreement details to the U.S. International Trade Commission 90 days before entering into an agreement, and present the USITC report on the agreement's impact to Congress within 105 days of its signing. The congressional consultation process is a crucial part of Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), requiring the President to notify and consult with Congress before entering into trade agreements. This process includes presenting the USITC report on the agreement's impact to Congress within 105 days of signing and releasing the agreement text 60 days prior to signing. The effectiveness of this consultation process has been questioned. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) evaluated the effectiveness of the consultation process for trade negotiations. Despite extensive consultations with Congress on FTAs, many congressional staff felt they did not have enough time to provide input. Many congressional staff expressed concerns about the consultation process for trade negotiations, feeling that they were not given enough time to provide input and that last-minute changes were not always included in draft FTA texts. There is a need to amend the process to allow for greater and earlier congressional input. Similar concerns have been raised regarding consultation with the Administration on TPP and other trade negotiations. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) procedures were adopted by Congress to prevent delays in trade implementing bills and protect fragile consensus between trade partners from congressional amendments. Congress did not agree to surrender its input into the drafting of Free Trade Agreements (FTAs). The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) procedures were designed to protect consensus from congressional amendments, but Congress retained authority over trade matters by including provisions to limit expedited procedures. Renewals of TPA provide limited time for expedited procedures for trade agreement implementing bills, with the 2002 statute applying to agreements before July 1, 2007, and TPA-2015 applying to agreements before July 1, 2021. The TPA procedures under TPA-2015 apply to trade agreements entered into before July 1, 2021, without a disapproval resolution introduced and passed by July 1, 2018. Implementing legislation for FTAs entered into before the authority expires has no set deadline, as seen with the delay in passing bills for agreements with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea. In 2006, the FTAs with Panama and South Korea were signed, but implementing bills were not passed until October 12, 2011. The TPA legislation requires the President to request an extension of authority, which is granted unless a disapproval resolution is adopted by either House of Congress. This process serves as a reminder to the executive branch. The availability of expedited legislative procedures for trade agreements is a congressional prerogative that can be denied if Congress is dissatisfied with the President's negotiation conduct. Fulfilling consultation and reporting obligations helps preserve Congress's role in influencing trade agreements before finalization. Failure to meet these requirements may lead Congress to reject implementing resolutions. Congress has the power to influence trade agreements before finalization. If the President fails to meet consultation and reporting requirements, Congress can reject implementing resolutions through a joint \"procedural disapproval\" resolution. The CCR procedure in TPA-2015 allows either chamber to withdraw TPA procedures for an implementing bill if there is a failure to notify or consult with Congress on a trade agreement. The Trade Act of 1974 allows Congress to withdraw expedited procedures for trade implementing bills with a vote, preserving its constitutional right to change rules related to trade agreements. The Trade Act of 1974 allows Congress to withdraw expedited procedures for trade implementing bills with a vote, preserving its constitutional right to change rules related to trade agreements. The long-term success of TPA depends on cooperation between the legislative and executive branches, as well as bipartisan agreement, which has been lacking since 1993. Since 1993, bipartisan agreement on Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) has been lacking, with a notable eight-year gap during the Clinton Administration. Congress has integrated certain procedures into the approval process of trade agreements, such as reviewing agreements before introducing implementing bills. Congress has integrated procedures into the approval process of trade agreements, including reviewing agreements before introducing implementing bills. This involves hearings before the House Ways and Means and Senate Finance Committees, followed by an informal markup session and a mock conference to test congressional response to the implementing bill. During an informal markup session near the White House, committee members review a draft of the trade agreement and implementing bill. This allows them to raise concerns, offer amendments, and signal changes they would like to see in the actual bill. The mock conference helps reconcile differences in the markups to reinforce congressional positions. The revenue committees may use a \"mock conference\" to reconcile differences in their markups for the implementing bill of a trade agreement. The Administration has discretion in accepting suggested changes from Congress, as seen in the example of the CAFTA-DR agreement. The Bush Administration made changes to the CAFTA-DR agreement but declined to include an amendment supported by the Senate Finance Committee in the U.S.-Oman FTA implementing legislation. This led to a bipartisan call for better consultation before entering into trade agreements. Congress has sometimes requested additions or clarifications to trade agreements outside of formal requirements. Side agreements and side letters are often added to trade agreements by Congress, beyond formal requirements. Side agreements can involve additional obligations accepted by all parties after the original trade agreement is signed, such as the environment and labor side agreements of NAFTA. Side letters act as clarifying devices for specific issues in bilateral FTAs. Side letters in bilateral FTAs clarify specific issues and are addressed between top trade representatives. They do not change the agreement's text but require official signatures from all parties to be considered in force. Enforcement of side letters remains untested and uncertain, with some Members of Congress relying on informal commitments to address concerns. Enforceability of trade agreements remains untested and unclear. Some Members of Congress rely on informal commitments from the executive branch to address special interests. The Bush Administration made accommodations in the CAFTA-DR implementing bill to secure congressional support. TPA expired on July 1, 2007, and historically, the President requests renewed TPA from Congress. Historically, it has been common practice for the President to request renewed Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) from Congress, although not formally required. President Obama faced criticism for delaying this request but eventually asked for TPA renewal in 2013 and reiterated the request in his 2015 State of the Union address. Congress may also consider revamping parts of the 2002 law related to TPA, which some view as outdated and not reflecting current policy debates. Some policy issues and technical changes related to Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) are being debated. TPA is not always smooth and may not be necessary if consensus is reached on passing a Free Trade Agreement (FTA). TPA goes beyond expedited legislative procedures and can help build consensus on trade policy between the executive and legislative branches. Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) goes beyond expedited legislative procedures and can help build consensus on trade policy between the executive and legislative branches. It also signals congressional support for Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) and ensures Congress's role in the trade policy agenda by defining negotiating objectives and requiring specific consultation and notification. The timing of TPA renewal is a key question, with some suggesting waiting until FTA negotiations are near completion for a compelling rationale for congressional action. The debate over Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) renewal revolves around the timing of congressional action. Some argue for waiting until Free Trade Agreement (FTA) negotiations are close to completion, while others suggest addressing TPA early in the negotiation process to allow Congress to weigh in on critical matters. Congress must consider various aspects of TPA before deciding on renewed authority, as trade negotiating objectives have evolved with the changing structure of trade. The scope of U.S. trade negotiating objectives has expanded with the changing structure of trade, leading to more complex issues. TPA-2015 includes objectives for a \"21st-century trade agreement\" addressing new topics like state-owned enterprises, regulatory cooperation, trade effects on SMEs, and FTAs impact on global supply chains. The treatment of negotiating objectives in trade agreements is a key issue for TPA renewal, with Democrats dissatisfied with the outcome in the Trade Act of 2002. Approval of FTAs was withheld until a bipartisan agreement was reached. The \"May 10th Agreement\" incorporated significant changes in labor, environment, and intellectual property rights commitments for trade agreements negotiated with Peru, Colombia, Panama, and South Korea. These changes have been accepted as a baseline for future trade agreements by many Republicans and Democrats. Some Democrats and Republicans have differing views on including the May 10th Understanding commitments in formal trade negotiating objectives in TPA-2015. Republicans have reservations, stating it does not represent an agreement on a new trade policy. However, TPA-2015 includes key provisions from the May 10th Understanding on labor. TPA-2015 includes key provisions from the May 10th Understanding on labor and environmental provisions, but it is unclear how much it reflects the IPR provisions. Some Members of Congress are unhappy with the executive branch's handling of trade negotiation consultations required under TPA, especially with the TPP negotiations. Key issues include defining procedures for Congress to influence FTAs early in the negotiation process. Some Members are dissatisfied with the quality of consultation regarding trade agreements. They argue for clearer procedures to allow Congress to influence FTAs early in the negotiation process and have better access to draft texts. There are concerns that Congress may seek to clarify negotiation and consultation procedures due to limited access compared to business and NGO representatives. Members emphasize the importance of staying informed on trade agreements. Members of Congress, especially those involved in trade committees, stress the need to stay updated on trade agreement negotiations to influence the agreement text and participate in drafting implementing bills. Bipartisan efforts focus on enforcing trade commitments with legislative initiatives and the creation of the Interagency Trade Enforcement Center by President Obama. Congress may also consider including language on trade agreement enforcement in the Trade Promotion Authority (TPA). President Obama has established the Interagency Trade Enforcement Center to address enforcement issues. Congress may need to include language on trade agreement enforcement in the Trade Promotion Authority (TPA). The recent use of TPA expedited procedures in the 112th Congress raised technical issues that Congress may need to reassess, such as the strict interpretation of using TPA only for necessary provisions in implementing bills. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) requires provisions in implementing legislation to be \"strictly necessary or appropriate.\" Some Members may want to define this language more precisely, while others argue for flexibility in applying the standard. Additionally, there is a time limitation on introducing Free Trade Agreement (FTA) implementing bills, as seen with FTAs with Colombia, Panama, Peru, and South Korea being introduced 3-4 years after the agreements were made. Some argue for a time limit on introducing FTA implementing bills after negotiations conclude. Changes to the U.S.-South Korea FTA text post-negotiations raised concerns about TPA compliance and the potential for FTA approval denial. The changes in the U.S.-South Korea FTA text after negotiations raised concerns about TPA compliance, potentially leading to FTA approval denial. Congress may need to address this issue in TPA renewal, as the real power of fast track lies in the political compact between Congress and the President. The political compact between Congress and the President is crucial for trade policy consensus. Congress has options for renewing TPA, including renewing and revising TPA authority. Congress has options for renewing TPA, including revising the TPA Authority, extending a Targeted TPA for specific agreements like the TPP, or granting Permanent TPA Authority. Congress could grant the President permanent fast track/TPA through a two-tier procedure, where specific negotiations would require approval from both houses of Congress. The lack of TPA renewal may delay future trade agreements, but trade policy can still progress through other means like TIFAs and trade enforcement measures. In the 114th Congress, legislation to renew TPA was signed by the President on June 29, 2015, reauthorizing it for four years with a possible three-year extension. Some Members oppose TPA due to concerns about expedited procedures and loss of congressional authority. The legislation signed by the President on June 29, 2015, reauthorizes TPA for four years with a potential three-year extension. It includes changes like increased consultation requirements with Congress and private sector advisers. Key objectives cover trade in goods, services, foreign investment, and intellectual property. The reauthorized Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) legislation includes revised objectives such as trade in goods, services, foreign investment, intellectual property, and new provisions on digital trade, state-owned enterprises, currency, and human rights as principal trade negotiating objectives. The reauthorized Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) legislation includes new provisions on currency and human rights as principal trade negotiating objectives, along with objectives on trade in goods, services, foreign investment, intellectual property, and digital trade. The expedited legislative procedures for passage of trade implementing bills under TPA involve mock markups by House and Senate committees before final implementing legislation is sent to Congress. The President then sends the final legal draft text of the trade agreement for approval. The President sends a final legal draft text of the trade agreement and a draft implementing bill to Congress, which initiates expedited procedures. Identical bills are introduced in each house of Congress and referred to relevant committees for review within 45 in session days. The President sends the trade agreement and implementing bill to Congress, starting expedited procedures. Committees have 45 days to report the bill or it's automatically discharged. The Senate Finance Committee has a deadline for action on revenue bills. After the bill is reported or discharged, any Member can motion to consider it. After the bill is reported or discharged, any Member may offer a non-debatable motion to consider it. Debate is limited to 20 hours, and the measure cannot be amended. If floor action is not completed within 15 days, any Member may bring it to a vote. The bill passes by a simple majority, and the second House typically debates its own bill before taking a final vote. After the bill is passed by a simple majority in both houses, the implementing bill is signed by the President and enters into force for the United States. The President implements it by proclamation after assurance from the USTR that necessary legislative and regulatory changes have been made by the partner country(ies). After the bill is passed by both houses, the President implements it by proclamation, following assurance from the USTR that partner countries have met all obligations under the trade agreement. The agreement enters into force on a specified date."
