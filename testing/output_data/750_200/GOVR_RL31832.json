    "content": "Legislation to rewrite and reauthorize the Export Administration Act of 1979 (EAA) may be considered in the 111th Congress. In the 110th Congress, various bills were introduced addressing penalties, enforcement, diversion of goods, and integrating export control data. The EAA controls sensitive dual-use goods with civilian and military applications, including those that can contribute to nuclear, biological, and chemical weaponry proliferation. The EAA, which expired in 1989, has been periodically renewed. The Export Administration Act of 1979 (EAA) controls dual-use goods with civilian and military applications, including items that can contribute to the proliferation of nuclear, biological, and chemical weaponry. The EAA expired in 1989 and has been periodically reauthorized. The export licensing system created under the EAA is continued through the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) administers the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) under the EAA. The Export Administration Regulations (EAR) under the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) in the Department of Commerce regulate exports of dual-use commodities, software, computers, and technology. The Export Administration Act (EAA) focuses on controlling exports of civilian goods with military applications, based on strategic relationships and threats to national security. Some Members of Congress and U.S. business representatives advocate for liberalizing export regulations to boost American companies in international competition for high-tech sales. However, others, including national security analysts, argue that past liberalization has increased foreign threats to U.S. national security and call for tighter controls. Congress is urged to carefully consider further liberalization. The Export Administration Act has evolved over the last decade, with some advocating for liberalization while others call for tighter controls due to foreign threats to U.S. national security. The report discusses the act's major features, including controls, the Commerce Control List, and export licensing procedures. It also addresses issues related to maintaining export controls under IEEPA and highlights controlled commodities in export control discussions. Competing business and national security perspectives on contentious themes in exports are also discussed. Export controls have been a part of U.S. policy for almost a century, evolving significantly after WWII and during the Cold War. The current debate includes issues like technology control, multilateral regimes, organization of the system, and the impact on the economy. The Export Control Act of 1949 marked a shift towards a peacetime export control system, particularly focused on the Soviet-Bloc countries. It identified three reasons for imposing export controls: short-supply controls, foreign policy controls, and national security concerns. The Export Control Act of 1949 established controls to promote U.S. foreign policy and national security by restricting exports that could enhance the military capabilities of potential threats. This included regulating items related to regional stability, human rights, anti-terrorism, missile technology, and chemical and biological warfare. The Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (CoCom) was established in 1949 to regulate the transfer of critical technology among NATO allies, reflecting a high level of restrictions similar to U.S. controls. The Export Controls (CoCom) was established in 1949 with high restrictions. The Export Control Act was renewed multiple times until the 1960s when a reexamination and revision occurred due to the U.S.-Soviet era of \"detente\". The Export Administration Act of 1969 was passed to replace the outdated system. The Export Administration Act of 1969 replaced the restrictive Export Control Act of 1949, leading to a gradual liberalization of export controls through renewals in 1974 and 1977. A comprehensive rewrite in 1979 formed the basis of the current export control system, with further amendments in 1985 and moderate liberalization in subsequent years. The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989 has been partly attributed to the success of U.S. cold war export control policy. The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989 led to changes in U.S. export control policy. The export control system has been streamlined since the George H.W. Bush Administration, but the basic structure remains intact. Calls for revamping the act have been made to enhance exports, focus on current national security threats, or increase penalties for violations. The dissolution of CoCom in 1994 and its replacement by the Wassenaar Arrangement in 1997 also significantly changed export control. The dissolution of CoCom in 1994 and its replacement by the Wassenaar Arrangement in 1997 significantly changed the export control environment, raising questions about the effectiveness of U.S. export controls in achieving national security objectives and the fairness of unilateral controls to American industry. Congress has struggled to agree on measures to reform the Export Administration Act. The Export Administration Act has faced challenges in reform measures since the 101st Congress. Export controls were extended through temporary measures and Executive Order No. 12924 in 1994. There are debates on whether to liberalize or tighten controls under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Legislation passed in 2000 extended the Export Administration Act until 2001, temporarily removing the need to operate under IEEPA powers. Export control authority has since been operating under IEEPA provisions pursuant to Executive Order 13222. Legislation to rewrite the Export Administration Act has been proposed. Export control authority has been operating under IEEPA provisions pursuant to Executive Order 13222 since 2001. Legislation to rewrite the Export Administration Act has been introduced in recent Congresses, with the House passing the Omnibus Export Administration Act of 1996 in the 104th Congress. In the 106th Congress, the Export Administration Act of 1999 (S. 1712) was introduced by Senator Michael P. Enzi. The Senate Banking Committee unanimously voted to report the legislation to the Senate floor, but action was not taken due to concerns about national security. In the 107th Congress, Senator Enzi introduced the Export Administration Act of 2001 (S. 149), which was favorably reported for consideration by the Senate and passed with amendments by a vote of 85-14. This bill was similar to S. 1712 from the previous Congress. In the 107th Congress, the Export Administration Act of 2001 (S. 149) was introduced by Senator Enzi and passed with three amendments by a vote of 85-14. The House version, H.R. 2581, was introduced by Representative Benjamin Gilman with 35 amendments passed by the House International Relations Committee. In the 107th Congress, the House International Relations Committee passed H.R. 2581 with 35 amendments. The House Armed Services Committee and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence received the legislation through sequential referral. HASC further amended H.R. 2581 on March 6, 2002, and reported it out by a vote of 44-6. HPSCI held hearings on the legislation but made no changes. The Administration supported S. 149 and opposed House attempts to revise it. In the 108th Congress, Representative Dreier introduced EAA legislation (H.R. 55), identical to S. 149, but no action was taken. The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) has been used to attempt to amend the export control regime. In 2004, the House version of NDAA 2005 (H.R. 4200) contained provisions affecting dual-use export controls. The provision in response to a DOD study noted that MCTL technologies not controlled under EAR or ITAR. Another provision would require exporters to obtain licenses for items previously exported to China. The House NDAA report expressed concern about potential transfer of U.S. goods or technology to China, but these provisions were not included in the final conference report signed by the President in 2004. In 2004, provisions to revise the Export Administration Act were signed into law. A bill introduced in 2005 addressed penalties, enforcement, and U.S. relations with multilateral control regimes. The legislation included targeted changes and extended the expired EAA for two years. The bill introduced in 2005 aimed to amend the enforcement and penalty structure of the Export Administration Act, extend the expired EAA for two years, and integrate export control information into electronic filing. Legislation in the 110th Congress did not address rewriting or reauthorizing the EAA. The bill introduced in 2005 aimed to amend the enforcement and penalty structure of the Export Administration Act, extend the expired EAA for two years, and integrate export control information into electronic filing under the Automated Export System (AES). H.R. 6828, S. 3445, and H.R. 7112 targeted countries of diversion concern. H.R. 6828 also required an investigation of BIS' validated end-user program. S. 3445/H.R. 7112 was the only legislation acted upon in the 110th Congress, with S. 3445 being reported out of the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee but not receiving floor consideration. H.R. 7112 was introduced and passed in the House. On July 31, 2009, Representative Sherman introduced the Export Control Improvements Act (H.R. 3515) with provisions on export controls enforcement, integration of export control data in the AES, and diversion control. The title on export enforcement does not amend the enforcement section of the expired EAA (Sec.12) like H.R. 6828, but introduces new measures. The draft legislation on export enforcement provides additional authority for the Export Administration Regulations under the International Economic Emergency Powers Act. It grants investigative authority to departments and agencies to conduct investigations in the US and abroad. The draft legislation grants additional authority for export enforcement under the International Economic Emergency Powers Act. It allows agencies to conduct investigations in the US and abroad, including search, detention, and seizure of goods. The bill also authorizes actions at US ports of entry or exit and overseas, and directs the Secretary of Commerce to publish guidelines for export control compliance programs. It includes confidentiality provisions and new language on the use of funds for undercover operations. Title 1 of H.R. 3515 aims to streamline licensing requirements and data collection rules for exporters by integrating them into the Automated Export System. It focuses on programming the AES to include export control data and establishing audit and reporting requirements for undercover investigations. The export control provisions of this title focus on programming the AES to include export control data and prevent improper shipments. The issue of evasion of U.S. export controls through transhipment hubs remains a concern, highlighted by reports of sensitive goods being diverted to Iran for use in Iraq. The United Arab Emirates exported goods that were diverted to Iran for bomb detonators used in Iraq. This led to licensing requirements on UAE-based Mayrow General Trading and other entities. The focus then shifted to the UAE's export control regime, prompting the proposal of a 'Country Category C' by the BIS in 2007. This category would impose stricter licensing requirements on countries of diversion concern. No country was designated as Category C. H.R. 3515 would legislate the 'Category C' concept with regards to diversion to Iran, requiring the President to identify countries of concern within 180 days. Countries could be designated as possible diversion concern or diversion concern, triggering government-to-government contacts for assistance. The bill would require the Administration to initiate government-to-government contacts with countries of diversion concern to strengthen their export control systems. Failure to cooperate within 12 months would result in designation as a Destination of Diversion Concern, with additional licensing requirements imposed. The legislation would designate countries of diversion concern, leading to additional licensing requirements and increased end-user checks. President Obama initiated a review of the U.S. export control system in 2009, with Defense Secretary Gates announcing key details. Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates announced key elements of the administration's agenda for reforming the export control system, proposing a 4-pronged approach to create a single licensing agency, adopt a unified control list, and implement a single integrated information technology system. The administration's plan for export control reform includes creating a single licensing agency, adopting a unified control list, implementing an integrated information technology system, and establishing an enforcement coordination agency in three phases, with legislative action required for the final phase. The first phase involves harmonizing the Commerce Control List with the U.S. Munitions List and creating a tiered control structure for evolving technology. Phase II of the export control reform plan involves implementing a harmonized licensing system with two identically structured tiered control lists. This harmonization and tiering of control lists aim to significantly reduce license requirements and potentially move certain items from the munitions list. An Enforcement Fusion Center will be created to synchronize enforcement efforts, along with a single electronic gateway for accessing the licensing system. The export control reform plan includes harmonizing and tiering control lists to reduce license requirements. Certain items may be moved from the munitions list to the dual-use list, with consultations on multilateral controls. A new export control system will debut in Phase III, with a single licensing agency and consolidated enforcement activities. The export control reform plan includes merging harmonized control lists, establishing a Primary Enforcement Coordination Agency, and implementing a single IT system for licensing and enforcement. Secretary Gates predicts a 3-phase plan unfolding over the next year, but many questions remain unanswered, particularly regarding legislative action for certain proposals. The export control reform plan includes merging control lists and establishing a Primary Enforcement Coordination Agency. Legislative action may be required for changes in the structure of control lists and agency placement. The specific department for the proposed licensing agency has not been determined yet. The proposed licensing agency's placement within an existing Department or as an independent entity is undecided, with proponents and detractors for each option. Common principles in export control efforts include types of controls, licensing procedures, review process, and enforcement procedures. U.S. dual-use export controls have been in place since the 1949 Act. The 1949 Act established U.S. dual-use export controls based on national security, foreign policy, and domestic economic impact. Items on the Commerce Control List are controlled for national security and foreign policy reasons, with different standards for licensing to specific countries. The 1979 Act further restricted exports of goods. The 1979 Act restricted the export of goods or technology that could contribute to the military capabilities of other countries, with control standards based on national security. National security control items fall under the National Security licensing requirement of the EAR, with licenses reviewed on a case-by-case basis for controlled countries in \"Country Group D-1\". The Export Administration Act (EAA) controls the export of goods and technology for national security purposes. Licenses are reviewed on a case-by-case basis for controlled countries, with items approved if they are deemed for civilian use or do not significantly contribute to the military potential. The Secretary of Defense maintains the Military Critical Technology List (MCTL) to identify items for national security control. The list is periodically reviewed and revised by the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Commerce. The Secretary of Defense maintains the Military Critical Technology List (MCTL) for national security control, which is consistent with the Wassenaar Arrangement. U.S. national security controls do not cover items under nuclear, chemical, biological, or missile proliferation regimes, or to countries under anti-terrorism controls. Items controlled for national security purposes are subject to a foreign availability determination. Under the 1979 Act, the Secretary, along with the Secretary of Defense and other agencies, determines if items subject to export control for national security reasons meet foreign availability status. Requests for foreign availability determinations can be made by license applicants or initiated by the Secretary. The Export Administration Act (EAA) allows for foreign availability determinations to be made by the Secretary, leading to decontrol of items unless the President deems it detrimental to national security. In such cases, negotiations with multilateral control partners are required. Additionally, the EAA established an Office of Foreign Availability to assist in data gathering for these determinations. The Export Administration Act established an Office of Foreign Availability to assist in data gathering for determinations. The bill also created an Office of Foreign Availability and an Emerging Technology and Research Advisory Committee to assess foreign availability and control list technologies. The Export Administration Act established an Office of Foreign Availability and an Emerging Technology and Research Advisory Committee to assess foreign availability and control list technologies. BIS created a system to review the Commerce Control List (CCL) in a three-year cycle, with certain licensing requirements lifted for uncooled thermal imaging cameras to 36 U.S. allied countries in 2009. The final rule lifts licensing requirements on uncooled thermal imaging cameras to 36 U.S. allied countries. Low to mid-market night vision cameras are decontrolled if not incorporated into military commodities and not exported for civilian use. Tighter export controls are imposed on higher-end thermal imaging cameras. Exporters must report transactions to BIS semi-annually. Some concerns remain about the length of time for this action. The final rule lifts licensing requirements on uncooled thermal imaging cameras to 36 U.S. allied countries. Concerns remain about the time taken to resolve issues with BIS. Mass market status was proposed in EAA legislation but is not currently provided for in regulations. Legislation introduced in the 106th and 107th Congress aimed to define mass market status for items based on distribution, shipping conduciveness, and usefulness without modification. This criteria was controversial and a stumbling block in negotiations. The Export Administration Act (EAA) feature allowing the President to control exports for foreign policy objectives was controversial in the 107th Congress. It covers anti-terrorism, regional stability, crime control, UN sanctions, embargoes, and non-proliferation. The Export Administration Act (EAA) allows the President to control exports for foreign policy objectives, including anti-terrorism, regional stability, crime control, United Nations sanctions, unilateral embargoes, and non-proliferation agreements. The EAA attaches limitations on foreign policy controls, requiring annual renewal and clear objectives reported to Congress. It also directs the President to negotiate to remove foreign availability of controlled items and impose controls to comply with international agreements. The Export Administration Act allows the President to control exports for foreign policy objectives, including anti-terrorism and regional stability. It requires negotiations to remove foreign availability of controlled items and compliance with international agreements. Additionally, a license is needed for exporting certain items to countries supporting terrorism, with exceptions for humanitarian goods like medicine and food. Controls on sales of agricultural products and medicines have been further amended by the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000. Catch-all controls require a license for export or reexport of any item if it will be used for nuclear, missile, chemical, or biological purposes. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) maintains an end-user list of entities requiring licenses subject to Export Control Policy and current regulations prescribe a presumption of denial for licenses to certain entities in Russia, China, Pakistan, India, and Israel, as well as foreign terrorist organizations. The 1979 Export Administration Act authorized restrictions on exports to protect domestic industry from shortages and inflationary impacts. The 1979 Export Administration Act authorized restrictions on exports to protect domestic industry from shortages and inflationary impacts. Short-supply controls remain for crude oil, petroleum derivatives, unprocessed western red cedar, and sea export of horses. The Bureau of Industry and Security administers the license application process, reviewing 21,213 applications worth $72.1 billion in FY2008, including $50.2 billion in crude oil licenses. The proposed EAA legislation in the 107th Congress did not include short-supply control authority. In FY2008, BIS reviewed 21,213 license applications totaling $72.1 billion, including $50.2 billion for crude oil exports in exchange for refined petroleum. Dual-use technology licenses were valued at approximately $21.9 billion, representing 1.7% of total U.S. exports. BIS approved 84% of applications, denied 1.0%, and returned 15%. The average processing time for referred applications was 27 days. China was the largest destination for controlled goods. In FY2008, BIS reviewed 21,213 license applications totaling $72.1 billion, with an average processing time of 27 days. China was the largest destination for controlled goods, with 1,990 licenses approved worth $2.7 billion. Chemical manufacturing facilities and equipment had the most approved license applications, totaling 2,212 with a value of $294 million. The Commerce Control List (CCL) was created under the 1979 EAA. The Commerce Control List (CCL) was established under the 1979 Export Administration Act (EAA) to control specific goods, technology, and software for national security, foreign policy, and short-supply reasons. It consists of ten categories, including nuclear materials, electronics, computers, and telecommunications. The Commerce Control List (CCL) was established under the 1979 Export Administration Act (EAA) to control specific goods, technology, and software for national security, foreign policy, and short-supply reasons. It consists of ten categories, including nuclear materials, facilities, equipment, organisms, microorganisms, toxins, materials processing, electronics, computers, telecommunications, information security, lasers, sensors, navigation, avionics, marine, propulsion systems, space vehicles, and related equipment. Each category is further divided into functional groups with export control classification numbers (ECCN) and descriptions. The Commerce Control List (CCL) categorizes goods, technology, and software for control based on ECCN listings. Nearly all U.S.-origin commodities are subject to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), allowing restrictions based on end-use or end-user. Items on the CCL may be eligible for license exceptions, granting exporters approval for exports without prior authorization. The Commerce Control List (CCL) categorizes goods for control based on ECCN listings. Items on the CCL may be eligible for license exceptions, but some products may still require a license due to high diversion risk or controversial nature. Commodity jurisdiction (CJ) determines if a product is dual-use or munition, regulated by the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls. The regulatory regime for products is determined by Commodity Jurisdiction (CJ) which classifies items as dual-use or munition. Exporters can request a classification from BIS for items not listed on the Commerce Control List (CCL), indicating they fall under EAR jurisdiction. BIS must refer these requests to the Department of State and Department of Defense. The General Accounting Office criticized Commerce for low referral rates of commodity classification requests to State and Defense, with only 10 out of 5,370 requests referred in 2005. Renewed referral criteria development had not been initiated. In 2005, out of 5,370 commodity classification requests processed, only 10 were referred to State and Defense. The General Accounting Office highlighted jurisdictional disagreements and coordination problems between the two departments, leading to exporters determining restrictions. Despite recommendations, the departments have not resolved these issues or improved coordination. The Export Administration Regulations (EAR) and the EAA establish policies for license application reviews and resolving interagency disputes. Executive Order 12981 grants the Secretary of Commerce the authority to review and decide on export licenses, despite ongoing coordination issues between the Departments of State, Defense, and Energy. The Export Administration Regulations and the EAA give the Secretary of Commerce the power to review and decide on export licenses. The Departments of State, Defense, and Energy can also review licenses and may waive their right to do so for certain commodities or destinations. The Secretary must take action on license applications within nine days, including seeking additional information, referring applications to other agencies, and granting or denying the application. The reviewing agency must request additional information within 10 days from the Secretary. Within 30 days of receipt of the application, the agency must recommend approval or denial, providing justification for a denial. Failure to provide a recommendation within 30 days results in the application being returned. The agency must recommend approval or denial of the application within 30 days, providing regulatory or statutory justification for a denial. If no recommendation is provided, the agency is deemed to have no objection. The 1995 Order established a three-level interagency dispute resolution mechanism, with the Export Administration Review Board (EARB) at the top tier. The Export Administration Review Board (EARB) was created in 1970 by Executive Order and consists of the Secretary, Secretaries of State, Defense, and Energy. Non-voting members include the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Director of Central Intelligence. The Advisory Committee on Export Policy (ACEP) operates under the EARB, with the Operating Committee (OC) being the third tier. The Operating Committee (OC) of the ACEP, chaired by the Secretary of Commerce, is the third tier of the Export Administration Review Board (EARB). The Chair reviews agency recommendations and informs them of decisions within 14 days. Any reviewing department can appeal to the ACEP within five days, stating the basis for the appeal. The ACEP members review recommendations and vote on applications within 11 days of an appeal. A department head of a dissenting agency can appeal to the Secretary within five days of a majority decision. The EARB must decide on the application within 11 days of the appeal. A member of EARB can appeal to the President within five days. The interagency appeal process must be completed within 90 days of application registration. The interagency appeal process for export license denials must be completed within 90 days of application registration. BIS's denial of a license must be supported by specific reasons, with an explicit appeal procedure outlined in the EAR. One basis for appeal is foreign availability assessment. One possible basis for appeal is an assessment of foreign availability. In FY2008, BIS reported that 422 cases were escalated to the OC, and a further 20 were examined by the ACEP. President George H.W. Bush extended export regulations in 1990 using emergency authority under IEEPA. President George H.W. Bush extended export regulations in 1990 under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) due to a national emergency. Controls were later terminated during temporary extensions in 1993 and 1994, but were reimposed by President Clinton in 1994. A major restructuring of export control regulations was published in 1996. President Clinton reimposed export controls under IEEPA in 1994 and a major restructuring of regulations was published in 1996. President George W. Bush renewed emergency controls in 2001. Deficiencies in maintaining export controls under IEEPA authority have been noted, including the lapse of police power of enforcement agents. The Export Administration Act (EAA) lapsed, leading to complications for agents under IEEPA who need Special Deputy U.S. Marshal status to enforce laws. IEEPA lacks provisions for limiting court jurisdiction, protecting information confidentiality, and discouraging compliance with foreign boycotts. The IEEPA does not explicitly authorize provisions to discourage compliance with foreign boycotts against friendly countries, leading to concerns about U.S. credibility and enforcement effectiveness. Penalty authorities under IEEPA are lower than under the EAA, reducing their deterrent effect. The International Emergency Economic Powers Enhancement Act (P.L. 110-96) raised criminal penalties to $1 million or up to 20 years' imprisonment for natural persons, and civil penalties to $250,000. This act aimed to address the issue of diminished U.S. credibility due to the lack of a statute and the lower penalty authorities under IEEPA compared to the EAA. The EAA limits civil penalties to $10,000 or $100,000 for national security violations, and criminal penalties to $250,000 and 10 years' imprisonment for individuals or $1 million for firms. Controversial exports include telecommunications, advanced electronic equipment, precision machine tools, guidance technology, aerospace technology, synthetic materials, and specialized manufacturing equipment. In recent years, congressional focus has been on technologically advanced computers known as High Performance Computers (HPCs), which can perform complex digital operations quickly. These HPCs encompass a variety of technologies including workstations, mainframes, microprocessors, and software. The benchmark for measuring HPC computing performance was previously the composite theoretical performance (CTP). The benchmark for gauging HPC computing performance was previously the composite theoretical performance (CTP), measured in MTOPS. A new standard called adjusted peak performance (APP) was approved in December 2005 and incorporated into a BIS final rulemaking in April 2006. This new standard calculates computing power based on the adjusted peak rate of digital operations. The new standard for measuring computing power, called adjusted peak performance (APP), was approved in December 2005 and incorporated into a BIS final rulemaking in April 2006. It measures the peak rate at which digital computers perform 64-bit or larger floating point operations using a metric known as \"weighted teraflops\" (WT). The control level is set at 0.75 WT, replacing the previous 190,000 MTOPS benchmark. This level continues to control high-end proprietary HPCs used for advanced research and development by the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy. The new standard for measuring computing power, called adjusted peak performance (APP), was approved in December 2005 and incorporated into a BIS final rulemaking in April 2006. It measures the peak rate at which digital computers perform 64-bit or larger floating point operations using a metric known as \"weighted teraflops\" (WT). The level for computer software and technology is set at 0.04 WT and for computer development and production technology at 0.1 WT. Export restrictions on HPCs have been debated due to rapid advancements in computing capabilities and foreign availability of comparable models. During the Clinton Administration, HPC export thresholds were raised. During the Clinton and Bush Administrations, HPC export thresholds were raised significantly, with the threshold for exports to Tier 3 countries reaching 190,000 MTOPS in 2002. This decontrol process had a regulatory impact on BIS, reducing license applications for computer assemblies and hardware. Despite the shift to the WT metric, changes in control measures were implemented. The National Defense Authorization Act of 1998 imposed special conditions on the export of high performance computers, requiring prior notification for exports above the MTOPS threshold to Tier III countries. Changes in control measures were implemented despite the shift to the WT metric. The National Defense Authorization Act of 1998 imposed special conditions on the export of high performance computers, requiring prior notification for exports above the MTOPS threshold to Tier III countries. Encryption is the process of encoding electronic messages to transfer important information and data securely. Keys are needed to unlock or decode the message. Encryption is crucial for secure electronic message transfer, requiring keys for decoding. It is essential for e-commerce security and cryptography, with implications for military code-breaking. Executive Order 13026 transferred control of encryption technology from the Department of State to the Department of Commerce in 1996, leading to decontrols of encryption items and technology. Since Executive Order 13026 in 1996, there have been decontrols of encryption technology, allowing for the export of retail encryption products to western countries and non-governmental end-users with a license exemption. Licenses are still required for countries under anti-terrorism controls. Stealth technology protects systems from electronic detection through design elements. Stealth technology uses materials and design elements to protect systems from electronic detection. It falls into two categories: deflecting radar signals to neutral space or absorbing them to prevent reflection. Export controls are sensitive due to civil applications and the need to retain U.S. leadership in this technology. The Department of State reclassified certain stealth-related technology as munitions in the 1990s due to concerns over potential export. Congress debated the control of exports of commercial communications satellites and the effectiveness of monitoring foreign launch operations to prevent disclosures of missile secrets. In 1998, the Cox Committee found that U.S. satellite manufacturers provided missile design information to China through improper transfer of launch failure analysis. The Cox Committee discovered that U.S. satellite manufacturers shared missile design information with China through improper transfer of launch failure analysis. Satellite exports were licensed by the Department of Commerce until March 1999 when Congress returned authority to the Department of State. The satellite industry has lobbied to reverse export controls to Commerce due to licensing delays and lost sales. The satellite industry has lobbied to reverse export controls to Commerce due to licensing delays and lost sales. Satellites launched for commercial communication purposes may contain sensitive technology controlled under the U.S. Munitions List. The Foreign Relations Authorization Act of 2010-11 contained a provision to transfer commercial satellite and satellite components from the USML back to the CCL with presidential approval. The Foreign Relations Authorization Act of 2010-11, passed on June 10, 2009, included a provision allowing the President to transfer commercial satellite technology from the USML to the CCL with congressional approval. This technology includes advanced manufacturing equipment used for producing parts for missiles, aircraft engines, and arms. The satellite industry has expressed concerns about the lack of multilateral controls over sales, particularly regarding China. The lack of multilateral controls over sales of advanced manufacturing equipment has hindered competitive positions, especially concerning China. A technology assessment recommended decontrolling certain products to China and Taiwan. \"Hot section\" technology is crucial for jet aircraft development and production, controlled by the U.S. Munitions List. During debates on EAA legislation in the 106th Congress, concerns were raised about the decontrol of technology in military and commercial aircraft. The civilian aviation industry sought a \"carve-out\" for sensitive technologies to prevent decontrol by the Department of Commerce. The Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC) within the Department of State oversees these regulations. The civilian aviation industry has long been concerned about the DDTC asserting jurisdiction over civilian aircraft parts. Section 17(c) of the EAA states that certain aircraft equipment certified by the FAA and exported to non-controlled countries should be subject to export controls exclusively under this act. In response to concerns about DDTC jurisdiction over civilian aircraft parts, legislation was introduced to clarify that civil aircraft equipment certified by the FAA and exported to non-controlled countries should be subject to export controls exclusively under the EAA. Representative Manzullo introduced legislation (H.R. 3633) to clarify that civil aircraft equipment eligible for export airworthiness approval under FAA regulations is subject only to controls under the EAA. DDTC released a new rule clarifying Commerce's jurisdiction over parts and components of civil aircraft. The Federal Aviation Administration issues civil aircraft type certificates for standard equipment, which are considered integral parts of the aircraft. Suppliers no longer need to seek commodity jurisdiction determination for non-significant military equipment parts. Technology exports to foreign nationals within the U.S. are regulated by the Export Administration Regulations, requiring a license for technology transfer. Deemed exports are regulated by the Export Administration Regulations, requiring a license for technology transfer to foreign nationals in the U.S. BIS reviewed 1,056 deemed export licenses in FY2007, with nearly 57% for Chinese nationals. In FY2007, BIS reviewed 1,056 deemed export licenses, with nearly 57% for Chinese nationals. BIS established a rule-making procedure in response to an Inspector General's report recommending a change in the standard for foreign nationals subject to export controls. The IG suggested using country of birth as the standard instead of citizenship or residency. The Inspector General recommended using country of birth as the standard for foreign nationals subject to export controls, but the Under Secretary of Commerce announced that controls would still be based on citizenship or permanent residency. In 2007, the Deemed Export Advisory Commission released a report on the regulatory regime. In 2007, the Deemed Export Advisory Commission recommended a \"trusted entity\" program for academia and industrial entities to streamline the deemed export application process. The program would evaluate an applicant's probable loyalties based on various factors like country of birth, prior residence, and current citizenship. The Commission also suggested streamlining certain terminology in the regulatory regime. The Deemed Export Advisory Commission recommended a \"trusted entity\" program to streamline the deemed export application process by evaluating an applicant's probable loyalties based on factors like country of birth, prior residence, and current citizenship. They also suggested streamlining terminology in the regulations and establishing an outside panel of experts for an annual review of technologies on the Commerce Control List. Industry representatives and the research community criticized the recommendations as unmanageable for the government and difficult for industry to comply with. BIS sought comments on the scope of technologies subject to deemed export regulations in May 2008.

The tension between commercial and national security concerns complicates debates on export administration legislation. The tension between commercial and national security concerns complicates debates on export administration legislation. Many favor reform to assist U.S. business in global competition, while others prioritize effective controls on potential exports to threatening countries. The debate on export administration legislation is complicated by tensions between commercial interests and national security concerns. Some prioritize effective controls on potential exports to threatening countries over the abilities of U.S. industry to export. Controversies arise regarding technology control, multilateral regimes, licensing processes, and the impact of export controls on the U.S. economy. The foreign availability and mass market provisions of EAA reauthorization legislation have sparked controversy. Industry groups supporting EAA reauthorization legislation view foreign availability and mass market provisions as essential for controlling technology flow and maintaining U.S. technological dominance. They argue that unilateral controls will not prevent other countries from accessing advanced technology. According to industry groups, U.S. dominance in cutting-edge technology is no longer guaranteed. Unilateral controls are seen as ineffective in preventing other countries from obtaining advanced technology. Critics argue that countries of concern will simply acquire technology from other nations, leading to American businesses losing out while foreign businesses gain new markets. Unilateral export controls are becoming increasingly unworkable in the global economy. The current export control system is facing challenges in a globalized economy as component parts are manufactured worldwide, making unilateral controls ineffective. Purchasing managers are reducing dependence on American components due to licensing delays. Aerospace companies are urged to reduce reliance on American components for defense and space technology products due to delays in licensing procedures. Critics argue that the mass market standard could undermine U.S. export control efforts by decontrolling items that could be used for proliferation purposes. The mass market standard could potentially decontrol products, including dual-use items for proliferation, allowing sales similar to what controlled countries can purchase. Industry argues that robust export industries enhance national security due to changes in defense procurement and research. The military's role in technical research has shifted, with a greater reliance on commercial applications and off-the-shelf purchases. Industry argues that selling current technology is crucial for national security, as export controls could hinder competitiveness and allow foreign firms to surpass American technological lead. Foreign firms gaining market share and increasing profits could potentially surpass the US technological lead, impacting national security. Industry advocates for a streamlined export process to avoid hindering exports, while critics argue against selling advanced technology to potentially hostile states. Some argue that selling advanced technology to potentially hostile states could pose a threat to national security, citing the case of Iraq using U.S. weaponry against Kuwait. They suggest funding R&D for defense capabilities within the Defense Department to maintain control over technology exports. Some argue that R&D for defense capabilities should be funded within the Defense Department to control technology exports, as attempting to control computing power is deemed unfeasible and self-defeating. Increasing computing speeds and networking advances have blurred the distinction between super-computers and commodity computers. Microprocessors can be linked together to create servers with capabilities that breach export thresholds, eroding the ability to restrict access to high-performance computing power. The Defense Science Board highlighted the challenge of restricting access to high-performance computing due to the clustering of commodity computers. Some believe the US can control access by limiting exports, as American-made computers are seen as superior and offer better networking and service. Control advocates argue that these distinctions are significant in maintaining qualitative superiority. The purchase of American-made computer products offers superior networking and service at a better price. Control advocates emphasize the qualitative differences and challenges of networking parallel processing systems. Post-shipment verification is a policy attempted to monitor the end-use of controlled goods, mandated by Sec 1213 of NDAA98. The post-shipment verification requirement (PSV) on the export of High-Performance Computers (HPCs) is mandated by Sec 1213 of NDAA98. It applies to computers destined for tier III destinations, including China, Russia, India, Pakistan, Israel, and other nations in areas of regional instability. Lawmakers are particularly concerned about exports of HPCs to China, where access to U.S. HPC exports is restricted. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has found that the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) has made limited efforts to monitor compliance with export license terms. Monitoring the end-use of HPCs is challenging. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) has made limited efforts to monitor compliance with export license terms for High-Performance Computers (HPCs). Monitoring the end-use of HPC exports in China is challenging due to close ties with the Chinese military. The United States participates in the Wassenaar Arrangement (WA) on Dual-Use Goods and Munitions for dual-use goods and technology control. The Wassenaar Arrangement (WA) was established in 1996 as the successor to CoCom, a Cold War era control regime. WA's dual-use control list aligns with the U.S. CCL for national security items. The U.S. also participates in other control regimes like the Australia Group, Missile Technology Control Regime, and Nuclear Suppliers Group, each with a common control list and national export controls. The Wassenaar Arrangement (WA) was established in 1996 as the successor to CoCom, a Cold War era control regime. WA's members control exports under national discretion, with a common control list. They pledge disclosure and consultation on export licenses, with some groups adhering to a \"no undercut\" provision. These organizations operate by consensus and face institutional limitations. The Wassenaar Arrangement operates by consensus and faces institutional limitations. Critics argue that its reliance on consensus makes it ineffective, as it results in minimal reporting requirements and prevents effective pre-export consultation among member states. Industry representatives emphasize the importance of effective multilateral controls for export items. Industry representatives stress the necessity of effective multilateral controls for export items, particularly criticizing unilateral export policies towards China. They argue that adherence to export controls by all capable states is crucial for their effectiveness, noting the lack of consensus among Wassenaar Arrangement countries on technology transfer limits to China. This lack of consensus, combined with stringent domestic controls and minimal multilateral constraints, is seen as detrimental to American companies by industry spokesmen. Industry spokesmen criticize the U.S. for strict licensing policies towards China and lack of effort to convince allies to follow suit. Proponents of tighter export restrictions argue that America's leadership in export controls is essential for non-proliferation efforts. They believe that weakening export restrictions in Washington undermines efforts to strengthen the Wassenaar Arrangement. Industry spokesmen and advocates of heightened export controls believe that the United States must lead by example in strengthening export restrictions to convince other nations to follow suit. They argue that relying solely on consensus-based negotiations in multilateral fora is ineffective and detrimental to national security. Both groups emphasize the importance of adopting controls first and then persuading other countries to do the same. The debate over export controls revolves around the need for consensus on which countries and goods pose a threat. While there is agreement to restrict dual-use items to certain 'countries of concern,' consensus breaks down when it comes to countries like China. This lack of consensus raises the question of whether the United States should impose controls unilaterally. The debate over export controls revolves around consensus on target countries and goods posing a threat. The dilemma in U.S. export control policy to China is balancing economic benefits with national security risks. The debate over U.S. export control policy towards China focuses on balancing economic benefits with national security risks. Some in the business community argue that current controls are too stringent, hindering technology transfers to China. Chinese companies avoid involving U.S. companies in bids due to delays in the U.S. licensing process. The U.S. export control policy towards China is debated for balancing economic benefits and national security risks. Chinese companies avoid involving U.S. firms in bids due to delays in the licensing process, leading to concerns about China's acquisition of dual-use technology. The Cox Commission found that China illegally obtained missile and satellite technology, evading export controls and end-user controls on high-performance computers. This raises concerns about the need for stricter controls. The Cox Commission found that China illegally obtained missile and satellite technology, evading export controls and end-user controls on high-performance computers. This raises concerns about the need for stricter controls and greater enforcement of export controls against China. China has also been implicated in nuclear, missile, and chemical proliferation activities. On June 19, 2007, BIS published a final rule titled \"Revisions and Clarification of Export and Re-export Controls for the People's Republic of China,\" which includes a new licensing requirement for certain products for military end-use in China, a validated end-user (VEU) program, and a requirement to obtain. The final rule includes a new licensing requirement for certain products for military end-use in China, a validated end-user (VEU) program, and a requirement to obtain an end-user statement for certain licensed products. The concern driving the proposed rule is that the export of commercial technology to certain end-users is undermining the arms embargo against China. The new licensing policy has two components: new military end-use controls for the PRC and a revised License Review Policy for national security controlled items. Industry has questioned the scope and efficacy of these new controls. The licensing policy includes new military end-use controls for China and a revised License Review Policy for national security controlled items. It requires a license for the export of certain items to China, previously controlled for anti-terrorism reasons. The new rule by BIS requires a license for exporting items to China for military end-uses, with a presumption of denial for items contributing to China's military capabilities in key weapons systems. The Final Rule by BIS requires a license for exporting items to China that would significantly contribute to their military capabilities in key weapons systems. It also raises the exemption threshold for obtaining End-Use Statements from the Ministry of Foreign Commerce of China. The BIS Final Rule requires a license for exporting items to China that enhance their military capabilities. It increases the exemption threshold for End-Use Statements from $5,000 to $50,000 for most goods, but now covers all license applications reaching this threshold. The VEU component allows trusted PRC civilian end-users to receive items without a license if approved by BIS. The BIS Final Rule requires a license for exporting items to China that enhance their military capabilities. The VEU program allows eligible end-users to receive items without a license if approved by BIS through an applications process evaluating various criteria. China's Minister of Foreign Commerce announced that companies seeking VEU status must obtain authorization before inspections. Not all items on the CCL qualify for export under this program, and items controlled for crime control or missile technology do not qualify. Approved VEU applications will include a list of eligible items for export. The VEU program allows for the export of approved items to validated end-users, with the list of eligible items expandable by the ERC. Once approved, VEUs can import from any exporter. The program aims to streamline licensing processes for certain companies, freeing up resources for more complex applications. On October 2, 2007, BIS expanded the VEU program to India, with General Electric India being the first eligible company on June 17, 2009. The first five VEU companies were announced on October 19, 2007, including Applied Materials China, National Semiconductor, Boeing Hexcel AVIC I Joint Venture, SMIC, and HHNEC. These companies imported licensed goods worth $54.3 million in 2006. In January 2008, the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control accused two entities of misconduct. The Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control accused AVIC I and HHNEC of diversion risks due to their affiliations with government-owned companies doing business with the Chinese military. Some entities affiliated with these companies have violated U.S. proliferation sanctions and export control laws. BIS Undersecretary Mario Mancuso defended the companies, stating they have a history of using U.S. technology. The controversy surrounding the Validated End-User (VEU) program with China continues, with a GAO study recommending its suspension due to the inability to conduct on-site reviews of validated end-users. The companies involved maintain a history of using U.S. technology and argue that the VEU judgment was based on data, not conjecture. The Validated End-User (VEU) program with China faces controversy as on-site reviews of validated end-users cannot be conducted. The lack of criteria for selecting candidates for on-sites and procedures for the review process is highlighted by GAO. Commerce has conducted checks under the 2004 end-use verification understanding, but these checks require an end-use statement from MoFCom, hindering trade facilitation. BIS announced full implementation of the VEU to China on January 13, 2009. The Validated End-User (VEU) program with China faced controversy as on-site reviews of validated end-users could not be conducted. BIS announced full implementation of the VEU to China on January 13, 2009, with procedures to ensure secure operation. Representative Markey cited concerns about VEU approved entity Aviza Technology China sharing an address with a sanctioned state-owned firm. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) regulates dual-use exports, consulting with other agencies for input on license applications. The Department of Defense conducts national security reviews for referred applications, while the Department of Energy reviews dual-use applications for nuclear uses. The Department of Energy reviews dual-use license applications for nuclear uses and end-users, while the State Department's Directorate of Defense Trade Controls administers the International Traffic in Arms Regulations for weapons and military technology exports. Industry leaders have identified issues with overlapping jurisdiction between Commerce and State Departments for certain dual-use products. The overlapping jurisdiction between Commerce and State Departments for dual-use products creates confusion for exporters applying for licenses. Extended approval times for licenses affect the reliability of U.S. suppliers and hinder manufacturers' and customers' planning. The licensing system does not keep up with technological advancements, foreign availability of dual-use items, and the economic impact of export controls. Additionally, there is no opportunity for judicial review of licensing decisions. Export administration officials conduct thorough, fair, and expedited license reviews, checking proposed export items against controlled lists and investigating issues on a case-by-case basis to prevent sensitive technologies from falling into the wrong hands. National security is seen as the primary concern, with foreign availability and economic impact considered secondary. Some analysts question if the Department of Commerce, which houses the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), is the right place for export control due to its focus on promoting exports. However, others argue that the involvement of agencies like the Department of Defense ensures a balanced approach to national security goals."
