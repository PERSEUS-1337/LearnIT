    "content": "Congress passed the FY2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act on March 23, 2018 (H.R. 1625), which included Agriculture appropriations bills from both the House and Senate Committees. The House had also passed a consolidated bill (H.R. 3354) that included agriculture. The final appropriation was facilitated by new budget caps in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-123). The House passed an eight-bill consolidated appropriation, H.R. 3354, with the Agriculture bill as Division B on September 14, 2017. The enacted Agriculture appropriation is $23.3 billion, $2.1 billion more than FY2017, including the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The Administration proposed $15.8 billion, the House passed $20 billion, and the Senate reported $20.53 billion. The enacted FY2018 Agriculture appropriation is $146 billion, including discretionary and mandatory spending. The Trump Administration proposed $15.8 billion, the House passed $20 billion, and the Senate reported $20.53 billion for the Agriculture bill. The Agriculture appropriations bill funds the USDA and FDA, excluding the U.S. Forest Service. It also includes CFTC funding in even-numbered fiscal years. Jurisdiction lies with the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations. The Agriculture appropriations bill, under the jurisdiction of the Committees on Appropriations, focuses on discretionary spending for agency operations and grant programs. Discretionary spending is controlled annually through appropriations acts, with the budget resolution process setting spending limits. The annual budget resolution process sets spending limits for discretionary appropriations, while mandatory spending is controlled by budget rules during the authorization process. In FY2018 Agriculture appropriations, discretionary appropriations were 16% of the total, with mandatory spending comprising 84%. In FY2018 Agriculture appropriations, discretionary spending was 16% of the total, with mandatory spending making up 84%. $99 billion of the $123 billion mandatory amount was attributed to programs in the 2014 farm bill. The largest discretionary spending items included WIC, rural development, agricultural research, FDA, foreign food aid, farm assistance program salaries and loans, food safety inspection, conservation, and animal and plant health programs. The main mandatory spending items in Agriculture appropriations include Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), child nutrition programs, crop insurance, and farm commodity and conservation programs. SNAP is an \"appropriated entitlement\" while the Commodity Credit Corporation operates on a line of credit. Annual appropriations fund these programs. The nutrition program funding is based on projected spending needs, while the CCC operates on a line of credit. Changes in Agriculture appropriations have generally mirrored changes in the bill's total discretionary limit. Funding peaked in FY2010, declined through FY2013, and has since increased. Historical comparisons may require adjustments for inflation and other factors. Prior to FY2018 enactment, the discretionary spending authorized for each appropriations title since FY2008 is represented in Figure 3. The total of positive stacked bars exceeded the official allocation due to budgetary offsets from negative amounts in Title VII general provisions and other adjustments. General provisions had net negative impacts mainly from rescissions and limits on mandatory programs. The Trump Administration's FY2018 budget request was released later than usual in 2017, with a proposed 21% reduction for USDA programs. The budget outline coincided with Congress finalizing FY2017 appropriations. The FY2018 budget request overlapped with Congress finalizing FY2017 appropriations. The explanatory statement for FY2017 addressed Congress's role in setting funding levels for FY2018. The Administration released its full FY2018 budget request on May 23, 2017, along with budget summaries from USDA and FDA. In May 2017, the Administration released its FY2018 budget request, including budget summaries from USDA and FDA. The Trump Administration requested $15.82 billion for Agriculture appropriations, $5.3 billion less than in FY2017. Congressional appropriations committees evaluated the request and began considering their own bills in the summer of 2017. In the summer of 2017, congressional appropriations committees evaluated the FY2018 budget request from the Administration. The House Appropriations Committee made \"302(b)\" allocations to subcommittees for markups, with the Agriculture Subcommittee receiving nearly $20 billion for FY2018. The Subcommittee marked up its bill on June 28, 2017, and the full Appropriations Committee passed it on July 12, 2017. The House Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee marked up its FY2018 bill on June 28, 2017, and the full Appropriations Committee passed an amended bill on July 12, 2017. The House later passed an eight-bill consolidated appropriation on September 14, 2017, with Agriculture as Division B, including budget-neutral amendments. The $20 billion discretionary total in the House-passed FY2018 Agriculture appropriation was $1.13 billion less than enacted in FY2017. The House-passed FY2018 Agriculture appropriation reduced funding compared to FY2017, with cuts to rural development, nutrition assistance, farm and conservation programs, department administration, and research. The Senate Appropriations Committee made adjustments in the absence of an adopted FY2018 budget resolution. The Senate Appropriations Committee allocated $20.53 billion for the Agriculture Subcommittee in FY2018. The Subcommittee marked up its bill on July 18, 2017, and the full Appropriations Committee passed the amended bill on July 20, 2017, with a discretionary total of $20.53 billion. The Senate Appropriations Committee passed an amended bill on July 20, 2017, with a discretionary total of $20.53 billion.

The Senate Appropriations Committee passed a bill with a discretionary total of $20.53 billion, reducing rural development by $119 million and agricultural research by $57 million while increasing foreign food aid by $140 million. Additionally, the bill included $220 million in reductions and continued funding through CRs due to the lack of an enacted appropriation for FY2018. The Office of Management and Budget prorates funding to agencies annually during a Continuing Resolution (CR) through apportionment. The first CR for FY2018 continued FY2017 funding levels with exceptions and anomalies for the agriculture appropriation. The Continuing Resolution for FY2018 includes a 0.6791% reduction across-the-board and sufficient funding for mandatory programs, such as nutrition programs. It also provides an increase of about $2 million for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program, totaling $238 million. Additionally, there is a technical correction for the computation of rescission to Section 32 funds. The Continuing Resolution for FY2018 includes a reduction across-the-board and funding for mandatory programs, with a technical correction for the computation of rescission to Section 32 funds. Additionally, there were multiple CRs extending provisions and anomalies, waiving PAYGO rules for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and avoiding a government shutdown through January. The government experienced multiple shutdowns due to the lack of a further CR or appropriation, leading to extensions through various CRs, including the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 raised budget caps for discretionary spending, provided disaster assistance for agriculture, amended farm bill provisions, and extended sequestration effects. It also authorized supplemental appropriations for crop and livestock losses from 2017 disasters and included revisions to agriculture programs with long-term policy implications. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 revised agriculture programs, changed farm bill statutes, raised discretionary spending caps, and provided $3.6 billion in disaster assistance in FY2018. This included $2.36 billion for states affected by 2017 hurricanes and wildfires, $941 million for conservation and watershed recovery, and $165 million in supplemental appropriations. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 allocated $2.36 billion in block grants to states for losses from 2017 hurricanes and wildfires. Additionally, it provided $941 million for conservation and watershed recovery, $165 million for rural water and wastewater recovery, and $89 million for other USDA disaster accounts. The act also included $1.4 billion in mandatory funding for the successor to the current farm bill, with $1.1 billion for dairy programs, $240 million for permanent disaster assistance programs, and a $62 million net addition for cotton programs. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 allocated funds for disaster recovery and farm programs, including $62 million net addition for cotton.

Unlike previous years, there are fewer changes to mandatory program spending, costing about $740 million against the discretionary limit of the bill. Sequestration is a process of automatic, largely across-the-board reductions triggered as a budget enforcement mechanism when federal spending would exceed. Sequestration is a budget enforcement mechanism triggered by exceeding statutory budget goals, resulting in across-the-board reductions in discretionary and mandatory spending. It is authorized in the BCA for discretionary spending through FY2021 and for mandatory spending through FY2027. Bipartisan Budget Acts in 2013, 2015, and 2018 have prevented sequestration on discretionary spending, except for FY2013. The Bipartisan Budget Acts in 2013, 2015, and 2018 raised discretionary budget caps to avoid sequestration. Sequestration still applies to certain mandatory spending accounts. The FY2021 sunset on sequestration of mandatory accounts has been extended four times. The sunset on sequestration of mandatory accounts has been extended four times by Congress to avoid sequestration of discretionary spending and as a budgetary offset for other bills, with extensions until FY2027. Congress extended sequestration on nonexempt mandatory accounts until FY2027 as an offset in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. Some farm bill mandatory programs are exempt from sequestration, such as nutrition programs and the Conservation Reserve Program. OMB determines exemptions for prior legal obligations in crop insurance and farm commodity programs. Sequestration on nonexempt mandatory spending in agriculture accounts continues in FY2018, with a 6.6% reduction rate resulting in payments at 93.4% of the authorized amount, leading to a reduction of about $1.3 billion.
