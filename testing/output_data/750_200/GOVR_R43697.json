    "content": "Ebola virus disease (Ebola, or EVD) is a severe, often fatal disease first detected in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 1976. It is spread through contact with infected bodily fluids and is not transmitted through the air. An outbreak in Guinea, West Africa in March 2014 is the largest and most persistent ever documented. The Ebola outbreak in Guinea, West Africa is the largest and most persistent ever documented. It has spread to Sierra Leone and Liberia, with nearly 10,000 cases and almost 5,000 deaths reported as of late October. WHO estimates actual cases may be higher due to inadequate surveillance capacities in the region. WHO estimates actual Ebola cases in the region may be two to four times higher than reported. Concerns exist about weak surveillance systems in neighboring countries missing cases. Mali reported its first EVD case, and suspicions of undetected cases in Cote d'Ivoire. WHO is sending a team to Mali for clinical management and contact tracing. Efforts are underway to develop drugs for EVD treatment and prevention, with plans to test two Ebola vaccines on 20,000 health workers and volunteers in January. In October, WHO planned to test two Ebola vaccines on 20,000 health workers and volunteers in January. A treatment might be available for use in Liberia by early November. Supportive care can reduce the fatality rate of EVD. Disease surveillance and containment measures can limit the spread of the disease. WHO has released manuals for patient care, safe burial practices, and diagnostic protocols to contain Ebola outbreaks. The Ebola virus circulating in West Africa is not new, and health experts are familiar with containment methods. However, the current outbreak in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone is spreading quickly due to inadequate health systems. This outbreak is unique as it emerged in West Africa, unlike previous outbreaks in the DRC and Gabon. The Ebola outbreak in West Africa has spread rapidly due to inadequate health systems. Outbreaks were previously concentrated in the DRC, Gabon, Sudan, South Sudan, and Uganda. Disease transmission along shared borders has led to outbreaks in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. Efforts to detect and contain the disease have been successful in Senegal and Nigeria, where the outbreak ended after infecting 20 people and killing eight. In Senegal and Nigeria, the Ebola outbreak was contained, with 20 people infected and eight deaths in Nigeria. A new EVD case is being investigated in Mali. Health workers in the US and Spain contracted EVD while caring for patients, but no additional cases have been reported. Previous outbreaks were in rural areas, but cases in urban areas have been reported. No secondary cases have been reported outside of Africa. The current Ebola outbreak is spreading in both rural and urban areas, with responders struggling to isolate cases in densely populated urban areas lacking access to clean water and sanitation. The scale and pace of transmission are unprecedented, with reported cases doubling every 15-40 days in affected countries. The Ebola outbreak is spreading rapidly in affected countries like Liberia and Sierra Leone, with cases doubling every 15-40 days. Weak health systems are contributing to the unabated spread. In a separate outbreak in the DRC, 66 cases and 49 deaths have been reported, including eight deaths among health workers. Since October 20, there have been 66 cases and 49 deaths in the DRC due to Ebola, including eight deaths among health workers. Congressional actions to address the outbreak have been accelerating, with legislation providing $88 million for the Ebola response. This is the seventh outbreak of EVD in the DRC since 1976. In September, Congress enacted legislation (P.L. 113-164) providing $88 million for the Ebola response, including $30 million for CDC activities in West Africa and $58 million for research on treatments and vaccines. The Department of Defense was allowed to reprogram $750 million for building Ebola treatment units in Liberia. The health systems in the affected countries were weak before the Ebola outbreak and have been overwhelmed by the crisis. WHO identifies six components of a health system: human resources, governance, financing, supply chain, service delivery, and information. The affected countries face severe deficiencies in these areas, exacerbated by the outbreak. The Ebola outbreak has worsened deficiencies in the health systems of affected countries, including human resources, governance, financing, supply chain, service delivery, and information. This has led to government ineptitude, mistrust among civilians, and attacks on health workers and facilities. The Ebola outbreak has led to attacks on health workers and facilities, with some governments using armed forces to enforce disease control measures and quarantine neighborhoods. Despite criticisms and protests, Liberia and Sierra Leone have stopped quarantining some areas. Despite concerns about quarantine practices, Liberia and Sierra Leone have stopped quarantining some neighborhoods. Per capita health spending in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone is low, leading to poor conditions in health facilities. Health workers often face delays in compensation, contributing to absenteeism and worker shortages during the Ebola outbreak. During the Ebola outbreak, government personnel faced delays in compensation, leading to absenteeism and worker shortages. Health workers in Liberia went unpaid for months, prompting some to leave their posts due to safety concerns and frustration. Financial aid from donors, including the United States, is being provided to support payment of salaries and other incentives for health workers in affected countries lacking sufficient resources for their Ebola response plans. During the Ebola outbreak, affected countries lack financial resources for their response plans. Donors have pledged support, but gaps remain. The United Nations estimates costs for Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. Health worker shortages in Liberia lead to lack of medical care for infected individuals. The Ebola outbreak in Liberia has led to severe shortages of health workers and clinics, leaving many infected individuals without access to medical care. This lack of health personnel and facilities is also a problem in Sierra Leone and Guinea, leading to people caring for the ill on their own and facilitating the spread of the virus. The shortage of medics and health facilities not only affects Ebola care but also leaves people with nowhere to go for non-EVD related issues. Observers are concerned about the impact of clinic closures on broader health issues. Before the Ebola outbreak, maternal and child mortality rates in the affected countries were among the highest in the world. In 2012, over 46,000 women died from pregnancy-related complications, and nearly 1 million children died before reaching their fifth birthday in the affected countries. Before the Ebola outbreak, maternal and child mortality rates in the affected countries were among the highest in the world. In 2012, nearly 1 million children died in the affected countries before reaching their fifth birthday, accounting for roughly 30% of all under-five deaths in sub-Saharan Africa. Most of these deaths could have been prevented with adequate access to vaccines, clean water, sanitation, and nutrition. Pregnant women are avoiding health facilities out of fear of contracting EVD, leading to clinic closures and constraints in medical attention during labor and delivery. More people are now dying in Liberia from treatable ailments and common diseases. Due to clinic closures and human resource constraints, many in Liberia are unable to receive medical attention for treatable ailments and common medical conditions. The lack of health workers in the country has led to high maternal and child mortality rates. Sierra Leone had only two doctors per 100,000 people between 2006 and 2013, while Liberia had fewer than 200 doctors before the Ebola outbreak, with only about 50 remaining afterwards. After the Ebola outbreak, Liberia was left with only about 50 doctors to provide clinical care, as many expatriate doctors were evacuated. The shortage of healthcare workers was exacerbated by Ebola deaths among them. WHO reported that 443 health workers contracted EVD, with 244 deaths, over 40% of which occurred in Liberia. Ebola control requires significant labor and resources, with WHO estimating that a facility treating 70 patients needs at least 250 healthcare workers. The Ebola outbreak led to a severe shortage of healthcare workers in Liberia, with only about 50 doctors remaining to provide clinical care. WHO estimates that a facility treating 70 Ebola patients requires at least 250 healthcare workers. To control the spread of EVD, affected countries would need over 13,000 health workers, with 5% coming from foreign countries and the rest being national staff. Countries are deploying medics to the region to address the lack of healthcare personnel. The Ebola outbreak has led to a severe shortage of healthcare workers in affected countries, with many health facilities closed. Access to clinics was already limited before the outbreak, and now large portions of the population lack access to general healthcare and Ebola-specific treatment. Patients often have to travel long distances for medical care, exacerbating health complications. Due to limited access to clinics, patients with Ebola often travel long distances in search of healthcare, leading to delayed health-seeking practices that reduce survival prospects and hinder virus containment efforts. Severe deficiencies in health services, including Ebola treatment centers and laboratories, exist in affected countries, with new facilities quickly reaching capacity. Liberia faces severe treatment shortages, with only 23% of needed beds for EVD patients. CDC estimates fatality rates could be halved with better access to healthcare. U.S. plans to support construction of 27 ETUs in Liberia. The U.S. plans to support the construction of 27 ETUs in Liberia to improve treatment capacity for EVD patients. Health experts are investigating a recent reduction in people seeking Ebola care, while safe disposal of dead bodies is also improving. EVD responders are working with community leaders to adapt traditional funeral practices that can facilitate EVD transmission. The poor quality of health care delivery is a concern, with inconsistent adherence to infection control protocol contributing to Ebola cases among health workers. In July, CDC investigated a cluster of Ebola cases among HCWs in Liberia and identified multiple opportunities for transmission, including exposure to patients with undetected Ebola and inadequate use of protective equipment. Inadequate use of personal protective equipment during cleaning and disinfection in hospitals, leading to potential transmission among healthcare workers. CDC Director noted inconsistent availability of gloves and hand washing during a tour of Liberia. Lack of running water in health centers hampers sanitation efforts. Poor conditions of health facilities discourage attendance, with power outages and water interruptions being common. Ambulance services are virtually non-existent in rural areas. Shortages of protective gear in health facilities, limited ambulance services in rural and urban areas, and lack of appropriate protective equipment for health workers contribute to the spread of Ebola in affected countries. Limited supplies and access to protective equipment increase the risk of transmission within health facilities. Due to limited supplies of protective equipment, health workers in Ebola treatment centers are prioritized, leaving those who work in the general population at risk of contracting and spreading the disease. Shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) are also noted in Ebola treatment units (ETUs), leading to a lack of antibiotics and safe blood for treatment. The price of disinfectants and medicine has doubled as people try to protect themselves. Health providers face shortages of antibiotics and safe blood to treat Ebola, with doubled prices for disinfectants and medicine. Transportation of aid workers and supplies is hindered by poor road conditions and limited air service. Efforts to improve alternative transportation routes have helped, but limited air service remains a challenge. Awareness about preventing EVD infection has increased, but poverty and infrastructural deficiencies continue to pose obstacles. Before Ebola hit, hunger was already a problem in the affected countries, particularly in rural areas. Consumption of wild animals is common practice, particularly in areas with high food insecurity. Health officials are expanding efforts to inform the public about the risks associated with eating wild animals, including fruit bats and other animals that might carry EVD. Without sufficient access to food, hunger often compels people to continue hunting and eating the animals. Efforts to contain the Ebola outbreak are hindered by weak laboratory and surveillance systems, leading to uncertainty about the number of cases and hindering containment efforts. Limited laboratory capacity has resulted in extensive diagnosis backlogs, particularly in Liberia where only 20% of cases have been confirmed through laboratory diagnosis. This uncertainty endangers health workers and others involved in the response. Efforts to contain the Ebola outbreak are hindered by extensive diagnosis backlogs, raising uncertainty about the number of cases and hindering containment efforts. International responses are accelerating, but the financial requirements for containment are increasing as the outbreak spreads. WHO estimated it would take $4.8 million to contain the outbreak in March, with over 200 cases in Guinea and fewer than a dozen in Liberia by the end of April. In March, WHO estimated it would cost $4.8 million to contain the Ebola outbreak. By August, the estimated cost rose to $490 million as the outbreak spread to Sierra Leone and Nigeria, with 3,685 cases and 1,841 deaths. The outbreak has caused social and economic disruptions, infecting over 10,000 people. In September, the U.N. established UNMEER to coordinate the international response. The United Nations established the U.N. Mission for Ebola Emergency Response (UNMEER) in September to coordinate the international response to the outbreak, which has infected over 10,000 people. The U.N. Security Council urged member states to support affected countries and contribute to a $988 million plan addressing health and social impacts of the outbreak. Roughly half of the funds would be spent on health programs, while the rest would address issues like food insecurity and economic disruptions. Donors have contributed $493 million towards the UN plan to address the Ebola outbreak, with an additional $279 million pledged. Resources are also being provided for addressing the outbreak outside of the UN response, totaling $894 million committed and $938 million pledged for preparedness needs. WHO and UNOCHA may revise their requests. The World Health Organization is leading the response to the Ebola outbreak, requesting donors to provide $490 million for building referring and isolation centers with over 1,500 beds. In 2014, WHO requested $490 million for Ebola Response Roadmap, including building 158 centers with 1,500 beds, increasing diagnostic capacity, and attracting 13,000 health workers. Pledges for health workers have increased, but human resource constraints hinder containment efforts. Countries like Cuba and the U.S. have pledged medical support. Several countries have pledged medical support to the region, including Cuba's commitment to deploy 165 health professionals, the U.S. commitment to deploy 65 U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps officers for providing Ebola care, Britain's provision of 750 troops including medical officers, and China's pledge to send over 170 health workers. The African Union and East African Community have also committed to sending health workers. In response to human resource constraints, the Liberian Government, WHO, CDC, and other partners developed the Community Care Campaign targeted at the 400,000 most vulnerable households in Liberia. The Community Care Campaign, developed by the Liberian Government, WHO, CDC, and partners, targets the 400,000 most vulnerable households in Liberia. It involves setting up community care centers managed by NGOs, community health workers, and family members of EVD patients to complement Ebola Treatment Units. The campaign will later expand to cover the entire country and region. The United States is the top funder of the international Ebola response, with financial support totaling $344.6 million as of October 22. The Department of Defense plans to spend over $1 billion on containing the outbreak in West Africa. The U.S. has allocated $344.6 million for Ebola responses. President Obama appointed an Ebola Czar to coordinate domestic and global efforts. The U.S. Global Ebola strategy aims to control the outbreak, mitigate impacts, establish leadership, and enhance global health security. Focus is on Liberia, with involvement in all three affected countries. The U.S. has allocated $344.6 million for Ebola responses, with a focus on Liberia. Nearly 900 U.S. Government personnel are stationed in the region, including 700 military personnel. Efforts are coordinated through USAID and CDC, with contributions from other departments. Since 2005, U.S. pandemic preparedness efforts have been primarily implemented through USAID and CDC, with contributions from other departments like Agriculture, Defense, and State. USAID has invested approximately $1 billion in helping countries detect, prepare for, and respond to outbreaks like Ebola. In FY2014, USAID spent $72.5 million through the Emerging and Pandemic Threats program. In FY2014, USAID spent $72.5 million on pandemic preparedness efforts through the Emerging and Pandemic Threats program, which operates in 18 countries in Africa and Asia. The program focuses on viral detection and risk determination in wildlife, livestock, and human populations. USAID's pandemic preparedness efforts focus on viral detection and risk determination in wildlife, livestock, and human populations. This includes assessing public health threats, determining transmission methods, integrating a \"one health\" approach, building outbreak response capacity, and promoting risk reduction actions. A Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) has been deployed to West Africa to coordinate the U.S. Government's response. USAID has deployed a Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) to West Africa to coordinate the U.S. Government's response to the Ebola outbreak, committing over $300 million for combating Ebola. Resources provided include treatment beds, protective equipment, and hygiene kits to prevent the spread of disease. USAID is supporting the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies to raise public awareness of Ebola's transmission, teach prevention practices, train volunteers, and provide hygiene kits. Funds have been reprogrammed from Global Health and International Disaster Assistance accounts for these efforts. CDC funds global pandemic preparedness through various accounts. CDC has reprogrammed funds from various accounts to support global pandemic preparedness efforts, including the Global Disease Detection program. Additional funding has been requested for activities related to the Global Health Security Agenda. CDC has requested $45 million in FY2015 to support the Global Health Security Agenda, accelerating efforts to detect, prevent, and respond to global infectious disease threats like Ebola. CDC supports pandemic influenza preparedness in over 50 countries through various partnerships and expert deployments. In March 2014, CDC teams assisted Guinea and Liberia in characterizing and controlling the Ebola outbreak. CDC teams traveled to Guinea and Liberia in March 2014 to help Health Ministries control the Ebola outbreak. After a brief decline in cases, new outbreaks occurred, prompting CDC to resume technical assistance efforts. In addition to training airport personnel and displaying Ebola-specific travel messages, CDC has committed over $16.7 million towards the response efforts as of October 22, 2014. CDC is providing assistance with electronic messages and posters at airports in affected countries for Ebola. DOD has committed $22 million to set up a field hospital in Liberia to treat EVD cases among healthcare workers. HHS will deploy 65 officers to manage and staff the hospital in Liberia. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps will deploy 65 officers to Liberia to manage and staff a hospital. Military personnel will establish and supply the facility, but not provide direct medical care. President Barack Obama announced the launch of \"Operation United Assistance\" on September 16, which will involve the deployment of roughly 4,000 U.S. military forces to Monrovia, Liberia. The operation will support the coordination of U.S. and international relief efforts, provide medical personnel to train up to 200 health workers weekly, and establish a field hospital. Operation United Assistance will establish 12 treatment centers in Liberia with 100-bed capacity each. The first 22-bed ETC is expected to be completed by the end of October, with three more to follow in November. Over 700 U.S. military personnel, including personnel from the U.S. Naval Medical Research Center, are in the region operating three mobile medical labs for EVD testing. Congress has approved DOD reprogramming requests to fund the operation and related activities. Total DOD funding for the global Ebola response is expected to exceed $1 billion. The current Ebola outbreak has overwhelmed the governments of Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia, with insufficient capacity to detect, treat, and prevent the spread of disease. Congress has held hearings on the outbreak and enacted measures to support Operation United Assistance and related activities. The Ebola outbreak has weakened health systems and spread globally. Congress enacted legislation to expand responses and provide funds. WHO estimated 13,000 health workers are needed to contain the outbreak. Foreign governments and organizations are deploying medics and health workers. The Administration may request additional funds to contain the outbreak. The Ebola outbreak requires 13,000 health workers to contain it. Foreign governments and organizations are deploying medics, but there are human resource constraints, especially in Liberia. The United States is partnering with WHO and other groups to develop a Community Care Campaign. Doctors Without Borders has expressed concerns about infection control in the CCCs. Doctors Without Borders (MSF) has raised concerns about the Community Care Campaign, warning that without proper infection control, supplies, trained staff, and supervision, CCCs could become \"contamination centers.\" WHO also acknowledges the risk of virus transmission within CCCs if implementation lacks quality control. Inconsistent adherence to infection protocols is contributing to Ebola cases among health workers. The Community Care Campaign faces challenges with quality control, particularly in ensuring consistent adherence to infection control protocols among health workers and lay personnel. Concerns arise about the spread of Ebola from family care providers to other community members, prompting WHO to recommend limiting care to one family member per patient. WHO recommends that only one family member provide care for each patient in CCCs to prevent the spread of EVD to the community. However, challenges may arise in enforcing this recommendation due to common collective familial care practices in Liberia. Other factors like loss of income and emotional stress could also impact adherence to this guideline. Only one family member should provide care in CCCs to prevent EVD spread. Challenges include loss of income, separation from family, and emotional stress. IPC protocol mandates PPE for handling EVD patients' linen, cleaning CCCs, and burial. Waste management is crucial to prevent EVD spread within CCCs. Deficiencies in waste management exist in affected countries. The affected countries face deficiencies in waste management, with less than 20% having access to improved sanitation facilities in 2012. Ensuring strict adherence to IPC protocol among lay care takers without medical training may be a challenge, especially if they lack access to sanitation themselves. Monitoring and supervision are critical for the success of the approach, as many community health workers and members have never provided care in CCCs before. The Community Care Campaign emphasizes the need for daily supervisory visits by trained health care workers to ensure compliance with IPC protocols, including proper use of PPE. Poor supply chain management in publicly funded health clinics leads to interruptions in medical supplies. Due to poor supply chain management, health clinics in affected countries lack essential medical supplies like gloves, masks, and gowns, leading to EVD infections among workers. WHO and partners face challenges in ensuring continuous supply to CCCs, advising Ministries of Health to take necessary precautions. The USAID is implementing the Community Care Campaign in Liberia by providing 9,000 community care kits to be used in homes. NGOs are overseeing the management of Community Care Centers with autonomy over USAID grants. The White House reports that the United States Government is actively involved in this effort. Questions have been raised about U.S. oversight and implementation of the Community Care Campaign in Liberia, particularly regarding the management of CCCs and quality control. Critics have also pointed out budget cuts affecting WHO's effectiveness in responding to the Ebola outbreak. Budget cuts under WHO's reform efforts have reduced outbreak response capacity. Critics argue that staff reductions and bureaucratic issues have further hampered WHO's effectiveness in containing outbreaks. WHO's response to outbreaks has been hindered by bureaucratic bloat and underqualified staff with political connections. Weak health systems, inadequate capacity, and insufficient international responses have sparked debates on WHO's role. Some suggest a \"Health Systems Fund\" administered by WHO to build long-term capacity and address crises like Ebola. Some argue for a \"Health Systems Fund\" to address long-term health system capacity and crises like Ebola, but concerns about WHO's ability to lead due to sovereignty issues exist. Weak health systems in West Africa contribute to the rapid spread of Ebola, prompting donors to rethink disease-based funding approaches. In the early 2000s, donors shifted to disease-based funding through non-governmental groups, sparking debate on its impact on health systems. Supporters argue it strengthens oversight, while opponents claim it worsens human resource shortages and weakens public sectors. The introduction of PEPFAR intensified this debate. The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) was introduced to address the HIV/AIDS epidemic by providing funding to non-governmental organizations and local partners to establish care facilities. While successful in saving lives and preventing infections, the U.S. became the primary supporter for millions of at-risk individuals globally. In the second phase of PEPFAR, resources were allocated to strengthen health systems for countries to take over. In the third phase of PEPFAR, there is a debate on the use of funds for building health systems. A 2013 GAO report highlighted that 21% of PEPFAR funds were spent on capacity building projects. PEPFAR Country Coordinator Deborah Birx aims to allocate 50% of resources to care and treatment activities. Health system advocates are concerned about the allocation of funds. Deborah Birx aims to allocate 50% of PEPFAR resources to care and treatment activities, as mandated. Health system advocates are concerned that budgetary reforms may jeopardize efforts to strengthen health systems. The U.S. Congress also faces a dilemma with the current Ebola outbreak, as affected countries require focused support to contain it. However, without support for strong health systems, countries may struggle to detect, prevent, or respond to future disease outbreaks. Ken Isaacs from Samaritan's Purse highlighted the importance of supporting the development of strong health systems to effectively respond to disease outbreaks, such as Ebola. USAID has established a working group to strengthen health systems and support healthcare delivery during the outbreak. USAID has set up an Ebola Health Systems Strengthening working group to aid in healthcare delivery and enhance health systems post-outbreak. Despite efforts from PEPFAR and other U.S.-funded programs, there is no specific allocation for health system strengthening. Majority of health aid is directed towards specific diseases, leaving limited resources for broader health system activities. This may prompt Congress to review global health fund allocation. The ongoing Ebola outbreak has prompted various U.S. agencies to respond, with the Department of State leading diplomatic efforts, USAID coordinating responses, CDC managing public health activities, and DOD providing support to foreign armed forces. Each agency, except USAID, can utilize flexible authorities to address the crisis. This situation may lead Congress to review global health fund allocation for future health system strengthening activities. The Department of State coordinates diplomatic efforts through existing channels, CDC can use various accounts for outbreak responses, and DOD supports domestic and international health activities. The DOD budget supports domestic and international health activities without detailed congressional direction. USAID often receives specific directives from Congress on fund usage, limiting its ability to address unforeseen events like the Ebola outbreak without reallocating funds. USAID is reprogramming funds to address the current Ebola outbreak, drawing from ongoing health efforts. Supporters view the appropriation structure as a tool for overseeing health programs, while opponents argue it limits agility in the field and sustainability of health and development issues. The congressional directives hinder agility in health and development efforts, creating artificial segmentation. Disease outbreaks are unpredictable, but with surveillance and response mechanisms, impact can be minimized. USAID focuses on pandemic preparedness in East and Central Africa, South and Southeast Asia. The emergence of Ebola in West Africa may lead to another outbreak in the region, posing challenges for affected countries. The FY2015 budget request for pandemic preparedness is lower than the previous year, posing challenges for affected countries in West Africa. Even if funding is increased, it may not be enough to meet current demands. Experts predict the outbreak can be contained by the end of January, but the high death tolls are causing disruptions and may have long-term effects in the region. MSF has reported significant impacts on the affected population. The high death tolls from the Ebola outbreak in West Africa are disrupting social structures and may have long-term effects in the region. MSF reports that affected villages in Sierra Leone have lost many adult community members, leaving vulnerable populations without resources. Concerns also arise about the growing number of orphaned children, who are particularly vulnerable to marginalization. The Ebola outbreak in West and Central Africa has worsened the orphan crisis in the region, with over 28 million children orphaned in 2012. The outbreak is straining government healthcare systems, leading to higher child and maternal mortality rates due to a lack of health personnel, resources being diverted to Ebola treatment centers, and public avoidance of health facilities. The Ebola outbreak in West and Central Africa has led to a decrease in health personnel, diversion of resources to Ebola treatment centers, and public avoidance of health facilities. The full health impact of the outbreak may not be known until it is contained, prompting a potential reevaluation of how U.S. global health assistance funds are allocated. Advocates may push for increased support for various health and development issues exacerbated by Ebola, such as maternal and child mortality, orphanhood, poverty, and food scarcity. The Ebola outbreak in sub-Saharan Africa has led to various health and development issues worsening, including maternal and child mortality, child vulnerability, poverty, food scarcity, and water-borne infections. There is no specific cure, treatment, or vaccine for Ebola, but experimental treatments and vaccines are being tested in clinical trials to improve survival rates. Several experimental treatments and vaccines are being tested in clinical trials to determine their safety and efficacy. The debate around the appropriate use of experimental drugs, particularly in terms of equity, is ongoing. The ethical concern of administering untested drugs to African patients is highlighted, as well as the potential risks of ineffectiveness or serious side effects. WHO announced in August that it is ethical to offer unproven interventions to African patients during the Ebola outbreak. In October, they planned to test two Ebola vaccines on 20,000 health workers and volunteers. WHO planned to test two Ebola vaccines on 20,000 health workers and volunteers in January. An experimental treatment might be available in Liberia by early November. A meeting was convened to fast track testing and deployment of vaccines to impact the Ebola epidemic. WHO convened a meeting with agencies to fast track testing and deployment of Ebola vaccines to impact the epidemic. Bordering countries are at risk of seeing Ebola cases, with Mali reporting its first case. WHO is assisting neighboring countries in building EVD surveillance and response plans. The WHO is assisting neighboring countries in building Ebola surveillance and response plans. A study by Oxford University suggests that future Ebola outbreaks may occur in Central and West Africa due to the presence of fruit bats in forested areas. Changes in human mobility could impact the spread of Ebola cases. Urban areas and countries with limited pandemic preparedness are at risk for future outbreaks. The potential for future Ebola outbreaks in urban areas and countries with limited pandemic preparedness capacity raises questions about the effectiveness of the U.S. response, support for pandemic preparedness efforts, impact of disease-specific funding, reprogramming of USAID funds, and the capacity building efforts in affected countries and regions."
