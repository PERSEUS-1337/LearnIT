    "content": "The report summarizes the USDA's efforts to establish a national animal traceability system for rapid disease outbreak response. Despite economic benefits, federal proposals face controversy within the U.S. cattle industry. The report discusses the background of animal ID and traceability, reviews arguments for and against a national system, and outlines the current U.S. system development. The report discusses the controversy surrounding the current U.S. system of animal ID and traceability, including arguments for and against a national system. It also outlines unresolved issues related to program development and provides a brief overview of international organizations involved in setting standards for animal health and trade. On February 5, 2010, USDA announced a new approach called Animal Disease Traceability to replace the National Animal Identification System. This new approach allows states and tribal nations to choose their own level of animal ID and traceability for livestock populations. The USDA announced the Animal Disease Traceability framework, giving states and tribal nations flexibility in choosing their own level of animal ID and traceability for livestock populations. However, all animals moving in interstate commerce must have a form of ID for traceability back to their originating state. USDA collaborated with animal health officials to develop a Traceability Regulation Working Group following the announcement of the Animal Disease Traceability framework. The working group, consisting of state, tribal nation, and APHIS officials, is responsible for gathering feedback and making recommendations for a proposed rule. APHIS also organized a forum for state and tribal officials to discuss and provide feedback on the new framework in March 2010. In March 2010, a forum was held for animal health officials to discuss the new framework for animal disease traceability. In August 2010, USDA released two publications outlining current recommendations for a proposed rule. APHIS organized public meetings to gather feedback from officials and producers. USDA's traceability framework is still evolving, with states and tribal nations responsible for managing traceability programs. States can choose to implement mandatory animal ID and traceability systems or utilize existing systems to combat diseases like brucellosis and tuberculosis. Public forums have been held to gather feedback on the framework. The USDA's traceability framework is evolving, with states and tribal nations managing programs to combat diseases like brucellosis and tuberculosis. States can choose to implement mandatory animal ID systems or utilize existing ones. Federal rules will apply to livestock moving in interstate commerce, requiring official identification and an Interstate Certificate of Veterinary Inspection. Data collection and storage will be done by state authorities, not the federal government. The USDA's traceability framework is evolving, with federal rules applying to livestock moving in interstate commerce. Livestock will need official identification and an Interstate Certificate of Veterinary Inspection. Exemptions will be defined, and acceptable identification types will be outlined in federal regulations. The animal disease traceability capacity of each state and tribal nation will be evaluated according to performance standards defined through rulemaking by the Traceability Regulation Working Group. The Traceability Regulation Working Group, along with state and tribal animal health officials, will define performance standards for animal traceability. States and tribal nations will have detailed cooperative agreements with APHIS, with federal funding provided through annual agreements. No funding for animal traceability is designated in the FY2011 agriculture appropriations bill. The FY2011 agriculture appropriations bill does not designate funding for animal traceability, but the Senate Committee on Appropriations report suggests funding could be considered later. USDA will implement a program for animal disease traceability through federal regulations and rulemaking processes, defining it in Title 9 of the Code of Federal Regulations. A proposed rule may be published in April. USDA will define animal disease traceability in Title 9 of the Code of Federal Regulations, with a proposed rule expected in April 2011. Major outbreaks of harmful animal diseases have caused significant economic damages. Major outbreaks of harmful animal diseases have led to the slaughter of millions of commercial animals and billions of dollars in economic damages. The economic impact extends beyond the farm to disrupt markets domestically and internationally, affecting consumers. The United States has been fortunate in avoiding catastrophic disease outbreaks like Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD) events in other countries. If a similar FMD outbreak were to occur in the US, the economic consequences could be staggering. The economic consequences of major animal disease outbreaks in the 1990s and early 2000s led to the development and implementation of animal identification and traceability systems in many countries. If a Foot-and-Mouth Disease outbreak were to hit the United States, it could cost the U.S. cattle industry $30 billion to $100 billion alone, as stated by House Agriculture Committee Chairman Collin Peterson in 2009. The economic impact of animal disease outbreaks in the 1990s and early 2000s led to the development of animal identification and traceability systems in many countries. These programs vary from voluntary to mandatory, focusing on animal health and food safety. Some countries like the EU, Japan, and South Korea have mandatory programs. Japan and South Korea are considering requiring traceability on imported meat products, adding a market access dimension to these programs. The United States, a major producer and exporter of livestock, is considering requiring traceability on imported meat products, which would impact market access. This is significant due to the country's leading position in beef and poultry production and ranking third in pork production globally. The United States is a top producer of beef, poultry, and pork globally. It leads in pork exports, is second in poultry exports, and third in beef exports. The country is also the top importer of beef. Animal identification (ID) is crucial for tracking individual farm animals or groups. Animal identification (ID) involves keeping records on individual farm animals or groups for tracking purposes from birth through the marketing chain. It includes information on the animal's origins, traceability, and a national database for ID combined with traceability. A national database of animal ID combined with traceability is essential for quick response to disease outbreaks or tainted food, minimizing threats to human and animal health. Different countries have varying animal ID systems, collecting information on the animal's origin and traceability. Animal ID systems vary in the amount and type of information collected, including details like birthplace, owner information, movements, and slaughter details. More advanced systems track additional data such as sex, breed, parentage, feed, pharmaceuticals, and product movement. The purpose of tracking animals and their products is for rapid response to disease outbreaks and food safety concerns. The movement of animal products from processing plant to retail consumer is tracked for animal health and food safety concerns. In the United States, animal ID focuses on health, tracing from birth to slaughter. Other countries like the EU, Japan, and South Korea focus on both health and safety. In the EU, Japan, and South Korea, animal ID focuses on both health and food safety, with comprehensive traceability systems extending to retail consumers. International buyers are demanding more information on the history of U.S. animal products, leading to the need for traceability systems to meet these demands. A national animal ID and traceability system in the United States has evolved to meet demands for information on how products are raised and prepared, and the marketing chain they follow. Proponents argue that the system enhances animal health surveillance and disease eradication by facilitating early detection of outbreaks. Critics raise concerns about the system's effectiveness and potential drawbacks. A national animal ID and traceability system in the United States aims to enhance animal health surveillance and disease eradication. It would facilitate early detection of dangerous outbreaks, identify the source of disease, and minimize economic impacts by controlling and eradicating animal diseases at regional and national levels. Regionalization or compartmentalization is a disease management tool that contains a disease outbreak to a specific zone, minimizing economic impact and facilitating re-establishing international market access. Increasing domestic marketing opportunities is essential for farmers and ranchers to exploit desirable production characteristics and command price premiums in certain retail markets. Universal bar codes on processed food, including meats, are widely used to manage products. Universal bar codes on processed food, including meats, are widely used by processors and retailers to manage inventories and add value to products. ID and traceability can help verify production methods for meat, eggs, or milk from animals raised according to specific standards. Government-coordinated programs, like USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service, provide livestock and meat producers with the opportunity to assure customers of consistent quality. The USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service operates a verification program that allows livestock and meat producers to confirm their manufacturing processes through independent audits. Suppliers verified under the \"Process Verified\" program can make marketing claims about breeds and feeding practices. Other traceability programs include the national organic certification program overseen by AMS. A traceability program for animal products would provide valuable post-mortem information on production techniques and increase transparency in the supply chain. It could track performance history of racing or show animals and be a management tool for producers. An animal ID and traceability program would be beneficial for tracking performance history of racing or show animals, increasing transparency in the supply chain, and helping producers maintain records on animal movements, health, and marketing activities. Additionally, it addresses food safety and national security concerns by collaborating with federal and state agencies to protect the food supply from threats to human health. Safety agencies collaborate with APHIS to protect the food supply from threats to human health, such as tuberculosis and foodborne illnesses like Salmonella and E. coli O157:H7. Improved traceback and animal ID systems could help with food recalls and containing the spread of illnesses. Enhanced traceback and animal ID systems could aid in food recalls, contain foodborne illnesses, and improve foreign marketing opportunities for animal products. Some in the food industry argue against these systems, citing concerns about their scientific basis, technical feasibility, and cost. The USDA's AMS developed an export verification program for U.S. plants after BSE appeared in North America in 2003. This program helps U.S. suppliers meet beef import specifications of countries like Japan, improving opportunities for niche markets. The USDA's AMS established standards for U.S. suppliers to meet beef import specifications of countries like Japan. EV is voluntary but necessary for access to foreign markets, enhancing U.S. export competitiveness. The lack of a standardized national animal identification system hindered the US from receiving \"negligible risk\" status for BSE from the OIE. This status would enhance international competitiveness and support domestic price structures for all producers. Additionally, it would improve animal welfare in response to natural disasters. Opponents argue that a national animal ID system invades privacy by collecting personal information and production methods, potentially leading to the disclosure of proprietary information. Critics argue that a national animal ID system could lead to privacy invasion and public disclosure of proprietary information, as well as increased costs and technical complexity. The implementation of a national animal ID system in the United States could heavily impact the cattle sector, with over 90% of the costs falling on them. The technology requirements for this program could also pose challenges for operators. Additionally, the system may favor vertical integration over family farms, leading to increased costs and technical complexities. The cattle industry faces the burden of implementing a national ID program, with individual animal tagging creating cost disadvantages for producers. Small operators may struggle to absorb these costs, impacting profit margins and market competitiveness. The national ID program for cattle faces challenges such as thin profit margins, disadvantages for family farms in price structure, and objections on religious grounds. Large retailers and meat packers may shift compliance costs to smaller farms, making it harder for them to stay in business. Some producers push back due to concerns about increased transparency at the farm level. Some producers are concerned that greater transparency at the farm level from thorough counting and reporting of livestock may lead to increased tax liabilities. The national animal ID and traceability program has evolved from state and national disease eradication programs. The USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) oversees animal health programs for disease eradication and control, including animal identification components like brucellosis ID tags. These tags were successful in eradicating brucellosis from U.S. commercial herds, leading to a decrease in animal ID usage. The USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) successfully eradicated brucellosis from U.S. commercial herds through a program that required animal identification. As a result, animal ID became less common as the program wound down. Certain classes of livestock, such as swine and sheep, have official identification requirements before entering interstate commerce. State laws and breed association rules also often require identification for animals participating in shows or races. U.S. animal ID programs vary in scope and methods, with limitations highlighted after the discovery of mad cow disease in 2003. Trading partners hesitated to reopen borders due to difficulties in tracing cattle movements. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) program, established in 2002, aimed to improve tracing of cattle movements to address concerns raised after the discovery of mad cow disease in 2003. The program, administered by USDA's APHIS, involved a state-federal-industry partnership allowing producers to voluntarily participate in national animal health safeguarding efforts. The USDA replaced the voluntary NAIS program with a state-based program that mandates traceability for livestock moving in interstate commerce due to criticism from the U.S. cattle sector. The USDA replaced the voluntary NAIS program with a state-based program mandating traceability for livestock in interstate commerce. NAIS aimed to cover major livestock and poultry species in the US, including cattle, hogs, sheep, goats, chickens, turkeys, and horses. The USDA implemented a state-based program mandating traceability for livestock in interstate commerce, replacing the voluntary NAIS program. NAIS focused on major livestock and poultry species, excluding household pets, and aimed to identify animals entering commerce or commingling with others at sales barns, fairs, or exhibits. The program was voluntary, with USDA's role being to promote and ensure adequate implementation at local and state levels. The USDA's involvement in the NAIS program was focused on popularizing it and ensuring adequate information for participants. They addressed issues such as prioritizing implementation by species, harmonizing animal ID programs, standardizing data elements, integrating technology, partnering with states, tribes, and industry, and advancing ID technologies. The USDA focused on popularizing the NAIS program by integrating technology, partnering with states, tribes, and industry, and advancing ID technologies. They published reports with participant guidance, technical standards, and implementation strategies. The USDA focused on popularizing the NAIS program by integrating technology, partnering with states, tribes, and industry, and advancing ID technologies. A Business Plan to Advance Animal Disease Traceability detailed recommended strategies and actions to enhance animal disease traceability. The NAIS User Guide provided guidance to producers and owners on how to participate in NAIS and how participation would benefit them. The Program Standards and Technical Reference document established data standards for NAIS, including formats for premises, animal, and group/lot identification numbers, official identification devices, and technology standards from ISO. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) utilized technology standards from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) to ensure system effectiveness in protecting U.S. agriculture from animal disease outbreaks. NAIS was not a food safety program but aimed to safeguard commercial interests. USDA set specific goals to increase the United States' animal disease traceability. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) aimed to increase disease response capabilities, limit disease spread, minimize economic impact, protect animal producers' livelihoods, and maintain market access. USDA's long-term goal was to identify and trace animals within 48 hours of a disease outbreak by accessing reliable data on animal ID and movement history. To meet the 48-hour identification and tracing goal during a disease outbreak, animal health officials need rapid access to complete data on animal ID and movement history. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) was designed to provide this information, allowing officials to quickly identify infected animals, their current locations, and other potentially exposed animals for containment and commercial damage limitation. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) was created to trace animal diseases from discovery to original premises, including all animals in contact. NAIS consisted of premises registration, animal identification, and tracking phases. States and tribes had to collect specific information for premises registration, such as premises identification number (PIN) and contact person. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) required states and tribes to collect key information for premises registration, including a premises identification number (PIN), entity name, contact details, location coordinates, operation type, activation and retirement dates, and alternative phone numbers. The PIN, a unique seven-digit number, remains unchanged even with a change of ownership. Multiple PINs could be assigned to a producer based on different animal production activities. The National Animal Identification System required premises registration with a unique seven-digit PIN, which remains unchanged even with a change of ownership. Premises were to be registered with state or tribal animal health authorities for free. USDA maintained premises information in a National Premises Information Repository to quickly notify producers of disease outbreaks. The National Animal Identification System required premises registration with a unique seven-digit PIN to protect private and confidential business information. Premises information would help notify producers quickly during disease outbreaks, allowing officials to locate at-risk animals and take necessary actions. However, as of September 6, 2009, only about 37% of premises were registered out of an estimated 1.4 million U.S. animal and poultry operations. Only 37% of premises were registered under the NAIS as of September 6, 2009, out of an estimated 1.4 million U.S. animal and poultry operations. USDA emphasized the need for higher participation levels to successfully implement the system. The second phase of NAIS involved assigning unique numbers to individual animals or specific groups, such as group IDs for animals like swine or poultry raised in confined lots and animal identification numbers (AIN) for each animal. The NAIS involved assigning unique numbers to individual animals or specific groups, such as group IDs for animals like swine or poultry raised in confined lots. An animal identification number (AIN) is a unique 15-digit number, with the first three numbers being the country code and the following 12 digits as the animal's unique identifying number. AIN devices include visual ear-tags, tattoos, or radio frequency identification devices. The USDA does not specify specific identification technologies beyond the minimum requirements for official identification. The use of RFID devices and injectable transponders for faster access to ID information is increasing. The use of RFID and injectable transponders for faster access to ID information is increasing in animal identification, reducing stress and improving data quality. Some animals are exempt from identification under NAIS if they pose a low disease risk or are only moved directly for personal consumption. USDA encourages all animal owners to register their premises for disease control, regardless of the animals' movements. The person caring for the animal can choose when to attach an ID, either shortly after birth or later on. The USDA recommends registering premises for disease control and attaching an ID on animals. Producers can choose to tag animals at birth or later. Animals should have an ID before moving to another location. Tagging services are available at auction markets for animals ready to be marketed. When animals are unloaded, they should be tagged before being mixed with animals from other premises. Producers bringing animals into their operation should maintain the official identification already on the animal. Group/lot identification numbers can be used for animals moving through the production chain as a group, common in the poultry and pork industries. Group/lot identification numbers (GINs) are commonly used in the poultry and pork industries to identify animals moving through the production chain as a group. The GIN is a 15-character number consisting of a seven-character PIN, a six-digit date, and a two-digit number to reflect the count of groups assembled at the same premises on the same day. Producers self-generate the GIN, which is maintained in their management records. The GIN is \"self-generated\" by the producer and maintained in their management records. It links each producer's livestock or poultry flock to the animal's birthplace. The identification protocol is tailored to different species groups and their unique characteristics. The third phase of NAIS focuses on timely access to accurate animal movement records to quickly locate at-risk animals during a disease outbreak. NAIS aimed to quickly locate at-risk animals during a disease outbreak by accessing accurate animal movement records. Producers could choose a NAIS-compliant animal tracking database to report animal movements, with only minimum tracing information required. This included the national premises identification number (PIN) and the animal ID number (AIN) or group ID number (GIN). The minimum traceback information required for participation in NAIS included the national premises identification number (PIN), animal ID number (AIN) or group ID number (GIN), date of the event, and the event itself. Other animal-specific data like age, species, and sex were standardized but not necessary for participation. Traceback information was recorded for notable movements between locations, excluding movements within a production unit for management purposes. The voluntary animal tracing component of NAIS was a public/private partnership where industry and states would operate and maintain Animal Tracking Databases (ATDs) containing animal location and movement records. The federal government would not maintain the ATDs; states and private entities would ensure confidentiality for participants. The USDA's plan for the National Animal Identification System involved states and private entities maintaining Animal Tracking Databases (ATDs) to ensure confidentiality. The federal government would operate the Animal Trace Processing System (ATPS) for officials to request information during disease outbreaks. ATDs were designed to provide timely reports on animal movements during health events. The USDA's National Animal Identification System involved maintaining Animal Tracking Databases (ATDs) for confidential tracking of animal movements during health events. State and federal officials would use the system for efficient disease containment in specific situations, such as confirmed positive tests for foreign animal diseases or conducting tracebacks for program diseases like brucellosis and tuberculosis. As of September 2008, about 40% of data retrieval was done within a 48-hour window. As of September 2008, 40% of potential premises in the United States had been registered in the National Animal Identification System, with varying participation rates across species and states. Poultry and sheep had a high registration rate of 95%, while cattle had the lowest at 18%. By September 2009, over 530,000 animal premises had been registered, representing 36.9% of estimated livestock and poultry farms. Over 530,000 animal premises have been registered in the National Animal Identification System, representing 36.9% of estimated livestock and poultry farms in the United States. USDA estimates that 70% of animals in a specific species need to be identified for effective disease outbreak response. USDA estimated that 70% of animals in a specific species need to be identified and traceable to their premises of origin for effective disease outbreak response. Dr. John Clifford, USDA's Chief Veterinary Officer, suggested a participation rate of 70% for traceability, but a higher rate of 90% may be needed for full benefits. Some supporters criticize USDA for slow progress in implementing an animal ID program. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) identified problems hindering effective implementation of the animal ID program, such as lack of prioritization among species, integration plan with existing requirements, and data requirements. USDA's NAIS Business Plan (2008) aimed to address these issues. The USDA's NAIS Business Plan (2008) aimed to address criticisms from the GAO about the animal ID program. Concerns were raised about low participation rates in the voluntary program, leading USDA officials to consider making it mandatory or increasing incentives for participation. The USDA's NAIS Business Plan aimed to address low participation rates in the voluntary program by considering making it mandatory or increasing incentives. The American Veterinary Medical Association and state animal health officials supported mandatory participation in NAIS. The Animal Health Association's livestock committee and various industry groups support a mandatory animal identification system, with key lawmakers expressing interest in its implementation. Peterson and DeLauro support implementing NAIS as a mandatory program to prevent losses from diseases. Opponents, mainly from the cattle industry, such as R-CALF, NCBA, and Farm-to-Consumer Legal Defense Fund, fear high costs and industry concentration. The cattle industry opposes the mandatory NAIS program due to concerns about high costs, industry concentration, and confidentiality of information. Some members of Congress have also expressed these concerns. The USDA announced that the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) would remain voluntary, despite calls for it to be mandatory. Proponents argue for mandatory participation, citing the need for traceability in the livestock industry and the costs associated with implementing an animal ID system. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) remains voluntary, with costs for tags, data systems, and traceability increasing as more requirements are imposed. The debate centers on who should pay for these expenses - the industry, government, or both. USDA suggests sharing costs, with database funded by government and identifying devices by producers. As more tracing requirements are imposed, large retailers and meat packers may shift compliance costs to farms and ranches, making it difficult for smaller, independent operations to survive. Larger, vertically integrated operations are better equipped to handle traceability costs. However, smaller plants with slower fabrication speeds may find niche markets if big meat plants reduce line speeds due to traceability costs. Costs forced big meat plants to reduce line speeds, smaller plants with slower fabrication speeds may be better equipped to implement traceability to the retail level and may find niche market opportunities. APHIS released a study on the economic benefits and costs of adopting USDA's NAIS, conducted by economists at Kansas State University in collaboration with researchers from other universities. The report provided estimates of the adoption of NAIS across multiple species and at varying participation rates. The researchers' best estimate of the adoption of NAIS across multiple species and participation rates showed annual costs of $228 million for full pre-harvest traceability with 100% participation. Cattle are individually ID tagged, swine are group ID tagged except for breeding animals, and poultry are uniquely group ID tagged. The annual estimated costs for implementing NAIS in the livestock industry would be around $228 million for full pre-harvest traceability with 100% participation. The cost increases to $304.2 million when horses are included. The majority of the costs, over 90%, are associated with the cattle sector, amounting to $5.97 per animal marketed due to individual animal ID requirements. Swine, sheep, goats, and poultry can often be traced using premises and group lot information. The cost of implementing NAIS in the livestock industry is mainly attributed to individual animal ID requirements for cattle, with an estimated cost of $3.30 to $5.22 per animal. In comparison, other livestock sectors have lower costs per animal: $0.059 for swine, $1.39 for sheep, $0.0007 for broilers, $0.002 for turkeys, and $0.0195 for layers. The economic benefits of NAIS with full participation exceed the costs. The economic benefits of NAIS with full participation easily exceed the costs, including substantial government savings, quick market re-establishment after disease outbreaks, expanded international market access, avoidance of significant losses, and increased consumer demand. The implementation of NAIS could lead to significant economic benefits, including avoidance of losses up to $1.32 billion per year over a 10-year period, increased consumer demand, and improved market access. However, concerns exist among producers regarding liability for issues beyond their control once animals leave the farm. Producers are concerned about liability for issues beyond their control once animals leave the farm. Documentation of management practices can help protect against liability and prove the origin and raising of animals. Producers are also worried about public scrutiny of their records under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Producers have concerns about potential misuse of information obtained through FOIA, but certain types of business information are exempt from access. In the 110th Congress, a provision addressing the protection of trade secrets and confidential business information in an animal ID system was deleted from a farm bill. The USDA regulations require disclosure of trade secrets and confidential business information in an animal ID system. South Korea plans to implement traceability requirements for imported beef by December 2010. The EU mandates individual identification and traceability for all suppliers. Japan does not currently require traceability for imported beef but has other specifications in place. The Democratic Party of Japan aims to address traceability if elected. The Democratic Party of Japan aims to implement traceability requirements for imported beef, aligning it with domestic beef standards. The party won a majority in the Japanese Diet and plans to prioritize this issue in their new administration. The DPJ aims to implement traceability requirements for imported beef, aligning with domestic standards. However, this issue may not be addressed early on as the party focuses on setting up its new administration. The importance of beef traceability is highlighted as a potential requirement for global beef trade. The WTO's Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures enforces rules on non-tariff trade barriers like traceability for global beef trade. Traceability measures for imports must be scientifically justified and equivalent to domestic standards. The USDA has invested $142 million since 2004 in traceability development. Since early 2004, the USDA has invested $142 million in the development of the National Animal Identification System (NAIS). Despite the significant funding, only about 40% of livestock producers participated in NAIS by 2009, with criticism from the U.S. cattle sector. In response to low participation rates and concerns from producers, Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack took action. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack conducted public listening sessions between April 15 and June 30, 2009, to gather feedback on the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) from livestock producers and stakeholders. The information obtained from these sessions and written comments would help in making decisions about the future of animal ID and traceability in the U.S. The future of animal ID and traceability in the United States was influenced by public feedback on the National Animal Identification System (NAIS). Secretary Vilsack announced the abandonment of NAIS in favor of a state-based system in 2010 due to concerns about slow implementation despite significant funding. The FY2009 USDA appropriation directed APHIS to make progress in implementing the NAIS program, with specific objectives from the agency's 2008 traceability business plan. The Administration proposed a slight funding increase to $14.6 million for FY2010, but the House Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee voted to eliminate funding for NAIS from the FY2010 appropriations bill. The Subcommittee voted to eliminate funding for USDA's NAIS from the FY2010 appropriations bill (H.R. 2997). Chairwoman Rosa DeLauro and Collin Peterson expressed frustration with the slow progress of the national sign-up for NAIS. The full committee's report (H.Rept. 111-181) noted the lack of an effective system despite receiving $142 million in funding since FY2004. USDA needs to provide details on implementing an effective ID system before funding continues. The Senate version of H.R. 2997 originally provided $14.6 million for the NAIS, but a floor amendment reduced funding to $7.3 million for FY2010. The amendment restricted the use of funds to ongoing NAIS activities and purposes. Continued investments in the current NAIS are deemed unwarranted until USDA provides details on implementing an effective ID system. The FY2010 funding for the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) was reduced to $5.3 million after amendments to H.R. 2997. The final funding level was set in the Agriculture appropriations bill signed into law as P.L. 111-80 by President Obama on October 21, 2009. The USDA claims authority to implement an animal ID program under the Animal Health Protection Act. The USDA claims authority to implement an animal ID program under the Animal Health Protection Act. In the 110th Congress, bills were proposed but not adopted to clarify USDA's authority and establish a national ID system. In the 111th Congress, bills were proposed to establish a Livestock Identification Board for a national ID system and to implement a comprehensive farm-to-consumer animal ID and meat traceability program. H.R. 3485 and other bills aimed to create new traceability systems for USDA-regulated meat, poultry, and FDA-regulated foods. The 111th Congress proposed bills for a national ID system and meat traceability program for livestock. These bills aimed to establish traceability systems for USDA-regulated meat, poultry, and FDA-regulated foods, with provisions for maintaining records and providing access for traceability purposes. The 111th Congress proposed bills for a national animal ID system and meat traceability program for livestock. Hearings were held in the House to review the National Animal Identification System. The Subcommittee on Emerging Threats, Cybersecurity, and Science and Technology reviewed the National Animal Identification System. Animal ID has a long history in the U.S., dating back to the 1800s with hot iron brands used for identification. In the 1940s, the USDA initiated a program to identify cattle vaccinated for brucellosis. During the 1940s, the USDA started a program to identify cattle vaccinated for brucellosis with official tags and ear tattoos. As brucellosis neared eradication, the tagging system was phased out. In the 1950s-1980s, plans for a national animal identification system began to take shape, driven by the need to quickly identify sick or exposed animals during disease outbreaks. In 1986-1988, Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or \"mad cow disease\" is first identified in the UK's cattle herds. BSE is transmitted by feeding infected cattle parts back to cattle. In 1997, an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Taiwan resulted in $6.9 billion in losses and the slaughter of 3.8 million pigs. In 1997, an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Taiwan led to $6.9 billion in losses and the slaughter of 3.8 million pigs. Similarly, a major outbreak of Classical Swine Fever in the Netherlands resulted in the destruction of 12 million hogs and $2.3 billion in losses. In 2001, an outbreak of FMD in the UK forced the slaughter of over 10 million sheep and cattle, costing $7.9 billion. In 2002, APHIS officials collaborated with various organizations to draft an early version of an animal ID plan. By December 2003, a draft of the U.S. Animal Identification Plan (USAIP) was published, calling for recording animal movements in a central database. APHIS was responsible for designing an ID numbering system and allocating numbers. The USAIP called for recording animal movements in a central database, with APHIS designing an ID numbering system and coordinating data collection. The plan aimed for all states to have an animal premises ID system by July 2004 and for major species to be identified by July 2006. The first case of BSE in the US was detected as the draft USAIP was published in December 2003. In December 2003, the draft USAIP was published, and the first case of BSE was detected in the US. Secretary Ann Veneman transferred $18.8 million for a national animal ID system. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) framework was announced on April 27, 2004. The program has been periodically revised since then. Ann Veneman announced the framework for implementing the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) in response to changing circumstances and industry input. USDA issued a \"Draft Strategic Plan\" in May 2005 with timelines for a mandatory program by January 2009. In August 2005, USDA announced Draft Program Standards with new guiding principles. A new plan, \"Implementation Strategies,\" was unveiled in April 2006, setting a timeline for full implementation by 2009, initially as a voluntary program with potential for mandatory regulations. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) was initially planned to transition from voluntary to mandatory by 2009. However, in response to concerns, it was announced in August 2006 that NAIS would remain entirely voluntary at the federal level. In November 2006, a draft \"user guide\" was distributed as the most current plan for NAIS. In November 2006, USDA distributed a draft \"user guide\" outlining the three-step approach to implementing the National Animal Identification System (NAIS). The program was designed to be voluntary and protect individuals' private information. In December 2007, USDA's APHIS released the NAIS. In December 2007, USDA's APHIS released the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) User Guide and Additional Information Resource. In April 2008, a Business Plan was released to advance animal disease traceability, aiming for 48-hour traceback of affected animals in case of an outbreak. The USDA's APHIS released the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) User Guide and Business Plan in 2007 and 2008, respectively, to achieve 48-hour traceback of affected animals during disease outbreaks. A proposed rule in 2009 aimed to establish an Official Animal Identification Numbering System, prioritizing species into Tier 1 and Tier 2 categories. The USDA's APHIS proposed a rule in 2009 to establish a seven-character PIN as the standard location identifier for the National Animal Identification System (NAIS). Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack held public listening sessions to gather feedback on animal identification and traceability. Additionally, a comprehensive benefit-cost analysis of the NAIS was released by USDA's APHIS in April 2009. In 2009, USDA released a comprehensive benefit-cost analysis of the NAIS. In 2010, Secretary Vilsack announced a new approach for animal disease traceability, allowing states to choose their own level of animal identification and traceability. All animals moving in interstate commerce will require a form of ID for traceability. The USDA proposed a revision for animal disease traceability in interstate commerce, requiring all animals to have a form of ID for traceability back to their originating state. Public meetings were held from March to August 2010 to discuss feedback on the proposed rule. APHIS released documents outlining the Animal Disease Traceability Framework in August 2010. The United States participates in international organizations like CODEX alimentarius, OIE, and WTO for animal health, food safety, and trade in livestock. Livestock and animal products are subject to export certification standards. The United States participates in international organizations like CODEX alimentarius, OIE, and WTO for animal health, food safety, and trade in livestock. U.S. livestock and animal products are subject to export certification standards imposed by importing countries. The WTO sets international trade rules for harmonizing participation in global commerce and resolving disputes. The CODEX alimentarius and OIE recommend standards for food safety and animal health, serving as guidelines for countries to develop their own standards. The WTO's Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures restricts traceability measures on imports to scientifically justified requirements based on risk assessment and equivalent to domestic standards. CODEX provides guidelines for countries to develop their own food safety and animal health standards. The Codex Alimentarius Commission, established in 1963 by the FAO and WHO, develops food standards and guidelines to protect consumer health and ensure fair trade practices in the food industry. The standards must be based on risk assessment and equivalent to domestic industry standards. The World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) was founded in 1924 as the Office International des Epizooties and renamed in 2003. It is responsible for improving animal health globally and setting international standards for animal identification and traceability. The OIE helps member countries implement animal identification and traceability systems to enhance disease prevention, food safety, and export certification. In 2006, the OIE established guidelines on identification and traceability, which were adopted as official standards in 2007. Chapter four of the OIE's Terrestrial Code includes sections on animal identification and tracing. The OIE established guidelines on animal identification and traceability in 2006, adopted as official standards in 2007. The Terrestrial Code includes sections on general principles and guidance for system design and implementation. The Director General called for global implementation of traceability systems from \"farm to fork\" under OIE standards for disease control and trade continuity. Robust animal identification and tracing systems following OIE standards allow compartmentalization and regionalization during disease outbreaks, enabling trade continuity for animal products. The OIE's Terrestrial Code outlines principles and application of compartmentalization. Export certification, managed by USDA's FSIS in the US, is often required by importing countries. In the United States, certification for beef imports is handled by USDA's FSIS, ensuring compliance with importing countries' standards. The OIE promotes international certification standards through programs and scientific evaluation. The OIE promotes international certification standards and transparency based on scientific information. Many countries have adopted national animal identification systems with traceability capabilities. Canada's CCIA manages the Canadian Cattle Identification Agency. The Canadian Cattle Identification Agency (CCIA) is a nonprofit organization managing Canada's national individual identification, tracking, and trace-back system for cattle and bison. CCIA is industry-led with a board of directors representing various sectors, including the government's Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) as a non-voting member. Agri-Food and Agriculture Canada (AAFC) collaborates with CCIA on funding and development initiatives. The Canadian Cattle Identification Agency (CCIA) collaborates with Agri-Food and Agriculture Canada (AAFC) to ensure funding for development initiatives. Cattle identification in Canada transitioned to mandatory RFID tags in 2002. Since September 1, 2006, all Canadian cattle leaving their farm must have a CCIA-approved RFID tag for tracking purposes. The benefits of RFID tags include excellent retention, data integrity, long-distance readability, and potential for full animal movement tracking. CCIA reported a nationwide compliance rate of 99-100% in March 2009, with privacy measures in place to secure personal information associated with the tag number. The Canadian Livestock Traceability System (CLTS) securely maintains personal information associated with ear tag numbers for various industry and species groups. The Canadian sheep and hog identification programs became mandatory in 2004 and 2008, respectively. Australia's National Livestock Identification System (NLIS) is a permanent whole-of-life system for livestock traceability. Australia's National Livestock Identification System (NLIS) is a permanent whole-of-life system for identifying and tracing livestock. It allows individual animals to be electronically identified and tracked from birth to slaughter. The system has been mandatory for cattle since July 1, 2005, and for sheep and goats since January 1, 2009. Similar tracing systems are being developed for pigs and alpacas. Australia initiated its animal identification system in the 1960s to eradicate bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis. In the early 1960s, Australia started its animal identification system to eradicate bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis. A mandatory cattle identification system using Property Identification Codes (PICs) was established in 1967, which evolved into an electronic system with Radio Frequency Identification Devices (RFIDs) in the mid-1990s. The PIC system in Australia was converted to an electronic whole-of-life individual cattle identification system using RFIDs to ensure biosecurity, food safety, and market access. Individual identification became compulsory for producers supplying the EU market in 1998, leading to the introduction of NLIS in 1999. A 2004 audit showed that NLIS successfully traced all identified animals to their origin within 24 hours. NLIS ensures all animals are traced to their origin within 24 hours. Mandatory animal identification for all cattle leaving their property of birth was implemented in 2005. Each animal at slaughter is assigned a unique ID number linked to live animals, carcasses, hides, and byproducts. Australia's NLIS ensures quick tracing of animals to their origin within 24 hours. Individual animal ID information is linked to live animals, carcasses, hides, and byproducts. However, unless specific agreements are made, animals are grouped into lots at harvesting facilities, and individual animal information is not available. The NLIS is a partnership between the Australian Government and industry, with the Federal government coordinating policy and funding, while state governments have jurisdiction over livestock movement and health. The state governments work with industry in joint management committees to develop and implement legislation for the animal identification program. They coordinate extension and education programs for producers, manage a registry of PICs, order identification devices, and assist with establishing reading infrastructure. The state governments work with industry to manage the animal identification program, including establishing a registry of PICs and ordering identification devices. Meat and Livestock Australia administers the database for NLIS, ensuring data protection from Australian FOI laws. The EU also classifies animal identification as important. The Australian FOI Act provides exemptions for animal identification data, while the EU has mandatory programs for major animal species to ensure food safety and disease control. EU species-specific ID systems have evolved in response to disease outbreaks like swine fever, foot-and-mouth disease, and BSE crisis. In response to disease outbreaks like swine fever, foot-and-mouth disease, and the BSE crisis, the EU implemented a mandatory system of permanent identification for individual bovine animals in 1997. All bovine animals were required to be identified with double ear tags by January 1, 2000, enabling reliable traceability from birth to death. The EU implemented a mandatory bovine ID and traceability system in 1997, requiring double ear tags for all cattle by January 1, 2000. A national database tracks individual animals from birth to harvest, with meat products labeled to link back to the animal of origin. EU regulations require specific labeling for meat products, including a reference number linking to the animal of origin, the member state of harvest and processing, and approval numbers for facilities. Food traceability has been mandatory in the EU since 2005. Equidae must have a passport for movement since 2000, and a similar system for porcine animals started in 2008. The ID system for ovine and caprine was adopted in 2003. A mandatory identification system for porcine animals was implemented on August 28, 2008, following the EU's ID system for ovine and caprine animals in July 2005. Japan also has a mandatory bovine ID and traceability system since December 1, 2004, tracking domestic animals from birth to consumer purchase. Imported beef currently lacks the same traceability requirements as domestically produced beef, but there is growing political pressure for such regulations. In response to food safety crises in the early 2000s, Japan implemented animal traceability regulations for domestically produced beef, requiring traceability from farms to slaughterhouses by December 1, 2003. Political pressure is growing for similar regulations for imported beef. Japan implemented bovine animal traceability laws requiring traceability of domestically produced beef from farms to slaughterhouses by December 1, 2003. Subsequently, the Beef Traceability Law extended traceability to processors, distributors, and retailers by December 1, 2004. Retailers and restaurants now display animal identification numbers for consumers to access information about domestic beef. Japan implemented bovine animal traceability laws for domestically produced beef by December 1, 2003. The Beef Traceability Law extended traceability to processors, distributors, and retailers by December 1, 2004. Retailers display animal identification numbers for consumers to access information about domestic beef. In June 2003, Japan's Ministry of Agriculture announced a new Japan Agricultural Standard program to certify traceability of imported beef. South Korea has a mandatory Beef Traceability System initiated in 2004. South Korea implemented a mandatory Beef Traceability System (BTS) in 2004, which became mandatory for domestically produced beef in 2009. The BTS tracks individual animals from birth to consumer, providing information on sex, breed, quality grade, location of birth, and feed used. In South Korea, the Beef Traceability System (BTS) allows consumers to access detailed information about animals, including sex, breed, quality grade, birth location, owner's details, feed, medications, slaughter date and location, inspection date, and processing location. The South Korean government plans to enforce traceability requirements on imported beef by December 2010. New Zealand lacks a comprehensive national animal ID system, but an Animal Identification and Traceability Working Group was established in August 2004 to address this issue. In August 2004, the Animal Identification and Traceability Working Group (AITWG) was established in New Zealand to improve animal traceability. A new system called NAIT (National Animal Identification and Tracing) was developed under the oversight of the Animal Identification and Traceability Governance Group (AITGG) in March 2006. However, as of early 2009, NAIT is still in the development stage and lacks effective traceability for individual animals. New Zealand's current animal ID systems focus on traceability for cattle and deer populations, with gaps at the national level. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) emphasizes the need to establish traceability for these species before considering others. The existing systems were initiated under the Bio-security Act of 1993, providing partial bovine animal ID. New Zealand's animal ID systems include the Management Information System for Dairy Administration (MINDA) and the National Bovine Tuberculosis Identification Program (NBTIP) for cattle and deer traceability. MINDA is voluntary with high dairy herd participation, while NBTIP is mandatory for cattle and deer identification before movement. Several other traceability databases exist alongside these systems. A new mandatory animal identification system for cattle and possibly deer is proposed to be in place by June 2011 in Brazil. The Brazilian Bovine and Buffalo Identification and Certification System (SISBOV, now ERAS) was created in 2001 for cattle, and extended to the entire beef chain in September 2006. The SISBOV certification system, now renamed ERAS, was initially intended for individual animal identification at the farm level in Brazil. It was later extended to the entire beef chain in 2006. Despite plans for mandatory national participation by 2008, it remains a voluntary program focused on providing origination information for slaughterhouses supplying foreign markets, particularly the EU. The SISBOV certification system, now called ERAS, was meant for individual animal identification at the farm level in Brazil but expanded to the entire beef chain in 2006. It is voluntary and focuses on providing origination information for slaughterhouses supplying foreign markets, notably the EU. The EU has found significant deficiencies in Brazil's animal identification and traceability system during audits since 2003. In 2003, EU audits found deficiencies in Brazil's animal identification system, leading to a near-total beef import ban. By 2009, the EU was concerned about the worsening situation in Brazil, fearing the spread of foot-and-mouth disease. Argentina also implemented a limited animal traceability system in 2003. Argentina established a limited mandatory animal identification and traceability system in 2003, directed at animal products for the EU. The system includes farm-of-origin information and permits documenting cattle movements, with official ID tagging required for all calves born after September 2007. Argentina implemented a mandatory animal identification program in 2003 for EU exports, with official ID tagging required for calves born after September 2007. The program aims to track cattle from birth to slaughter, but full tagging of the beef herd is expected by 2017. Export restrictions to the US due to disease outbreaks like foot and mouth disease have pushed Argentina to improve its traceability system. Argentina implemented a mandatory animal identification program in 2003 for EU exports, with official ID tagging required for calves born after September 2007. Export restrictions to the US due to disease outbreaks like foot and mouth disease have pushed Argentina to improve its traceability system. This has provided ample incentive for Argentina to enhance its animal identification and traceability system. Uruguay is also dependent on external markets for selling a large portion of its annual domestic production, with 68% of its beef production sold in foreign markets during the 2004-2008 period. Uruguay has a strong incentive to provide animal identification and traceability information as demanded by foreign buyers, leading to the implementation of a comprehensive national program in late 2006 by the Ministry of Livestock, Agriculture, and Fisheries. Uruguay implemented a mandatory animal identification system called the National Livestock Information System (SNIG) in late 2006. All individual animals must be tagged before six months of age or before being transported. Two tags are required for all cattle, one visible and one electronic. The government aims to have all herds registered and all cattle tagged. The Uruguayan government implemented the National Livestock Information System (SNIG) in 2006, requiring all cattle to be tagged before six months of age. By 2010, all herds must be registered and traceability extended to all cuts of beef back to specific animals at their farm of origin. SNIG builds on Uruguay's national premises identification system (DICOSE) and requires movement notification through registered individuals or companies. Termination records are managed by MAGyP. The Uruguayan government implemented the National Livestock Information System (SNIG) in 2006, requiring all cattle to be tagged before six months of age. SNIG includes premises and animal identification, movements, and termination data. The government currently pays for ID tags but plans to shift the cost to producers in the future. Some countries like Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, and Russia do not have ongoing animal ID programs. Not all countries with large animal populations have ongoing animal ID programs like Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, and Russia. Reasons for this include lack of technological advancement, absence of national distribution chains for animal products, and financial constraints of consumers in poorer countries. Many lower-income consumers in countries around the world cannot afford to be selective in their choice of animal products, leading to a lack of willingness to pay extra for traceable food."
