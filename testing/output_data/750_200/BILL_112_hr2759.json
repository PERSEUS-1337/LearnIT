The \"Business Transparency on Trafficking and Slavery Act\" requires disclosure of human rights impact of products in the US market, following findings of forced labor and child labor in goods from various countries. California was the first state to enact a law mandating public disclosure by manufacturers and retail companies. In 2010, California enacted the first State law requiring manufacturers and retail companies to disclose policies on eradicating slavery, forced labor, and human trafficking in their supply chains. The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 prohibits importation of goods made with forced or convict labor, with exceptions for goods not produced in sufficient quantities in the US. Courts have ruled that consumers do not have rights impact on products in the US market. Courts have ruled that consumers do not have standing to bring a civil action in United States courts for enforcement of the Tariff Act provision prohibiting importation of goods made with forced or convict labor. Only fewer than 40 enforcement actions have been recorded in the past 80 years due to the legislative intent to protect American manufacturers, not consumers. It is the sense of Congress that forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor are egregious forms of abuse for commercial profit. The legislative framework to prevent these actions has limitations and fails to provide information on specific suppliers. The legislative framework to prevent abuse for commercial profit is inadequate, and legislation is needed to ensure transparency from businesses in providing information to consumers and investors. The solution to these problems lies in transparently providing information to consumers and investors, and responding to their demands for business reasons rather than just following government regulations.
