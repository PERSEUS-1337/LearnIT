    "content": "The report discusses the modernization of U.S. military tactical aircraft, including fighter aircraft, strike fighters, and attack planes. Tactical aircraft are crucial for U.S. military capability and defense spending. The Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps had around 3,500 tactical aircraft in early 2009. Modernization efforts focus on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, the Air Force F-22 fighter program, and the Navy F/A-18E/F strike fighter program. Program-specific issues for Congress in FY2010 include the F-35, F-22, and F/A-18E/F. In FY2010, Congress faces decisions on the F-35, F-22, and F/A-18E/F programs. Key issues include whether to terminate the alternate engine for the F-35, end F-22 procurement at 187 aircraft, and approve Navy's request for nine F/A-18E/Fs. In FY2010, Congress must decide on procurement of additional F-22s and Navy's request for nine F/A-18E/Fs. Legislative activity on F-35, F-22, and F/A-18E/F programs is covered in CRS reports. The CRS reports discuss FY2010 legislative activity on U.S. tactical aircraft, focusing on affordability and the future of the industrial base for designing and manufacturing these aircraft. Tactical aircraft are combat planes that can operate within a regional theater of operations without refueling. They are shorter-ranged compared to strategic aircraft like B-52 bombers, which are designed for long-range missions, including intercontinental flights. Tactical aircraft, such as fighters and strike fighters, are designed for missions within a regional theater of operations. Fighters are primarily for air-to-air combat, while strike fighters have both air-to-air and air-to-ground combat capabilities. Tactical aircraft, like fighters and strike fighters, are designed for air-to-air combat primarily, with some air-to-ground capability. Strike fighters, with \"F\" or \"F/A\" designations, have dual roles for air-to-ground and air-to-air operations. Attack planes, designated with \"A,\" focus on air-to-ground missions. Air Force and Navy tactical aircraft operate from land bases and are conventional takeoff and landing (CTOL) aircraft. Tactical aircraft, including Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps planes, have various capabilities such as CTOL, VSTOL, and STOVL. They are used for air-to-air combat and air-to-ground missions. Marine Corps aircraft can operate from Navy ships and land bases. The Air Force operates a variety of missions with fighters focusing on air-to-air combat and attack planes specializing in air-to-ground operations. Strike fighters engage in both air-to-air and air-to-ground missions, while tactical aircraft can also be used for surveillance and reconnaissance operations. The Air Force currently operates new F-22 fighters. The Air Force operates a variety of missions with fighters focusing on air-to-air combat and attack planes specializing in air-to-ground operations. Tactical aircraft can also be used for surveillance and reconnaissance operations. The Air Force currently operates new F-22 fighters and older aircraft types like F-15, F-16, and A-10. The Navy operates older F/A-18A-D strike fighters and newer F/A-18E/F strike fighters. The Marine Corps operates F/A-18 A-D strike fighters and AV-8B VSTOL attack planes. In early 2009, the Department of Defense had approximately 3,500 tactical aircraft, with 2,375 in the Air Force and 1,125 in the Navy and Marine Corps. Modernization efforts focus on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, Air Force F-22 fighter program, and Navy F/A-18E/F strike fighter program. The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, also known as the Lighting II, is a new strike aircraft. The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program is the Department of Defense's largest weapon procurement program, aimed at providing a relatively affordable fifth-generation strike fighter for the Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy. It is designed to meet their similar operational needs with three common versions, avoiding the higher costs of developing separate aircraft designs. The F-35 program is the DOD's largest weapon procurement program, acquiring 2,456 JSFs for the three services at an estimated cost of $246 billion. The Air Force is replacing F-16s and A-10s with the F-35A, while the Marine Corps is procuring the F-35B. The F-35 program is the DOD's largest weapon procurement program, acquiring 2,456 JSFs for the three services at an estimated cost of $246 billion. The Air Force is replacing F-16s and A-10s with the F-35A, while the Marine Corps is procuring the F-35B, and the Navy is procuring the F-35C for carrier operations. The administration's proposed FY2010 budget requested funding for the procurement of 30 F-35s, including 10 F-35As, 16 F-35Bs, and 4 F-35Cs. The FY2010 budget requested funding for the procurement of 30 F-35s, including 10 F-35As for the Air Force, 16 F-35Bs for the Marine Corps, and four F-35Cs for the Navy. The F-22 fighter, also known as the Raptor, is a fifth-generation aircraft with advanced capabilities like stealth and high maneuverability. The administration plans to end F-22 procurement at 187 aircraft. The administration plans to end F-22 procurement at 187 aircraft, with supporters wanting to continue procuring more towards a goal of 243 to 250. The F/A-18E/F, also known as the Super Hornet, is a Navy strike fighter considered a fourth-generation aircraft. The F/A-18E/F, also known as the Super Hornet, is a fourth-generation aircraft that incorporates some fifth-generation technology. It forms the core of the Navy's aircraft carrier air wings, with more than 40 Hornets and Super Hornets in each wing. The Navy has procured a total of 449 F/A-18E/F Super Hornets since FY1997, with funding requested for nine more in FY2010. The administration's proposed FY2010 budget requested funding for the procurement of nine F/A-18E/Fs. Air Force and Navy officials projected significant fighter shortfalls by 2024, with some questioning the Air Force's 800-aircraft shortfall projection. The Air Force and Navy projected fighter shortfalls by 2024, with the Air Force announcing a plan to retire older tactical aircraft. The Navy-Marine Corps strike fighter shortfall depends on assumptions about aircraft service life extensions and procurement rates of F-35Cs and F-35Bs. The Air Force announced a combat air forces restructuring plan in response to the proposed FY2010 defense budget, which includes accelerating the retirement of 249 older tactical aircraft to generate savings for other program needs. This plan involves retiring 112 F-15s, 134 F-16s, and three A-10s, while excluding the retirement of five fighters proposed in the budget submission. Briefing slides on the plan are available in the Appendix. Following the FY2010 budget proposal for the Department of Defense, the Air Force plans to retire legacy fighters to fund a smaller, more capable force and prioritize higher missions. Approximately 250 aircraft, including F-15 Eagles, F-16 Fighting Falcons, and A-10 Thunderbolt IIs, will be retired under the Combat Air Forces restructuring plan. This strategic move aims to create opportunities for fighter aircraft restructuring, according to Secretary of the Air Force Michael Donley. Secretary of the Air Force Michael Donley highlighted the strategic opportunity for fighter aircraft restructuring to transition legacy fighters and F-22s into a smaller, more lethal force bridging to fifth-generation F-35s. Cost savings of $355 million in FY10 and $3.5 billion over five years will be used to enhance remaining fighters with advanced capabilities. The Air Force plans to invest $3.5 billion over the next five years to reduce capability gaps by enhancing fighters and bombers with advanced modifications and procuring munitions like small diameter bombs and missiles. Additionally, funds will be allocated for critical intelligence capabilities and enabling technologies for tactical air controllers and special operations forces. This decision was made after assessing the current threat environment and capabilities. The Air Force plans to invest $3.5 billion over the next five years to enhance fighters and bombers with advanced modifications and procure munitions. Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Norton Schwartz emphasized the need for modernization due to eroding advantages over potential adversaries. The CAF restructuring plan aims to move approximately 4,000 manpower through reassignment and retraining programs. The CAF restructuring plan aims to move 4,000 manpower authorizations to emerging missions like surveillance and nuclear deterrence. This includes expanding aircrews for MQ-1 Predator, MQ-9 Reaper, and MC-12 Liberty, adding a fourth B-52 squadron, and enhancing combat support capabilities in Afghanistan and Iraq. The Air Force is focusing on enhancing its ground system and information processing capabilities for combatant commander support in Afghanistan and Iraq. Secretary Donley and General Schwartz are committed to revitalizing the nuclear enterprise and deploying 50 unmanned combat air patrols by FY11. The goal is to have a force mix that meets current mission requirements while preparing for future challenges. Congress is concerned about the affordability of DOD's plans for modernizing tactical aircraft. The affordability of DOD's plans for modernizing tactical aircraft has been a key issue for Congress for many years. Observers predict a budget \"train wreck\" as funding may not be sufficient for tactical aircraft acquisition. The focus was on the affordability of the F-35, F-22, and F/A-18E/F programs, but as production winds down, the issue remains a concern. The affordability of DOD's tactical aircraft modernization plans has been a long-standing concern for Congress. As production of the F-22 and F/A-18E/F programs winds down, the focus shifts to the affordability of the F-35 program, with plans to increase procurement rates. DOD aims to ramp up F-35 procurement to 130 aircraft per year by 2014-2015, significantly reducing the number of new aircraft acquired since the 1990s. Since the early 1990s, DOD has lowered the cost of its tactical aircraft modernization plans by reducing the number of new aircraft to be acquired. This reduction was due to post-Cold War cuts in Air Force and Navy air wings, as well as the Navy-Marine Corps Tactical Air Integration Plan. The DOD has implemented initiatives to reduce costs in tactical aircraft modernization, including the F-35 program. However, affordability remains uncertain due to potential budget constraints in the future. The DOD has implemented cost-saving initiatives in tactical aircraft modernization, such as the F-35 program. However, the affordability of future defense budgets, with little to no real growth or possible decline, poses a challenge. The projected Air Force and Navy-Marine Corps fighter shortfalls indicate ongoing affordability issues. If DOD's modernization plans cannot be fully funded without reducing funding for other programs, policymakers may face funding tradeoffs. If DOD's modernization plans cannot be fully funded without reducing funding for other programs, policymakers may face tradeoffs between funding for tactical aircraft acquisition programs and non-aircraft systems that can perform similar missions. This includes potential tradeoffs with funding for other aircraft like long-range bombers or helicopters. Some argue DOD should prioritize funding for long-range aircraft over tactical aircraft due to improving anti-access capabilities in the region. The affordability of DOD's tactical aircraft modernization plans is a subset of a larger issue concerning the affordability of DOD's plans for procuring new aircraft of all types, including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs). UAVs have played an increasing role in surveillance in recent years. The DOD is focusing on funding for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) for improving U.S. capabilities in irregular warfare operations. This includes precision attacks on terrorist targets. The debate is between funding for land-based Air Force tactical aircraft acquisition programs like the F-22 and F-35A, versus funding for sea-based Navy and Marine Corps sea-based operations. The debate revolves around funding for land-based Air Force tactical aircraft (F-22 and F-35A) versus sea-based Navy and Marine Corps tactical aircraft (F/A-18E/F and F-35 Bs and Cs). Observers discuss the capabilities and costs of each for various missions. The administration proposes ending F-22 procurement at 187 aircraft. The administration's proposal to end F-22 procurement at 187 aircraft and focus on the F-35A raises questions about funding for different tactical aircraft models. This includes deciding between funding for new F-35s, F-22s, and F/A-18E/Fs versus service life extensions or procurement of upgraded older-design tactical aircraft like F-15s or F-16s. The administration's proposal to end F-22 procurement at 187 aircraft and focus on the F-35A raises questions about funding for different tactical aircraft models. This includes deciding between funding for new F-35s, F-22s, and F/A-18E/Fs versus service life extensions or procurement of upgraded older-design tactical aircraft like F-15s or F-16s. Potential tradeoffs involve complex questions of costs, capabilities, and technical feasibility, which have been studied and debated for years in the context of U.S. military goals and objectives. The Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) is currently reviewing U.S. military goals and objectives, with a focus on preparing for irregular warfare operations and conventional interstate conflict. The need for large quantities of tactical aircraft in the post-Cold War era has been questioned. In the post-Cold War era, there is a debate over the procurement of high-capability tactical aircraft. Some argue for reducing these aircraft in favor of investing in UAVs, special operations helicopters, and other equipment for counterinsurgency and anti-terrorism operations. Some argue for increased investments in UAVs, UCAVs, special operations helicopters, medical evacuation aircraft, and training forward air controllers due to potential threats from Russian aircraft and SAMs. The end of the Cold War did not eliminate the need for advanced aircraft in high-threat areas. Recent acquisitions of advanced fighter aircraft and SAMs by China and India have heightened concerns. Recent acquisitions of advanced fighter aircraft and surface-to-air missiles by China and India have raised concerns about potential challenges to U.S. airpower in the future. Representative Neil Abercrombie requested the Government Accountability Office to examine DOD's investment planning for modernizing its tactical fighter and attack aircraft force. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) examined DOD's investment planning for tactical fighter and attack aircraft. The military services plan to spend $109.3 billion on 570 new aircraft and modernizing existing ones. Cost increases, schedule delays, and changes in requirements have reduced procurement quantities of new aircraft. The development period and costs for new aircraft like the F-22A have doubled, leading to a decline in procurement numbers. The Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) is facing similar challenges with increased development costs and slipping schedules, despite being crucial for future modernization efforts. The development costs for new aircraft have increased by $31.6 billion since 2004, with procurement and delivery schedules slipping. Funding needs for new and legacy aircraft are interdependent, requiring more money to sustain legacy systems until new ones are ready. Uncertainty about new systems costs and deliveries makes effective planning challenging. The services are investing an average of about $1.7 billion per year on legacy modifications over the next seven years. There are large pent up demands for unfunded requirements and potential life extension programs. Hard decisions on retiring or extending the life of legacy aircraft must be made soon. DOD lacks a comprehensive plan for modernization efforts and legacy retirement schedules. The DOD is facing the need to make tough decisions on retiring or extending the life of legacy aircraft. There is a lack of a comprehensive investment plan for modernizing fighter and attack aircraft, leading to difficulties in assessing capability gaps and duplication of resources across military services. Each service operates independently to acquire resources for their force structure needs. The military services have struggled to deliver aircraft within desired costs and quantities. Future plans may be unaffordable within projected funding levels, as they rely on unrealistic assumptions about new acquisitions and increased funding levels. The military services face challenges in delivering aircraft within desired costs and quantities due to unrealistic assumptions about new acquisitions and increased funding levels. Future funding levels may not be sustainable, given the projected decline in federal discretionary spending and competing demands for funds from other defense projects. Recent efforts to examine joint requirements on an integrated, DOD-wide basis have not significantly affected service plans and investments. GAO recommends that DOD shorten cycle times for developing new tactical aircraft and develop an integrated investment strategy for tactical air forces. The Congressional Budget Office conducted a study on fighter capabilities and costs at the direction of the Senate Armed Services Committee. The Congressional Budget Office conducted a study on the capabilities and costs of tactical aircraft forces, comparing alternative approaches for modernization. The Congressional Budget Office study compared alternative approaches for modernizing DoD's fighter forces, analyzing advantages, disadvantages, and costs. The report, issued in May 2009, highlighted the potential increase in capability with modernization while maintaining similar inventory levels. The Congressional Budget Office study in May 2009 compared approaches for modernizing DoD's fighter forces, emphasizing the potential increase in capability through modernization while maintaining similar inventory levels. The modernized fleets would have state-of-the-art aircraft with advanced technology, including increased payload capacity and stealth capabilities for enhanced survivability. However, fighter inventories under DoD's fiscal year 2009 procurement plans are likely to fall below the services' goals. The Congressional Budget Office study in May 2009 compared approaches for modernizing DoD's fighter forces, emphasizing the potential increase in capability through modernization while maintaining similar inventory levels. Fighter inventories are projected to fall below the services' goals in the coming years, but aggregate capabilities may still improve due to the enhanced lethality and survivability expected from new fighters. Some improvements could be offset by the increased capabilities of potential adversaries. Alternative approaches include purchasing additional F/A-18E/F Super Hornets or upgraded versions of legacy aircraft like the F-16 Fighting Falcon and F-15E Strike Eagle. Purchasing upgraded versions of legacy aircraft like the F-16 Fighting Falcon and F-15E Strike Eagle could provide short-term inventory relief and cost savings compared to buying JSFs, although with lesser capability improvements. Forces with a mix of fighters and subsonic attack aircraft would offer improved basing flexibility. Force structures that replace some fighters with smaller numbers of attack aircraft could offer improved basing flexibility and persistence during air-to-ground missions. These forces would have comparable air-to-ground weapons capacities at costs similar to current plans, but fewer aircraft capable of air-to-air combat. Congress also faces decisions on tactical aircraft acquisition programs and their implications. Decisions on tactical aircraft acquisition programs can impact employment levels and the structure of the U.S. military aircraft manufacturing industry, which employs thousands of workers. The U.S. currently has two prime contractors for tactical aircraft production - Lockheed being one of them. The United States currently has two active prime contractors for the production of tactical aircraft - Lockheed and Boeing. When production of F/A-18E/F and F-22 winds down, the number of active U.S. prime contractors might be reduced to one (Lockheed), raising concerns about potential impacts on competition, innovation, prices, schedule adherence, and production quality in the industry. The United States currently has two active prime contractors for tactical aircraft production - Lockheed and Boeing. Questions for Congress include the need for multiple contractors in the future, the value of competition at the prime contractor level, and the potential for firms like Boeing to maintain key skills for future competition. The curr_chunk discusses legislative activity for FY2010 related to tactical aircraft modernization and the potential impact on U.S. export earnings and international competitiveness in the aerospace industry. It also raises questions about the need for multiple contractors, competition at the prime contractor level, and the importance of firms like Boeing maintaining key skills for future competition. The House passed H.R. 2647, requiring DOD to report on the procurement of \"4.5\"-generation aircraft, including F-15s, F-16s, and F/A-18s with upgrades. The report must be submitted to Congress within 90 days of the Act's enactment. The House passed H.R. 2647, mandating a report on 4.5 generation fighter aircraft procurement, including F-15s, F-16s, and F/A-18s with upgrades. The report must detail the number of aircraft needed to maintain 2,200 tactical fighter aircraft, estimated procurement costs under single and multiyear contracts, potential savings from multiyear contracts, and the Secretary's determination. The curr_chunk discusses the estimated savings and benefits of procuring aircraft through multiyear contracts compared to annual contracts, as well as the availability of F-35s for Air National Guard recapitalization. It also includes the Secretary's recommendations on authorizing a multiyear procurement. The Secretary's recommendations on authorizing a multiyear procurement contract for 4.5 generation fighter aircraft in fiscal year 2025 are to be submitted to Congress along with required certifications. The budget for fiscal year 2011 includes a definition of '4.5 generation fighter aircraft' with advanced capabilities. Section 1032 requires a report on force structure findings from the 2009 Quadrennial Defense Review. The committee's report expects analyses to include details on force structure decisions for the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps based on the 2009 Quadrennial Defense Review, focusing on fighter force capabilities, air defense capabilities, modeling simulations, and unmanned aerial vehicle inventories. The committee's report expects analyses on force structure decisions for the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps, focusing on fighter force capabilities, air defense capabilities, modeling simulations, unmanned aerial vehicle inventories, and quantifiable operational risks associated with planned fighter fleets. Section 1047 prohibits the Air Force from retiring fighter aircraft until a report is submitted to Congress. SEC. 1047. COMBAT AIR FORCES RESTRUCTURING. Prohibits the retirement of fighter aircraft by the Air Force until a report is submitted to Congress. The Secretary of the Air Force is prohibited from reassigning personnel associated with the Combat Air Forces restructuring plan. At least $344,600,000 must be used for the continued operation and maintenance of 249 fighter aircraft scheduled for retirement in fiscal year 2010. At least $10,500,000 from the funds authorized for Air Force procurement in the Act must be used for modifications to sustain the 249 fighter aircraft. A report detailing how force structure and capability gaps resulting from the retirement actions will be addressed must be submitted to the Committees on Armed Services. The report must include a plan to address force structure and capability gaps, an assessment of threat environment and capabilities, mission assignments for affected bases, criteria for base and fighter selection, environmental analyses, and manpower authorizations for Air Force personnel affected by retirements. The report must include identification of reassignment and manpower authorizations for Air Force personnel affected by retirements, funding needed for operation and maintenance costs, and an estimate of cost avoidance if the restructuring plan is not carried out. The future-years defense plan aims to modernize the remaining fighter force to outpace threats, with an exception for five fighter aircraft scheduled for retirement in fiscal year 2010. Congress expresses its findings on Navy carrier air wing force structure in Section 1051. Congress finds that the Navy must maintain at least 10 carrier air wings, each with a minimum of 44 strike fighter aircraft, despite the limited availability of fifth-generation assets. The Navy must maintain 10 carrier air wings with a minimum of 44 strike fighter aircraft, even though most will not be fifth-generation assets. Congress supports this and urges the Secretary of the Navy to allocate resources accordingly. The House Armed Services Committee supports maintaining 10 carrier air wings with a minimum of 44 strike fighter aircraft. They are concerned about the Air Force's plans to retire legacy fighter aircraft in addition to those already scheduled for retirement. The House Armed Services Committee supports maintaining 10 carrier air wings with a minimum of 44 strike fighter aircraft. Plans to accelerate the retirement of 249 legacy fighter aircraft in fiscal year 2010, including 112 F-15s, 134 F-15s, and 3 A-10s, could lead to serious gaps in force structure and capability. Concerns arise as replacement aircraft are still being tested and not yet available for fielding. Additionally, the Air Force has not identified follow-on missions for affected bases, potentially leaving force structure and capability gaps unfilled. The committee has identified $143.7 million in unjustified program growth. The House Armed Services Committee has identified $344.6 million in unjustified program growth and unexecutable peacetime operations in the Air Force budget. These funds are recommended to be used for the continued operation and maintenance of 249 legacy fighters slated for retirement in fiscal year 2010. The committee recommends using $344.6 million for the operation and maintenance of 249 legacy fighters slated for retirement in fiscal year 2010. An additional $10.5 million is recommended for aircraft modifications. The Air Force has reported a projected shortfall of fighter aircraft. The Department of the Air Force has reported a projected shortfall of fighter aircraft, with a requirement of 2,200 aircraft and a projected shortfall of approximately 800 aircraft by 2024. This shortfall could impact the ability of active duty and reserve forces to meet future mission requirements. The committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force to provide a report to Congress on this issue. The committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force, in consultation with the Chief of the Air National Guard and the Chief of the Air Force Reserve, to provide a report to the congressional defense committees by March 1, 2010. The report should address the ''fighter gap'' issue in the long- and short-term with alternative solutions including accelerated procurement of fifth generation fighters like the F-22 and F-35, interim procurement of ''4.5 generation'' fighters, and fleet management options. The committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force to provide a report on the fighter gap issue, including options like accelerated procurement of fifth generation fighters such as the F-22 and F-35, interim procurement of ''4.5 generation'' fighters, and fleet management solutions. The report must analyze the impact of any shortfalls on the Air National Guard and air sovereignty alert mission, including potential loss of flying missions and pilot/maintenance capability. The committee is concerned about the projected Navy-Marine Corps strike fighter shortfall. The committee is concerned about the projected Navy-Marine Corps strike fighter shortfall, with a potential peak shortfall of 312 aircraft by fiscal year 2018. The drastic shortfalls in strike fighter inventory are deemed unacceptable due to various factors causing the current and projected shortfall. The committee believes the Navy-Marine Corps strike fighter shortfall is unacceptable due to various factors, including reductions in F/A-18A through D and F-35B/C inventory, delays in F-35B/C development, and early service life expiration of F/A-18A through D aircraft. They remain unconvinced that naval strike-fighter shortfalls should be viewed in isolation from the Department of Defense's overall strike-fighter inventory. The committee supports procurement of additional F/A-18E/F aircraft to address the naval strike-fighter inventory shortfall, emphasizing the importance of matching carrier air wings to the number of aircraft carriers. They believe a multi-year procurement contract for F/A-18E/F aircraft is more cost-effective and prudent than annual procurement. The committee supports procurement of additional F/A-18E/F aircraft to address the naval strike-fighter inventory shortfall and believes a multi-year procurement contract is more cost-effective than annual procurement. They also express a sense of Congress that the Department of the Navy should maintain no less than ten carrier air wings. The committee supports procurement of additional F/A-18E/F aircraft to address the naval strike-fighter inventory shortfall. Congress expresses the need for the Department of the Navy to maintain at least ten carrier air wings with a specific number of strike-fighters each. Additionally, a report is requested to evaluate extending the service-life of existing aircraft versus procuring new ones. The Senate Armed Services Committee's report expresses concern about the Navy facing a significant aircraft inventory gap as older F/A-18A-D Hornets retire before the F-35C variant is available. The committee recommends procuring additional F/A-18E/F aircraft to address the shortfall. The Senate Armed Services Committee is concerned about the Navy's aircraft inventory gap as older F/A-18A-D Hornets retire before the F-35C variant is available. The committee recommends procuring additional F/A-18E/F aircraft to address the shortfall. The Navy has failed to provide a report comparing single versus multiyear procurement costs as mandated by previous committee reports. Last year, the Navy projected a shortfall in Navy tactical aviation. The Navy projected a shortfall in tactical aviation, with a potential gap of up to 250 aircraft according to the Chief of Naval Operations. The Senate Armed Services Committee recommends procuring additional F/A-18E/F aircraft to address the inventory gap. The Senate Armed Services Committee is concerned about the Navy's projected shortfall of up to 250 aircraft in its tactical air fleet, which poses a potential risk to national security. The committee notes that the Navy's delay in taking action to address this shortfall is worrisome. The Navy's delay in addressing the projected shortfall of up to 250 aircraft in its tactical air fleet is concerning. The committee is worried about the security risks associated with the delay and the reliance on a costly service life extension program for legacy F/A-18s. They recommend considering long-term procurement plans, such as a multiyear procurement of F/A-18E/F aircraft. The Navy is facing a strike aircraft shortfall and is considering extending the life of select legacy F/A-18s to 10,000 flight hours through a costly SLEP program. It is uncertain how many planes can reach this milestone even with the extension. The Navy is considering extending the life of legacy F/A-18s to 10,000 flight hours through a costly SLEP program. The committee is concerned about the cost uncertainties and believes that procuring new F/A-18E/F's may be more efficient. A SLEP to achieve an additional 1,400 flight hours would cost approximately $18,571 per flight hour gained. The Navy is considering extending the life of legacy F/A-18s to 10,000 flight hours through a costly SLEP program. The committee believes the Navy should carefully evaluate costs and benefits of new F/A-18E/F procurements compared to investing in a SLEP of legacy aircraft. New F/A-18E/F models come equipped with improved technological capabilities. The committee believes the Navy should carefully evaluate costs and benefits of new F/A-18E/F procurements compared to investing in a SLEP of legacy aircraft. New F/A-18E/F models come equipped with improved technological capabilities over legacy F/A-18's, including radar, avionics, aerial refueling system, and weapon hard points, increasing the benefit of purchasing new F/A-18E/Fs. The Navy projects the F/A-18E/F will remain in the fleet until at least 2040. The Navy plans to keep the F/A-18E/F in service until 2040 and is considering conducting a SLEP on legacy aircraft. The Department of Defense will review tactical aircraft forces in the Quadrennial Defense Review, including analyzing multiyear procurement for the F/A-18E/F. This analysis will compare cost differences between single year and multiyear procurement strategies and evaluate the tradeoffs between a SLEP and new procurements of the F/A-18E/F. The Department will use analysis on cost differentials between single year and multiyear procurement strategies for the F/A-18E/F to inform tactical aviation procurement strategies in the Quadrennial Defense Review. Addressing the strike-fighter shortfall is crucial and actions should not be delayed. The Department of Defense must address the shortfall in fighter aircraft procurement without delay. H.R. 2647 requires reports on 4.5-generation fighter aircraft and force structure findings from the 2009 Quadrennial Defense Review. The report on 4.5-generation fighter aircraft is required by H.R. 2647 / P.L. 111-84, with specific details on decisions for Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps force structure. Prohibitions on Air Force fighter aircraft retirement are in place until a report is submitted to Congress. Congress also addresses Navy carrier air wing force structure in the legislation. The report on 4.5-generation fighter aircraft, required by H.R. 2647 / P.L. 111-84, includes details on Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps force structure. Congress addresses Navy carrier air wing force structure in the legislation, with specific requirements for the procurement of 4.5 generation fighter aircraft outlined in Section 131. The Air Force must maintain at least 2,200 tactical fighter aircraft. The estimated procurement costs for annual and multiyear contracts, potential savings from multiyear contracts, and a comparison of costs and benefits between the two procurement methods are discussed. The curr_chunk discusses the costs and benefits of procuring F-35 aircraft through annual vs. multiyear contracts, as well as the definition of \"4.5 generation fighter aircraft\" with advanced capabilities. The curr_chunk discusses advanced fighter aircraft like F-16 and F-18 with AESA radar, high capacity data-link, and enhanced avionics, capable of deploying advanced armaments. Section 1052 requires a report on force structure findings of the 2009 Quadrennial Defense Review. Section 1075 requires a report to congressional defense committees with analyses supporting force structure findings and changes in major military capabilities from previous reviews. Major military capabilities are defined broadly to include various capabilities deemed significant by the Secretary. Section 1075 of the 2006 quadrennial defense review prohibits the retirement of fighter aircraft under the Combat Air Forces restructuring plan until a report is submitted by the Secretary of the Air Force. This report must include analyses supporting force structure findings and changes in major military capabilities. The Secretary of the Air Force is prohibited from reassigning any personnel associated with the Combat Air Forces restructuring plan.

The report to Congress must include a detailed plan addressing force structure and capability gaps from retirement actions, assessment of current threat environment, follow-on mission assignments, criteria for base and fighter selection, environmental analyses, reassignment and manpower authorizations, and funding needs. The fighter force achieves the desired service life and is sufficiently modernized to outpace the threat, with an exception for five fighter aircraft scheduled for retirement in fiscal year 2010. Congress finds that the Department of the Navy must maintain not less than 11 operational aircraft carriers. The Department of the Navy is committed to maintaining at least 11 operational aircraft carriers and 10 carrier air wings, each with 44 strike-fighter aircraft. Congress supports the Navy meeting its requirement for 10 carrier air wings, even if the number of aircraft carriers is temporarily reduced. The Congress and the Secretary of the Navy should ensure the current requirement of 10 carrier air wings with 44 strike-fighter aircraft each is maintained, even if the number of aircraft carriers is temporarily reduced. The Secretary of the Navy must provide Congress with a justification for any proposed modifications to the carrier air wing force structure. The conference report emphasizes the Air Force's investment strategy to transition to a smaller, more flexible, and capable strike fighter force. The Air Force is expected to analyze the possibility of procuring additional 4.5 generation fighter aircraft under certain conditions. The conference report emphasizes the Air Force's investment strategy to transition to a smaller, more flexible, and capable strike fighter force. The Air Force is expected to analyze the possibility of procuring additional 4.5 generation fighter aircraft under a multiyear contract, specifically defined to include the F-15, F-16, and F-18 with advanced radar, data-link, and avionics capabilities. The House Appropriations Committee, in its report on H.R. 3326, discusses the Air Force's proposed combat forces, including the procurement of additional 4.5 generation fighter aircraft such as the F-15, F-16, and F-18 with advanced capabilities. The House Appropriations Committee expressed concerns about the lack of detail and analysis provided to Congress regarding the Air Force's Combat Air Force restructure plan to retire 248 legacy F-15, F-16, and A-10 aircraft. The House Appropriations Committee is concerned about the lack of detail and analysis provided to Congress regarding the Air Force's Combat Air Force restructure plan to retire 248 legacy aircraft. They are also worried about the personnel and acquisition costs associated with the Air Force proposal to remove F-15 pilot training from Tyndall Air Force Base. The Committee is concerned about the lack of detail and analysis provided to Congress regarding the Air Force's Combat Air Force restructure plan to retire 248 legacy aircraft. They are also worried about the costs and potential acquisition costs associated with the Air Force proposal to remove F-15 pilot training from Tyndall Air Force Base. The Department is directed to provide a cost benefit analysis of this proposal for Tyndall Air Force Base and Kingsley Field in Oregon within 180 days. The report will analyze factors impacting F-15 training quantity and quality at each location, including training synergies, airspace access, and availability. It will also identify where F-15 Basic Crew Chief Training, Air Control Squadron Training, and Intelligence Formal Training will be established. The report will identify and justify the establishment and maintenance of F-15 Basic Crew Chief Training, Air Control Squadron Training, and Intelligence Formal Training. It will include analysis on simulator and ancillary training access, instructor base quality, future military construction requirements, and special considerations and costs due to different training environments. Additionally, the Department is requested to identify airfields sharing runways for Air Force and commercial operations within the continental United States. The Committee requests the Department to identify airfields that share runways for both Air Force and commercial operations in the continental United States. An independent review by a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) on the impact of the restructure on the Nation's combat air forces is also directed. The Secretary of the Air Force is required to provide reports on this no sooner than 180 days after enactment of this Act, with a directive that no funds may be used for executing the Combat Air Force restructure until 180 days after. The Committee directs the Department to provide reports on the Combat Air Force restructure no sooner than 180 days after enactment of this Act. No funds can be used for the restructure until all reports are submitted to the congressional defense committees. The report highlights the Navy-Marine Corps strike fighter shortfall due to high operational tempo in overseas contingencies aging the aircraft faster than planned. The Navy's fleet, primarily the F-18 aircraft, is aging faster than planned due to high operational tempo. This has led to critical shortfalls in strike fighter inventory, exacerbated by delays in the introduction of the F-35 aircraft. Last year, the Navy predicted a peak shortfall of 125 aircraft in fiscal year 2017. The Navy's F-18 aircraft fleet is aging faster than expected, leading to critical shortages in strike fighter inventory. The shortfall is now over 200 aircraft, with the life extension of older F-18s proving more challenging than anticipated. Additionally, the Navy's reduction in F-18 purchases in fiscal year 2010 is moving the tactical aircraft inventory in the opposite direction of what is needed to address the shortage. The reduction in F-18 purchases in fiscal year 2010 is moving the tactical aircraft inventory in the opposite direction of what is needed to address the shortage. Fortunately, the production line for the F/A-18E/F variant aircraft is still open and producing cost-effective aircraft. The unit price difference between an annual procurement and a multi-year procurement is substantial. The Committee believes the Navy is missing out on significant savings by not entering into a multi-year procurement for F/A-18E/F aircraft. They recommend $108,000,000 above the request for a five-year, 150 aircraft multi-year procurement to mitigate the strike fighter shortfall and achieve cost reduction initiatives. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommends a multi-year procurement for F/A-18E/F aircraft to address the strike fighter shortfall in the Navy's inventory. Additionally, they propose $495,000,000 for the procurement of nine additional F/A-18E/F Aircraft. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommends a multi-year procurement for F/A-18E/F aircraft to address the Navy's strike fighter shortfall. They propose an increase of $512,280,000 to procure nine additional F/A-18s in fiscal year 2010. The Senate approved an increase of $512,280,000 to procure nine additional F/A-18s in fiscal year 2010 and encourages the Navy to pursue a multi-year procurement contract for these aircraft. The Senate also passed an amendment prohibiting the Air Force from retiring any tactical aircraft until a detailed plan is submitted to the congressional defense committees. The Senate passed an amendment to prohibit the Air Force from retiring any tactical aircraft until a detailed plan is submitted to the congressional defense committees. The Senate passed an amendment to prevent the Air Force from retiring any tactical aircraft until a detailed plan is submitted to Congress outlining how force structure gaps will be filled and the follow-on missions for affected bases. The Air Force must submit a detailed plan to Congress outlining the criteria for selecting bases and aircraft for retirement, reassignment of personnel, cost savings, and investment of funds under the combat air forces restructuring plan. This appendix includes briefing slides on the proposed plan."
