    "content": "The Internet is a vast network of interconnected computers identified by unique IP numbers. Domain names simplify access to websites by replacing numbers with names. Top Level Domains (TLDs) indicate the type of website, such as country codes like .jp or .uk. The Domain Name System (DNS) is a distributed set of databases that map address numbers to domain names. Root servers coordinate connectivity across the Internet. The Internet originated from research funding by the Department of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) for a military network, which later evolved into a civilian segment. The Internet and the DNS were initially funded by the Department of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) for military purposes. A civilian segment later emerged with support from the National Science Foundation (NSF) and other science agencies. Key entities like the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) played crucial roles in managing the DNS. The National Science Foundation (NSF) was responsible for managing network services, including domain name registration. In 1993, NSF signed a five-year cooperative agreement with a consortium of companies called InterNic to handle technical decisions concerning root servers, qualifications for managing country code TLDs, protocol parameters, and IP address space management. In 1993, NSF signed an agreement with InterNic for domain name registration services. Network Solutions Inc. became the sole registrar for .com, .net, and .org gTLDs. Criticism grew over NSI's control and trademark disputes in the .com domain. Concerns arose over IANA's legal foundation and permanence. The enormous growth of registrations in the .com domain led to disputes and concerns about the legal foundation of IANA. This prompted actions both in the United States and internationally, including the release of a proposal by the International Ad Hoc Committee (IAHC) for the administration and management of gTLDs. The proposal recommended creating seven new gTLDs and selecting additional registrars to compete in granting registration services for new second level domain names. The IAHC proposed creating seven new gTLDs and selecting additional registrars to compete in granting registration services for new second level domain names. The U.S. government formed an interagency group led by the NTIA to address the domain name issue and issued a final statement of policy called the White Paper in June 1998. The White Paper endorsed a new not-for-profit corporation to administer policy for the Internet name and address system, ensuring stability, competition, private coordination, and fair representation of the Internet community. The White Paper endorsed the creation of a new not-for-profit corporation to manage Internet names and addresses. Internet constituencies worldwide met to discuss the formation of this new corporation, which eventually became known as the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). The final version of ICANN's bylaws and articles of incorporation were submitted to the Department of Commerce. After five iterations, ICANN's bylaws and articles of incorporation were submitted to the Department of Commerce on October 2, 1998. A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed on November 25, 1998, between DOC and ICANN to transition management responsibility for DNS functions to a private-sector not-for-profit entity. The MOU was extended until September 30, 2006, with specified transition tasks for ICANN to address. On June 30, 2005, the U.S. government outlined principles for the Internet's domain name system, emphasizing security and stability. NTIA stated that the U.S. would authorize changes to the root zone, recognized governments' interests in managing country code domains, and affirmed ICANN as the technical manager of the DNS. The U.S. government outlined principles for the Internet's domain name system in 2005, emphasizing security and stability. It recognized governments' interests in managing country code domains and affirmed ICANN as the technical manager of the DNS. In 2006, a new Joint Project Agreement (JPA) was announced between DOC and ICANN to transition coordination of technical functions to the private sector. The JPA focused on transparency and accountability mechanisms within ICANN. On September 30, 2009, the DOC and ICANN agreed on an Affirmation of Commitments (AoC) to institutionalize transparency and accountability mechanisms within ICANN. The AoC affirms commitments to ensure accountability, transparency, security, stability, and competition in the DNS globally. ICANN is a not-for-profit public benefit corporation headquartered in Los Angeles, CA, organized under the laws of California. ICANN is a not-for-profit public benefit corporation based in Los Angeles, CA, organized under California law. It operates under the oversight of the California attorney general and has tax-exempt status. ICANN's structure includes a Board of Directors advised by supporting organizations and advisory committees representing various Internet interests. ICANN's Board of Directors is advised by organizations and advisory committees representing different Internet constituencies. The Board consists of 16 members, including a president and representatives selected by various supporting organizations. ICANN's Board of Directors is advised by organizations and advisory committees representing different Internet constituencies. The Board consists of 16 members, including a president and representatives selected by various supporting organizations. The Address Supporting Organization, two selected by the Country-Code Names Supporting Organization, and one selected by the At-Large Advisory Committee, with five non-voting liaisons. The ICANN budget has grown significantly due to the Internet's expansion, domain name registration, and new gTLD program, reaching $159 million in revenue and 373 staff members in 2015. Funding primarily comes from fees paid by registrars and registry operators. ICANN's budget for 2015 was $159 million with 373 staff members. The organization is funded through fees paid by registrars and registry operators. Congressional committees oversee the Department of Commerce's activities related to ICANN. The Department of Commerce oversees ICANN's activities and policies, with congressional committees maintaining oversight. The DOC has no statutory authority over ICANN, but has historical ties to the internet's development. The Department of Commerce has historical ties to the internet's development, but no statutory authority over ICANN or the DNS. The U.S. government originally owned and operated key components of the network architecture enabling the domain name system. The 1998 Memorandum of Understanding initiated a transition of DNS coordination to a private-sector entity. The DOC does not play a role in internal governance. The Department of Commerce initiated a process to transition DNS coordination to a private-sector entity. The U.S. government retains a role through contractual agreements with ICANN, IANA/ICANN, and VeriSign for various technical functions related to the DNS. The Department of Commerce transitioned DNS coordination to a private-sector entity through agreements with ICANN, IANA/ICANN, and VeriSign for technical functions. An Affirmation of Commitments (AoC) was established to institutionalize global DNS coordination by a private-sector-led organization, succeeding the Joint Project Agreement. The AoC has no expiration date and would only end if one party terminates the agreement. Many U.S. industry and public interest groups argued that continued DOC oversight of ICANN was necessary to prevent undue control of the DNS by international or foreign governmental bodies. Many U.S. industry and public interest groups argued for continued DOC oversight of ICANN to prevent international or foreign governmental control of the DNS. International entities believed ICANN had met conditions for privatization and opposed U.S. government control. Senator Snowe introduced S.Res. 564 in the 110th Congress, stating more progress was needed in achieving accountability and transparency goals. NTIA issued a Notice of Inquiry seeking public comment on the matter. NTIA issued a Notice of Inquiry on the progress of achieving accountability and transparency goals set by the JPA between DOC and ICANN. The mid-term review highlighted areas needing further work, such as long-term stability, accountability, and stakeholder participation. Public comments were requested on the transition of technical coordination. The NTIA requested public comments on the progress of transitioning the DNS management to the private sector, focusing on leadership, stakeholder participation, contract compliance, and competition. A hearing was held by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce to discuss the expiration of the JPA and related issues. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce held a hearing on the expiration of the JPA and related issues. Members expressed the need for a permanent instrument to ensure ICANN's accountability to the public and stakeholders. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce discussed the need for a permanent instrument to ensure ICANN's accountability to the public and stakeholders. This instrument should maintain the DOC-ICANN relationship, conduct periodic reviews of ICANN performance, outline steps for accountability improvement, implement new gTLDs and internationalized domain names, ensure access to WHOIS information, and confirm ICANN's not-for-profit status in the US. ICANN commits to remaining a not-for-profit corporation headquartered in the United States with global offices to serve the global community. The Affirmation of Commitments (AoC) calls for the establishment of review panels to ensure accountability, transparency, and the interests of global Internet users. ICANN will establish review panels to evaluate governance, transparency, and accountability in four areas. The panel will include members from various ICANN committees, organizations, and independent experts. The review panel, consisting of key ICANN members and independent experts, will assess ICANN's plan to enhance DNS operational stability, security, and global interoperability. The panel's composition will be jointly agreed upon by the GAC chair and ICANN CEO. The panel, including key ICANN members and independent experts, will periodically assess the impact of new gTLDs on competition, consumer trust, and choice. Additionally, it will review the WHOIS policy to evaluate its effectiveness. The panel, composed of key ICANN members, independent experts, and representatives from various organizations, will review the existing WHOIS policy to assess its effectiveness in meeting the needs of law enforcement and promoting consumer trust. The Accountability and Transparency Review Team (ATRT) released recommendations to improve ICANN's transparency and accountability. The Board adopted all 27 ATRT recommendations in June 2011. NTIA stated that ICANN management and staff must now implement these recommendations rapidly. The Board adopted all 27 ATRT recommendations, and NTIA emphasized the need for ICANN management to implement them quickly. A follow-up report, ATRT2, presented 12 new recommendations to address issues from the first report. The \"IANA functions contract\" allows ICANN to manage critical technical functions of the DNS. ICANN manages technical functions of the DNS, including IP address allocation and root zone file editing. VeriSign maintains the official root zone file for .com and .net registries under a cooperative agreement with the DOC. The U.S. government has authority over the root zone file and can approve or deny changes. The U.S. government has authority over the root zone file, allowing them to approve or deny changes made to it, such as adding new top-level domains. The government aims to preserve the security and stability of the DNS and is committed to maintaining its historic role in authorizing modifications to the root zone. The U.S. government maintains authority over the DNS root zone file to ensure security and stability. The expiration of the JPA and establishment of the AoC did not directly impact this authority. NTIA awarded the IANA functions contract to ICANN through September 30, 2015. The NTIA awarded the IANA functions contract to ICANN through September 30, 2015, with the option to extend it through September 2019. The contract includes a separation between policy development and implementation, a conflict of interest policy, respect for local laws, and transparency and accountability requirements. The contractor must be a wholly U.S. owned and operated firm or a U.S. university or college. The IANA contract specifies that the contractor must be U.S. owned and operated, with operations in the U.S. NTIA has oversight over ICANN and the domain name system, and announced its intention to transition its stewardship role in 2014. NTIA announced its intention to transition its stewardship role over key domain name functions to the global Internet multistakeholder community, with a goal to let its IANA functions contract with ICANN expire by September 30, 2015. NTIA is asking ICANN to collaborate with global Internet stakeholders to develop a transition proposal. NTIA expects ICANN to collaborate with key stakeholders, including IETF, IAB, ISOC, RIRs, domain operators, Verisign, and global stakeholders for the transition of IANA functions. Many Internet technical organizations have called for the globalization of ICANN and IANA functions. NTIA has set criteria for the transition of ICANN and IANA functions, emphasizing the importance of broad community support and adherence to key principles. This includes maintaining the multistakeholder model, DNS security, meeting global needs, and preserving Internet openness. Supporters of the transition argue that transferring authority over ICANN and the DNS to the global Internet community will strengthen the multistakeholder model of Internet governance and enable the United States to oppose intergovernmental control over the Internet. Supporters argue that the U.S. government has always intended for ICANN to eventually be privatized, and that the organization has matured and improved its accountability. Opponents, however, are concerned that the transition may compromise the integrity and stability of the DNS without NTIA's oversight. Critics fear that without NTIA's oversight, foreign governments could exert more control over the Internet, which would be detrimental to U.S. interests. They are also concerned about the development of a new international entity to oversee the DNS transition. Critics are concerned about the risks of foreign governments gaining influence over the DNS through the transition to a new Internet governance mechanism that no longer is subject to U.S. government oversight. Representative Shimkus introduced H.R. 4342, the DOTCOM Act, to prohibit the NTIA from relinquishing responsibility over the Internet. H.R. 4342, the DOTCOM Act introduced by Representative Shimkus, aims to prevent the NTIA from giving up control of the Internet domain name system until a report on the implications is submitted to Congress. The report will assess the advantages and disadvantages of the change, address national security concerns, and define the \"multistakeholder model\" in Internet policymaking. The DOTCOM Act, introduced by Representative Shimkus, aims to prevent NTIA from relinquishing control of the Internet domain name system without a report assessing the implications. The report will evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of the change, address national security concerns, and define the \"multistakeholder model\" in Internet policymaking. H.R. 4342 was approved by the House Energy and Commerce Committee on May 8, 2014, and subsequently, the GAO was requested to examine the Administration's proposal to transition NTIA's authority over IANA to the multistakeholder Internet community. The DOTCOM Act, introduced by Representative Shimkus, was offered as an amendment to H.R. 4435 on May 22, 2014, and passed by the House with a vote of 245-177. The House Armed Services committee emphasized the need for protections for the .mil domain and supported the separation of policymaking and root-zone management. The Senate Armed Services Committee supported maintaining separation between policymaking and root-zone management functions. Section 1646 of S. 2410 stated that the Secretary of Defense should advise the President on transferring the remaining role of the United States Government in Internet Assigned Numbers Authority functions to a global multi-stakeholder community. The Senate Armed Services Committee supported transferring the remaining role of the United States Government in Internet Assigned Numbers Authority functions to a global multi-stakeholder community, ensuring the '.MIL' top-level domain and Internet Protocol address numbers used by the Department of Defense remain exclusive for national security. DOD was directed to sustain stewardship of Internet root zone servers. The Senate Armed Services Committee supported transferring the remaining role of the United States Government in Internet Assigned Numbers Authority functions to a global multi-stakeholder community, ensuring the '.MIL' top-level domain and Internet Protocol address numbers used by the Department of Defense remain exclusive for national security. The committee urged DOD to seek an agreement with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers to maintain the .mil domain's status after the transition. The Carl Levin and Howard P. \"Buck\" McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 was signed into law, without including the DOTCOM. The Carl Levin and Howard P. \"Buck\" McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015, signed on December 16, 2014, does not include the DOTCOM Act provision. Section 1639 of the Act emphasizes the need to protect legacy top-level domain names and Internet Protocol address numbers, especially those used for national security purposes by the Department of Defense and other U.S. government components. The Department of Defense and US Government use domain names and IP addresses for national security. Mechanisms uphold consensus-based decision making in the multi-stakeholder approach. Stress-testing scenarios show accountability processes work transparently to maintain a free, open, and resilient Internet. Congress urges the Secretary of Defense to sustain stewardship of Internet root zone servers. The House Appropriations Committee approved H.R. 4660, the FY2015 Commerce, Justice, Science (CJS) Appropriations Act, which includes funds for DOC and NTIA. The committee's recommendation does not allocate funds for the transition of Internet root zone servers managed by the Department of Defense. The House Appropriations Committee recommended no funds for the transition of Internet root zone servers managed by the Department of Defense. An amendment to H.R. 4660 stated that no funds from the Act can be used to relinquish NTIA's responsibility for Internet domain name system functions. The National Telecommunications and Information Administration's responsibility for Internet domain name system functions, including the authoritative root zone file and Internet Assigned Numbers Authority functions, was addressed in H.R. 4660. The Senate Appropriations Committee directed NTIA to review any proposed transition of the IANA contract to ensure ICANN has NTIA-approved multi-stakeholder oversight. The Senate Appropriations Committee directed NTIA to conduct a thorough review of the proposed transition of the IANA contract to ensure ICANN has an approved oversight plan insulated from foreign government control. NTIA is required to report quarterly to the committee on the privatization process and inform them in advance of any decision on a successor contract. The committee expressed concern about NTIA's advocacy for U.S. businesses and consumers in ICANN. The Senate Appropriations Committee directed NTIA to review the IANA contract transition and report quarterly on the privatization process. Concerns were raised about NTIA's advocacy for U.S. businesses and consumers in ICANN. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 prohibits NTIA from relinquishing its responsibility for Internet domain name system functions during FY2015. During FY2015, NTIA is prohibited from using funds to relinquish its responsibility for Internet domain name system functions, including the authoritative root zone file and IANA functions. The prohibition on funding for NTIA's IANA transition activities ends on September 30, 2015. NTIA is directed to inform Congressional committees 45 days in advance of any proposed successor contract or decision related to changing its role. NTIA is directed to inform Congressional committees 45 days in advance of any proposed successor contract or decision related to changing its role with ICANN or IANA activities. NTIA must also submit a report to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations regarding potential recourse if a transition to a new contract negatively impacts the United States. Other legislation, such as H.R. 4367, also addresses the proposed transition. Legislation introduced in response to the proposed transition of Internet governance includes H.R. 4367, H.R. 4398, and H.R. 5737, all aimed at preventing NTIA from relinquishing its responsibilities. H.R. 5737 introduced by Representative Mike Kelly on November 19, 2014, would prohibit NTIA from relinquishing its domain name functions unless certain criteria are met. H.R. 4367, H.R. 4398, and H.R. 5737 were referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce. The DOTCOM Act of 2015, reintroduced as H.R. 805 by Representative Shimkus on February 5, 2015, is also related to the proposed transition of Internet governance. The DOTCOM Act of 2015, reintroduced as H.R. 805 by Representative Shimkus on February 5, 2015, would delay the transfer of Internet domain name system oversight until GAO submits a report to Congress analyzing the implications of the proposed transition. The report must discuss the pros and cons of the transfer, NTIA's criteria for the transfer, all transfer proposals, and the processes involved. The GAO is directed to analyze the disadvantages of the proposed transfer, NTIA's criteria, transfer proposals, evaluation processes, national security concerns, and concerns regarding the security of the Internet domain name system. The report will also define the \"multistakeholder model\" and other relevant terms. The NTIA is involved in Internet policymaking and governance. H.R. 805 and S.Res. 71 were introduced in Congress to address Internet governance awareness and the proposed transition process. The Senate resolution aims to increase public awareness and emphasize the importance of accountability and governance reforms in preparation for the transition. The Senate resolution S.Res. 71 emphasizes the importance of accountability and governance reforms in preparation for the transition of the stewardship of the IANA functions. Testimony from NTIA, ICANN, and others was heard at a Senate Committee hearing on the status of the transition process. ICANN has initiated a multistakeholder community process to reach consensus on the transition. ICANN has started a multistakeholder process to reach consensus on the transition of the IANA functions stewardship. A draft proposal for the transition was put out for public input based on feedback from the Internet community. A steering group would oversee the process in an open and transparent manner. The draft proposal for the transition of NTIA's stewardship of the IANA functions includes the formation of a steering group composed of representatives from various ICANN constituencies and affected parties. ICANN announced the creation of a Coordination Group to prepare the transition proposal after receiving public comments on the steering group draft proposal. The IANA Stewardship Transition Coordination Group (ICG) was formed by ICANN to prepare a transition proposal. It consists of 30 individuals representing 13 communities selected by their respective communities. The ICG's mission is to coordinate the development of a proposal for the three primary IANA functions. The ICG was formed by ICANN to prepare a transition proposal for the three primary IANA functions. The three proposals from operational communities are being consolidated into a single proposal. Domain Names proposal is in progress with a target submission date of June 2015, while the Number Resources proposal is being developed by the CRISP Team. The final proposal for the ICG is expected to be submitted by June 2015. The RIRs and IETF have submitted their proposals for Number Resources and Protocol Parameters, respectively, in January 2015. Consensus on the domain name function proposal is still pending. Consensus on the domain name function proposal has proven difficult to reach, with the CWG-Stewardship group unable to meet the extended deadline of June 2015. Transitioning away from the NTIA contract with respect to the domain naming function is complex and controversial. The debate within the multistakeholder community is whether a new organization should oversee the IANA function contract or if ICANN should be given authority with enhanced accountability measures. ICANN has also started a process to enhance its accountability in parallel with the IANA stewardship transition. ICANN has initiated a process to enhance its accountability in preparation for the potential absence of its historical contractual relationship with the U.S. government. This includes strengthening existing accountability mechanisms through a Cross Community Working Group (CCWG) to develop proposals. ICANN has formed a Cross Community Working Group (CCWG) to enhance its accountability mechanisms. The CCWG-Accountability consists of 25 members and 141 participants working on proposals. Decisions will be made by consensus, and the group is open to interested individuals as participants. The Cross Community Working Group (CCWG) on ICANN's accountability mechanisms consists of 25 members and 141 participants. Advisors selected by a Public Experts Group will provide independent advice and research. The CCWG is pursuing two interrelated Work Streams, with a focus on enhancing ICANN mechanisms. The CCWG on ICANN's accountability mechanisms consists of 25 members and 141 participants. Advisors provide independent advice and research. The group is pursuing two interrelated Work Streams focusing on enhancing ICANN mechanisms. Work Stream 1 focuses on mechanisms enhancing ICANN accountability within the IANA Stewardship Transition timeframe. Work Stream 2 addresses accountability topics extending beyond the transition. If approved, an accountability proposal will be submitted to the ICANN Board for approval. An accountability proposal will be submitted to the ICANN Board for approval by the CCWG chartering organizations. The Board can approve, modify, or reconsider the proposal, with a detailed rationale required for any decision not to implement a recommendation. The Workstream 1 proposal is due in June 2015, while Workstream 2's submission will follow the ICANN 54 meeting in October 2015. NTIA's approval is necessary for the transition to proceed, as Congress has restricted NTIA from spending any funds. NTIA's role in the transition process is crucial as they need to approve the multistakeholder community proposal for the transition to proceed. NTIA Administrator Lawrence Strickling stated that no appropriated funds will be used to terminate the IANA functions contract with ICANN before September 30, 2015. NTIA will not use appropriated funds to terminate the IANA functions contract with ICANN before September 30, 2015. Congress expects NTIA to actively monitor the transition process and provide regular reports on the discussions within the multistakeholder community. NTIA will actively monitor discussions and activities within the multistakeholder community as it develops the transition plan, participate in meetings with ICANN and other stakeholders, represent the United States at ICANN's Governmental Advisory Committee meetings, and provide informal feedback. The focus is on supporting an open and participatory multistakeholder process where all ideas are welcome. The community should proceed as if it has only one chance to get this right, with all ideas welcome and participants able to test all transition options. Everyone has the responsibility to participate as they deem appropriate, ensuring a well-thought-out plan that answers all concerns. The CWG-Stewardship group is called upon to equally consider all transition proposal models and ensure accountability in any new organizational structures replacing NTIA's oversight of the IANA functions contract. NTIA emphasized the need for accountability in the transition process, urging stress testing of proposed solutions to prevent future attempts to influence or take over ICANN. The community is encouraged to address mechanisms for removing or replacing board members if stakeholders lose confidence. NTIA stresses the importance of accountability in the transition process, urging stress testing of proposed solutions to prevent future attempts to influence or take over ICANN. The community is encouraged to address mechanisms for removing or replacing board members if stakeholders lose confidence. NTIA has specified that both the IANA function stewardship and accountability transition processes should remain synchronized, with a coordinated and complete transition plan to be delivered by summer, aiming for September 2015 as a target date. NTIA emphasizes the need for accountability in the transition process, stressing stress testing of proposed solutions to prevent future influence on ICANN. The community is urged to address mechanisms for removing or replacing board members if confidence is lost. Both the IANA function stewardship and accountability transition processes should be synchronized, with a complete plan to be delivered by summer, aiming for September 2015 as a target date. ICANN is an international organization due to the global nature of cyberspace and the Internet, with a diverse membership on its Board of Directors and policy-influencing constituency groups. ICANN's Board of Directors and constituency groups are global, with the Governmental Advisory Committee providing advice on public policy matters. The U.S. government's authority over ICANN and the DNS has been questioned by the international community. The international community, including foreign governments, argues against the U.S. government's control over ICANN and the DNS. The United Nations debated the issue at the 2003 World Summit on the Information Society and a report by the UN's Working Group on Internet Governance recommended against any single government having a dominant role in international governance. The UN's Working Group on Internet Governance released a report in 2005 calling for further internationalization of Internet governance. The report proposed creating a new global forum for Internet stakeholders and suggested four possible models, including two involving new Internet governance bodies linked to the UN. The report recommended that ICANN be either supplanted or made accountable to a higher intergovernmental body. These conclusions were to be considered during the second phase of the WSIS in Tunis in November 2005. The report recommended that ICANN be made accountable to a higher intergovernmental body. U.S. officials opposed transferring control of the domain name system to any international body, with the 109th Congress supporting U.S. control over ICANN. The EU initially backed the U.S. position but shifted towards supporting an enhanced international role in governing the Internet during preparatory meetings in September 2005. In September 2005, the EU shifted its support towards an enhanced international role in governing the Internet. Conflict at the WSIS Tunis Summit over control of the domain name system was averted by an Internet governance agreement announced on November 15, 2005. ICANN and the United States maintained their roles, while a new international group, the Internet Governance Forum (IGF), was formed under the U.N. to provide a forum for stakeholders to discuss Internet policy. The Internet Governance Forum (IGF) was formed under the U.N. to provide a forum for stakeholders to discuss Internet policy issues. In December 2010, the U.N. General Assembly renewed the IGF for another five years and tasked the U.N.'s Commission on Science and Technology for Development (CSTD) to develop a report on how the IGF might be improved. A Working Group on Improvements to the Internet Governance Forum was formed, including 22 governments and Internet stakeholder groups. Improvements to the Internet Governance Forum were made in 2010 and 2011, with controversies over new gTLDs and the .xxx TLD leading to calls for increased government influence on ICANN policy decisions. Some governments, like the United States, Canada, and the European Union, support the current multistakeholder model but advocate for a stronger role for the Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC). Other nations, such as Brazil, South Africa, and India, have also weighed in on the issue. Some nations advocate for an enhanced role for the Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC) on ICANN policy decisions, while others propose creating an Internet policy development entity within the U.N. system. Russia and China suggest a voluntary \"International Code of Conduct for Information Security\" for discussion in the U.N. General Assembly. The International Code of Conduct for Information Security was proposed by Russia and China for discussion in the U.N. General Assembly. It promotes multilateral, transparent, and democratic international management of the Internet. A revised version was released on January 13, 2015, emphasizing equal responsibility for all states in governing the Internet. The World Conference on International Telecommunications (WCIT) was held in Dubai on December 3-14, 2012 by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) to revise the International Telecommunications Regulations (ITRs) for equitable distribution of resources and secure Internet functioning. The World Conference on International Telecommunications (WCIT) in Dubai aimed to revise the International Telecommunications Regulations (ITRs) to address Internet traffic and governance. The Administration and Congress advocated for the new ITRs to focus on traditional telecommunications traffic and maintain a multistakeholder model of Internet governance. The WCIT aimed to revise ITRs to address Internet traffic and governance. Concerns arose in Congress about potential increased intergovernmental control over the Internet. H.Con.Res. 127 was introduced to oppose any extension of ITU jurisdiction over the Internet. H.Con.Res. 127 was introduced in response to concerns about potential increased intergovernmental control over the Internet, expressing Congress's support for a global Internet free from government control and the multistakeholder governance model. H.Con.Res. 127 was passed unanimously by the House on August 2, 2012, to promote a global Internet free from government control. Senator Rubio introduced a similar resolution in the Senate, expressing the need to continue working on the United States' position on Internet governance. The United States aims to promote a global Internet free from government control and uphold the multistakeholder model. S.Con.Res. 50 was unanimously passed by the Senate on September 22, 2012, and by the House on December 5, 2012. During the WCIT, a proposal supported by certain countries sought to extend ITR jurisdiction over Internet traffic and infrastructure. During the WCIT, a proposal supported by Russia, China, Saudi Arabia, Algeria, and Sudan aimed to extend ITR jurisdiction over Internet governance. The proposal included the right for Member States to manage Internet resources but was later withdrawn. As a compromise, a nonbinding resolution was adopted by the ITU. The ITU adopted a nonbinding resolution titled \"To Foster an enabling environment for the greater growth of the Internet\" as a compromise during the WCIT. Resolution 3 emphasizes equal government roles in international Internet governance and encourages Member States to share their positions on Internet-related issues within the ITU mandate. The United States declined to sign the treaty at the WCIT in Dubai due to the inclusion of Resolution 3 and new ITR articles related to spam and cybersecurity. The international debate over Internet governance is expected to continue, with the 113th Congress likely monitoring and overseeing U.S. government efforts to oppose intergovernmental control over the Internet. On April 16, 2013, H.R. 1580 was introduced to affirm the U.S. policy regarding Internet governance. On April 16, 2013, H.R. 1580 was introduced to oppose intergovernmental control over the Internet. It affirms the U.S. policy to preserve the multistakeholder model governing the Internet. The bill was passed unanimously by the House of Representatives on May 14, 2013. On May 14, 2013, H.R. 1580 was passed unanimously by the House of Representatives. In October 2013, leaders called for strengthening global multistakeholder Internet cooperation to prevent fragmentation and restore trust post revelations of monitoring. Leaders expressed strong concern over the undermining of trust and confidence of Internet users globally due to pervasive monitoring and surveillance. They called for ongoing efforts to address Internet Governance challenges and to accelerate the globalization of ICANN and IANA functions. The President of ICANN met with the President of Brazil to discuss plans for global multistakeholder Internet cooperation. After the Montevideo Statement, plans were made for an international Internet governance summit in April 2014 in Brazil. NETmundial, a global multistakeholder meeting on Internet governance, took place in Sao Paulo. The meeting aimed to create governance principles and a roadmap for the Internet's evolution. NETmundial was a global meeting in Sao Paulo focused on crafting Internet governance principles and proposing a roadmap for the Internet governance ecosystem. The outcome was a nonbinding \"NETmundial Multistakeholder Statement\" reaffirming the multistakeholder model, endorsing the transition of IANA functions to the global community, and emphasizing the importance of expanding the mandate. The U.S. government endorsed the transition of IANA functions to the global multistakeholder community and emphasized strengthening the Internet Governance Forum's mandate. A Panel on the Future of Global Internet Cooperation was formed by ICANN, representing a multistakeholder approach to Internet governance. The Panel on the Future of Global Internet Cooperation, formed by ICANN, released a report in May 2014 outlining principles for global Internet cooperation and proposed frameworks for future governance challenges. The creation of a NETmundial Initiative for Internet Governance Cooperation and Development was announced in August 2014 by the World Economic Forum in partnership with ICANN and other stakeholders. This initiative was separate from the April 2014 NETmundial summit in Brazil. The NETmundial Initiative aims to apply principles for Internet cooperation and governance. The ITU's Plenipotentiary Conference in Korea sets general policies and elects officials every four years. The U.S. delegation had concerns before the conference. The ITU's Plenipotentiary Conference in Korea sets general policies, adopts strategic plans, and elects officials every four years. The U.S. delegation had concerns about expanding ITU's role in Internet governance, but the conference concluded successfully without such expansion. Top Level Domains (TLDs) are suffixes at the end of web addresses. Domains (TLDs) are suffixes at the end of web addresses, such as country codes like .us, .uk, or generic TLDs like .com, .org. ICANN established eight gTLDs before 2000, and later introduced 22 gTLDs through application rounds. Some are restricted (e.g., .museum, .gov) while others are open for registration (.com, .org). Applicants for new gTLDs are typically commercial or non-profit organizations seeking ICANN recognition. Applicants for new gTLDs are usually commercial or non-profit organizations seeking ICANN recognition to establish and operate name servers for their TLD registry. ICANN began a consultative process in 2005 to introduce an indefinite number of new gTLDs into the domain name system, in response to the growing demand for domain names on the Internet. ICANN developed rules and procedures for introducing an indefinite number of new gTLDs into the domain name system. Between 2008 and 2011, ICANN released seven iterations of its gTLD Applicant Guidebook. In June 2011, the ICANN Board of Directors approved the launch of the new gTLD program, allowing potentially hundreds of new gTLDs to be introduced into the DNS. Applications for new gTLDs were accepted from January 12 through April 12, 2012, with an application fee of $185,000. ICANN approved the new gTLD program, allowing for the introduction of hundreds of new gTLDs into the DNS. Applications were accepted from January 12 to April 12, 2012, with a fee of $185,000. The approval has sparked controversy among trademark holders concerned about higher costs and difficulties in protecting their trademarks. Governments and law enforcement also expressed worries about intellectual property protections and combating cybercrimes across the new gTLDs. The approval of the new gTLD program by ICANN raised concerns among trademark holders and governments about the added burden of combating cybercrimes across the new gTLDs. Governments advocated for more intellectual property protections and stringent rules for better law enforcement in the domain space to protect consumers. Despite some changes, strong opposition from trademark holders, including parts of the U.S. government, emerged in late 2011. ICANN faced opposition from parts of the U.S. government in late 2011 regarding the gTLD expansion. However, ICANN defended its program, stating that new gTLDs would offer more protections for consumers and trademark holders, provide competition, choice, and innovation to the domain name system, and that critics had ample opportunity to contribute input during a seven-year policy development process. ICANN did not delay the new gTLD program, opening the application window on January 12, 2012. By June 13, 2012, ICANN had received 1,930 applications for new gTLDs, including geographic and Internationalized Domain Names. The evaluation phase will determine acceptance of these applications. After receiving 1,930 new gTLD applications, ICANN entered the evaluation phase to decide on their acceptance. The process is complex and can take 9 to 20 months, depending on various factors outlined in ICANN's gTLD Applicant Guidebook. ICANN has delegated new gTLDs into the DNS system. Rules and procedures are outlined in the gTLD Applicant Guidebook. 521 gTLDs are added to the Internet, with 894 in progress. ICANN plans for future rounds with changes to the application process. ICANN has delegated new gTLDs into the DNS system, with plans for future rounds and changes to the application process. Concerns arise about domain name abuse in the new gTLD spaces, prompting interest in ICANN's approach to intellectual property protection and mitigating unlawful behavior. The Dot Kids Implementation and Efficiency Act of 2002 was enacted in the 107th Congress to create a \"kids-friendly top level domain name\" (kids.us) containing age-appropriate content to protect children from obscene material on the Internet. The Dot Kids Implementation and Efficiency Act of 2002 required the .us registry operator to establish a kids-friendly domain (kids.us) for minors. Bills were introduced in past Congresses to establish a top-level domain for adult content or harmful material for minors, but did not advance beyond introduction. ICANN considered creating a \".xxx\" domain for adult websites, with voluntary registration and no requirement to give up existing domains. The Department of Commerce requested additional time for ICANN to address objections to the creation of a .xxx domain for adult websites. ICANN's Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC) expressed concerns about the impact of pornography on families and children, opposing the creation of a new top-level domain for adult content. The ICANN Board authorized negotiations with ICM Registry to address concerns raised by the GAC and the Department of Commerce. Despite a vote against the proposed agreement in May 2006, a revised agreement was considered in January 2007 for establishing a .xxx domain. On January 5, 2007, ICANN proposed a revised agreement with ICM Registry to establish a .xxx domain. However, on March 30, 2007, the ICANN Board voted 9-5 to deny the domain, citing reluctance to manage Internet content. ICM Registry challenged ICANN's decision before an Independent Review Panel, which ruled in favor of ICM on February 19, 2010. The Independent Review Panel ruled in favor of ICM Registry regarding their application for the .xxx TLD, stating that ICANN's reversal of approval was not consistent with fair policy. The ICANN Board postponed a decision on the .xxx TLD at their March 2010 meeting. At ICANN's March 2010 meeting, the Board postponed a decision on the .xxx TLD. In June 2010, the Board approved ICM's .xxx application to move forward, leading to expedited due diligence, negotiations on a draft registry agreement, and consultation with ICANN's Governmental Advisory Committee. In December, the ICANN Board passed a resolution regarding the application. The ICANN Board passed a resolution in December regarding the .xxx TLD application, stating intent to enter into a registry agreement with ICM Registry but will consult with the Governmental Advisory Committee on conflicting decisions. A February 2011 letter addressed areas of conflict with GAC advice on the .xxx registry agreement. The ICANN Board approved the .xxx registry agreement with ICM despite conflicting GAC advice. The resolution passed in March 2011, allowing the CEO or General Counsel to execute the agreement. The .xxx top-level domain became available in December 2011. The .xxx top-level domain became available in December 2011, with concerns about DNS vulnerabilities and the development of DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) to address them. DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) have been developed to address DNS vulnerabilities by digitally signing DNS data. \"Signing the root\" is a critical step in protecting against malicious attacks on the DNS. NTIA issued a Notice of Inquiry seeking public comment on deploying DNSSEC in the Internet's DNS infrastructure. On June 3, 2009, NTIA and NIST announced plans to work with ICANN and VeriSign to develop an interim approach for deploying DNSSEC in the root zone. On June 9, 2010, NTIA filed a notice seeking public comments on its testing and evaluation report for DNSSEC implementation in the root zone. By July 15, 2010, ICANN published the root zone trust anchor, allowing root operators to serve the signed root zone with actual keys. DNSSEC adoption is voluntary for registries, registrars, and other entities. The signed root zone is now available for DNSSEC deployment, requiring voluntary adoption by registries, registrars, and DNS server operators worldwide to enhance protection against fraudulent DNS redirection. Domain name registrants must provide contact information for the WHOIS database, sparking debate over the scope and accessibility of this data. The WHOIS database contains contact information for domain name registrants, sparking debate over its scope and accessibility. Privacy advocates argue for limited access, while businesses, law enforcement, and the U.S. government advocate for continued public access. ICANN's GNSO is developing policy recommendations on what data should be publicly available through WHOIS. On April 12, 2006, the GNSO approved a \"working definition\" for the public display of WHOIS information. The GNSO approved a narrow technical definition for the public display of WHOIS information, supported by privacy advocates, registries, registrars, and non-commercial user constituencies. Opponents urged ICANN to reconsider the working definition, leading to a vote by the GNSO on October 31, 2007. The GNSO deferred a decision on WHOIS database privacy in October 2007 and rejected a proposal for third-party contact information. Currently, the GNSO is conducting extensive studies on WHOIS, initiated by ICANN in June 2011 following recommendations from the Governmental Advisory Committee in 2008. The WHOIS studies recommended by the Governmental Advisory Committee in 2008 examined misuse, registrant identification, proxy and privacy abuse, and the feasibility of a privacy reveal study. A WHOIS policy review team issued 16 recommendations for strengthening WHOIS, including improving data accuracy and access. The ICANN Board approved a resolution to redefine WHOIS. The ICANN Board approved a resolution in 2012 to improve WHOIS data accuracy and access. An Expert Working Group released recommendations in 2014 for a next-generation Registration Directory Service to replace WHOIS. ICANN is currently working on implementing these recommendations. The White Paper called upon WIPO to develop recommendations for trademark/domain name dispute resolutions, adopted by ICANN in 1999. Registrars will take no action until receiving instructions from the domain-name holder. ICANN-accredited registrars must apply a uniform policy for handling complaints. Registrars will not take action without instructions from the domain-name holder or a court order. An exception is made for \"abusive registrations\" like cybersquatting, which is resolved through a special online procedure. ICANN's Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy started on December 9, 1999. The Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act was passed by the 106th Congress. The Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act, passed by the 106th Congress, allows courts to order forfeiture, cancellation, or transfer of domain names registered in bad faith. It also provides for civil damages of $1,000 to $100,000 per domain name identifier. Intellectual property concerns drive the debate over ICANN's addition of new generic top-level domain names. The debate over ICANN's addition of new generic top-level domain names is driven by intellectual property concerns, with many arguing that it could compromise IP rights and increase trademark protection costs. Legislation like PROTECT IP and SOPA aim to address online piracy by prohibiting ISPs from directing traffic to infringing domain names. The debate over ICANN's addition of new generic top-level domain names is driven by intellectual property concerns, with legislation like PROTECT IP and SOPA aiming to address online piracy by prohibiting ISPs from directing traffic to infringing domain names. The technical, operational, and management decisions regarding the DNS can have significant impacts on Internet-related policy issues such as intellectual property, privacy, Internet freedom, e-commerce, and cybersecurity, affecting Internet stakeholders worldwide. In transferring management of the DNS to the private sector, the key policy question has always been how to best ensure achievement of Internet stability and security, competition, private and bottom-up policymaking and coordination, and fair representation of the global. The debate over ICANN's addition of new generic top-level domain names is driven by intellectual property concerns, with legislation like PROTECT IP and SOPA aiming to address online piracy. Controversies such as the new gTLDs and .xxx have led some governments to criticize the ICANN policymaking process and suggest ways to increase governmental influence. Some governments argue for an enhanced role in developing Internet policies, while defenders of the multistakeholder model believe in a bottom-up consensus approach to protect policy decisions from government control. The 114th Congress is expected to closely examine NTIA's actions on Internet governance. The 114th Congress is likely to closely examine NTIA's proposed transitioning of its authority over ICANN and the DNS to a multistakeholder-driven entity. Congress will evaluate the transition plan, seeking assurances for a stable, secure, resilient, and open DNS free of U.S. government stewardship. Congress will assess ongoing and future intergovernmental telecommunications conferences for potential increased control over the Internet. NTIA and other government agencies will work to counteract this threat, impacting the evolution of ICANN, the DNS, and the Internet."
