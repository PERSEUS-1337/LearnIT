    "content": "Rising procurement costs for Navy ships are a concern for Navy officials and Members of Congress. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that executing a 30-year Navy shipbuilding plan may require higher annual funding levels than currently planned. Constraints on ship-procurement funding have led to reduced ship procurement rates in recent years, causing concern about the future size of the Navy and shipyards. Some Members of Congress are concerned about reduced ship procurement rates and rising Navy ship procurement costs. Congress must decide how to address these issues, which could impact future Navy capabilities, funding requirements, and the shipbuilding industrial base. Options include increasing funding, changing budget allocation for Navy ships, and utilizing multiyear procurement. Options to address reduced ship procurement rates and rising Navy ship procurement costs include increasing annual Navy ship-procurement funding, changing budget allocation for Navy ships, utilizing multiyear procurement, changing acquisition strategy, reducing shipyard fixed overhead costs, improving operating efficiency of shipyards, building ships without some planned equipment, and building ships in foreign shipyards with lower construction costs. The report discusses options to address reduced ship procurement rates and rising Navy ship procurement costs, including increasing funding, changing budget allocation, utilizing multiyear procurement, changing acquisition strategy, reducing shipyard fixed overhead costs, improving operating efficiency, building ships without some planned equipment, and constructing ships in foreign shipyards for cost savings. Additionally, it explores the option of reducing Navy ship procurement costs by shifting to designs with lower unit procurement costs, focusing on lower-cost attack submarines, aircraft carriers, larger surface combatants, and smaller surface combatants. The report discusses options for lower-cost designs of attack submarines, aircraft carriers, larger surface combatants, and smaller surface combatants. Congress may consider the advantages and disadvantages of shifting to these designs. Recent legislative activity on rising Navy ship procurement costs is also reviewed. Options for lower-cost Navy ship designs can be generated by starting with currently planned Navy ship designs and making changes such as reducing ship size to decrease procurement costs. This strategy has been used for the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS). The Navy can reduce procurement costs by shifting from nuclear to conventional propulsion for submarines and aircraft carriers, saving hundreds of millions of dollars. This strategy has been applied to the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) by reducing its size. A nuclear propulsion plant can significantly reduce ship procurement costs by shifting to a hull built to commercial-ship survivability standards. The Navy is considering using common hull designs for multiple ship classes to save costs. The Navy is considering using common hull designs for multiple ship classes to save costs and improve production economies of scale. This strategy can be applied more widely beyond the planned DDG-1000 destroyer and CG(X) cruiser. The OFT report suggests building four large surface ships with a common merchant-like hull design. The OFT report proposes building four large surface ships using a common merchant-like hull design, including an aircraft carrier, missile-and-rocket ship, amphibious assault ship, and small-craft \"mother\" ship. The CSBA report suggests using the Navy's LPD-17 class amphibious ship hull design for other ship types. Lower-cost ship options derived from these approaches may be less capable than current designs but offer cost savings. The report discusses potential lower-cost ship options derived from current ship designs, such as the Virginia (SSN-774) class nuclear-powered submarine. These options may be less capable individually but offer cost savings. The Navy is currently procuring one Virginia (SSN-774) class nuclear-powered attack submarine per year at a cost of $2.6 billion each. The Navy plans to maintain a fleet of 313 ships, including 48 SSNs. To support this, they may need to procure a total of 35 boats during the period FY2007-FY2022, averaging about 2.2 boats per year. The Navy's planned force of 48 boats may involve procuring 35 boats during FY2007-FY2022, averaging 2.2 boats per year. Continuing at one boat per year could reduce the SSN force to fewer than 30 by 2030, before recovering to 33 boats. Options for a lower-cost attack submarine include a non-nuclear-powered submarine with AIP system or a reduced-cost SSN using \"Tango Bravo\" technologies. The Navy is considering options for lower-cost attack submarines, including non-nuclear-powered submarines with air-independent propulsion (AIP) systems or a reduced-cost SSN using \"Tango Bravo\" technologies developed by DARPA. These submarines are less expensive due to their smaller size and different propulsion systems. The future Navy may include AIP-equipped non-nuclear-powered submarines as part of its fleet. The Navy is considering acquiring air-independent propulsion (AIP) submarines to complement the Virginia-class boats. AIP submarines offer extended submerged endurance and are being considered as a cost-effective option for the fleet. The possibility of procuring one Virginia-class boat along with one or more AIP submarines each year is being explored. The Office of Force Transformation (OFT) report suggested substituting four AIP submarines for one Virginia-class submarine in carrier strike groups to potentially save costs. The Office of Force Transformation report recommended substituting four AIP submarines for one Virginia-class submarine in carrier strike groups to potentially save costs. This suggests an average unit procurement cost for an AIP submarine of roughly $600 million to $750 million each. The Office of Force Transformation report suggested substituting AIP submarines for Virginia-class submarines to potentially save costs. New technologies may allow for the design of a new, less expensive SSN equivalent to the Virginia class. The Navy and DARPA are pursuing the development of these technologies. The Navy and DARPA are pursuing the development of new technologies under a program called Tango Bravo to design a reduced-size submarine with equivalent capability as the Virginia Class, aiming to reduce costs and increase payload volume. The collaborative effort between DARPA and the Navy, known as Tango Bravo, aims to overcome technology barriers impacting submarine platform infrastructure cost. This includes demonstrations in shaftless propulsion, external weapons, conformal alternatives to spherical arrays, simplifying existing systems, and automation to reduce crew workload. The Navy and industry officials believed in 2004 that developing new technologies could lead to designing a submarine equivalent to the Virginia class but with a lower procurement cost. This new submarine, referred to as \"Tango Bravo\" SSN, could be procured at a rate of two per year, providing an alternative to AIP submarines. The Navy and industry officials discussed the option of designing a new \"Tango Bravo\" SSN submarine with capabilities similar to the Virginia class but at a lower procurement cost. Design work on the Tango Bravo submarine could begin now, with procurement starting once it is ready, replacing Virginia-class procurement. The first Tango Bravo submarine could be ready for procurement in a few years if pursued diligently. Design work on a Tango Bravo submarine could begin now, potentially leading to procurement in a few years. The Navy is considering lower-cost carrier options, including medium-sized conventionally powered carriers and small carriers based on different hull designs. Currently, large nuclear-powered aircraft carriers are being built by the Navy. The Navy is constructing large nuclear-powered aircraft carriers with a catamaran hull design. The George H. W. Bush (CVN-77) was procured in FY2001 at a cost of $4.975 billion, now estimated at $6.1 billion, and is set to enter service in 2008. The next carrier, CVN-78, part of the CVN-21 class, is planned for procurement in FY2008. The FYDP proposes to procure the next aircraft carrier, CVN-78, in FY2008 as the lead ship of the CVN-21 class, with an estimated cost of $10.5 billion. Advance procurement funding has been provided since FY2001, and if procured in FY2008, it would enter service in 2015. The following carrier, CVN-79, is planned for procurement in FY2012, entering service around 2019, followed by CVN-80. The next carrier, CVN-79, is planned for procurement in FY2012 and would enter service around 2019. Options for a lower-cost aircraft carrier include a medium-sized, conventionally powered carrier based on the design for a new amphibious assault ship or a commercial-like hull design. Another option is a small, high-speed, conventionally powered aircraft carrier. The CSBA report recommended procuring CVN-21-class aircraft carriers to maintain a force of 10 large carriers and acquiring four medium-sized, conventionally powered aircraft carriers based on the LHA(R) design. These carriers might displace about 40,000 tons and embark an air wing of VSTOL versions of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The OFT report recommended procuring a medium-sized carrier with a full load displacement of about 57,000 tons. It would embark a notional air wing of 36 manned aircraft and 15 unmanned air vehicles, including Joint Strike Fighters, Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft, and UAVs. The unit procurement cost is estimated to be roughly $3 billion. The OFT report recommended a medium-sized carrier with a 57,000-ton displacement, carrying 36 manned aircraft, 15 unmanned air vehicles, including Joint Strike Fighters and Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft. It suggested substituting two of these carriers for each of the Navy's current large carriers. Alternatively, a small, high-speed carrier displacing 13,500 tons was also proposed. The OFT report recommended a small, high-speed carrier displacing 13,500 tons with a surface effect ship (SES)/catamaran hull. It would carry 10 manned aircraft, 8 UAVs, and have a maximum speed of 50 to 60 knots, slightly larger than Thailand's 11,500-ton aircraft carrier. The OFT report recommended a 13,500-ton carrier with a surface effect ship hull, carrying 10 manned aircraft, 8 UAVs, and having a maximum speed of 50 to 60 knots. It would be faster than existing carriers and could replace the Navy's current large carriers. The OFT report recommended substituting eight 13,500-ton carriers for the Navy's current large carriers to maintain the same number of manned aircraft at sea. Other potential designs discussed include a large conventionally powered carrier similar to the Kitty Hawk and John F. Kennedy. The Navy is considering a medium-sized nuclear-powered carrier based on the LHA(R) hull design, which would cost more than $3 billion. This carrier would displace about 40,000 tons and embark two dozen VSTOL JSFs. A nuclear-powered carrier based on the LHA(R) hull design would cost over $3 billion, displacing 40,000 tons and carrying two dozen VSTOL JSFs. It is comparable to France's Charles de Gaulle, which displaces 42,000 tons and carries 34 CTOL airplanes and two helicopters. Additionally, a conceptual design for a small, high-speed VSTOL carrier with a displacement of 4,000 tons and a maximum speed of 60 knots was developed by the Naval War College in 2000, capable of carrying seven VSTOL JSFs and two helicopters. A conceptual design for a very small, high-speed VSTOL carrier with a displacement of about 4,000 tons, a maximum speed of 60 knots, and an embarked air wing of about seven VSTOL JSFs and two helicopters. Ship size, propulsion type, and hull type create a matrix of notional aircraft carrier options, including large nuclear-powered carriers and potential alternatives. Medium-sized carriers of 40,000 to 70,000 tons might operate either VSTOL or CTOL aircraft, with larger ships more easily handling CTOL aircraft. Small carriers would likely be limited to VSTOL aircraft. The Navy procured nine nuclear-powered cruisers between FY1957 and FY1975 with displacements ranging from 9,000 to 17,500 tons. Small carriers may be limited to VSTOL aircraft, while larger carriers can operate CTOL aircraft more efficiently. The table does not provide examples of ships combining nuclear propulsion with a commercial-like hull. The Navy procured nuclear-powered cruisers between FY1957 and FY1975, with displacements ranging from 9,000 to 17,500 tons. The current design includes a 14,500-ton DDG-1000 destroyer/CG(X) cruiser, with potential lower-cost options such as an 11,000-ton cruiser-destroyer (SCD) and a 6,000-ton frigate (FFG(X)). The Navy plans to procure a low-cost gunfire support ship. The Navy plans to procure DDG-1000 destroyers and CG(X) cruisers, with the CG(X) based on the DDG-1000 design but larger and more expensive. The DDG-1000 has a full-load displacement of about 14,500 tons, making it 50% larger than current Aegis cruisers and destroyers. The DDG-1000 destroyer has a full-load displacement of 14,500 tons, making it 50% larger than current Navy Aegis cruisers and destroyers. The first two DDG-1000s are estimated to cost $3.3 billion each, with the following ships averaging $2.5 billion each. The procurement costs may be higher than initially estimated. The Cost Analysis Improvement Group (CAIG) in the Office of the Secretary of Defense believes DDG-1000 procurement costs may be higher than Navy estimates. The Navy plans to procure a total of 7 DDG-1000s as part of its proposed 313-ship fleet, which also includes 19 CG(X)s. The FY2006-FY2011 FYDP reduced planned DDG-1000 procurement to one per year for FY2007-FY2011, maintaining an average procurement rate of one DDG-1000 per year. Options for a reduced-cost surface combatant are being considered. The Navy plans to procure a total of 7 DDG-1000s as part of its proposed 313-ship fleet. Options for a reduced-cost surface combatant include an 11,000-ton cruiser-destroyer, a 6,000-ton frigate, and a lower-cost gunfire support ship based on the LPD-17 amphibious ship hull design. Another option is a new-design ship of about 11,000 tons, which would be 25% smaller than the current DDG-1000 design and larger than today's Arleigh Burke class Aegis destroyers. A smaller cruiser-destroyer (SCD) is proposed as a replacement for the CG(X) program or both the DDG-1000 and CG(X) programs. It would incorporate advanced technologies, cost less to procure, have a reduced crew size for lower operation costs, and carry a payload of sensors and weapons. A smaller cruiser-destroyer (SCD) is proposed as a replacement for the CG(X) program or both the DDG-1000 and CG(X) programs. It would have reduced crew size for lower operation costs and carry a payload of sensors, weapon launchers, weapons, computers, displays, aircraft, and fuel. The SCD could be land-attack oriented with two Advanced Gun Systems (AGSs) or air- and missile-defense oriented with CG(X) radar capabilities. A smaller, less expensive ship called the FFG(X) is proposed as a replacement for the DDG-1000/CG(X) and LCS programs. It might displace about 6,000 tons with a unit procurement cost of $800 million. The FFG(X) may not be equipped with the AGS, limiting its naval gunfire capabilities. A 6,000-ton FFG(X) with a unit procurement cost of about $800 million could serve as a replacement for the Navy's FFG-7 class frigates and DD-963 class destroyers. It may not have the AGS for naval gunfire capability but could perform non-gunfire missions similar to the DDG-1000 and LCS. A 6,000-ton FFG(X) could potentially replace the Navy's FFG-7 class frigates and DD-963 class destroyers. Another option suggested is a lower-cost gunfire support ship based on the San Antonio amphibious ship, with one or two AGSs on the basic LPD-17 hull design. LPD-17s under construction for Marine operations may displace 25,000 tons. An initial AGS-armed LPD-17 could cost $1.9 billion, subsequent ships $1.5 billion each. Navy plans to procure 55 Littoral Combat Ships as part of proposed 313-ship fleet. The Navy plans to procure 55 Littoral Combat Ships (LCSs) as part of its proposed 313-ship fleet. The LCSs would be small, fast surface combatants using modular weapon systems. The Navy aims for a procurement cost of no more than $220 million per LCS sea frame. The Navy's plan to procure 55 Littoral Combat Ships (LCSs) with a target cost of $220 million per ship may result in an average ship procurement cost of $387 million when mission modules are included. An alternative proposed in the OFT report suggests procuring a 1,000-ton surface combatant with similar capabilities to the LCS. The OFT report recommends procuring a 100-ton surface combatant with a maximum speed of 60 knots and standard interfaces for mission packages. These ships would be transported by a \"mother ship\" based on a 57,000-ton hull used for a proposed medium-sized aircraft carrier. The OFT report recommends procuring 100-ton surface combatants supported by a mother ship on a 57,000-ton hull. Lower-cost ship designs are being considered for cost, capability, technical risk, and impact on the shipbuilding industry. The cost implications of alternative ship designs need to consider development, design, procurement, operation, support, and disposal costs. Developing a new lower-cost design could save money in the long run compared to continuing with the current design, but initial costs must be carefully evaluated. Developing a new lower-cost ship design could save money in the long run compared to continuing with the current design, but only if the lower-cost design is procured in large enough numbers to outweigh the additional upfront costs. Stopping an existing ship acquisition program early could allow a lower-cost alternative design to reach the break-even point sooner, especially if it can utilize existing technologies. Developing a new lower-cost ship design could save money in the long run if it can utilize existing technologies and be procured in large numbers to reach the break-even point sooner. The cost of developing a new design could be reduced by using technologies from other ships, leading to decreased labor hours required as shipyard workers become more familiar with the design. Developing a new lower-cost ship design could save money in the long run if it can be procured in large numbers to reach the break-even point sooner. The difference in cost between the currently planned design and a lower-cost alternative may be reduced if some ships have already been built to the planned design. If the lower-cost design can be procured at a greater annual rate, it could benefit from greater spreading of the shipyard's fixed costs. Developing a new lower-cost ship design could save money in the long run if procured in large numbers to reach the break-even point sooner. Navy ships can remain in service for many years, with different life spans depending on the type of ship. Ship procurement costs are visible in the budget, but ship O&S costs are also significant over a ship's life cycle. Reducing a ship's life-cycle O&S cost can involve design features that increase procurement cost. Crew size reduction can be achieved by automating functions, like damage control, traditionally performed by people. Personnel costs are a significant component of ship O&S costs. Automating functions like damage control can reduce crew size and lower O&S costs, but may increase procurement costs if technology expenses outweigh crew-related space savings. Maintenance costs can also be reduced by using more durable materials or increasing space for easier access during maintenance. In considering ship design alternatives, it is important to weigh the impact on procurement costs and life-cycle O&S costs. The life-cycle O&S cost of a conventionally powered ship includes fuel costs, unlike nuclear-powered ships. This means that a lower procurement cost for an alternative design may not necessarily result in overall cost savings for the Navy in the long run. The procurement cost of nuclear-powered ships includes the cost of the nuclear fuel core, which can power the ship for its entire expected life. In 2004, the fuel core for a nuclear-powered attack submarine cost about $158 million and for a carrier about $300 million. This cost is not included in the life-cycle O&S cost of conventionally powered ships, which includes fuel costs over the ship's life. The nuclear fuel core for a carrier in 2004 cost about $300 million and is designed to power the ship for half of its 50-year expected life. This means that a nuclear-powered submarine or carrier will have no fuel-related O&S costs over its lifetime, unlike a conventionally powered ship. The difference in accounting for fuel costs results in a smaller cost difference between a nuclear-powered submarine and a conventionally powered one when procurement and life-cycle O&S costs are considered. When comparing procurement and life-cycle O&S costs, the difference in cost between a nuclear-powered submarine and a conventionally powered one is smaller due to the absence of fuel-related O&S costs for the nuclear-powered vessel. This cost-effectiveness is further influenced by the price of oil, with higher oil costs making nuclear-powered carriers more favorable in the long run. The higher oil costs expected in the future could make nuclear power more cost-effective for powering ships compared to conventional power. Nuclear-powered ships may have lower total ownership costs than conventionally powered ships if oil costs are high enough. However, nuclear-powered ships have higher end-of-life disposal costs due to the need to defuel and seal up the reactor. Nuclear-powered ships have higher end-of-life disposal costs compared to conventionally powered ships. The cost for a nuclear-powered submarine could be around $30-35 million, while for a nuclear-powered carrier, it might cost roughly $570 million. Lower-cost ship designs are generally less capable than higher-cost counterparts, with the exception of the reduced-cost Tango Bravo SSN. The reduced-cost Tango Bravo SSN may be as capable as the Virginia-class design due to advanced technologies. Ship capability factors include payload, detectability, survivability, mobility, and numbers in naval operations. As Navy combat ship size decreases, total payload tends to decrease as well. As Navy combat ship size decreases, the total payload also tends to decrease. This is due to factors such as ship design and propulsion. Smaller ships are not only less capable than larger ones but also proportionately less capable. As ship size decreases, the total weight of the aircraft that can be carried also decreases. For example, a 40,000-ton carrier may only be able to carry an air wing equivalent to less than 40% of the aircraft on a 100,000-ton carrier. Reducing ship size can increase the efficiency of aircraft carriers by allowing larger carriers to generate more sorties per day with a transferred air wing. This can result in a 40% increase in strike sorties compared to medium-sized carriers. Reducing ship size can impact the ability to equip desired systems, such as CTOL aircraft for carriers or large radars for surface combatants. As ship size decreases, the cost of putting combat-related equipment to sea can increase if total fleet payload is held constant. Reducing ship size can increase the cost of putting combat-related equipment to sea if total fleet payload is held constant. The OFT report argues that using new technologies could allow for greater payload fraction on smaller surface combatants. Using new technologies could increase payload fraction on smaller surface combatants by reducing the weight and volume of sensors and weapons. Improvements in technology can reduce the weight and volume of sensors and weapons on ships without compromising their capability. Supporters of larger ships argue that careful design can make them just as stealthy as smaller ships, and that they are better equipped to withstand hits from enemy weapons. Supporters of larger ships argue that larger ships and those built to military survivability standards are better equipped to withstand hits from enemy weapons compared to smaller ships or those with commercial-like hulls. They believe larger ships can continue operations after being hit, while smaller ships are more likely to be sunk. Opponents argue that making larger ships less detectable increases costs. Supporters of smaller ships argue that a fleet composed of a large number of small ships could overwhelm the enemy's target-tracking capabilities by presenting a large number of targets. They believe that even large ships built to military survivability standards can be sunk or put out of operation, concentrating too much capability in each individual platform. They suggest that individual-ship survivability is not as important as overall fleet survivability. Supporters of smaller ships argue that overall fleet survivability is more important than individual-ship survivability. They suggest that a fleet consisting of smaller ships can have superior survivability and that using expensive, highly capable Navy ships in high-threat situations may reduce their effectiveness. Additionally, submarines equipped with nuclear propulsion plants do not require access to the atmosphere to generate power. \"Equipping a submarine with a nuclear propulsion plant fundamentally changes ship mobility, allowing for operations primarily below the surface. Nuclear power distinguishes true submarines from submersibles that operate below the surface for limited periods.\" \"AIP systems like fuel-cells or closed-cycle diesel engines extend the submerged endurance of non-nuclear submarines, allowing for up to two or three weeks of stationary or low-speed operation below the surface. However, AIP does not significantly increase the high-speed submerged endurance of non-nuclear submarines.\" Non-nuclear-powered submarines, whether equipped with conventional diesel-electric propulsion or an AIP system, have a high-speed submerged endurance of 1 to 3 hours limited by battery capacity. In contrast, nuclear-powered submarines can stay submerged for weeks or months, limited by food supply. Non-nuclear-powered submarines have limited high-speed submerged endurance due to battery capacity, lasting only 1 to 3 hours. In contrast, nuclear-powered submarines can stay submerged for weeks or months, limited by food supply. The OFT report suggests transporting AIP submarines on a transport ship for extended operations in overseas theaters. This may reveal the presence of U.S. AIP submarines. SSNs in carrier strike groups can be detached for different missions in other theaters. The presence of an SSN in a carrier strike group allows for it to be detached and redirected to another theater for a different mission without alerting opposing forces, potentially achieving military effects in multiple theaters simultaneously. The effectiveness of an AIP submarine in a carrier strike group depends on its daily operations and potential conflict scenarios. Nuclear-powered carriers can quickly respond to crises without refueling, allowing for high-speed transits over long distances. AIP submarines can respond to urgent crises without refueling, allowing for immediate combat operations. They can sustain combat operations for longer periods before needing to be resupplied. Proponents argue for higher-speed ships like the LCS or recommended carriers in the OFT report. Advocates of higher-speed ships like the LCS or recommended carriers in the OFT report argue that the increased speed enhances their capability by enabling rapid location shifts and making them harder to track. Skeptics question the benefits of speeds exceeding 30 knots. Supporters of a larger fleet with lower-cost ship designs argue that more ships allow for better coverage and response capabilities. Advocates of a larger fleet with lower-cost ship designs argue that having more ships would enable better day-to-day presence in multiple locations and improve response to simultaneous crises. They suggest that a fleet with a larger number of less-capable ships could offer more flexibility in deploying naval capability as needed, without incurring high daily operational costs. Advocates of a larger fleet argue that increasing the number of ships would enhance the force's capability under network-centric warfare theory. They suggest shifting towards a more distributed force design to leverage advanced technologies. Advocates of a larger fleet argue that increasing the number of ships would enhance the force's capability under network-centric warfare theory. They suggest a shift to a more distributed force design to leverage advanced technologies. Some may argue that deploying a smaller number of more expensive ships could limit the fleet's effectiveness in fulfilling required missions. Advocates of a larger fleet argue that increasing the number of ships would enhance the force's capability under network-centric warfare theory. They suggest a shift to a more distributed force design to leverage advanced technologies. Deploying a smaller number of more expensive ships could still provide adequate capability for responding to various situations. The Navy's lower-cost options for maintaining an adequate number of nodes for network-centric warfare include AIP-equipped non-nuclear-powered submarines, Tango Bravo nuclear-powered submarines, 13,500-ton high-speed carriers, and smaller surface combatants with new technologies to increase payload fractions. Smaller ships could offer a wider range of homeporting options. Homeporting nuclear-powered ships can be more complex than conventionally powered ships due to unique requirements, such as access to a nuclear-certified maintenance shop. Forward-homeporting Navy ships in foreign countries can be politically challenging. Lower-cost ship designs could impact the Navy shipbuilding industrial base by changing the total volume of work among shipyards, which is largely dependent on available funding for ship procurement. Political challenges may arise when forward-homeporting a nuclear-powered Navy ship in a foreign country with anti-nuclear sentiments. Shifting to lower-cost ship designs may impact the total volume of Navy shipbuilding work, depending on the available funding for ship procurement. Three scenarios are possible: no change in funding, no substantial change in work volume; using lower-cost designs to reduce total building costs; or a shift affecting funding and work volume. The shift to lower-cost ship designs may impact the total volume of Navy shipbuilding work. Three scenarios are possible: no change in funding, using lower-cost designs to reduce total building costs, or a shift affecting funding and work volume. The lower-cost ship designs in the report could impact the distribution of Navy shipbuilding work, particularly for attack submarines like the Tango Bravo nuclear-powered submarine. General Dynamics' Electric Boat and Northrop Grumman Newport News could be involved in building the submarine, potentially changing the current division of work between the two shipyards. The division of work between General Dynamics' Electric Boat and Northrop Grumman Newport News for building submarines could change if AIP-equipped non-nuclear powered submarines are designed and built. This could potentially reduce work for U.S. naval nuclear propulsion component manufacturers. If AIP submarines are chosen over nuclear-powered submarines, it may impact U.S. naval nuclear propulsion component manufacturers who rely on work from Navy's nuclear submarine and aircraft carrier programs. NGNN is the only U.S. yard capable of building large nuclear-powered carriers, while a medium-sized conventionally powered carrier could be built by NGNN or another yard like Ingalls. A medium-sized, conventionally powered carrier based on a merchant-like hull could be built by NGNN, Ingalls, or other shipyards with experience in building merchant-like hulls. A small, high-speed carrier using an SES/catamaran hull design might be constructed at yards with experience in building SES/catamaran hulls. If conventionally powered carriers were chosen instead of nuclear-powered carriers, it could reduce the need for nuclear propulsion component manufacturers. If conventionally powered carriers were procured instead of nuclear-powered carriers, it could reduce the workload for U.S. naval nuclear propulsion component manufacturers. A carrier nuclear propulsion plant is equivalent to five submarine nuclear propulsion plants in terms of work provided. DDG-1000 destroyers are to be built at NGSS (Ingalls) and General Dynamics' Bath Iron Works. The DDG-1000 destroyers are to be built at NGSS (Ingalls) and General Dynamics' Bath Iron Works. Smaller surface combatants like the LCS will be built at Marinette Marine, Bollinger Shipyards, and Austal USA shipyard. Other ships like a 11,000-ton SCD or a 6,000-ton FFG(X) could also be built at various yards. The LCS will be built at Marinette Marine, Bollinger Shipyards, and Austal USA shipyard. A 1,000- or 100-ton surface combatant could be built at these yards or other yards focusing on smaller ships. H.R. 5122 limits procurement costs for aircraft carriers, LHA(R) class ships, and LPD-17 class ships. Section 1014 establishes a shipbuilding industrial base improvement program. The House Armed Services Committee expressed concerns about rising costs and production delays in defense acquisition programs, leading to fewer platforms being fielded. They warned against an over-reliance on expensive \"mega\" systems, advocating for less sophisticated but capable systems. The House Armed Services Committee warned against over-reliance on expensive \"mega\" systems in defense acquisition programs, advocating for less sophisticated but capable systems to avoid cost increases and production delays. This could lead to a \"high demand, low density\" situation with fewer platforms purchased, impacting operational tempos and military readiness. The House Armed Services Committee cautioned against relying too heavily on costly \"mega\" systems in defense acquisitions, advocating for more affordable yet capable systems to prevent cost overruns and delays. They expressed concerns about the affordability and feasibility of the Navy's shipbuilding plan, citing unrealistic assumptions that may hinder its execution. The House Armed Services Committee raised concerns about the affordability of the Navy's shipbuilding plan, which was developed with unrealistic assumptions. The plan requires a significant increase in shipbuilding funds and assumes that ship acquisition programs can avoid cost growth. Obtaining additional funds during anticipated federal spending reductions will be challenging. The House Armed Services Committee raised concerns about the affordability of the Navy's shipbuilding plan due to unrealistic assumptions and cost growth issues. The committee is worried about the excess capacity in the shipbuilding/ship repair industrial base and directs the Secretary of the Navy to report on managing this capacity. The House Armed Services Committee is concerned about the affordability of the Navy's shipbuilding plan and directs the Secretary of the Navy to report on managing the capacity of the shipbuilding/ship repair industrial base to make Navy shipbuilding more affordable. The committee is also worried about the process used for establishing the Navy's ship cost estimates. The House Armed Services Committee is concerned about the affordability of the Navy's shipbuilding plan and directs the Secretary of the Navy to report on managing the capacity of the shipbuilding/ship repair industrial base. The committee notes inaccuracies in the Navy's ship cost estimates and recommends revising the process to include all major known shipbuilding costs. The House Armed Services Committee recommends revising the process for deriving ship cost estimates to ensure all major known elements are included. Sections 122, 123, and 124 of the bill impose cost limitations on three current ship classes based on the Navy's latest cost estimates. The committee directs the Secretary of the Navy to revalidate the cost estimates for CVN-21. The committee directs the Secretary of the Navy to revalidate cost estimates for CVN-21, ships in the LHA Replacement program, and the San Antonio class amphibious ships. The revalidated costs must be approved by the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics by July 1, 2006. The Secretary of the Navy is directed to submit revalidated cost estimates for ship classes by July 1, 2006, including a certification that all major cost elements are included. The report also mentions concerns about the affordability of the DDG-1000 program, with the Navy reducing the number of next-generation destroyers from 32 to 7 to make the program more affordable. The Navy proposed building 32 next generation destroyers, reduced to 24, then finally to 7 to make the program affordable. The committee struggles to see how the original requirements for the destroyer can be met in such small numbers. They support the construction of up to two DD(X)s to demonstrate technologies for incorporation into future ships. The committee supports the construction of up to two DD(X)s to demonstrate technologies for future ships and procurement will meet operational needs. The report addresses the lack of funds for the maritime technology program aimed at reducing naval ship construction costs. The MARITECH program aims to reduce naval ship construction costs by improving efficiency and competitiveness in the shipbuilding industry. In recent years, the Navy and industry have implemented contract incentives to lower construction costs through process improvements. The committee supports expanding incentive clauses to all ship procurements, including the Lewis and Clark (T-AKE) class program. A provision creates a shipbuilding industrial base improvement program for grants and loan guarantees to qualified shipyards. This will help improve productivity and cost effectiveness in shipbuilding. The Navy will work closely with shipbuilders to lower ship procurement costs by identifying process changes, equipment investments, and facility improvements. This will lead to savings in constructing T-AKE class ships and enhance the competitiveness of U.S. shipyards. The committee recommends funding for the shipbuilding industrial base improvement program and U.S. shipbuilding and ship repair industrial base enhancement, allocating $120.0 million in PE 78730N for the maritime sector. The committee recommends $120.0 million in PE 78730N for the maritime technology program, including funding for the national shipbuilding research program (NSRP). NSRP operates on a 50-50 cost share between government and industry to improve the efficiency of the U.S. shipbuilding industry. The committee recommends $20.0 million in PE 78730N for the national shipbuilding research program to improve the efficiency of the United States shipbuilding industry. The committee also emphasizes the importance of sustaining viable and efficient shipbuilding and ship repair industries in the country. The committee recommends providing grants to U.S. shipyards for innovative design and production technologies, modernized infrastructure, and loan guarantees to improve the shipbuilding industry, totaling $50.0 million in PE 78730N. The committee recommends $50.0 million in PE 78730N for shipbuilding industrial base improvement loan guarantees to enhance efficiency and competitiveness of U.S. shipyards. Section 121 of S. 2766 would authorize 4-year incremental funding. The committee recommends $50.0 million in PE 78730N for shipbuilding industrial base improvement loan guarantees. Section 121 of S. 2766 authorizes incremental funding for CVN-21 class aircraft carriers. Section 123 increases the cost limit on CVN-77 to $6,057 million. The Senate Armed Services Committee noted that low shipbuilding rates were driving up costs. The committee received testimony from the Navy and industry stating that low shipbuilding rates were leading to higher costs, creating a downward spiral. Stable ship requirements, increased funding in the shipbuilding budget, and flexibility for funding large capital ships are crucial to reversing this trend. The committee also expressed concern about cost growth on the CVN-77 program and urged improvements for future aircraft carriers. The committee expressed concern about cost growth on the CVN-77 program and urged the Navy and shipbuilder to improve affordability for future aircraft carriers. The shipbuilder proposed savings for the CVN-21 class program through a stable procurement plan and economic order quantity material procurement for CVN-79 and CVN-80. The committee recommends a $50.0 million increase in SCN for CVN-21 class advance procurement. The committee recommends a $50.0 million increase in SCN for CVN-21 class advance procurement, directing the Secretary of the Navy to review economic order quantity and long lead time material procurement for the CVN-21 class. A report outlining advance procurement requirements for potential savings and escalation avoidance is to be submitted with the fiscal year 2008 budget request. None of the funds for advance procurement for CVN-79 and CVN-80 are available for obligation prior to 30 days. The report states that the procurement cost for CVN-77 has increased to $6.057 billion due to various factors, with additional funding needed in future budget requests. The fiscal year 2007 budget request included $348.4 million for CVN-77 cost growth, with additional funding needed in future budget requests. Despite management actions taken by the Navy to contain costs, projections show CVN-77 costs exceeding the contract ceiling by over 30 percent. The Navy is concerned about the cost growth of CVN-77, projected to exceed the contract ceiling by over 30 percent despite management actions. Visibility into cost performance is necessary to assess effectiveness and improve affordability of future naval vessel construction. The Secretary of the Navy is directed to provide quarterly reports to congressional defense committees starting December 1, 2006, regarding the CVN-77 ship construction contract, including contract target cost, Program Manager's Estimate at Completion, contractor's Estimate at Completion, contract ceiling price, and end of period actual costs. The report highlights cost risks in the construction of lead LCS vessels at two shipyards until completion in 2007 and 2008. Emphasis on cost control suggests the Navy should pursue competition, commonality, and learning curve results in procuring this 55-ship class for the global war strategy. The committee supports the Navy's strategy for the global war on terror by rapidly fielding the LCS program. However, concerns arise over cost growth and affordability issues, as well as the rapid ramp-up in LCS procurement. The LCS program is facing cost growth issues and a lack of clear acquisition strategy, hindering affordability goals. Concerns include added costs for training, maintenance, and procurement of LCS vessels. The committee directs the Secretary of the Navy to submit a report on these issues. The committee directs the Secretary of the Navy to submit a report on the LCS program's total costs, acquisition strategy, competition plan, flight strategy, and cost containment strategy by December 1, 2006. The report should also include R&D and procurement costs, as well as assess life cycle costs for two different LCS designs. Additionally, shipyard costs and efficiency will be addressed in the report. The report on LCS program costs includes assessing life cycle costs for two different designs and shipyard efficiency. The National Shipbuilding Research Program-Advanced Shipbuilding Enterprise has reduced shipbuilding costs through collaboration with the Navy and industry. The National Shipbuilding Research Program-Advanced Shipbuilding Enterprise (NSRP-ASE) has achieved savings and cost avoidance for the Navy, with a positive return on investment. The committee recommends increasing funding by $10.0 million to support NSRP-ASE efforts in developing a skilled shipbuilding workforce and establishing a national supply chain concept. The National Shipbuilding Research Program-Advanced Shipbuilding Enterprise (NSRP-ASE) has achieved savings for the Navy. The committee recommends increasing funding to support the development of a skilled shipbuilding workforce, establishing a national supply chain concept, exploring secondary markets for shipbuilders, and deploying industry-wide computer interoperability. Funding for the CVN-21 class aircraft carriers is authorized in Section 121 of H.R. 5122. Section 121 of H.R. 5122 authorizes incremental funding for CVN-21 class aircraft carriers CVN-78, CVN-79, and CVN-80, while Section 122 establishes unit procurement cost caps for these carriers. Additionally, Section 123 increases a procurement cost cap for the CVN-77 aircraft carrier, Section 125 sets a cost cap for LHA(R) amphibious assault ships, and Section 126 does the same for LPD-17 class amphibious ships. Section 215 allocates $4 million for Navy shipbuilding technology proposals, and Section 1016 provides further directives. Section 215 authorizes $4 million for Navy shipbuilding technology proposals. Section 1016 directs the Navy to assess naval vessel construction efficiencies and contractor incentives. New procurement cost caps can be adjusted for inflation. Section 122 does not allow the Secretary to adjust limitation amounts for cost increases due to congressional actions impacting the shipbuilding program. The conferees direct the Secretary to include an assessment of any negative impact of congressional action on program costs in the annual written notice to the congressional defense committees regarding changes to cost limitations for the CVN-21 class budget. The conferees acknowledge uncertainties in completing the design and construction of nuclear powered aircraft carriers, allowing adjustments to cost limitations for design and engineering to mitigate risks. They expect the Navy to manage program execution within budget estimates. The conferees expect the Navy to manage program execution within budget estimates, requiring procurement cost trade-offs that may impact design and construction of the CVN-21 class. Trade-offs will be overseen by program and requirements offices, with notification to Congress before implementation. The Secretary must notify Congress 30 days before any cost-driven reduction that could impact safety, crew quality of life, or hinder meeting CVN-21 requirements. The report clarifies that the amendment does not give the Secretary authority to adjust limitation amounts for cost increases due to congressional actions. The report clarifies that the amendment does not give the Secretary authority to adjust limitation amounts for cost increases due to congressional actions, but directs an assessment of any negative impact on program costs in the annual notice to Congress. The conferees understand the Navy's assessment of costs for the LHA Replacement ship, acknowledging uncertainties in design and construction. An amendment allows adjustments for non-recurring design and engineering costs to reduce risk. The Navy is expected to manage program execution within the cost limitation. The conferees expect the Navy to manage program execution within budget limits, requiring procurement cost trade-offs that may impact design and construction of the LHA Replacement ship. The conferees expect the Navy to manage program execution within budget limits, requiring procurement cost trade-offs that may impact design and construction of the LHA Replacement ship. The Secretary must notify Congress before implementing any cost-driven reduction that could affect safety, crew quality of life, or hinder meeting program requirements. The House Appropriations Committee emphasized the importance of cost control in the Navy's long-range shipbuilding plan, noting a lack of initiatives to meet cost targets. The trend of cost growth in ongoing shipbuilding programs is concerning, with no clear plan in place to address it. The House Appropriations Committee emphasized the need for cost control in the Navy's shipbuilding plan, citing a concerning trend of cost growth in ongoing programs. The Committee recommended setting firm cost targets, implementing cost control initiatives, and signing contracts to reduce cost growth. The report also suggested reducing funding by $141.4 million for FY2007 procurement to cover cost growth on prior year's ships. The House Appropriations Committee highlighted concerns about the lack of cost control in Navy shipbuilding programs, noting rising cost growth in ongoing contracts. The Navy was required to submit a plan to address these issues, which was submitted late and only summarized cost overruns from the past two decades. The Committee is worried about the gap between the Navy's public statements on cost controls and the actual actions taken in shipbuilding programs. The Navy is facing cost overruns in shipbuilding programs, with the CVN-77 aircraft carrier and Virginia class attack submarines exceeding cost caps. Congressional legislation is needed to raise the cap for the CVN-77 program, which is estimated to have an overrun of $867.9 million over the next 3 years. The budget request for the U.S.S. Texas (SSN-775) includes $136 million for cost growth, while the U.S.S. North Carolina (SSN-777) is performing below Navy expectations. The 2007 budget requests $136 million for cost growth on the U.S.S. Texas (SSN-775), while cost performance on the U.S.S. North Carolina (SSN-777) is below Navy expectations. The Virginia class submarines' cost performance jeopardizes Navy's ability to meet contract goals and increase production rates. The Committee is unwilling to provide additional funds for cost overruns without a detailed cost control plan. The recommendation provides $436 million for shipbuilding programs, a reduction of $141 million. The Committee recommendation provides $436 million for shipbuilding programs, with reductions allocated to various programs. One option to address rising Navy ship procurement costs is to increase annual ship-procurement funding. Increasing annual ship-procurement funding to address rising Navy ship costs may be challenging due to finite defense funding, potentially requiring cuts to other Navy or DOD priorities. The Navy aims to operate more efficiently to redirect savings towards procurement programs. The Navy has been working to operate more efficiently to redirect savings towards procurement programs, but rising costs in other areas have offset these savings. One option to increase ship procurement is to modify how new Navy ships are funded in the budget, potentially increasing the number of ships that could be procured for a given total amount of money. This option is explored in CRS Report RL32776. The Navy is exploring options to increase ship procurement efficiency, including modifying funding methods and utilizing multiyear procurement contracts. This could potentially increase the number of ships acquired within budget constraints, but may also raise concerns about Congressional oversight and legal requirements. The Navy is considering options to improve ship procurement efficiency, such as utilizing multiyear procurement contracts. This could potentially increase the number of ships acquired within budget constraints, but may limit flexibility in adjusting ship-procurement plans in response to changing circumstances. Changing acquisition strategies for building certain Navy ships, like having all DDG-1000s built by a single yard, could significantly reduce costs. Shifting to a single-yard acquisition strategy for building DDG-1000s could save $3 billion for 10 ships, but may limit competition and innovation in design. Making greater use of competition in Navy ship acquisition could save costs, maintain production quality, and ensure adherence to scheduled delivery dates. This strategy involves using competition between shipyards in awarding contracts for building follow-on ships in each class, representing a return to Navy practices in the 1980s. Employing competition in the awarding of contracts for building follow-on ships requires a high annual procurement rate for the ship class or a willingness for losing yards to withdraw from building that type of ship. This could potentially leave the Navy with a single source for that kind of ship in the future. The Navy's contract-award decision could result in a single source for building Navy ships in the future. To reduce shipyard fixed overhead costs, excess capacity among yards could be eliminated or other types of work could be increased to absorb more of the fixed costs. To reduce shipyard fixed overhead costs, excess capacity among yards could be eliminated or other types of work could be increased to absorb more of the fixed costs, such as construction of ships for other U.S. government agencies, commercial ships, and overhaul and repair of Navy or commercial ships. Another option is to improve operating efficiency by incorporating advanced design and production processes and equipment. The National Shipbuilding Research Program (NSRP) Advanced Shipbuilding Enterprise (ASE) aims to improve shipyard efficiency by incorporating advanced design and production processes. A DOD report suggests building Navy ships without some planned equipment to reduce costs. Building a ship without some planned equipment may reduce its capabilities, but the equipment can be added later at a higher cost. This strategy could defer some procurement costs into the future. Installing equipment on an in-service ship may be more expensive than building it into the ship during its original construction. This strategy could increase the total cost of the ship in the long run. Another option is to build Navy ships in foreign shipyards to take advantage of lower construction costs. The provision in 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 7309 prohibits the construction of vessels for the armed forces in foreign shipyards, with exceptions allowed for national security interests. The President can authorize exceptions with notification to Congress, and no contract can be made until after a 30-day period. Inflatable boats and rigid inflatable boats are exempt from this provision. The provision in the annual DOD appropriations act prohibits the use of funds for Navy shipbuilding in foreign shipyards, including the construction of major components of naval vessels. The RAND Corporation report discusses the increased cost of Navy ships today compared to decades ago and suggests ways to reduce these costs."
