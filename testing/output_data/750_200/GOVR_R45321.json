    "content": "The Trump Administration requested $76.2 billion for the Department of Transportation (DOT) for FY2019, proposing significant cuts in funding for various programs. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $87.8 billion for DOT in the FY2019 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies appropriations bill. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $87.8 billion for the Department of Transportation in the FY2019 THUD appropriations bill, a 1.8% increase over FY2018 and 15% above the Administration request. The Senate passed a bill providing $86.6 billion for DOT, slightly above FY2018 and 14% above the Administration request. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $87.8 billion for the Department of Transportation in the FY2019 THUD appropriations bill, a 1.8% increase over FY2018 and 15% above the Administration request. The Senate bill would likely result in a slight reduction in inflation-adjusted funding for DOT compared to its FY2018 level. DOT's funding arrangements are unusual compared to most federal agencies, with most of its funding coming from trust funds and taking the form of grants to states and local government authorities. Most of the Department of Transportation's funding comes from trust funds and is in the form of grants to states and local government authorities. Around two-thirds to three-fourths of DOT's funding is mandatory, while one-third to one-fourth is discretionary. The Highway Trust Fund and the Airport and Airway Trust Fund typically provide around 90% of DOT's annual funding. In FY2018, DOT's funding structure changed significantly with a large increase in discretionary funding. Approximately 80% of DOT's funding is distributed as grants to states, local authorities, and Amtrak. The funding from trust funds is not clearly reflected in DOT budget tables. Approximately 80% of DOT's funding is distributed to states, local authorities, and Amtrak in the form of grants. The Federal Aviation Administration, responsible for air traffic control, has a budget primarily not grants. Trust funds, funded by taxes, play a significant role in DOT funding through periodic reauthorizations. Highway, transit, and rail are key areas of focus. The trust funds, funded by taxes, play a significant role in DOT funding. The authorization for federal aviation programs is set to expire in September 2018, potentially impacting its structure and funding. DOT's nonemergency annual funding has increased from $70 billion in FY2012 to $86 billion in FY2018 in nominal terms, but inflation-adjusted funding peaked in FY2010 at $87.5 billion. In FY2018, DOT's funding increased to $86 billion, but adjusting for inflation shows a different trend. Real funding peaked in FY2010 at $87.5 billion and declined until FY2015 before rising again in FY2016. From FY2012-FY2017, inflation-adjusted funding was lower than in the FY2007-FY2011 period. Highway Trust Fund provides most federal highway and transit funding. Table 4 compares FY2019 appropriations to FY2018 for DOT. In FY2018, DOT's funding increased to $86 billion, but adjusting for inflation shows a different trend. Real funding peaked in FY2010 at $87.5 billion and declined until FY2015 before rising again in FY2016. Most federal highway and transit funding comes from the Highway Trust Fund, which has faced a shortfall due to expenditures exceeding revenues. Congress transferred about $143 billion to the fund from FY2008-FY2016 to keep it solvent. The federal gas tax has not been raised since 1993, leading to a shortfall in the Highway Trust Fund. The fund receives a fixed amount per gallon of fuel sold, regardless of the fuel cost. Inflation and increasing fuel efficiency have reduced the purchasing power of the gas tax revenue. The Congressional Budget Office forecasts that gasoline consumption will remain flat through 2024 due to increasing fuel efficiency offsetting the growth in miles driven. This will result in Highway Trust Fund revenues of $39 billion to $41 billion annually from FY2018 to FY2027, falling short of projected expenditures. Congress allocated $1.5 billion for national infrastructure investment grants. The Congressional Budget Office projects flat gasoline consumption through 2024, leading to annual Highway Trust Fund revenues of $39 to $41 billion from FY2018 to FY2027. Congress allocated $1.5 billion for national infrastructure investment grants, also known as BUILD Transportation grants. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $750 million, while the Senate-passed bill proposed $1 billion for the grants. The Committee on Appropriations prohibited the Department of Transportation (DOT) from using an applicant's willingness to create new sources of nonfederal revenue as a selection criterion for TIGER grants. The TIGER grant program, originally called \"national infrastructure investment,\" was established under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The TIGER grant program, established under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, aims to address criticisms of federal transportation funding by funding projects with national or regional impacts. The TIGER grant program aims to address criticisms of federal transportation funding by funding projects with national or regional impacts. One challenge is that most federal transportation funding is divided by mode, making it difficult for projects in different modes to compete for funds. An example is Amtrak's Gateway Program, focused on replacing a deteriorating tunnel under the Hudson River. The BUILD program provides grants for significant transportation projects, with a focus on the Gateway Program benefiting Amtrak passengers. The $13 billion project burden falls on New York and New Jersey. The BUILD/TIGER program, funded by DOT, aims to support transportation projects of national, regional, and metropolitan significance. However, funding has mainly favored regional and metropolitan projects due to congressional directives for equitable distribution across geographic areas and transportation modes. Congress continues to back the program with annual appropriations despite high demand and low minimum grant thresholds. The BUILD/TIGER program, funded by DOT, receives annual support from Congress despite being heavily oversubscribed. Critics have raised concerns about TIGER grants favoring urban areas, leading Congress to allocate a minimum of 30% of funding to rural projects in FY2018. In FY2018, Congress increased funding for rural projects to 30%. The House Appropriations Committee recommends 33% for rural areas in FY2019, while the Senate bill sticks to 30%. Another 33% is allocated for projects near seaports, and the remaining 33% for urban areas over 200,000 in population. The BUILD/TIGER grant process has shown two recent patterns. The BUILD/TIGER grant appropriation process for urban areas over 200,000 in population has followed a consistent pattern in recent years, with the Obama Administration requesting more funding than Congress, leading to negotiations and final enacted amounts similar to previous years. In FY2018, despite the Trump Administration's request for no funding, Congress funded the program. This trend is expected to continue in FY2019 appropriations. The Essential Air Service (EAS) program is funded through a combination of mandatory and discretionary budget authority, with a mandatory annual authorization estimated at $140 million for FY2019. This is financed by overflight fees collected from commercial airlines by FAA. The Trump Administration requested $93 million for the program. The Essential Air Service (EAS) program is funded through a combination of mandatory and discretionary budget authority. The Trump Administration requested $93 million for the program in FY2019, while the House committee bill recommended $175 million in discretionary funding, and the Senate-passed bill also recommends the same amount. This would result in a 10% increase over the FY2018 total funding level. The EAS program seeks to preserve commercial air service to small communities by subsidizing unprofitable routes. The program's cost has doubled since FY2008 due to route reductions and new communities being added. Congress made changes in 2012, including capping the per-passenger subsidy at $1,000 and limiting communities less than 210 miles from a hub airport. Supporters of the EAS program argue that it is essential to maintain airline service to small communities as promised during airline deregulation in 1978. Subsidizing air service to smaller communities is seen as a way to promote economic development in rural areas. Critics of the Essential Air Service (EAS) program argue that the subsidy cost per passenger is high, many airports in the program have few passengers, and some are close to major airports. In 2008, Congress mandated positive train control (PTC) installation on certain rail segments by 2015 to prevent incidents caused by operator or dispatcher error. The Positive Train Control (PTC) system was mandated by Congress in 2008 to prevent incidents caused by operator or dispatcher error on certain rail segments by the end of 2015. Despite billions spent by freight railroads, most tracks were not compliant by the deadline. Congress extended the deadline to 2018, with an option to extend to 2020 with approval. Funding has been provided to help with installation costs. The Positive Train Control (PTC) system was mandated by Congress in 2008 to prevent incidents caused by operator or dispatcher error on certain rail segments by the end of 2015. Despite billions spent by freight railroads, most tracks were not compliant by the deadline. Congress extended the deadline to 2018, with an option to extend to 2020 with approval. Funding has been provided to help with installation costs, including $50 million in FY2016, $199 million in FY2017 (for commuter railroads), and at least $250 million in FY2018. The Trump Administration's FY2019 budget request did not include any funding for PTC implementation. The House-reported bill specified that $150 million was for PTC projects, while the Senate-passed bill does not set aside a specific amount but directs DOT to prioritize PTC projects in making grants from the Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and Safety Improvements grant program. The Passenger Rail Reform and Investment Act of 2015 reauthorized Amtrak and changed its federal grant structure. It now receives separate grants for the Northeast Corridor and the rest of its national network. Three new programs were authorized to make grants for intercity passenger rail development. Three new programs were authorized to make grants for intercity passenger rail development: Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and Safety Improvement Grants, Federal-State Partnership for State of Good Repair Grants, and Restoration and Enhancement Grants. The Administration's FY2019 budget requested $738 million for intercity passenger rail funding, all for grants to Amtrak. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $1.9 billion for Amtrak, $800 million for two new grant programs, and $150 million for the Magnetic Levitation Technology Deployment Program. The Senate bill would provide $1.9 billion for Amtrak and a total of $565 million for three new grant programs, with a focus on prioritizing PTC projects. Congress historically provided little funding for intercity passenger rail development, but there was a brief change in FY2009. In FY2009 and FY2010, Congress allocated $10.5 billion for high-speed and intercity passenger rail grants. However, from FY2011 to FY2016, funding for intercity passenger rail development was minimal, except for PTC implementation. In FY2017, $98 million was allocated for new intercity passenger rail grant programs, increasing to $863 million in FY2018. In FY2017, Congress provided $98 million for new intercity passenger rail grant programs, increasing to $863 million in FY2018. The Federal Transit Administration distributes roughly $13 billion in funding to state and local transit agencies through various programs, with the Capital Investment Grants program being the largest discretionary grant program. The Capital Investment Grants program (CIG) is the largest discretionary grant program by the Federal Transit Administration, funding new fixed-guideway transit lines and extensions. It consists of three components: New Starts grants for projects over $300 million seeking over $100 million in federal funding, Small Starts grants for projects under $300 million seeking less than $100 million in federal funding, and Core Capacity grants for projects increasing existing system capacity by at least 10%. The Capital Investment Grants program (CIG) by the Federal Transit Administration funds new fixed-guideway transit lines and extensions through New Starts, Small Starts, and Core Capacity grants. The program also includes an Expedited Project Delivery Pilot for eligible projects seeking a 25% federal share and supported by public-private partnerships. Grant funds for large projects are disbursed over multiple years, with a requested budget of $1.0 billion for FY2019. The Trump Administration requested $1.0 billion for Capital Investment Grants in FY2019, $1.6 billion less than the previous year. Funding is only provided to projects with existing full funding grant agreements. Congress has expressed concern about the Administration's approach. The Trump Administration requested $1.0 billion for Capital Investment Grants in FY2019, slightly less than the FY2018 amount. Congress has expressed concern about the Administration's stance towards the CIG program, which includes not requesting funding for any new transit projects in either FY2018 or FY2019. The Trump Administration has not requested federal funding for new transit projects in FY2018 or FY2019. Congress has provided more than double the funding requested by the FTA for the CIG program in both years, directing the agency to continue advancing the program as outlined in statute. The Senate Appropriations Committee reports that FTA has not complied with congressional directives for improving the CIG program, citing unnecessary delays in project development. Transportation for America claims that FTA is causing delays in transit project development by only issuing a fraction of the funding provided by Congress. FTA has issued only $533 million in grants under the CIG program in the FY2017 and FY2018 DOT appropriations acts. Project sponsors are facing increased costs due to delays in the review process, leading to expired construction bids and the need to rebid projects. FTA denies delaying the review process, and New Starts grants can cover up to 80% of the project cost. The federal share for New Starts projects can be up to 80% of the net capital project cost, but there have been efforts to lower this limit. The FY2018 DOT appropriations act set the limit at 51%, and the House-reported FY2019 bill includes a provision for a federal share no greater than 50%. Critics argue that the federal share for highway projects is typically 80% or higher, making them relatively more favorable compared to New Starts projects. Advocates of New Starts projects argue that the higher federal share, typically 80%, makes highway projects more attractive than public transportation projects. They believe that requiring a higher local match allows the FTA to support more projects and encourages communities to carefully estimate costs and benefits, reducing the risk of cost overruns. A higher local match encourages communities to estimate transit project costs more carefully, reducing cost overruns and ensuring ridership meets expectations. Federal transportation funding is mainly distributed by mode, making it challenging for projects involving multiple modes to secure significant funding. Congress allocates around $55 billion annually for surface transportation programs. Amassing federal funding for projects involving multiple modes can be difficult due to the automatic division of funds among states. The Gateway Program, specifically the Hudson Tunnel replacement project, is facing challenges in accumulating the necessary funding for rail service improvements between northern New Jersey and Manhattan. The Gateway Program aims to enhance rail service between northern New Jersey and Manhattan by replacing bridges, expanding track capacity, and adding a new rail tunnel under the Hudson River. The estimated cost is at least $24 billion, with the new Hudson River Tunnel alone costing a significant portion. The estimated cost of the Gateway Program is at least $24 billion, with the new Hudson River Tunnel alone costing $11.1 billion. Funding for intercity rail projects has been limited, with the largest rail grant program in FY2017 funded at $68 million, increasing to $593 million in FY2018. The largest rail grant program in FY2017 received $68 million, which increased to $593 million in FY2018. The Capital Investment Grants program had $2.6 billion in funding in FY2018, with the largest grant awarded in the past 10 years being $2.6 billion. An agreement was reached in 2016 between DOT, Amtrak, and the States of New Jersey and New York to share the costs of building the new Hudson Tunnel. An agreement was reached in 2016 between DOT, Amtrak, and the States of New Jersey and New York to share the costs of building the new Hudson Tunnel. The Trump Administration does not feel bound by the agreement, and Congress would need to provide the funding. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees did not mention the Gateway Program or Hudson Tunnel project in their FY2019 reports, but recommended significant funding for rail and transit grant programs that Gateway projects could be eligible for. Additionally, they recommended $240 million more for Amtrak's Northeast Corridor account. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended significant funding for rail and transit grant programs that Gateway projects could be eligible for, as well as $240 million more for Amtrak's Northeast Corridor account than requested for FY2019. The Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 authorized $1.5 billion over 10 years in grants to WMATA for maintenance and capital grants, to be matched by funding from DC, Maryland, and Virginia. This is in addition to around $310 million WMATA receives under FTA formula programs. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended significant funding for rail and transit grant programs, including $150 million for WMATA in FY2019. This grant is part of a $1.5 billion funding commitment made by Congress in 2008. The House Appropriations Committee also recommended $150 million for WMATA. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $150 million for WMATA in FY2019 to address maintenance needs and safety concerns. The House and Senate Appropriation Committee reports direct WMATA to work on extending authorization for the grant and implementing wireless service throughout the rail system. Several fatal incidents, including one in January 2015, have raised questions about the safety culture of WMATA. An investigation revealed mismanagement of federal funding, leading to restrictions on WMATA's use of federal funds. FTA assumed oversight of WMATA's safety compliance practices in October 2015, taking over from the Tri-State Oversight Committee. FTA now conducts inspections, leads accident investigations, and directs safety compliance efforts for WMATA. FTA exercises safety oversight of WMATA, including inspections and accident investigations. In February 2017, FTA notified Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia that 5% of their transit funds would be withheld until a new safety oversight agency, the Metrorail Safety Commission, is operational. The Metrorail Safety Commission must be operational before FTA releases funding. FTA outlined steps for the Commission's oversight transition. NTSB recommends FRA oversee WMATA's rail operations instead of FTA. Congress would need to grant FRA authority for this oversight."
