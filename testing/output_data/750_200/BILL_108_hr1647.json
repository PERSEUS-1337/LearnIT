    "content": "The \"Crane Conservation Act of 2003\" may be cited as such. Key findings are outlined in the Act. The Crane Conservation Act of 2003 acknowledges the serious decline of crane populations globally, particularly in Africa, Asia, and Europe. Five species of Asian cranes are listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 and the Convention. The Crane Conservation Act of 2003 recognizes the decline of crane populations globally, especially in Africa, Asia, and Europe. The Act lists five endangered Asian crane species, including the Siberian crane, red-crowned crane, white-naped crane, black-necked crane, and hooded crane. The Crane Action Plan of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature identifies four threatened African crane species and one Asian crane species, which are the wattled crane and the blue crane. The The Crane Conservation Act of 2003 recognizes the decline of crane populations globally, especially in Africa, Asia, and Europe. It lists five endangered Asian crane species, including the Siberian crane, red-crowned crane, white-naped crane, black-necked crane, and hooded crane. The Act also identifies four threatened African crane species and one Asian crane species, which are the wattled crane, blue crane, grey-crowned crane crane, black-crowned crane, and sarus crane. Additionally, the whooping crane and Mississippi sandhill crane are listed as endangered species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. The whooping crane and Mississippi sandhill crane are listed as endangered species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, with populations vulnerable to extinction due to hunting and habitat loss. Conservation resources have not been sufficient to address the decline in crane populations, which play a crucial role in the conservation of wetland, grassland, and agricultural landscapes. Cranes are flagship species for wetland and grassland conservation, providing benefits to other plants and animals. Threats to cranes include egg collection, poisoning from insecticides, power line collisions, and disturbance from human activities. To effectively address threats to cranes in the wild, joint commitment and effort from countries in Africa, Asia, North America, and the private sector are required. Cranes serve as ambassadors promoting goodwill among countries due to their migration across continents. Conservation successes and methods developed in one region have wide applicability in other regions where government and private agencies cooperate to conserve threatened cranes. The purposes of this Act are to perpetuate healthy populations of cranes, support conservation programs in countries where endangered cranes occur, assist private organizations dedicated to crane conservation, and provide financial resources for these efforts. The term \"conservation\" in this Act refers to methods to ensure the population of crane species in the wild is sufficient to prevent extinction, including habitat protection and management. Scientific resource management for crane conservation includes habitat protection, restoration, research, monitoring, management planning, enforcement of regulations, community involvement in law enforcement and habitat protection, and reintroduction of cranes to the wild. The Crane Conservation Fund focuses on law enforcement, habitat protection, reintroduction of cranes to the wild, conflict resolution, and community outreach and education. The terms \"Convention\" and \"Fund\" refer to specific definitions in the Endangered Species Act of 1973, while the term \"Secretary\" pertains to the Secretary of the Interior. SEC. 5. CRANE CONSERVATION ASSISTANCE. The Secretary will use funds from the Fund to provide financial assistance for crane conservation projects with approved proposals. Applicants seeking assistance for crane conservation projects must submit proposals to the Secretary. Applicants for crane conservation projects must submit project proposals meeting specific requirements to the Secretary. Eligible applicants include wildlife management authorities from countries within the range of crane species in Africa, Asia, Europe, or North America. Applicants for crane conservation projects must submit project proposals meeting specific requirements to the Secretary, the Secretariat of the Convention, or any person with expertise in crane conservation. The proposal should include a concise statement of the purpose. A project proposal must include a concise statement of the purpose, names and qualifications of project personnel, methods for implementation and assessment, and staff/community management details. The project proposal should include details on project outcome assessment, staff and community management, logistics, estimated funds and time needed, government support, and funding sources. The project proposal should include project outcome assessment, staff and community management details, logistics, estimated funds and time needed, government support, matching funding information, and any other necessary details for eligibility evaluation. The Secretary must review project proposals within 30 days of receiving them and consult with other officials within 180 days for approval or disapproval. After receiving a project proposal, the Secretary must consult with relevant Federal officials and the government of each country where the project will take place. The Secretary will then approve or disapprove the proposal after considering any comments received during the consultation, and provide written notification to the applicant. The Secretary may approve a project proposal if it will enhance conservation programs for cranes and address conflicts between humans and cranes. Disapproval notifications are sent to the applicant, other Federal officials, and relevant countries. The Secretary may approve projects to implement conservation programs, address conflicts between humans and cranes, enhance compliance with laws, and develop scientific information on crane habitat and population. The Secretary may approve projects for conservation programs, addressing conflicts, enhancing compliance with laws, and developing scientific information on crane habitat and population. Additionally, monitoring crane habitat condition, population numbers, and threats, promoting cooperative projects, conducting scientific research, and reintroducing cranes into the wild are also important tasks. The Secretary may approve projects for conservation programs, scientific research on cranes, successful reintroduction of cranes into the wild, and providing training and support for effective crane conservation. Preference is given to projects that promote project sustainability and matching funds. The Secretary gives preference to project proposals that ensure long-term conservation of cranes and habitats or have matching funds available. Recipients of assistance must submit periodic reports to the Secretary. The Secretary requires reports with necessary information to evaluate project progress and success for positive results, problem assessment, and fostering improvements. Reports and project documents must be made available to the public. The Secretary convenes a panel of experts biennially to identify conservation needs for cranes and wetlands. The Crane Conservation Fund is established under Section 6. The Crane Conservation Fund is established within the Multinational Species Conservation Fund, consisting of transferred amounts, appropriations, and interest earned on investments. The Crane Conservation Fund within the Multinational Species Conservation Fund allows for the transfer of necessary amounts to provide assistance under section 5, with a limit of 3 percent or $80,000 for administrative expenses. The Secretary may expend up to 3 percent or $80,000 for administrative expenses each fiscal year. Additionally, not more than 50 percent of the Fund can be used for projects related to North American crane species conservation. The Secretary of the Treasury will invest any remaining Fund amounts in interest-bearing accounts. The Secretary of the Treasury may invest any remaining Fund amounts in interest-bearing obligations of the United States, which can be acquired on original issue or by purchase of outstanding obligations at the market price. Any obligation acquired by the Fund may be sold at the market price. The Secretary of the Treasury may sell obligations acquired by the Fund at market price. Interest and proceeds from obligations held in the Fund are credited to the Fund. Amounts required to be transferred to the Fund are done monthly from the general fund of the Treasury based on estimates by the Secretary of the Treasury. The Secretary may accept donations for assistance under section 5, which will be transferred to the Treasury for deposit in the Fund. Adjustments will be made for prior estimates in excess or less than required amounts. SEC. 7. ADVISORY GROUP. The Secretary may convene an advisory group of individuals involved in crane conservation, ensuring public participation in meetings with timely notice provided. The Secretary convenes an advisory group for crane conservation with public participation, providing timely notice of meetings and keeping minutes available to the public.
