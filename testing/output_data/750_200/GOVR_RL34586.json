    "content": "This report focuses on USAID's global health programs for child survival and maternal health from FY2001 to FY2008. It discusses how advancements in addressing malaria can improve maternal and child survival. UNICEF's report in 2008 celebrated the decline in annual deaths among children under five. In 2008, UNICEF Executive Director Ann Veneman noted a 60% decrease in annual deaths of children under five since 1960. Despite this progress, around 26,000 children still die daily, with most deaths occurring in developing countries. About 4 million newborns die annually, with 37% of childhood deaths happening in the first 28 days. Child deaths are prevalent in developing countries, with 37% occurring in the neonatal period, resulting in about 4 million annual newborn deaths. The main causes are neonatal infections and diseases like pneumonia, diarrhea, malaria, measles, and HIV/AIDS. Undernutrition contributes to half of these deaths, highlighting the importance of maternal and child health monitoring. Maternal and child health are crucial to monitor as indicators of overall health conditions. The Millennium Development Goals aim to reduce child and maternal mortality rates, with progress in other goals impacting the ability to reach these targets. Countries with undernourished populations and limited access to clean water tend to have higher mortality rates. Countries with significant undernourished populations and limited access to clean water tend to have higher maternal and child mortality rates. Undernourished individuals are more likely to be impoverished and susceptible to infectious diseases. UNICEF reports that 62 countries show no progress in child survival goals, with a majority in Africa. Maternal health is closely linked to child survival, with over 500,000 women dying annually from pregnancy-related causes. Maternal health is closely linked to child survival, with over 500,000 women dying annually from pregnancy-related causes in developing countries. Access to adequate diets, safe water, sanitation facilities, basic literacy, and health services during pregnancy and childbirth could prevent most of these deaths. Maternal mortality in developing countries is linked to undernutrition and obstetric complications, with 20% of deaths due to undernutrition and 75% due to complications like hemorrhage, sepsis, and eclampsia. Young mothers under 20 are at higher risk, facing complications such as toxemia, anemia, and premature delivery. Adolescent girls, especially those under 20, face higher risks during pregnancy and delivery, including complications like toxemia, anemia, premature delivery, prolonged labor, and cervical trauma. They are also at a higher risk of delivering low birth weight babies, leading to higher morbidity and mortality rates. The United Nations estimates that adolescents give birth to 15 million infants each year, with girls aged 15-19 being twice as likely to die from childbirth compared to women in their twenties. Girls younger than 15 are five times as likely to die. The maternal mortality rate is higher for adolescent girls, with those aged 15-19 facing a rate of 178 per 100,000 live births. Hemorrhage is a significant cause of maternal deaths in Africa and Asia, accounting for about 34% and 31% respectively. Regions with fewer skilled health attendants at birth have higher mortality rates. Regions with low proportions of skilled health attendants at birth have higher maternal mortality rates. In sub-Saharan Africa, 43% of women give birth with skilled attendants, 65% in south Asia, and 99% in industrialized nations. In sub-Saharan Africa, one in every 22 women is at risk of dying from pregnancy-related causes, compared to one in every 59 Asian women and one in every 8,000 women in industrialized nations. UNICEF reports that many countries lack the capacity to reduce maternal mortality nationwide. One in every 8,000 women faces the risk of dying from pregnancy-related causes. UNICEF found that many countries lack the capacity to reduce maternal mortality nationwide, with 80% of priority countries having low health workforce densities. South Africa and Swaziland are the only sub-Saharan African countries meeting the minimum standard for health workers. African countries, including South Africa and Swaziland, have reached the minimum standard for health workers. Child and maternal survival rates are higher in areas with sufficient health workers, clean water, controlled mosquito populations, and access to nutritious food. Sub-Saharan Africa faces the greatest proportional shortage of health care workers globally, with 36 out of 57 countries with critical shortages located in Africa. No industrialized nations are among the countries with critical shortages. The WHO estimates that 57 countries, including 36 in Africa, have critical shortages of health care workers. An additional 4.3 million health workers are needed globally, with African countries needing to increase their health workers by 140% to meet the minimum threshold. USAID has supported research leading to interventions saving millions of children. USAID has committed over $6 billion in the past 20 years to support global child survival efforts, with $3.4 billion allocated from FY2001-FY2008. They focus on six health problems that cause 90% of child deaths in developing countries, with undernutrition contributing to half of these deaths. USAID allocates a significant proportion of its child survival funds to address health issues, with undernutrition contributing to half of child deaths in developing countries. The United Nations FAO states that hunger and malnutrition weaken immune systems, leading to the deaths of nearly 10 million children annually. WHO-supported studies from 1991 to 2001 found that mildly underweight children are at risk. Children who are underweight are at higher risk of death from infectious diseases. Malnourished children have a higher likelihood of dying from measles and severe diarrhea. Good nutrition improves child survival, health, and cognitive development, while undernutrition weakens the immune system. USAID's nutrition programs focus on micronutrient supplementation and fortification, as well as infant and young child feeding. These programs add vital immune-building micronutrients like zinc, vitamin A, iron, and iodine to processed foods. USAID-supported programs add vital immune-building micronutrients like zinc, vitamin A, iron, and iodine to processed foods. Funds are used for research on biofortified crops to enhance the nutrient content of basic foods. Micronutrient supplementation is integrated with other interventions like safe water and sanitation to address malnutrition-related deaths in infants and children. According to USAID, poor feeding practices during the first two years of life contribute to malnutrition-related infant and child deaths. Less than one third of infants are exclusively breastfed in most countries during the first six months of life, leading to early cessation of breastfeeding and introduction of nutritionally inadequate and unsafe foods. Exclusively breastfed infants have fewer childhood diseases and are less likely to die from acute respiratory infections. One USAID-supported study found that exclusively breastfed infants have significantly lower rates of childhood diseases and are less likely to die from respiratory infections and diarrheal diseases. Continued breastfeeding during diarrhea episodes also helps protect infants from energy and protein loss. USAID integrates safe infant feeding practices with HIV/AIDS programs to prevent mother-to-child transmission. USAID allocates around $30 million annually for nutrition programs, including Vitamin A, iodine, food fortification, and anemia packages. UNICEF emphasizes the importance of preventing pneumonia through minimizing indoor pollution, adequate nutrition, exclusive breastfeeding, and Vitamin A and zinc supplements. It is crucial for children to receive full immunizations against infections like Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and pertussis to prevent pneumonia. International health organizations aim to expand access to vaccines for protection. Since the mid-1990s, international health organizations, with support from USAID, have focused on preventing pneumonia by expanding access to vaccines for infections like Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and pertussis. USAID has administered immunizations to nearly 500 million children and treated over 375 million cases of child pneumonia since 2002. Additionally, UNICEF and WHO developed the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) strategy to address various childhood illnesses, including pneumonia. USAID supports the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) strategy, which includes interventions for diarrhea, acute respiratory infections, malnutrition, and malaria. Approximately 40% of the world's population, mainly in the poorest countries, are at risk of malaria, with over 500 million people severely ill each year. Most cases and deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa, with about 1 million children under five dying annually from malaria. The President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) was proposed in 2005 by the President as an effort to increase support for U.S. international malaria programs by over $1.2 billion from FY2006 through FY2010 in 15 targeted countries. USAID coordinates all PMI activities in partnership with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to reduce malaria deaths by 50% in those countries by 2010. The President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) was proposed in 2005 to increase support for U.S. international malaria programs by over $1.2 billion from FY2006 through FY2010 in 15 targeted countries. USAID coordinates all PMI activities with the CDC to reduce malaria deaths by 50% in those countries by 2010. In January 2008, USAID reported that PMI reached over 6 million people in its first year and over 25 million within two years. Activities included indoor residual spraying in 10 PMI countries, distributing 4.7 million LLITNs, and benefiting more than 17 million people. The President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) has been successful in distributing over 4.7 million LLITNs and benefiting more than 17 million people through indoor residual spraying in 10 countries. Additionally, they have procured 12.6 million malarial treatments, trained 28,000 health workers, and purchased 4 million anti-malarial tablets to reduce the impact of malaria in pregnancy. HIV/AIDS is preventable and treatable, but not curable, with most children acquiring HIV from their infected mothers during pregnancy, birth, or breastfeeding. Most children acquire HIV from their infected mothers during pregnancy, birth, or breastfeeding. Successful interventions can reduce mother-to-child HIV transmission to 2%. In resource-limited countries, about 33% of HIV-positive pregnant women receive drugs for prevention. Nevirapine, costing $0.29 to $0.40 per dose, is commonly used for this purpose. It is crucial for children to receive timely treatment. The cost of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for children is significantly higher than for adults, with an annual supply of generic ARTs costing about $260 per child. Fixed-dosed treatments combining multiple drugs in a single pill are most effective but more expensive for children. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial for children with HIV, as the infection progresses faster and more aggressively in this population. Fixed-dosed treatments combining multiple drugs in a single pill are more effective but costly for children. The Clinton Foundation negotiated lower prices for pediatric ARTs, reducing the cost to $0.16 per day or $60 per year. ART is not the only treatment to reduce child mortality among HIV-positive children. Health experts emphasize that ART is not the sole treatment for reducing child mortality in HIV-positive children. Treating opportunistic infections like pneumonia with Cotrimoxazole, costing $0.03 per day or $10 per year, can also enhance child survival rates. Only 10% of the 4 million children in need of the drug are currently receiving it. USAID has invested $6 billion in HIV/AIDS interventions across 100 countries since 1986, with the introduction of PEPFAR leading to changes in reporting practices. Since 1986, USAID has spent $6 billion on HIV/AIDS interventions in over 100 countries. The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) has led to changes in reporting practices, with outcomes now reported collectively. PEPFAR initiatives have provided care and support to 2.7 million orphans and vulnerable children, reaching 332,000 children through food and nutrition programs. PEPFAR's child-focus programs provide support for orphans and vulnerable children, pregnant or lactating women, and severely malnourished individuals on ART. These programs include training for caregivers, promoting technology use, income-generating activities, and connecting families to essential health care and social services. Support for HIV-infected adults receiving treatment is also emphasized for creating a nurturing environment for children. PEPFAR has committed $1.5 billion for HIV/AIDS care and support programs. Pediatric treatment received $191.5 million in funding, benefiting 85,900 children. PMTCT services supported over 10 million pregnancies, providing ART to HIV-positive women in 827,000 pregnancies and preventing 157,000 infant HIV infections. Since 2002, USAID has provided over $1.5 billion for treating child diarrhea with ORS, preventing and treating diarrhea through various methods like ORS, fluids, breastfeeding, and antibiotics. They also control diarrheal disease by training health workers and promoting breastfeeding. USAID focuses on controlling diarrheal disease by training health workers, promoting breastfeeding, and emphasizing hygiene practices like handwashing with soap to reduce diarrhea prevalence among children. Handwashing with soap is not common in poorer communities, where soap is often reserved for bathing or washing clothes and dishes. In poorer communities, soap is often reserved for bathing or washing clothes and dishes. USAID supports handwashing with soap to reduce diarrhea prevalence by 30% to 40%. WHO states that measles immunization is a cost-effective intervention for preventing childhood deaths. The measles vaccine is a cost-effective public health intervention that can reduce childhood deaths. It costs less than $1 per dose and has been available for over 40 years. In countries where rubella and mumps are significant public health concerns, the measles vaccine is often combined with them. The measles vaccine is often combined with rubella and/or mumps vaccines in countries where they are significant public health concerns. The cost of a MR vaccine through UNICEF is about $0.65 per dose, and MMR costs $1.04 to $1.50 per dose. Immunization coverage rates for measles vaccination vary by region, with an estimated 80% of children vaccinated in 2006, up from 72% in 2000. In 2006, 80% of children were vaccinated, up from 72% in 2000. 478 million children received measles vaccinations from 2000 to 2006 in priority countries, leading to a 68% decrease in global measles mortality. Africa saw a 91% reduction in measles cases and deaths. USAID considers immunization programs a major public health success. USAID supports immunization programs in over 100 countries, partnering with organizations like GAVI and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Their maternal health programs aim to improve pregnancy outcomes in low-resource settings through various interventions. USAID's maternal health programs focus on ensuring healthy pregnancy outcomes in low-resource environments through interventions like nutritional supplementation, treatment for parasitic worms, immunizations, prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission, malaria treatment, and syphilis detection. They advocate for skilled birth attendants at all births and emergency obstetric care plans for home deliveries. Birth attendants are trained to prevent infant deaths. USAID trains birth attendants to prevent infant deaths by facilitating infant breathing, resuscitating, and providing care for birth asphyxia. They also promote hygienic cord and eye care, immediate breastfeeding, and develop contingency plans for accessing emergency obstetric care for mothers who deliver at home. Community-based interventions include teaching families to recognize birth complications, arranging transportation to a hospital, identifying blood donors, and creating savings plans for healthcare costs. USAID addresses key causes of maternal mortality by training birth attendants to prevent postpartum hemorrhage deaths through low-cost interventions. They urge communities to ensure mothers give birth in the presence of a trained health care practitioner who can administer life-saving techniques. USAID-supported programs train birth attendants to actively manage postpartum hemorrhage by using drugs and life-saving techniques. This intervention can prevent 60% of hemorrhages. Infections cause nearly 10% of maternal deaths, with unhygienic delivery practices identified as a key factor. USAID-supported efforts aim to prevent sepsis in mothers and babies by addressing unhygienic delivery practices. This includes distributing delivery kits, ensuring trained delivery attendants are present at each birth, and training birth attendants to identify signs of infection and provide necessary treatment. USAID trains birth attendants to identify signs of infection and use antibiotics to prevent sepsis in mothers and babies. They also train healthcare providers to recognize and treat hypertensive disorders, including pre-eclampsia and eclampsia. Additionally, USAID provides support for mothers experiencing prolonged or obstructed labor. Prolonged or obstructed labor can lead to serious complications for both the mother and baby, including obstetric fistula. This condition is more common in women in low-resource settings, especially those who were stunted due to undernourishment and lack access to obstetric care. In low-resource settings, girls and women with underdeveloped pelvic regions due to undernourishment are at higher risk of developing obstetric fistula. Delaying pregnancy until the pelvic region is fully developed, ensuring access to emergency obstetric care, and performing caesarean surgery when necessary can prevent obstetric fistula. USAID has supported fistula prevention and repair programs since 1989 and 2005, respectively. USAID has been supporting fistula prevention programs since 1989 and repair programs since 2005. These programs aim to increase access to emergency obstetrical care, delay child marriage, train health practitioners to identify labor complications, and reduce stigma around obstetric fistula. Complications from unsafe abortions contribute to 13% of maternal deaths globally, totaling 67,000 deaths according to WHO. USAID supports fistula prevention and repair programs to increase access to emergency obstetrical care, delay child marriage, and reduce stigma. Complications from unsafe abortions contribute to 13% of maternal deaths globally, totaling 67,000 deaths annually. Regional variations exist, with Latin America and the Caribbean accounting for 12% of maternal deaths from unsafe abortions, while Africa sees about 4% of women dying from the procedure. USAID's international family planning programs have helped avert an estimated 4 million maternal deaths over the last 20 years. Appropriations to USAID's CS/MH programs grew by about 8% from FY2001 to FY2003. From FY2001 to FY2003, appropriations to USAID's CS/MH programs grew by about 8%, and overall support for USAID's global health programs increased by 28%. The majority of this growth came from higher appropriations for HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases, with funds directed to tuberculosis and malaria programs. Congress also showed strong support for the Global Fund to Fight. During FY2004 to FY2008, OID funds were mainly allocated to tuberculosis and malaria programs, with increased support for the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. Congress supported global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs, with a focus on PEPFAR. Some Members questioned the Administration's lower funding requests for other global health interventions. During FY2004 to FY2008, Congress supported global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs, particularly through PEPFAR. Some Members questioned the Administration's lower funding requests for other global health interventions like child survival, maternal health, family planning, and reproductive health. There were concerns about recipient countries' ability to absorb increasing HIV/AIDS funds due to strained health infrastructures. Congress urged better integration of HIV/AIDS with other health programs, such as TB and nutrition, as appropriations for HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria exceeded support for USAID's other health programs. During FY2004 to FY2008, Congress provided $19.7 billion for global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs, surpassing support for USAID's other health initiatives. Appropriations for child survival, maternal health, and family planning totaled $4.6 billion during the same period. Congress consistently increased funding for USAID's global health programs, mainly focusing on specific diseases under President George W. Bush's administration. During FY2001 to FY2010, Congress supported targeted disease-specific U.S. programs under President George W. Bush's administration, including initiatives for HIV prevention, PEPFAR, and malaria. Funding for child survival and maternal health remained relatively unchanged, except for a slight increase in FY2008. Health experts praised the increased U.S. commitment to combat global disease spread. Many health experts are concerned that while there has been an increase in U.S. funding for diseases like HIV/AIDS, other life-saving health programs for women and children in sub-Saharan Africa are being overlooked and underfunded. The World Health Organization states that two-thirds of child deaths can be prevented with low-cost interventions. Critics argue that HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria are not the only diseases causing deaths and call for increased funding for child survival and maternal health programs. Some argue for increased U.S. global health funds beyond HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria to support child survival, maternal health, and family planning activities. Family planning can improve maternal and child health by reducing high-risk pregnancies, preventing HIV/AIDS, reducing abortions, and protecting the environment. Family planning aims to improve maternal and child health by spacing pregnancies, preventing HIV/AIDS, reducing abortions, and protecting the environment. Some oppose funding for family planning due to concerns about abortions and coercive practices. Research shows that adolescent girls in rural areas of developing countries are at higher risk of poor pregnancy outcomes. Research indicates that teenage mothers are at higher risk of delivering low-birthweight babies and facing pregnancy complications such as toxemia, anemia, premature delivery, and obstetric fistula. Adolescent girls have a higher likelihood of childbirth-related deaths compared to women in their twenties. In Kenya, 45% of obstetric fistula cases are among adolescents. Delaying pregnancy until pelvic development is complete can prevent obstetric fistula. Obstetric fistula is prevalent among adolescents in Kenya, with 45% of cases occurring in this age group. Preventative measures include delaying pregnancy until pelvic development is complete and performing caesarean surgery when necessary. Repairing fistula costs around $300, which is unaffordable for many affected individuals. Advocates suggest increasing health system funding to address maternal and child mortality effectively. Improvements in health strategies, including income and food levels, maternal and child health services, safe drinking water, and basic sanitation, are crucial for reducing mortality rates. UNICEF emphasizes the importance of donor support for health systems to deliver essential interventions effectively. Strengthening health systems requires better coordination of health assistance among donors and agencies like USAID. Supporters urge Congress to direct USAID to coordinate health assistance with other donors and ministries to improve efficiency and health outcomes, following the model of WHO's International Health Partnership. The IHP+ encourages donors and countries to create a compact committing to support a national health plan with predictable financing from national and international sources. Compacts bind donors and governments to one health plan, budget, monitoring, and evaluation process, and benchmarks for performance. The IHP+ promotes a compact between donors and countries to support a national health plan with predictable financing. Global health experts emphasize the role of recipient governments in improving health systems. Critics argue that political will influences minimal health spending in developing countries, with lack of political will cited as a key reason for unspent health funds. In developing countries, lack of political will is a key reason for unspent health funds. African leaders have pledged to increase health spending, with the continent spending less than 1% of the world's health expenditure. Members of the African Union signed the Abuja Declaration on HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Other Infectious Diseases in 2001. Members of the African Union and the Organization of African Unity signed the Abuja Declaration on HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Other Infectious Diseases, pledging to allocate at least 15% of their national budgets to healthcare. By 2004, 33% of AU States had allocated 10% or more to health, with only Botswana meeting the 15% target. Some African countries allocate between 5% and 10% of their national budgets to healthcare, with only Botswana meeting the 15% target. Critics argue that structural adjustment programs and lending practices limit governments' ability to invest in public health and medical education, leading to shortages in supplies and equipment. Shrunken health budgets in Africa have resulted in a decline in education quality for medical students, shortages of health supplies, insufficient medicine stocks, and a brain drain of health workers. Discussions on the impact of structural adjustment and health reform are often biased, according to the International Development Research Center. The International Development Research Center found mixed results in structural adjustment, conditional lending, and health reform. They could not support extreme views on the erosion of public expenditure on health. Bills introduced in the 110th Congress aimed to improve maternal and child health, including increased support by $5 million for FY2008. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008 increased support for maternal and child health by $5 million for FY2008. The Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008 authorized $50 billion and $48 billion for international HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria interventions, requiring women receiving drugs to prevent mother-to-child HIV transmission to also receive appropriate maternal and child services. The House version of the bill calls for linkages to NGOs implementing multi-sectoral approaches for HIV/AIDS education and testing in family planning and maternal health programs. The Senate version of the bill does not include language on family planning. H.R. 1302 and S. 2433, Global Poverty Act of 2007, require the President to develop and implement a comprehensive strategy to advance U.S. efforts. The Global Poverty Act of 2007, H.R. 1302 and S. 2433, require the President to develop a strategy to reduce global poverty and achieve the Millennium Development Goal. The House passed the bill and referred it to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The House passed H.R. 2266 and S. 1418, U.S. Commitment to Global Child Survival Act of 2007, providing assistance for improving health in developing countries. The Senate version was also introduced. H.R. 1225, Focus on Family Health Worldwide Act of 2007, amends the Foreign Assistance Act to enhance family planning programs. H.R. 1225, Focus on Family Health Worldwide Act of 2007, amends the Foreign Assistance Act to improve voluntary family planning programs in developing countries. H.R. 2114, Repairing Young Women's Lives Around the World Act, provides a U.S. contribution to the United Nations Population Fund for the prevention and treatment of obstetric fistula. H.R. 2604, United Nations Population Fund Women's Health and Dignity Act, supports the United Nations Population Fund for women's health activities. H.R. 2604, United Nations Population Fund Women's Health and Dignity Act, provides support for activities to save women's lives, limit unsafe abortions, promote family planning, and improve lives in developing countries. S. 1998, International Child Marriage Prevention Act of 2007, aims to reduce child marriage. S. 2682, United Nations Population Fund, also addresses women's health issues. The Prevention Act of 2007 aims to reduce child marriage and allocate funds for this purpose. S. 2682, the United Nations Population Fund Restoration Act of 2008, directs U.S. funding to the UN Population Fund for maternal and child health. H.Res. 1045, the Global Security Priorities Resolution, calls for reducing nuclear weapons and preventing their proliferation to enhance global security. The resolution H.Res. 1045 calls for reducing nuclear weapons to enhance global security and directs savings towards child survival, hunger, and education. It also urges the President to take action to achieve these goals. The House passed H.Res. 1022, affirming commitment to promoting maternal health and child survival globally."
