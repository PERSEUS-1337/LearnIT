    "content": "The \"Biofuels Market Expansion Act of 2011\" ensures the availability of dual-fueled automobiles and light-duty trucks. The \"Biofuels Market Expansion Act of 2011\" mandates manufacturers to produce a minimum percentage of dual-fueled automobiles and light-duty trucks for sale in the United States. The \"Biofuels Market Expansion Act of 2011\" requires manufacturers to produce a certain percentage of dual-fueled vehicles, with 50% for model years 2014 and 2015, and 90% for model year 2016 and beyond. There is an exception for vehicles running solely on electricity. The \"Biofuels Market Expansion Act of 2011\" mandates the production of dual-fueled vehicles by manufacturers. The Secretary of Transportation must establish regulations within a year of the Act's enactment. Additionally, there is a provision for promoting blender pumps. The Biofuels Market Expansion Act of 2011 requires the production of dual-fueled vehicles and mandates regulations by the Secretary of Transportation. It also includes a provision for promoting blender pumps capable of dispensing various gasoline and ethanol blends, including E-85 fuel. The term \"E-85 fuel\" refers to a blend of gasoline with approximately 85 percent ethanol content. \"Ethanol fuel blend\" is a mixture of gasoline and ethanol, with a range of 0 to 85 percent ethanol content. A \"major fuel distributor\" is defined as a person who owns a refinery or directly markets its output. The term \"major fuel distributor\" refers to a person who owns a refinery or directly markets its output. The Secretary of Energy will make grants to eligible facilities to pay the Federal share. The Secretary will make grants to eligible facilities to pay for installing blender pump fuel infrastructure and providing subgrants to direct retailers of ethanol fuel blends for the purpose of installing fuel infrastructure. The purpose is to install fuel infrastructure for direct retail sale of ethanol fuel blends, including blender pumps and storage tanks. Major fuel distributors are not eligible for grants. The Federal share of project costs can be up to 50%. If a facility or retailer receiving a grant does not offer ethanol fuel blends for sale for at least 2 years, there will be a reversion. The eligible facility or retailer receiving a grant must offer ethanol fuel blends for sale for at least 2 years after installing the blender pump. Failure to do so will result in repayment to the Secretary, not exceeding the grant amount provided. Authorization of appropriations is available for the Secretary to carry out this subsection. Authorization of appropriations for the Secretary to carry out subsection includes $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2012, $100,000,000 for fiscal year 2013, $200,000,000 for fiscal year 2014, $300,000,000 for fiscal year 2015, and $350,000,000 for fiscal year 2016. This is for the installation of blender pumps by major fuel distributors at owned and branded stations. The Clean Air Act is amended to allow major fuel distributors to install blender pumps at owned and branded stations, defining E-85 fuel and ethanol fuel blend in the process. Authorization of appropriations for this purpose is specified for fiscal years 2012 to 2016. The Clean Air Act allows major fuel distributors to install blender pumps at owned and branded stations, defining E-85 fuel as a blend of gasoline and ethanol with 0-85% denatured ethanol content. The Clean Air Act allows major fuel distributors to install blender pumps at owned and branded stations for E-85 fuel, defined as a blend of gasoline and ethanol with 0-85% denatured ethanol content. The term 'major fuel distributor' excludes those marketing through less than 50 retail fueling stations. The Secretary of Energy, in consultation with the EPA Administrator and Secretary of Agriculture, is responsible for promulgating regulations. The Secretary of Agriculture will promulgate regulations requiring major fuel distributors to provide blender pumps dispensing E-85 fuel and ethanol blends at majority-owned or branded stations in the US for a minimum of 5 years. The Secretary of Agriculture will require major fuel distributors to provide blender pumps dispensing E-85 fuel and ethanol blends at stations for a minimum of 5 years, based on specified percentages of majority-owned and branded stations. The applicable percentage of majority-owned and branded stations for dispensing E-85 fuel and ethanol blends is set to increase over the years: 10% in 2014, 20% in 2016, 35% in 2018, and 50% from 2020 onwards. From 2020 onwards, major fuel distributors must install blender pumps dispensing E-85 fuel and ethanol blends at a minimum specified percentage. The Secretary mandates major fuel distributors to install blender pumps dispensing ethanol fuel blends at a minimum specified percentage in each State. The Secretary requires major fuel distributors to assume financial responsibility for installing blender pumps dispensing ethanol fuel blends in each State where they operate. The Secretary mandates major fuel distributors to provide blender pumps and necessary equipment for proper function. Production credits are available for exceeding blender pump installation requirements at owned and branded stations. The major fuel distributor earns credits for installing blender pumps exceeding requirements, which can be used in the following three calendar years. Trading credits are also available for distributors who exceed installation requirements. A major fuel distributor can earn credits for exceeding blender pump installation requirements, which can be sold to another distributor. These credits cannot be used to fulfill geographic distribution requirements. SEC. 4. LOAN GUARANTEES FOR PROJECTS TO CONSTRUCT RENEWABLE FUEL PIPELINES. Amendment to the Energy Policy Act of 2005 includes definitions for \"renewable fuel\" and \"renewable fuel pipeline.\" The term \"renewable fuel\" now encompasses all types of ethanol and biodiesel. Amendment to the Energy Policy Act of 2005 includes changes to guarantee amounts for renewable fuel pipelines. The guarantee for such projects shall be 80 percent of the project cost as estimated at the time of issuance. Amendment to the Energy Policy Act of 2005 includes changes to guarantee amounts for renewable fuel pipelines and rapid deployment of these pipelines. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 amendment includes provisions for the installation of infrastructure for clean energy technologies and renewable fuel pipelines through loan guarantees. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 amendment requires the Secretary of Energy to establish regulations within 90 days to implement the changes, including a specific deadline for certain projects."
