    "content": "The Act titled \"Environmental Dredge Disposal Act of 1996\" establishes regulations for dredged material disposal facilities. Section 101 of the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 is amended to include provisions for dredged material disposal facilities for Federal navigation projects. The Water Resources Development Act of 1986 now includes provisions for dredged material disposal facilities for Federal navigation projects, with cost sharing for construction and operation. The Federal navigation project funds from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund shall be used for construction until the Secretary determines they are not needed for eligible operation and maintenance costs. The maximum federal share for operation and maintenance costs is specified. The Federal share of operation and maintenance costs for a project shall not exceed $25,000,000 per fiscal year. Eligible costs include constructing dredged material disposal facilities. The Federal share of costs for constructing and maintaining dredged material disposal facilities for Federal navigation projects in harbors and inland harbors is limited to $25,000,000 per fiscal year. Federal navigation projects for harbors and inland harbors include the Federal share of costs for environmental dredging and disposal facilities for contaminated sediments in Federal navigation channels and the mitigation of environmental impacts from Federal dredging activities. The text chunk discusses the management and disposal of contaminated sediments in port and harbor areas to support maritime commerce. Preference is given to port areas where harbor maintenance fees exceed Federal expenditures. This subsection applies to specific activities related to environmental remediation. The subsection applies to the provision of a dredged material disposal facility or associated navigation project without awarded contracts before the enactment date. The subsection applies to dredged material disposal facilities or navigation projects not awarded contracts before the enactment date. Cooperative agreements with non-Federal interests must be amended to conform to this subsection within 30 days. The subsection requires cooperative agreements with non-Federal interests to be amended within 30 days to conform to provisions regarding project costs for dredged material disposal facilities. Amendments must be applied prospectively and should not increase the non-Federal share of costs for any dredged material disposal facility."
