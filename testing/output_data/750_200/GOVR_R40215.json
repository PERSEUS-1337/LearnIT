He proposed creating a special oversight board chaired by a Chief Performance Officer to review and address identified problems. The Obama Administration planned to establish a website, Recovery.gov, to provide information on contracts and financial details. The Chief Performance Officer would review problems and conduct regular meetings to address specific issues. The Administration planned to launch Recovery.gov to track spending from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. An oversight board will ensure accountability and transparency in government spending. Numerous oversight provisions were included in economic stimulus legislation to root out waste and inefficiency. The House Committee on Appropriations characterized the stimulus bill as providing \"unprecedented accountability.\" Concerns have been raised about agencies' capacity to spend funds rapidly and improve competition and oversight. Questions have been raised about the resources for inspectors general and the Government Accountability Office to oversee the stimulus legislation. The House and Senate passed their versions of the bill in January and February 2009, respectively. The House and Senate passed their versions of the stimulus bill in January and February 2009. Negotiations were ongoing to reconcile differences between the two versions.

The 9-11 Commission emphasized the concept of \"institutionalizing imagination\" to address challenges in crisis response. The federal government operates as a system of nested oversight, with Congress overseeing the President, agencies, and entities like the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) providing support. Government Accountability Office (GAO) and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) provide oversight support to Congress and agencies. Agencies monitor their activities as mandated by Congress, utilizing tools like monitoring and evaluation. In oversight of funding recipients, tools like monitoring, analysis, and evaluation are used to ensure compliance with laws, faithful implementation of congressional intent, avoidance of mismanagement, and fair allocation of resources and policy execution. The oversight of funding recipients involves adherence to sound management practices, fair allocation of resources, achievement of programmatic missions, and minimization of waste. Implementation agencies, nonfederal recipients, OMB, oversight board, and IGs will play a role in ensuring these aspects are addressed. Table 1 provides a brief analysis of selected general oversight provisions in the House- and Senate-passed versions of economic stimulus legislation, detailing how various entities will approach oversight. References to \"the Act\" within each bill generally refer to either Division A or Division B of the bill, not the entire bill."
