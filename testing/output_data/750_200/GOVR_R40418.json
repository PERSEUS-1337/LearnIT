    "content": "The federal government responded to the 9/11 and anthrax attacks by increasing funding for biodefense, focusing on capacity shortages in diagnostic, clinical, and research laboratories. The DOD, DHS, HHS, and USDA have expanded their high-containment laboratory capacity for studying dangerous pathogens since 2001. High-containment laboratories are crucial in the study of dangerous pathogens for biodefense efforts. They help develop countermeasures, diagnostics, and detectors for potential terrorist attacks. However, there is a concern that these facilities could also increase the risk of a biological attack by providing materials or training. The federal government invested in research to develop countermeasures, diagnostics, and detectors for dangerous pathogens usable in a terrorist attack. Funding for civilian biodefense increased significantly from $690 million in FY2001 to $5.4 billion in FY2008, supporting academic and industrial researchers. Concerns exist about aging laboratory infrastructure and limited capacity. Non-federal entities have also expanded high-containment laboratories. The proliferation of high-containment laboratories internationally due to the threat of bioterrorism and emerging diseases has raised new policy questions regarding laboratory capacity, federal investment, consolidation, and optimal size and type of laboratories. The expansion of high-containment laboratories has prompted policymakers to consider the necessary federal investment, consolidation of labs, optimal size and type of facilities, coordination of efforts, and the balance between benefits and risks. This interest stems from accidents, regulatory issues, and community resistance to these laboratories. The federal government is increasingly interested in regulating high-containment laboratories due to accidents, noncompliance, and community resistance. The Commission on the Prevention of Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferation and Terrorism recommended tighter oversight. These labs may also be regulated by state and local laws. The report focuses on federal regulation, explaining biosecurity, biosafety, and oversight mechanisms. Biosecurity and biosafety are closely related, with biosecurity focusing on securing pathogens from theft and biosafety on lowering infection risks in laboratories. The federal government oversees their implementation in high-containment laboratories, facing issues that require policy options for congressional consideration. The federal government oversees biosecurity and biosafety practices in high-containment laboratories. Biosecurity focuses on securing pathogens from theft, while biosafety aims to lower infection risks. The Select Agent Program regulates commerce in pathogens with severe consequences if released into the environment. The federal government established the Select Agent Program to regulate commerce in pathogens with severe consequences if released. This program was created in response to the threat of bioterrorism, particularly highlighted by the 2001 anthrax mailings. The federal government enacted laws to increase restrictions on possession of dangerous pathogens after the 2001 anthrax mailings. The Select Agent Program oversees regulation of select agents possession, transfer, and use. The Select Agent Program regulates possession, transfer, and use of select agents certified by the federal government. Scientists must register with the DOJ for access, undergo background checks, and obtain nontransferable permits valid for five years. Facilities using select agents must implement security plans to prevent theft or unauthorized access. Facilities using select agents must develop and implement a security plan to protect them from theft or improper access. Plans are submitted to HHS or USDA for review and regulatory compliance. The CDC conducts announced inspections of regulated facilities every three years. Noncompliance with Select Agent Program regulations can result in fines. As of February 2009, about 390 entities were certified to work with select agents, with 15,300 staff approved for access. Violating Select Agent Program regulations can lead to fines and legal consequences under the USA PATRIOT Act. The majority of certified entities are owned or operated by state or local governments. The federal government has developed a Laboratory Response Network linking state or local public health laboratories to handle dangerous pathogens. Tensions have increased over the Select Agent Program due to the large number of academic entities and researchers involved. The Select Agent Program has caused tensions in academia due to the perceived onerous regulations. Approximately 200 entities chose to transfer or destroy their select agent inventories rather than register. Inspectors General have conducted investigations on the program's performance and internal controls. The Select Agent Program has been the subject of investigations by agency Inspectors General, focusing on internal controls, processing applications, and regulatory compliance. Findings showed universities and laboratories were not fully compliant, leading to some entities withdrawing their select agent licenses. The USDA IG found that some commercial laboratories were not in full compliance with select agent regulations, leading to three entities withdrawing their licenses. The CDC suspended a select agent entity certificate at Texas A&M University in 2007 due to failure to report occupational exposures and allowing access to select agents without security risk assessments. Other companies, laboratories, and universities have also faced citations and fines for violations of select agent regulations. The HHS OIG has fined 12 organizations a total of $1,887,000 for not complying with Select Agent regulations. Scientists studying dangerous pathogens acknowledge the risks involved and have developed best practices to mitigate them since the 1970s and 1980s. The U.S. government began collecting best practices for handling dangerous pathogens in the 1970s and 1980s, issuing guidelines like Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL). The CDC and NIH established four biosafety levels (BSL-1 to BSL-4) to guide researchers in safe handling, with higher levels for more dangerous pathogens. Each level has specific protections in place. The Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL) guidelines define different biosafety levels (BSL-1 to BSL-4) with specific protections based on the pathogen's risk to human health. High-containment laboratories typically refer to BSL-3 and BSL-4 labs, which have additional protective measures. These guidelines were developed by the DOD, HHS, and USDA to protect laboratory workers from specific risks posed by different pathogens. The Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL) guidelines define biosafety levels based on specific risks posed by pathogens. Criteria for defining biosafety levels, best practices for safe laboratory operation, and identifying appropriate levels for organisms and procedures are outlined. Biosafety levels are linked to a combination of pathogen and experiment, with primary and secondary barriers to infection described. The most recent BMBL edition also includes standard and special laboratory practices for each level. The most recent edition of the BMBL includes security guidelines for different biosafety levels. Researchers and laboratory workers at institutions receiving federal funds must be trained in BMBL procedures before accessing the laboratory. The correct biosafety level depends on the pathogen, its transmission potential, treatment, and research activity. The Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL) provides guidelines for different biosafety levels based on the pathogen, transmission potential, treatment availability, and research activity. BSL-1 is for procedures unlikely to cause disease, BSL-2 for those with available treatment, BSL-3 for serious diseases from pathogen inhalation, and BSL-4 for high-risk aerosol-transmitted infections. The Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL) guidelines recommend handling potentially deadly pathogens at lower biosafety levels for certain experiments. For example, anthrax can be handled at BSL-2 for specific activities and at BSL-3 for others. The BMBL recommends handling anthrax at BSL-2 for certain activities and at BSL-3 for others. Some select agents require BSL-4 containment, while others may be studied at BSL-2 depending on circumstances. BSL-4 facilities also work on non-select agent pathogens. BSL-4 facilities in the United States work with select agents and are regulated under the Select Agent Program. BSL-3 facilities may also use select agents but are not always subject to select agent regulations. BSL-2 facilities have a small proportion that fall under the Select Agent Program, with compliance to BMBL guidelines being widely adopted. Compliance with guidelines, such as the BMBL, is important in various laboratories. Federal contracts and grants require adherence to these guidelines, with noncompliance risking loss of funding. Health and safety officials in different types of laboratories ensure proper operation of protective equipment. Health and safety officials in laboratories are responsible for verifying the operation of protective equipment to comply with guidelines. Laboratories under the Select Agent Program must consider BMBL guidelines for security plans and building design standards. Compliance with BMBL guidelines is required for federal facilities and those built with federal funds. Federal facilities, including those built with federal funds, adhere to design standards established by the agency funding construction. These standards, based on BMBL guidelines, cover ventilation, utilities, and access controls. Separate security requirements are outlined for high-containment laboratories, with NIH issuing checklists for compliance. The NIH issues checklists to ensure compliance with security requirements for high-containment laboratories. The process of certifying or commissioning a laboratory involves testing to meet standards before occupation. Other agencies follow similar procedures, contracting out the commissioning process to ensure adherence to biosafety guidelines. The commissioning of laboratories at specific biosafety levels must adhere to HHS guidelines outlined in the BMBL. Agencies often outsource this process, with NIH recommending certification by companies not involved in the facility's design or construction. Specialized individuals, such as licensed Professional Engineers, are required for technical oversight during the commissioning process. Individuals overseeing technical aspects of laboratory facilities should be licensed Professional Engineers with extensive experience in system design, optimization, and testing. Compliance with biosafety guidelines, such as those in the BMBL, is crucial for labs receiving federal funding to avoid funding withdrawal. If laboratories are found to be non-compliant with guidelines, federal funding could be withdrawn. Grantee organizations must be able to provide evidence of compliance with health and safety standards if requested. Federal research grants for recombinant DNA research typically require compliance with regulations. Federal research grants for recombinant DNA research often mandate the creation of an institutional biosafety committee (IBC) to oversee compliance with federal guidelines. The IBC has the authority to determine biosafety levels for research activities and can require specific precautions to be taken. Some suggest expanding the role of IBCs to oversee other research areas as well. The IBC has the authority to determine biosafety levels for research activities and can require specific precautions. Some propose expanding the role of IBCs to oversee research with biosafety concerns. The BMBL guidelines are incorporated into the Select Agent Program regulations, making compliance with the BMBL mandatory. Some experts argue that the IBC mechanism lacks sufficient oversight for these responsibilities. Entities possessing select agents must develop a security plan and biosafety plan in compliance with the BMBL guidelines, which are mandatory for the Select Agent Program. The number of BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratories has increased significantly in recent years, with a twelve-fold increase in planned or existing BSL-4 space in the United States since 2004. The number of BSL-4 laboratories in the United States has increased significantly in recent years, with a twelve-fold increase since 2004. This expansion is due to federal construction, increased funding for research activities, and a focus on public health and diagnostic capacity. The federal government is funding the construction of high-containment laboratories in various departments. The federal government has significantly increased investment in biocontainment laboratories across various departments, including Defense, Homeland Security, Health and Human Services, and Agriculture. These facilities are a mix of federally owned and operated, federally owned but privately operated, and privately owned and operated, creating both government and private infrastructure. The Department of Defense has maintained high-containment laboratories since World War II, which have been modernized over the years to support evolving research activities. The Department of Defense (DOD) has high-containment laboratories that have been modernized over the years for research activities. These labs were initially used for offensive and defensive biological research but now focus solely on defensive work, such as developing countermeasures and preventive clinical research. USAMRIID in Frederick, MD, is the primary location for these activities. The DOD has high-containment laboratories focused on defensive research, including infectious disease research, vaccine evaluation, and biological countermeasures. USAMRIID in Frederick, MD, is the main location for BSL-4 laboratory space, with a $683 million expansion underway to increase BSL-3 and BSL-4 capacity. Other DOD labs have also enhanced their BSL-3 capabilities since 2001. The DOD maintains BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratories for infectious disease research, vaccine evaluation, and bioforensic analysis. President Bush assigned bioforensic responsibility to DHS in 2004, leading to the establishment of the National Bioforensics Analysis Center. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was assigned bioforensic responsibility by President Bush in 2004, leading to the establishment of the National Bioforensics Analysis Center. The center, currently located at USAMRIID, is constructing permanent facilities in Frederick, MD, including a BSL-4 laboratory and BSL-3 laboratories for bioforensic and biological threat assessment activities. These facilities are expected to be fully operational by 2010. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred the Plum Island Animal Disease Center to DHS, which is now establishing the National Bio- and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF) to replace it. NBAF will be a BSL-4 laboratory focused on researching animal pathogens and developing countermeasures. It is expected to be fully operational by 2010. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is establishing the National Bio- and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF) to replace the Plum Island Animal Disease Center. NBAF will focus on researching animal pathogens and developing countermeasures, with a high level of biocontainment. The DHS has announced Kansas as the site for NBAF, expanding research capabilities for animal pathogens. The National Bio- and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF) is being established by the Department of Homeland Security to replace the Plum Island Animal Disease Center. It will focus on researching animal pathogens and developing countermeasures with high biocontainment levels. Additionally, the construction of two BSL-4 National Biocontainment Laboratories (NBLs) and thirteen BSL-3 Regional Biocontainment Laboratories (RBLs) is underway to support biodefense research and public health efforts during emergencies. The NBLs and RBLs are being built in Boston, MA, and Galveston, TX, respectively, through a grant-making process. The HHS has established the Laboratory Response Network (LRN) to coordinate laboratories for responding to bioterrorism and other public health emergencies. The LRN includes federal and state public health facilities and medical institutions primarily engaged in diagnostic testing. The LRN consists of federal and state public health facilities, medical institutions, and others primarily involved in diagnostic and public health testing, especially in emergencies. USDA is conducting research in the new NBAF and building new BSL-3 laboratories in Ames, IA, and Fort Collins, CO. Academic institutions are also investing in high-containment facilities. Academic institutions, such as the University of Minnesota, Purdue University, and Ohio State University, are investing in high-containment laboratory facilities to increase their ability to compete for federal funding and recruit new faculty. Private sector companies and non-profit organizations are also constructing additional BSL-3 laboratory space. Academic institutions like the University of Minnesota, Purdue University, and Ohio State University are investing in high-containment laboratory facilities to enhance their competitiveness for federal funding and faculty recruitment. Private sector companies and non-profit institutions also have high-containment laboratory facilities for medical testing, product development, and manufacturing goals. Some companies choose to build in-house facilities, while others contract with firms like Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute and Battelle Memorial. The expansion of high-containment laboratories has raised issues for policymakers, including determining appropriate capacity, increasing oversight, balancing desire for capacity with increased risk, international ramifications, and local concerns. After the 2001 anthrax mailings, policymakers realized the need for existing high-containment facilities. After the 2001 anthrax mailings, policymakers recognized the need for additional high-containment laboratory space due to the accompanying increase in risk and possible international ramifications. Congress and the administration decided to construct more high-containment laboratories, with the understanding that federal investment and support were necessary to cover the high capital and maintenance costs. It is crucial to avoid over-building capacity and fully utilize existing resources to make the most of these facilities. Decisions to build high-containment laboratories were made without a national needs assessment or coordinated plan, leading to concerns of excess capacity. Lack of information hinders coordinated planning. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases identified 277 domestic BSL-3 laboratories, but its survey had low response rates and methodological shortcomings. DHS and HHS estimated 630 BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratories, criticized by experts for relying heavily on registered select agent facilities. The number of BSL-3 laboratories in the US is uncertain, with varying estimates from different sources. The Government Accountability Office noted an increase in laboratories, but determining if construction has exceeded national needs is challenging. The number of BSL-3 laboratories in the US is uncertain, with varying estimates. A government-wide assessment involving multiple federal agencies may be needed to determine if ongoing construction exceeds national needs. Congress may need to decide on conducting a survey at the agency level or through an external coordinating body. Increased funding for research, operations, and management will be necessary to fully utilize additional capacity in high-containment facilities. Increased funding for research, operations, and management will be necessary to fully utilize additional capacity in high-containment facilities, which may be challenging for agencies undergoing a large increase in capacity. Interagency federal planning efforts may help alleviate overcapacity costs. Increased funding for research, operations, and management is needed to utilize additional capacity in high-containment facilities. Interagency federal planning efforts could reduce overcapacity costs, but require agreement among agencies on prioritization and shared facility use. Individual agency initiatives may struggle to address synergies or redundancies between agencies, while higher-level multi-agency strategies may not be prescriptive. Homeland security research and development activities lack coordination in utilizing agency laboratory assets, raising concerns about pathogen release and biological weapon proliferation. Congress should consider central coordination for high-containment laboratory use to address these issues. The potential for pathogen release and biological weapon proliferation from high-containment laboratories has raised concerns. Events like laboratory infections and improper shipping of select agents have led to calls for increased federal oversight. Some experts suggest expanding oversight beyond the current self-regulatory approach. Some experts suggest expanding regulations for high-containment laboratories to include mandatory biosafety training and broader biosecurity measures. Others propose enhancing self-regulatory approaches with increased training in best practices and greater worker engagement. The capacity expansion of high-containment laboratories is seen as both beneficial and risky. Increased high-containment laboratory capacity is a two-edged sword, allowing for greater diversity of biodefense research and more efficient public health sample testing. However, it also increases the potential for theft or accidental release of dangerous pathogens. Legislation has been passed to address concerns about the theft of pathogens and enhance physical security. The theft of dangerous pathogens has prompted enhancements to the Select Agent Program for better physical security of stored pathogens. Investigations have revealed security weaknesses at some facilities participating in the program, indicating a need for increased regulatory focus on compliance. The expansion of high-containment facilities poses challenges for agency resources in ensuring biosecurity. The expansion of high-containment laboratories poses challenges for agency resources in ensuring biosecurity, as each facility has an inherent associated risk that increases with the construction of additional facilities. The magnitude of this incremental risk is difficult to measure and may vary depending on compliance with best practices and regulations. The expansion of high-containment laboratories poses challenges for agency resources in ensuring biosecurity. The incremental risk associated with each facility's construction is difficult to measure and may vary depending on compliance with best practices and regulations. Policymakers may perform a cost/benefit analysis to estimate the potential benefits of research in high-containment laboratories and the costs of an infectious release. The potential costs of an infectious release from high-containment laboratories include the loss of infected animals or infection of laboratory workers. Federal policymakers may overlook subtle effects like the development of a national sampling laboratory network and the proliferation of high-containment laboratory techniques, leading to policy decisions driven by high-profile incidents rather than actual risk assessment. The expansion of high-containment laboratories raises concerns about personnel surety and the \"insider threat.\" More trained technicians and scientists are needed, increasing the risk of malicious intent. Some experts believe high-containment skills are not necessary for a bioterrorist attack, while others disagree. The DOJ asserts that the perpetrator of the 2001 anthrax attack may be overlooked by federal policymakers, leading to policy decisions driven by high-profile incidents rather than actual risk assessment. The increase in high-containment laboratory capacity may have international ramifications, as some countries may perceive it as excessive for biodefense and health research, potentially leading to suspicions of offensive biological weapons development by the United States. The United States' expansion of high-containment laboratory capacity may be perceived as excessive for biodefense and health research, potentially leading to suspicions of offensive biological weapons development. This perception could harm U.S. efforts to promote adherence to the Biological Weapons Convention and may spur other countries to build similar facilities, increasing the risk of international proliferation of high-containment techniques for malevolent purposes. Differences in biosafety regulations among countries could impact business decisions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. The location of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in different countries may be influenced by variations in biosafety regulations. This could impact national capabilities to respond to bioterrorism or disease outbreaks, as countries relying on foreign production of treatments may face restricted access to countermeasures. Countries with varying biosecurity regulations may limit international collaborations among U.S. scientists, impacting the scientific process. This could lead to hoarding of domestically produced disease countermeasures during outbreaks or bioterrorist attacks. The presence of biosecurity regulations may hinder international collaborations in scientific research, potentially leading to industry investment in countries with lower barriers. U.S. biosecurity standards could influence international partners to adopt similar policies. The construction of high-containment laboratories in the United States has been met with varying degrees of response. The construction of high-containment laboratories in the United States has faced local resistance, with some groups supporting the economic benefits while others oppose it due to public health and security concerns. Some groups oppose new laboratories due to public health and security concerns, questioning economic benefits and job availability for local workforce. Policymakers have options to address these issues, including deferring action until expert panel reports are complete. Several expert panels are currently examining issues related to oversight of facilities, pathogens, and personnel. Congress could defer additional action until their reports are complete or decide to increase oversight efforts to balance security controls with research productivity. One scientist highlighted the potential trade-offs between additional oversight and scientific progress in reducing the threat of terrorists acquiring deadly pathogens. The scientific community supports measures to reduce the threat of terrorists acquiring deadly pathogens, but there is strong opposition to measures that hinder research progress. Policymakers may find current oversight of high-containment laboratories sufficient, with some supporting no additional action. Supporters of the status quo argue that securing these labs in the US provides increased security without added burdens on scientific progress. Supporters of the status quo argue that focusing on identifying potential bioterrorists and disrupting their activities may be more effective than implementing additional regulatory frameworks for high-containment laboratories in the United States. Additional resources dedicated to intelligence gathering on bioterror groups could lead to disrupting their activities at a lower cost. The Bush Administration established expert groups to address biosafety and biosecurity issues since 2005, including the Working Group on Strengthening the Biosecurity of the United States and the National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity. Congress may defer action on regulatory oversight until a fuller understanding of policy options is obtained. President Bush created the Working Group on Strengthening the Biosecurity of the United States on January 9, 2009, through Executive Order. Congress could choose to wait for recommendations from expert groups before taking regulatory action on biosafety and biosecurity oversight. President Bush established the Working Group on Strengthening the Biosecurity of the United States in 2009 through an Executive Order. The group, co-chaired by the Secretaries of Defense and Health and Human Services, includes various government officials tasked with reviewing and evaluating security measures. The Trans-Federal Task Force on Optimizing Biosafety and Biocontainment Oversight was formed in December 2007 to review and evaluate existing laws and practices related to biosafety and biosecurity. Recommendations to the President are due in July 2009. The Trans-Federal Task Force on Optimizing Biosafety and Biocontainment Oversight, co-chaired by HHS and USDA, includes staff from various government agencies. Recommendations will be presented to HHS and USDA leadership. The National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity has non-governmental voting and non-voting members. The National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity, with members from 15 federal agencies, is developing policies for dual-use research. They are working on oversight frameworks, a code of conduct, and biosafety training programs for researchers. Multiple working groups are analyzing and publishing recommendations regularly. The GAO is expected to release a report in 2009 addressing these efforts. The National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity is developing policies for dual-use research and oversight frameworks. The GAO is expected to release a report in 2009 on high-containment laboratory issues with potential recommendations for legislative and executive action. Congress may benefit from waiting for these recommendations to avoid duplication and generate new policy ideas. Efforts to address high-containment laboratory issues may not wait for executive branch or GAO reports. Policy options to facilitate this approach include the need for a comprehensive inventory of existing capacity. Previous attempts to determine the number and capacity of such laboratories have been unsuccessful. Multiple sources have called for a more robust and reliable determination. Efforts are being made to address high-containment laboratory issues, with calls for a comprehensive inventory of existing capacity from various sources. Identifying non-federal high-containment laboratories in different locations and sectors poses challenges, and a voluntary self-reporting mechanism may not be sufficient. A survey would provide a snapshot of the actual high-containment facilities. Efforts to address high-containment laboratory issues include calls for a comprehensive inventory of existing capacity. A voluntary self-reporting mechanism may not be enough to identify all facilities and their capacity. Concerns about competitiveness and reporting burden could hinder obtaining a complete inventory. Incentivizing self-reporting or mandating registration with the federal government are potential solutions to increase participation. Congressional policymakers could mandate that all high-containment laboratories register with the federal government to create a comprehensive list of facilities. This registry would provide information on laboratory capacity, use, distribution, and availability. Registration was a component of the early Select Agent Program implementation. It may be required even without additional security measures. The Select Agent Program may require registration of high-containment laboratories, even without additional security measures. One option is to limit the survey to federal facilities, allowing agencies to report their facilities and capacity to Congress. This could help policymakers efficiently plan for capacity use and expansion. The government can efficiently plan for high-containment laboratory capacity by conducting a government-wide needs assessment. This assessment can help determine if federal capacity exceeds the actual need, avoiding overexpansion and resource allocation costs. Congress should consider the economic costs of surveying high-containment laboratories to make an informed decision. Congress may need to consider the economic costs of surveying high-containment laboratories under different reporting frameworks and assess the quality and utility of the acquired information. Comparing the survey with a needs assessment, currently lacking in federal agencies, could maximize its benefits. Some policymakers suggest a moratorium on new federally funded high-containment laboratory construction. Some policymakers have called for a moratorium on new federally funded construction of high-containment laboratories to avoid over-building and redundant operations among agencies. Some policymakers have raised concerns about over-building and redundancy in high-containment laboratory construction, suggesting that incremental increases in capacity may be more effective than building new facilities. Agencies argue that existing infrastructure is outdated and insufficient. Some agencies defend high-containment laboratory construction by stating they assess interagency needs case by case and existing infrastructure is outdated. However, without a government-wide assessment, synergies and available infrastructure in other agencies may be overlooked. A construction moratorium could impact the federal government's ability to meet national goals. Enacting a construction moratorium could hinder the federal government's ability to achieve national goals, such as establishing a permanent bioforensics capability and expanding high-containment laboratory facilities. Delays in construction may impede planned research activities and capabilities deemed necessary by advisory panels. Some analysts suggest federal licensing and certification for all high-containment laboratories to ensure compliance with security regulations. Options include directly regulating these labs or expanding the Select Agent Program. One approach to licensing high-containment laboratories could be applying the Select Agent Program requirements universally or establishing a separate licensing program with tailored requirements. This would ensure a uniform security level across all labs, regardless of the pathogens they work with. Licensing and certifying high-containment laboratories may not cover all labs of concern, as select agents can be handled outside these facilities. A more comprehensive approach would involve overseeing all labs capable of BSL-2. A more comprehensive approach to overseeing laboratories capable of BSL-2 or higher containment is proposed, which would capture all locations with sufficient biosecurity for select agent use. However, this approach would lead to overseeing a significantly increased number of facilities, including public health, diagnostic, hospital, industrial, and academic laboratories. Expanding the Select Agent Program to include more dangerous pathogens like SARS, dengue fever, western equine encephalitis, and yellow fever has been suggested to address gaps in regulation. These diseases and their causative agents have the potential to be used as biological weapons. Some scientists are concerned about expanding the select agent list to include more pathogens like SARS, dengue fever, western equine encephalitis, and yellow fever. They argue that the current definition of select agents may hinder research by not accurately differentiating between pathogens of concern and similar non-concerning pathogens. The NIH has requested the National Academies to determine scientific advances necessary to identify select agents based on features beyond taxonomy. Focusing on the Select Agent list would only impact entities using pathogens of concern, limiting disruption to scientific development and public health activities. The government may expand background checks to personnel in BSL-3 and BSL-4 facilities to focus regulatory efforts on high-risk laboratories. These checks are similar to those for access to classified information or positions of public trust. Efforts to enhance personnel oversight at high-containment facilities may face challenges, such as resistance to government documentation and certification of laboratory researchers. Efforts to enhance personnel oversight at high-containment facilities may face challenges, such as resistance to government documentation and certification of laboratory researchers. Some scientists may prefer to leave research fields requiring high-containment labs rather than undergo the necessary government clearance. The Department of Defense has extensive personnel oversight programs, but the DOJ noted a DOD scientist was involved in the 2001 anthrax mailings despite this oversight. The Select Agent Program mandates worker training. The DOJ has highlighted a DOD scientist's involvement in the 2001 anthrax mailings despite increased oversight. The Select Agent Program requires worker training tailored to individual needs and work risks. Developing training standards could ensure core competencies are met. Some experts suggest expanding biosafety training programs to meet current demand, which could range from voluntary local training to mandatory federal certification. The effects of such training may reduce laboratory-acquired infections, although the rate of these infections is lower than other injuries. Enhanced biosafety training could lower laboratory-acquired infections, but may not address biosecurity weaknesses. Including considerations for dual-use pathogens in high-containment labs could improve biosecurity awareness among workers. Lessons from incidents in high-containment labs can inform future practices. Lessons from incidents in high-containment labs can inform future practices, but reporting mechanisms may be hindered by potential penalties and concerns about reputation. Enhancing the reporting system for incidents in high-containment labs could help establish a database of accidents and their remedies, potentially preventing future occurrences. Enhancing incident reporting in high-containment labs could lead to a database that warns scientists of potential accidents, with recommendations to minimize penalties for reporting to encourage participation. Congress must consider balancing negligence accountability with existing penalties in the Select Agent Program. When crafting incident reporting programs in high-containment labs, policymakers must balance increasing oversight with regulatory burden. Resistance from scientists and stakeholders is expected with approaches that enhance federal oversight. The benefits of increased oversight include reducing opportunities for misuse of biological weapons within the Select Agent Program. The expansion of the Select Agent Program may create barriers to public health response and international collaboration, critics argue. Timely transfer of materials between high-containment labs is crucial for responding to emerging diseases like SARS and avian influenza. Increasing the program's scope could hinder this process. Increasing the scope of the Select Agent Program may hinder international collaboration on regulated pathogens due to differing security regimes in foreign countries, impacting public health response. Scientists not involved in biodefense activities could be significantly affected by licensing and certification requirements. The impact of a licensing and certification regime on regulated entities could be significant, affecting scientists not involved in biodefense activities and increasing costs for public health laboratories and hospitals. An increase in regulated facilities would require more federal resources for registration, inspections, and oversight. The identification of the most appropriate oversight agency is a key issue. The identification of the most appropriate oversight agency for biosafety and biosecurity programs is a key issue. Historically, USDA and HHS were deemed suitable regulators due to their technical knowledge and relationship with the scientific community. However, with increasing homeland security concerns, policymakers may consider DHS as a more appropriate agency. With increasing homeland security concerns, policymakers may consider DHS as a more appropriate agency for oversight of biosafety and biosecurity programs. If policymakers choose to develop new authorities, a mixture of oversight authority might occur, with one agency regulating for security under the Select Agent Program and another regulating high-containment laboratories. Harmonizing new requirements with existing ones is crucial. The oversight of high-containment laboratories may be under a new authority, potentially consolidating oversight responsibilities. Limited federal resources have been used for biosafety practices, but expanding the scope may require more resources. Additional funding and staffing may be necessary for agencies to meet new mandates. The 111th Congress is considering legislation to address issues related to the Select Agent Program and the expansion of high-containment laboratory capacity. Bills such as H.R. 1225 and S. 485 aim to extend the authorization of the Select Agent Program and expand criteria for determining select agents. The National Academy of Sciences would review the program and recommend improvements. Additional funding and staffing may be needed for agencies to oversee new mandates. The bills under consideration by the 111th Congress aim to improve the Select Agent Program by requiring reviews and recommendations from the National Academy of Sciences. They also mandate the development of biosafety and biosecurity training for access to select agents, as well as guidance on monitoring and inventory procedures. Additionally, the HHS Secretary, in consultation with the USDA Secretary, would evaluate current and planned capacity for sharing lessons learned in biodefense. The Laboratory Surge Capacity Preparedness Act (H.R. 1150) directs the USDA Secretary to evaluate current and planned laboratory capacity, share lessons learned across biodefense and infectious disease communities, improve guidance on laboratory infrastructure, and establish a Biological Laboratory Incident Reporting System. The Laboratory Surge Capacity Preparedness Act (H.R. 1150) would authorize DHS to award grants to Regional Biocontainment Laboratories for operation and maintenance. The bill also requires a report detailing the integration of the RBL network and the need for additional BSL-3 laboratory surge capacity in response to biodefense or infectious disease emergencies. Biocontainment technologies are globally dispersed and utilized by scientists. Biocontainment technologies are widely dispersed globally and used by scientists in many countries. The threat of high-containment laboratories being the source of bioterror weapons requires international harmonization. Congressional policymakers face the challenge of defining enhanced oversight goals for these laboratories. Focusing on a registry of existing high-containment laboratory capacity may be key. Focusing on a registry of existing high-containment laboratory capacity may have benefits for planning and coordination but limited security benefits. A rigorous oversight program may provide security benefits but at the cost of regulatory burden and impeded scientific progress. Policymakers must weigh potential policy options carefully. The impeded scientific progress in countermeasure research, bioforensics, and public health poses complex policy issues for policymakers to address, reconciling competing national needs."
