The Act, titled the \"Environmental Improvement Timber Contract Extension Act,\" defines key terms such as \"board feet,\" \"contract,\" \"contracting officer,\" and \"mid-market criteria\" related to a timber sale contract between the United States and the Ketchikan Pulp Company in the Tongass National Forest. The Act ensures timber operators have a profit and risk margin of at least 60% in a mid-market situation based on recent market data. Proportionality refers to the ratio of high volume stands to low volume stands. The term \"purchaser\" refers to the Ketchikan Pulp Company. Congress finds that on July 26, 1951, the Forest Service acted on behalf of the United States. The Forest Service and the purchaser entered into a contract in 1951 to harvest timber from the Tongass National Forest in Alaska. The contract aimed to provide adequate timber for the purchaser's facilities on a long-term basis. This legislation is needed to fulfill that intention. A pulp mill or similar facility is needed in southeast Alaska to create year-round, high-paying jobs, utilize low-grade wood efficiently, and stabilize the regional economy. The purchaser plans to improve the mill environmentally and operationally. The purchaser plans to invest $200,000,000 in environmental improvements at the pulp mill, with $25,000,000 already invested. A 15-year contract extension is needed for project amortization. Ketchikan, the fourth largest city in Alaska, heavily relies on the mill for its economy and jobs. The purchaser aims to continue a long-term commitment to Ketchikan and southeast Alaska by maintaining a stable Alaskan workforce and utilizing local contractors, vendors, and suppliers. The purchaser aims to maintain a stable Alaskan workforce by allowing businesses to hire Alaskan employees, participating in land management planning, and adhering to principles of multiple-use and sustained yield of forest resources. The purchaser in southeast Alaska aims to protect and promote various forest uses, comply with environmental laws, and explore new technologies to maximize timber use and product value. The national interest is served by a policy that ensures proper stewardship of publicly owned assets in the Tongass National Forest, fair return for public timber, and a balance among multiple use interests to enhance forest health and economic growth in southeast Alaska and the United States. The contract is modified to extend the term by 15 years from June 30, 2004 and includes a plan for timber volume, location, and schedule for the purchaser. The contract is modified to extend the term by 15 years from June 30, 2004, with a plan for timber volume, location, and schedule coordinated with the Tongass Land Management Plan. Volume requirements are provided in 5-year increments of 962,500,000 board feet for the purchaser to harvest in an orderly manner. The Forest Service must provide the purchaser with 192,500,000 board feet of timber annually until March 1, 1999, and maintain a sufficient timber supply for harvesting. The contracting officer must allow the purchaser to construct roads in advance of the 5-year timber increment to ensure orderly harvest. The contracting officer must appraise timber using national forest procedures and set rates for timber increments. Rates must meet mid-market criteria and roads can be constructed in advance of the 5-year operating period. The Forest Service sets timber sale procedures and rates for timber increments to ensure fair competition in the Pacific Northwest. Proportionality is measured based on contiguous management areas and acres. The Forest Service sets timber sale procedures and rates for timber increments in the Pacific Northwest based on contiguous management areas and acres. The purchaser has the option to convert or replace their pulp mill with a facility producing other value-added products using pulp logs. The unilateral termination clause in the contract is removed, and any further modifications to the contract can only be made as specified.
