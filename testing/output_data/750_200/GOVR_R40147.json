    "content": "The environmental impacts of human activity, including pollution, habitat destruction, and greenhouse gas emissions, have raised concerns. Buildings, such as residential, commercial, and government structures, are a significant part of the nation's infrastructure and are increasingly scrutinized for their environmental effects. Buildings, including residential, commercial, government, schools, and hospitals, are a major component of the nation's infrastructure. Their construction, operation, and demolition have significant environmental impacts, consuming resources like electricity, water, and construction materials while generating waste throughout their lifecycle. Buildings have significant environmental impacts due to their supply chains, manufacturing processes, and waste streams. They account for 40% of energy consumption in the US, produce 40% of greenhouse gas emissions, and cost consumers over $430 billion annually in energy bills. Additionally, buildings' locations and interactions with the environment affect ecological and human health impacts, particularly in stormwater management. Buildings' locations and interactions with the environment influence stormwater management and associated health and environmental impacts. Proximity to public transportation affects energy required for commuting. Building features impact indoor air quality, affecting occupant health and productivity. Green building addresses indoor air quality issues in buildings, aiming to reduce pollutants that can lead to \"sick building syndrome.\" It transforms the design, construction, operation, and demolition of buildings, gaining significant interest since the 1990s. Green building has gained substantial interest since the 1990s, evolving into a respected approach to building with various stakeholders involved. This report discusses the concept of green building, federal policies, programs, and associated issues. The concept of green building, federal policies, programs, and associated issues are discussed. Green building emerged in the 1990s and addresses environmental impacts. Major statutory and executive authorities and federal agency programs are involved in promoting environmentally sensitive building practices. The modern practice of green building emerged in the 1990s with the formation of organizations like the Committee on the Environment and the U.S. Green Building Council. The concept has expanded to encompass environmentally conscious design principles and strategies for reducing environmental impact. The concept of green building has evolved to include environmentally conscious design principles and strategies to reduce the harmful impacts of the built environment. There is no single definition, with efforts existing along a design and performance continuum. Some practices are indistinguishable from standard building, while others aim to greatly reduce environmental impacts. Practices that use the term \"green\" purely for marketing purposes are sometimes referred to as \"greenwashing.\" Some practitioners aim to provide buildings with greatly reduced environmental impacts, such as zero-impact and minus-impact buildings. Green building is an integrated approach that significantly reduces the environmental footprint of buildings. Green building is an integrated approach that significantly reduces the environmental footprint of buildings by considering multiple factors, not limited to just energy consumption. It is a relative concept, with green buildings being greener than average and can be applied to any class of building. The green building approach involves integration across multiple factors and can be applied to any type of building. Green builders aim to improve environmental performance through various techniques, such as using energy-efficient systems and designing features to influence occupant behavior. Decision-making on which techniques to use is typically done during the design and planning stages. Green building techniques are often decided during the design phase and can impact a building's environmental footprint. The term green building is used interchangeably with sustainable building, although they may not be exactly synonymous. Sustainable building is sometimes considered a form of green building. Sustainable building, also known as green building, aims to maintain small environmental footprints to support future human activity and ecosystem functioning. High-performance building, another term used interchangeably with green building, includes factors like security in addition to environmental considerations. Federal statutory definitions emphasize the integration and optimization of all major high-performance building attributes. High-performance buildings integrate and optimize various attributes such as energy efficiency, durability, occupant productivity, safety, security, accessibility, cost-benefit, sustainability, and functionality. Additional objectives like aesthetics and historical preservation may also be considered in their design. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 refined the concept of high-performance green buildings by establishing a detailed definition. Green building focuses on elements like energy, water, materials, waste, health, and siting with respect to transportation, ecology, and smart considerations. High-performance green buildings focus on elements like energy, water, materials, waste, health, siting with respect to transportation, ecology, and smart growth. Siting has gained prominence in recent years, considering the built environment beyond the building itself. Objectives for high-performance buildings may also include serviceability, productivity, functionality, disaster resilience, and climate resilience. The objectives for high-performance buildings include disaster and climate resilience, which have become more important due to natural disasters like Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy, and the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear meltdown. Green building projects may prioritize different elements based on stakeholders' needs and local factors such as climate zone and flood risk. Green building projects prioritize different elements based on stakeholders' needs and local factors like climate zone and flood risk. A reduced energy footprint is a key focus, achieved through energy efficiency, conservation, and the use of alternative energy sources like solar or geothermal power. Energy storage technologies are also utilized in combination with on-site renewable energy. The importance of energy efficiency in buildings is highlighted through the use of alternative, renewable sources like solar or geothermal power, energy storage technologies, and participation in smart-grid innovations. Energy savings potential is higher for buildings compared to transportation and industry, as stated in reports by the National Academies and the Department of Energy. In a 2015 report, the Department of Energy estimated that buildings using the best energy efficiency technologies would consume about half as much energy as current buildings. Federal law mandates energy use reductions in federal buildings, with a 22% decline in energy intensity from 2003 to 2015. Despite this, 2015 consumption exceeded the federal goal, highlighting the misconception that energy is the sole focus of green building. While energy is important in green building, it should not be the sole focus. Water management in buildings can also provide cost savings and aid in the conservation of water resources, especially in arid areas. This can be achieved through measures like reduced-flow plumbing fixtures and recycling of wastewater. Water management in buildings involves reductions through measures like reduced-flow plumbing fixtures, wastewater recycling, and landscaping to reduce irrigation needs. It also includes managing rain, on-site water, and run-off. Low-impact development aims to mimic natural water handling processes through techniques like using porous materials, green roofs, and holding ponds. Water management in buildings includes reducing impervious surfaces through landscaping, porous materials, and green roofs, as well as using holding ponds, swales, rain gardens, and similar measures. These techniques, collectively known as green infrastructure, help manage water effectively. The choice and use of materials in construction and operations significantly impact a building's environmental footprint, affecting resource depletion, pollution, embodied energy, and health. Opting for environmentally preferable or green-labelled products with recycled content can reduce the environmental impact. Environmentally preferable or green-labelled products can reduce the impact of resource depletion, pollution, embodied energy, and health risks. These materials may have recycled content, be made from renewable resources, or use processes with low energy and pollutant levels. There is debate on what defines environmentally preferable materials due to inconsistent vocabulary and measurement methodologies. The lack of consistent vocabulary and measurement methodologies in describing sustainability attributes of materials can make it challenging to determine their preference. Waste reduction efforts in building projects can include source reduction, reuse, recycling, and waste-to-energy to mitigate environmental impacts. Efficient material use and recycling can help reduce waste from standard demolition and construction processes. Efficient material use and recycling in building projects can reduce waste from demolition and construction processes. Landscaping can also play a role in waste reduction by recycling lawn clippings through mulching and composting. High-efficiency boilers and furnaces can decrease atmospheric pollutants. Operational solid waste like paper and food can be recycled to lessen environmental impact. Various factors can affect the health impacts of buildings, including indoor air pollutants like mold and radon. The health impacts of buildings are influenced by various factors, with indoor air quality (IAQ) being a significant concern. Maintaining high IAQ involves adequate ventilation, air filtration, and using materials free of toxic substances. Overall indoor environmental quality (IEQ) includes factors like lighting, climate control, acoustics, and ergonomic design. The indoor environmental quality (IEQ) of a building is influenced by factors such as lighting, climate control, acoustics, and ergonomic design. Site selection and building orientation can also impact the environmental footprint and ecological sensitivity of the area. The ecological sensitivity of potential building sites is crucial to minimize adverse impacts on ecological services and native species. Factors like building orientation, proximity to trees, and climate-related risks should be considered in siting decisions, especially in coastal areas. Productivity and utility are essential considerations for a building's worth, regardless of its environmental footprint. Green building's importance lies in its utility and productivity for occupants, with studies showing that Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) affects worker comfort and productivity. While green buildings can enhance productivity, trade-offs between serviceability and other elements like acoustic performance may occur. Resistance to hazards such as earthquakes, hurricanes, flooding, subsidence, and forest fires can increase a building's useful life and allow it to function during service disruptions. Practices for resilience include resistant construction. Approaches to resilience in building design include resistant construction, locating critical components away from flood waters, on-site power generation, rainwater harvesting, and water recycling. Climate-resilient design focuses on preparing for severe weather events and climate change to ensure assets can withstand disruptions. Green building focuses on integration across elements and stages to improve performance and minimize environmental impacts throughout the building's lifecycle. This approach allows for better assessment of environmental impact, balance among competing goals, and explicit examination of the whole building design. The integration of different elements in green building allows for a comprehensive assessment of environmental impact and balance among goals. Information technology can enhance performance, but focusing on one element at the expense of others can be counterproductive. Energy efficiency in green building can be improved by sealing the building envelope to prevent air escape, but this can lead to increased pollutants and moisture issues. Balancing energy efficiency and health may require compromises or technologies like active ventilation. A green building approach forces an examination of how actions impact each element to achieve overall optimization. A focus on optimizing green building practices by considering how actions affect different elements, even if only one factor can be addressed in some cases. Prioritizing certain elements over others may be necessary due to constraints or priorities. Focusing on only one stage of a building's life cycle can lead to savings in that stage but losses in others. Inadequate data on environmental impacts of alternative building materials can lead to misleading choices. Concrete walls offer better insulation than wood but have higher carbon dioxide emissions. Energy usage during building operation surpasses construction, requiring a balance between the two stages. Green building practices help assess impacts across all stages for better sustainability. A green building approach can reduce problems by assessing the impact of actions on all stages. Elements like environmentally preferable products can affect occupant health and productivity. On-site renewable energy generation prepares buildings for power outages. Stormwater management supports ecological services. Formal systems set criteria for green and sustainable buildings. In the building sector, formal systems and tools have been developed to assess whether construction projects meet green and sustainable criteria. These tools include rating systems, certifications, standards, and codes, but determining a building's sustainability is complex with no simple metric. Professional organizations in the 1990s developed rating and certification systems to address this issue. Rating and certification systems were developed in the 1990s by professional organizations in the building sector to standardize and define green building practices. These systems, such as LEED, assign points to buildings for meeting green design criteria, resulting in an overall score. Rating systems assign points to buildings for meeting green design criteria, resulting in an overall score and certification validates that a building meets specified design or performance requirements. Independent third parties conduct assessments and award certifications to ensure objectivity. LEED, developed by the USGBC in 1998, is a widely recognized green building certification system in the US. Over 37,300 commercial buildings have been LEED certified as of April 2017. The number of LEED certifications has increased annually since 2000, with over 37,300 commercial buildings certified worldwide as of April 2017. USGBC offers certifications for various building categories and focuses on six green building elements. LEED certification involves the design, construction, and maintenance of buildings with a five-year recertification cycle. It focuses on six green building elements and includes credit categories for innovation and regional priority. Buildings must meet mandatory requirements and earn a designated number of points to be certified. The LEED rating system involves meeting basic requirements and earning points for certification levels: Certified, Silver, Gold, or Platinum. It allows for simple compliance assessment and integrated consideration of green building elements. LEED v4, released in 2013, is the most recent version. Other certification systems in the US include The Building Research Establishment. The LEED v4 rating system, released in 2013, is the most recent version. Other certification systems in the US include the BREEAM In-Use system, which is an online rating system for existing commercial building performance with no prerequisites. BREEAM In-Use is an online rating system for existing buildings with no prerequisites. Ratings range from Acceptable to Outstanding, based on performance in nine impact categories. Certifications must be renewed annually. Green Globes, based on BREEAM, awards between one and four Globes. Green Globes, a rating system by the Green Building Initiative, is based on BREEAM and awards between one and four Globes based on points earned across six elements. Certification is solely based on points earned with no mandatory provisions. The International Living Future Institute's Living Building Challenge offers three certifications: Living Building Certification, Petal Certification, and Zero Energy Building Certification. Criteria for certification fall into seven performance areas, referred to as \"Petals\": place, water, energy, health and happiness, materials, equity, and beauty. Living Building Certification requires compliance in all seven areas, Petal Certification requires compliance in at least three areas including water, energy, or materials, and Zero Energy Certification requires a building to generate all its energy needs on site. The Living Building Challenge offers three certifications: Living Building Certification, Petal Certification, and Zero Energy Building Certification. Petal Certification requires compliance with at least three of the seven Petals, including water, energy, or materials. Zero Energy Certification entails generating all energy needs on site without combustion. Certification under the Living Building Challenge also involves a 12-month assessment of building performance. Different green building ratings systems emphasize various aspects, with suitability depending on local conditions and priorities. Some additional green certification programs focus on specific elements like energy efficiency (Energy Star), indoor air quality (Indoor airPLUS), water efficiency (WaterSense), and overall environmental performance (Zero Energy Ready Home, Passive House/ PHIUS+). These programs complement comprehensive green certification systems that cover a range of sustainability criteria for buildings. Several federal statutes and policies impose green building requirements on federal offices and agencies, with some agencies using third-party green building certification systems since the late 1990s. The General Services Administration (GSA) recommends that agencies use third-party green certification systems, such as Energy Star, Indoor airPLUS, WaterSense, Zero Energy Ready Home, and Passive House/ PHIUS+. The General Services Administration (GSA) recommends federal agencies use third-party green certification systems to simplify compliance with federal guidelines, reduce the need for additional staff, and communicate sustainability efforts. Some agencies have established internal policies on certification under available rating systems. EISA required the Secretary of Energy, in consultation with GSA and the Department of Defense (DOD), to identify a third-party certification system. The EISA required the Secretary of Energy, in consultation with GSA and the Department of Defense, to identify a third-party certification system for green buildings. GSA recommended the use of either LEED or Green Globes for federal agencies. The EISA required the Secretary of Energy, in consultation with GSA and the Department of Defense, to identify a third-party certification system for green buildings. GSA recommended federal agencies use LEED or Green Globes, with specific rating requirements for new construction and major renovation projects. The 2014 Department of Energy rulemaking established minimum criteria for green building certification systems eligible for federal agency use. Green building certification systems are required by federal agencies, states, and local jurisdictions for government and commercial buildings. Some jurisdictions offer incentives for obtaining green building certifications. These systems have influenced building codes and standards, with certification being voluntary compared to mandatory building codes. Building codes are mandatory regulations that specify minimum requirements for building design and construction. They cover various aspects of a building's design and construction, including health, safety, aesthetics, and other elements. Green building codes and standards address multiple green building elements, but do not focus solely on energy efficiency. These codes and standards have influenced by green building certification systems, which are voluntary compared to mandatory building codes. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 set a baseline for energy efficiency in building codes, with state and local governments determining additional requirements. Many jurisdictions adopt national model codes for building regulations. Green building codes go beyond minimum requirements and cover various aspects of building design and construction. Green building codes, also known as \"beyond-code\" or \"above-code\" options, exceed minimum building code requirements and specify additional environmental design and performance standards. Governments can choose to make these codes mandatory or voluntary for meeting green building objectives. Voluntary measures for meeting green building objectives often incorporate technical standards created by recognized standards development organizations. These organizations may develop more general green building standards, and buildings meeting these standards can be certified as having met the criteria. Green building standards may be achieved through various pathways, including prescriptive, performance, and outcome-based requirements. These standards are often described as code-intended and aim to certify buildings that meet specific criteria. Green building standards are written in mandatory, code-enforceable language and may be adopted by jurisdictions with modifications. Standards are developed through a consensus process involving multiple stakeholders and require accreditation by bodies like ANSI. Certification must be performed by a third party. The International Code Council (ICC) and ASHRAE are the main developers of national green building model codes and standards in the United States. The ICC is responsible for the widely used International Building Code (IBC) and released the International Green Construction Code (IgCC) in 2012, the first model code to include sustainability measures for entire buildings. The International Green Construction Code (IgCC) was released in 2012 by the ICC, functioning as an overlay code compatible with other ICC codes. Municipalities can adopt the IgCC to make sustainability measures more or less strict based on local factors. The most recent revision was in 2015. The IgCC offers various compliance pathways and options to adjust requirements based on local factors. It covers most building types except low-rise residential buildings, which are referred to the ICC 700 National Green Building Standard (NGBS). The NGBS, developed in partnership with ASHRAE and NAHB, is structured as a rating system and can be adopted by ordinance. ASHRAE, USGBC, and IES have jointly released a high-performance green building standard. Standard 189.1, developed by ASHRAE, USGBC, and IES, serves as a high-performance green building standard for nonresidential and residential buildings over three stories. It includes requirements for site sustainability, energy efficiency, water-use efficiency, indoor environmental quality, and building impacts on the atmosphere, materials, and resources. Elements of Standard 189.1 have been integrated into Department of Defense building requirements. In 2015, the ICC and ASHRAE partnered to integrate Standard 189.1 into the 2018 version of the IgCC, aligning it with the LEED rating system. State, local, and tribal authorities have also developed their own green building codes, while federal laws and policies include provisions for green building. Several federal laws, executive orders, and policy instruments have provisions related to green building. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 requires agencies to procure products with recycled content. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 contained incentives and requirements for green building efforts. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT 1992) and the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT 2005) included incentives and requirements for energy and water efficiency in federal, commercial, and residential buildings, as well as for appliances, plumbing fixtures, and building materials. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT 2005) mandated energy and water conservation programs for congressional buildings, reduced energy consumption in federal buildings by 20% by 2015, promoted energy-efficient products procurement, set energy consumption targets for new federal buildings, and required sustainable-design principles for new and replacement federal buildings. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 mandated energy and water conservation programs for federal buildings, set a consumption target of 30% below existing standards for new federal buildings, required sustainable-design principles, and authorized funding for state energy conservation plans and energy-efficient appliances.

It promotes energy-efficient equipment and lighting, Energy Star labels for leased buildings, and energy efficiency at executive branch agencies, utilities, and state/local governments. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 allocated funds for green retrofits of housing, energy-efficiency improvements to GSA facilities, and green renovations of public schools. The Energy Efficiency Improvement Act of 2015 (P.L. 114-11) directs GSA to develop model leasing provisions for energy and water efficiency in commercial buildings, including federal agencies, state, and local governments. It also amended EISA to improve energy efficiency in tenant spaces. The Energy Efficiency Improvement Act of 2015 amended EISA to include provisions for improving energy efficiency in tenant spaces, such as studying energy efficiency in commercial buildings, collecting occupant energy-use information, and developing a Tenant Star recognition label. It also addressed energy conservation standards for grid-enabled water heaters. The Energy Efficiency Improvement Act of 2015 amended EISA to include provisions for improving energy efficiency in tenant spaces and developing a Tenant Star recognition label. President Obama signed Executive Order 13693 in 2015 for federal sustainability planning. President Obama signed Executive Order 13693 in 2015, replacing previous orders to establish green building as a key component of federal efforts to reduce environmental impacts and improve resource use efficiency at federal facilities. The order set new targets for federal agencies to achieve by FY2025, including reducing building energy intensity by 2.5% annually and potable water consumption intensity by 36% relative to previous years. The Executive Order 13693, signed by President Obama in 2015, set new targets for federal agencies to reduce building energy intensity by 2.5% annually, potable water consumption intensity by 36%, and produce 25% of building energy from clean sources by FY2030. It also mandated climate-resilient design elements in federal buildings and directed the Council on Environmental Quality to issue revised sustainable building principles. The Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) issued revised \"Guiding Principles for Federal Leadership in High Performance Sustainable Buildings\" under E.O. 13693. Agencies were directed to ensure compliance with the principles for federal buildings over 5,000 square feet, with a goal of achieving full compliance across the inventory. Agency efforts led to an 18% increase in federal sustainable buildings between FY2014 and FY2015. In 2006, 19 federal agencies signed a memorandum of understanding titled \"Federal Leadership in High Performance and Sustainable Buildings\" with core Guiding Principles. The principles were revised in 2008 and 2016 to reflect progress in green building design. The federal government has issued revisions to the Guiding Principles in 2008 and 2016 to improve green building design and address a wider range of issues, including the health of occupants and climate change risks. The government owns or leases 273,000 buildings in the US, totaling 3 billion square feet and costing $6.1 billion in energy bills. The federal government owns or leases 273,000 buildings in the US, totaling 3 billion square feet and costing $6.1 billion in energy bills. EISA and other policy instruments require all federal agencies to implement green building practices. GSA and DOD control three-quarters of federal building floorspace. Several agencies have programs with a broader focus than just reducing environmental impacts. The General Services Administration (GSA) manages 425 million square feet of space in over 8,500 buildings for federal workers. They require LEED certification for new construction and renovations, aiming for Gold level or above by 2020. Properties leased by GSA must also meet certification standards. GSA aims for all new buildings to achieve net-zero energy, water, or waste by 2020, exceeding Executive Order 13693 requirements. The Green Proving Ground program evaluates next-generation building technologies for deployment across GSA's properties. Various offices within GSA contribute to green building efforts, including the Energy Program and Office of Design and Construction.

The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) administers mortgage insurance programs encouraging green building elements in public housing. The Mark-to-Market program offers incentives for green measures in multifamily housing projects. The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) runs the Energy Efficient Mortgage Program for homeowners and buyers. The Energy Efficient Mortgage Program, administered by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), enables homeowners and buyers to finance energy-efficiency improvements through their FHA-insured mortgage. Public Housing Agencies receive funding from the Public Housing Capital Fund and the Public Housing Operating Fund for energy and water efficiency improvements. HUD also oversees the Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes Program to reduce home health hazards. The rise of green building since the 1990s has raised questions about its impacts, including market penetration, cost, building performance, measurement science, legislative goals, and implementation. The building industry is a significant part of the U.S. economy, with construction and renovation work totaling in 2016. The building industry in the U.S. is a substantial component of the economy, with construction and renovation work exceeding $1 trillion in 2016, accounting for over 6% of the GDP. The percentage of green building in the construction market has grown significantly in recent years due to various factors like government requirements, investment returns, and environmental concerns. In 2005, only 2% of new construction in the U.S. was green. Green construction in the United States has seen significant growth, with spending more than tripling from $39 billion in 2008 to $129 billion in 2014. By 2013, green building made up 20% of new construction, up from just 2% in 2005. It is projected to generate $303.4 billion in GDP between 2015 and 2018, with new institutional construction driving future growth. New institutional construction is expected to drive green building growth in the United States, with certification requirements for public buildings and schools. The percentage of certified-green floorspace is increasing, with a rise in office space certified by LEED or Energy Star from 5% in 2005 to 38% in 2016. However, a large portion of U.S. residential and commercial building stock was not constructed using green building practices. Green building efforts impact financial performance by affecting construction costs, operating expenses, rental rates, and property values. Retrofitting existing buildings to meet green criteria may not always be feasible due to cost barriers and lack of information on true costs. The financial performance of green building investments is limited by the difficulty in obtaining true cost information. Initial costs of green buildings are perceived to be higher than conventional buildings, making it challenging to generalize their cost performance. The initial costs of green buildings are perceived to be higher than conventional buildings, which is a top obstacle for green building in the United States. Higher costs can stem from various sources such as high-efficiency appliances, high-performance windows, and certification processes. However, evidence suggests that the costs for constructing green buildings are not substantially higher than standard construction. The costs for constructing green buildings are comparable to those of conventional buildings, with some evidence suggesting that integrated design can reduce initial costs. Proponents argue that operational cost savings from reduced utility resource usage will eventually offset any higher initial investment. Green buildings can create operational cost savings by reducing utility resource usage and selling renewable energy back to the grid. Studies show that green certification is linked to lower utility expenses, but overall operating costs are not significantly reduced. Green certification may not significantly reduce overall operating expenses, but green-labeled buildings can command price premiums in the real estate market. However, some factors in real estate markets may discourage investments in green building, such as homeowners moving frequently, limiting the time for a return on investment through utility savings. Building owners, especially homeowners, may move frequently, reducing the time for a return on their green building investment. The financial return depends on the premium they can charge tenants. Tenants benefit from investments only if they stay long-term, creating a split-incentive problem. Constraints may limit potential beneficiaries of green building renovations. Constraints on capital availability may limit potential beneficiaries of green building renovations, such as educational institutions, hospitals, and municipalities. Cost barriers are decreasing as green building practices become more widespread, with financial incentives helping to offset initial investment costs. Financial incentives from states and municipalities can lower initial costs, making green building investments more attractive. The \"triple bottom line\" concept considers social and environmental returns in addition to financial ones. Design and performance should be distinguished when evaluating green building efforts. In evaluating green building efforts, it is important to distinguish between design and performance. While much focus has been on design and construction specifications, the actual environmental performance of green buildings was historically not a certification requirement. Factors like inadequate maintenance, alterations to building controls, and changes in building use can impact a building's performance after receiving a green rating. Studies have shown that even certified green buildings may not always perform better than conventional buildings due to factors like inadequate maintenance, alterations to building controls, and changes in building use. Post-occupancy evaluations have revealed some green buildings to be resource-intensive. The energy performance of green buildings has been scrutinized, showing a significant difference between predicted and actual energy use. Despite greater resource-use efficiency, savings may be offset by factors like larger home sizes and increased electronic devices. The performance gap in green buildings, between predicted and actual energy use, is a concern in the construction industry. Rating systems like LEED are now emphasizing postoccupancy performance assessment by requiring building-level energy and water meters for data collection and reporting. The certification process for green buildings is evolving to address critiques by including building-level energy and water meters for data collection and reporting to USGBC for the first five years post-certification. Other systems like BREEAM In-Use and Living Building Certification also incorporate performance parameters. Building codes are shifting towards outcome-based compliance pathways for energy usage, allowing builders to meet requirements through actual performance. Commissioning of building systems is also becoming more common. The 2015 IgCC introduced an outcome-based compliance pathway for energy usage, allowing builders to meet requirements through actual performance. Commissioning of building systems can improve environmental performance, especially for energy use, and can be applied to new or existing buildings. Organizations can also develop an environmental management system (EMS) with available international standards for certification. An organization can develop an environmental management system (EMS) with international standards for certification, including commitments to improve environmental performance and prevent pollution. Performance measurement in the EMS can make meeting these commitments easier. Building monitoring tools can detect faults in equipment and provide resource use analytics. Diagnostic tools are increasingly prevalent for early fault detection in critical building equipment and resource use analytics. GSAlink has identified over 33,000 instances of sub-optimal equipment performance. Challenges exist in measuring and evaluating green building performance due to a lack of consensus on criteria and outcomes. Recent studies have shown a lack of consensus on defining green building criteria and measuring outcomes, making it challenging to compare results. Green buildings exhibit a wide range of energy performance, with some falling below design expectations. The selected studies primarily use LEED ratings for inclusion, as other rating systems are less prevalent in the United States. A study of energy use in over 100 LEED-certified buildings found they performed 24% better on average than other buildings, with some performing worse. Criticisms of the study included sample bias and inappropriate baselines. A follow-up assessment concluded that primary energy savings from LEED certification were nonexistent for lower levels of certification. A follow-up assessment using the same data found that primary energy savings from LEED certification were nonexistent for lower levels of certification and 13% better than average for Gold and Platinum-certified buildings. A GSA study of 22 green federal buildings, most of which had received LEED certification, showed better performance in energy use, water use, operating costs, occupant satisfaction, and carbon emissions compared to the national average. Some buildings performed worse in certain areas. The energy performance of LEED-certified buildings was found to be below federal requirements and higher than the national average in some cases. Studies on Navy and Arizona buildings revealed discrepancies between actual energy consumption and modeled results, indicating a gap in effectiveness of energy-saving strategies. The studies on LEED-certified buildings showed a disconnect between energy-saving strategies and modeling results, suggesting that LEED certification may not consistently reduce building energy consumption. Limited sample sizes and proprietary performance data hinder comprehensive assessments. Access to more building performance data is crucial for better evaluations. Access to building performance data is essential for comprehensive performance assessments of green buildings. While some elements like energy and water use are easily quantifiable, others may require evaluation based on the presence or absence of certain features. Performance measurement is crucial to ensure that green buildings meet their environmental targets and to identify areas for improvement. Performance measurement of green buildings is essential for assessing their environmental impact. Some elements, like energy usage, can be quantitatively measured through metering, while others may require qualitative evaluation. Disagreements may arise on the most relevant metrics, such as energy use intensity (EUI) per square foot. Additional methodologies for measuring EUI have been proposed by GSA's Green Building Advisory Committee. The Green Building Advisory Committee has proposed new methodologies for measuring Energy Use Intensity (EUI), including energy use per occupant and area-based EUI measuring energy used in commuter transportation. However, accurate building occupancy data is needed to calculate occupancy-adjusted EUI. Commonly accepted metrics like Energy Star scores may not be highly correlated with EUI. The Green Building Advisory Committee has proposed new methodologies for measuring Energy Use Intensity (EUI), including energy use per occupant and area-based EUI measuring energy used in commuter transportation. Accurate building occupancy data is crucial for calculating occupancy-adjusted EUI. There is evidence that commonly accepted metrics, such as Energy Star scores, may not be highly correlated with the intended outcomes. Measurement of building performance is important over its entire lifespan to prevent environmental performance deterioration. Eventually, a standard life-cycle assessment for whole buildings may be feasible. EISA mandates federal agencies to measure their performance. EISA mandates federal agencies to measure building performance against specified energy targets, with more stringent requirements for new construction. Challenges exist in determining accurate baseline energy consumption levels. Despite available resources, uncertainties and gaps make effective application challenging. The importance of measurement in green building is recognized, but uncertainties and gaps make effective application challenging. Consensus on specific goals and metrics may not exist, and obtaining reliable data is difficult. Measurement science in green building is an active research area, with the development of appropriate metrics being a top research need. The National Institute of Standards and Technology prioritizes developing tools for measuring building sustainability. The National Institute of Standards and Technology is focused on developing metrics and tools for measuring building sustainability. Agency progress towards federal green building goals varied widely during the Obama Administration, with annual sustainability and energy scorecards released by OMB for each agency. Scorecards reported on various areas including GHG emission reductions, energy intensity, renewable energy use, water intensity, fleet petroleum use, and green buildings. During the Obama Administration, agencies were evaluated on their progress towards federal green building goals through annual sustainability and energy scorecards. These scorecards included reports on GHG emission reductions, energy intensity, renewable energy use, water intensity, fleet petroleum use, and green buildings. The scores were color-coded as green, yellow, or red, with green indicating meeting or being on track to meet the target, yellow showing some progress, and red indicating lack of progress. Federal progress towards buildings-related goals is discussed below. Federal progress towards green building goals is discussed, with agencies evaluated based on compliance with Guiding Principles. Some agencies have surpassed the 15% target for buildings over 5,000 square feet, while others are making progress. However, a few agencies have achieved compliance in less than 2% of buildings, receiving a red score from OMB. Several agencies have achieved compliance in fewer than 2% of buildings, with some receiving a red score in the green buildings category from OMB for FY2015. EISA set a goal for federal facilities to reduce energy intensity by 30% from 2003 levels by 2015, but many agencies did not meet this goal. Government-wide energy intensity only declined by 22% during this period. E.O. 13693 directs agencies to reduce energy intensity by 2.5% per year relative to 2015, with progress on this goal reported starting from FY2016. E.O. 13514 set a goal for a 26% reduction in potable water intensity between 2007 and 2020, which was replaced by E.O. 13693 in 2015. The goal for potable water intensity reduction was set by E.O. 13514 for 26% between 2007 and 2020, later replaced by E.O. 13693 in 2015 for a 36% reduction by 2025. Agencies have made progress towards the 36% reduction goal, with some already achieving the earlier goal. Concerns have been raised about green building approaches, particularly regarding rating and certification systems. Some critics have concerns about rating and certification systems for green building approaches. They argue that the certification process varies in rigor and many systems lack caps on performance metrics, making sustainability claims relative. Critics also point out that design criteria may not be integrative enough across elements or stages in a building's life cycle. Additionally, some argue that mere mitigation of environmental impacts is not sustainable. Some critics argue that green building certification systems lack rigor and performance caps, leading to relative sustainability claims. They also believe that design criteria should be more integrative across building life cycles. Concerns exist that new builders may not fully grasp the importance of a forward-thinking, holistic approach to green building design. Some critics argue that green building measures are often seen as add-ons rather than integral parts of a project. The limited scientific knowledge base in green building makes it challenging to determine the most appropriate approaches, requiring substantial research. Differences in goals and perspectives among proponents further complicate the issue. The challenges in green building include differences in goals and perspectives among proponents, making it difficult to identify objective criteria. Congress may face questions on the effectiveness of current federal green building programs and coordination methods among agencies. Congress may need to consider the effectiveness of current methods for coordinating green building activities among agencies and how to extend federal efforts to support green building adoption nationwide. Prioritizing elements like siting and promoting scientific knowledge growth are key areas for Congress to focus on through appropriations, statutory requirements, and tax laws. Congress could take additional action on green building through appropriations, new statutory requirements, and tax law. GAO reports have identified various federal initiatives related to green building, but few focus on the integrative approach discussed in this report. Coordination among agencies is recommended to assess performance. In this report, the focus is on specific elements like energy, IEQ, or water in green building programs. GAO recommends agencies coordinate to assess initiative performance. Congress should examine federal agencies' implementation of green building programs and their impact on adoption nationwide. Coordination of agency efforts should also be evaluated. In addition to supporting energy efficiency mortgages, federal agencies like the Federal Housing Administration and the Department of Veterans Affairs also promote green building initiatives. Congress could consider providing stronger incentives, broadening existing incentives, funding rebate programs, and making specific appropriations to further support green building efforts. Congress could consider expanding mortgage and tax incentives to include green building elements, funding rebate programs, and making specific appropriations to accelerate adoption in areas with low market penetration. Regulatory actions may be complicated by federalism issues and regional differences. Enhancing current green building efforts in federal agencies and considering programs for new and existing buildings are also options for Congress to explore. Congress could enhance green building efforts in federal agencies by integrating programs and activities more effectively. Energy is a key focus due to concerns about fossil fuel imports, climate change, and inefficient energy use. Congress may need to assess the balance and effectiveness of federal green building efforts, considering concerns about fossil fuel imports, climate change, and energy inefficiency in buildings. It may also be necessary to evaluate if the current incremental approach is sufficient to meet national needs or if modifications or accelerations are needed. The development of scientific and technological knowledge for green building is supported by R&D funding from federal and private-sector sources, which may be insufficient to address current needs. Studies have shown that green building receives minimal funding compared to total federal nondefense R&D, and the construction sector invests less in R&D than the industry average. The construction sector invests less in R&D than the industry average, especially in green building elements like energy. Congress may need to reconsider federal funding levels and priorities to incentivize private-sector involvement in green building research and development. Congress may need to consider modifying federal funding levels and priorities to incentivize private-sector involvement in green building research and development. Additionally, ensuring a knowledgeable workforce for construction, certification, and operation of green buildings, including schools and hospitals, may require evaluating the availability of training and education in relevant areas of expertise."
