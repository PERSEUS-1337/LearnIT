    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Safe Communities Act of 2017\". The Congress acknowledges the lack of financial resources for incorporating disaster threats in land use and public facility planning, leading to costly relief programs and ad hoc security measures. This has negatively impacted communities in the United States. Although land use planning falls under State and local jurisdiction, there is a need for encouragement. The Federal Government and State governments should support incorporating disaster mitigation and emergency preparedness into comprehensive land use planning to prevent costly post-disaster recovery efforts. Disaster planning should focus on prevention and mitigation strategies from various professional fields like urban planning, architecture, and design, rather than just post-disaster recovery. Comprehensive planning can incorporate practices to reduce property damage and human casualties. Efforts to update land use statutes in many States to support comprehensive planning for safe communities and long-term hazard mitigation and emergency preparedness are underway. Coordination of State and regional investments is also being emphasized. Efforts to coordinate State and regional investments for at-risk public infrastructure with local plans require additional State level planning. Comprehensive urban planning considers the relationship between land use, transportation systems, water and wastewater facilities, and open space to promote safe and economically viable communities. Local governments should integrate safety considerations into comprehensive planning efforts, including ensuring safe housing. Safe housing is crucial for community development, and comprehensive planning should incorporate modern techniques to provide a variety of safe housing options. Prevailing land use patterns can put people and the environment at risk, especially in poorly regulated rural communities and small towns facing growth pressures on the metropolitan fringe. Regulated rural communities and small towns on the metropolitan fringe face growth pressures leading to haphazard development patterns. The Federal and State governments should support Tribal governments and Native Hawaiian organizations in implementing land use planning for safer housing and improved socioeconomic conditions. SEC. 3. SAFE COMMUNITIES PLANNING GRANTS. The Secretary of Homeland Security will establish a grant program to assist States and local governments in developing or updating land use planning statutes and comprehensive planning documents to address natural and human-caused hazards, including acts of terror. The grant program aims to assist States and local governments in addressing natural and human-caused hazards through land use planning statutes, comprehensive planning documents, and multi-State regional land use plans. Eligibility for the grant is based on meeting specific criteria. The grant program assists States and local governments in addressing hazards through land use planning. Eligibility requires demonstrating consistency with specific guidelines, including citizen engagement in the planning process. In developing land use plans, stakeholder involvement and multi-disciplinary planning processes are essential. Multi-jurisdictional cooperation and multi-agency coordination are necessary for assessing risks from natural hazards and terrorist acts. In developing land use plans, stakeholder involvement and multi-disciplinary planning processes are essential for assessing risks from natural hazards and terrorist acts. Planning legislation and regulations are created based on cooperation between Federal, State, and local government agencies, with implementation elements including a timetable for action and defined roles and responsibilities. Comprehensive planning is essential for incorporating risk assessment and mitigation into land use plans at the state or local level. This planning involves stakeholder involvement, multi-disciplinary processes, and cooperation between different government agencies. The State or local government integrates risk assessment and mitigation measures into comprehensive plans, urban design guidelines, building codes, and transportation plans. Plans are regularly updated and adhere to professional planning standards. Grant funds received by a State or local government under subsection (a) shall be used for developing comprehensive land use plans, integrating natural hazard mitigation and security plan elements, and assessing critical public infrastructure for land use and community development policies. The grant funds received by a State or local government under subsection (a) are to be used for various purposes, including assessing critical public infrastructure, developing geographical information systems, acquiring scenario planning technology, updating building codes and zoning regulations, and implementing CPTED initiatives. Implementing CPTED initiatives, assessing risk and vulnerability related to land use, incorporating mitigation and security elements in transportation plans, facilities, and operations, integrating regional security plans with transportation or land use plans, encouraging interagency cooperation, and identifying natural hazard areas. The grant program aims to enhance collaboration between first-responders and planning agencies, integrate natural hazard areas into comprehensive plans and regulations, and limit grants to $1,125,000. Federal funding for projects will not exceed 90%, with the possibility of an increased share for Tribal governments. The Secretary may increase the Federal share for Tribal governments or Native Hawaiian organizations if they lack funds for a project. The Secretary also encourages coordination between Federal land management agencies and State or local planning directors. Audits are required. The Inspector General of the Department of Homeland Security conducts audits on grants to ensure funds are used as specified. Audit results influence future grant awards to States. The Inspector General of the Department of Homeland Security conducts audits on grants to ensure funds are used as specified, with recommendations influencing future grant awards to States. Land use planning legislation is defined as actions taken by a State or local government to guide land use and development practices. The term \"comprehensive plan\" refers to a planning document adopted for regulating land use, natural resources, development practices, and urban development. The term \"State\" includes the 50 States and the District of Columbia. The term \"State\" encompasses the 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, Tribal governments, and Native Hawaiian organizations. The term \"State planning director\" refers to a State official designated by statute. The State planning director is a State official responsible for drafting and updating State guide plans that regulate land use on a statewide basis. The local planning director is a local official responsible for drafting and updating local comprehensive plans. The local planning director is responsible for drafting and updating local comprehensive plans that regulate land use and development within the local government's jurisdiction. The term \"Tribal government\" refers to the Tribal government of an Indian Tribe as defined in the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act. SEC. 4. SAFE COMMUNITIES PLANNING RESEARCH. The Secretary of Homeland Security, along with various partners, will conduct research on land use and community planning to mitigate natural hazards and terrorism threats. This includes integrating federal facility security with local plans and assessing the impact of security strategies on the community environment. The Secretary of Homeland Security will report to Congress on best practices in community security and safety planning, evaluating land use codes to reduce risks from natural hazards and terrorism within 2 years of enacting the Act. The evaluation includes land use and development codes, software tools for safe planning, security design standards, and best practices for incorporating safety into infrastructure planning. The Secretary will evaluate best practices for incorporating safety and security into infrastructure planning, considering regional, State, and local differences, and assessing practices in terms of risk reduction and cost. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2019 through 2023 totaling $57,250,000, with $56,250,000 allocated for grants under section 3 and $300,000 for section 4 implementation."
