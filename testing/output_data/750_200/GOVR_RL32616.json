The report emphasized the need for intelligence and law enforcement to exploit al Qaeda's travel vulnerabilities. The 9/11 Commission report emphasized the need for intelligence and law enforcement to exploit al Qaeda's travel vulnerabilities. It issued recommendations related to immigration law and policy, highlighting the importance of targeting travel as a weapon against terrorists. The 9/11 Commission report emphasized targeting travel as a weapon against terrorists and recommended integrating the U.S. border security system into a larger network of screening points, including transportation systems and vital facilities. The Department of Homeland Security should expedite the implementation of a biometric entry-exit screening system. The Department of Homeland Security, with support from Congress, must quickly establish a biometric entry-exit screening system to prevent terrorists from entering the country. Collaboration with other governments is essential for this effort. Immigration law and policy will be significantly impacted by these recommendations. The 108th Congress considered and adopted various immigration-related reforms as part of major legislative proposals. The 108th Congress considered and adopted major legislative proposals, including reforms related to immigration law. Two bills passed, implementing recommendations from the 9/11 Commission: H.R. 10, the 9/11 Recommendations Implementation Act, and S. 2845, the National Intelligence Reform Act of 2004. The National Intelligence Reform Act of 2004, introduced by Senators Susan Collins and Joseph Lieberman, faced contention over immigration provisions. The compromise bill, the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, signed on December 17, 2004, included some immigration provisions but not all originally considered. The compromise bill, P.L.108-458, signed on December 17, 2004, includes some immigration provisions but not all originally considered. The major areas under consideration in comprehensive reform proposals are briefly discussed, with references to CRS reports. Actions to identify and intercept terrorists entering or leaving the United States are a key component of the 9/11 Commission's recommendations. Congress required the development of an automated entry and exit data system in 1996. Actions to track the arrival and departure of aliens entering or leaving the United States were recommended by the 9/11 Commission. Congress mandated the development of an automated entry and exit data system in 1996, but it has not been fully implemented. Following the 9/11 attacks, additional measures were enacted to expedite the system's development and require the use of biometric identifiers in travel documents for improved security. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 mandated a pre-inspection program at selected overseas locations to inspect aliens before their departure to the United States and provide assistance to air carriers in detecting fraudulent documents. Proposals in the 108th Congress aimed to enhance monitoring of individuals entering and exiting the country. Several proposals in the 108th Congress aimed to improve monitoring of individuals entering and exiting the United States, including hastening the development of a biometric entry and exit data system integrated with various databases. The 108th Congress proposed measures to enhance monitoring of individuals entering and exiting the US, including pre-flight comparison of passenger records with the terrorist watch list, implementing a watchlist for cruise ship passengers, and establishing permanent pre-enrollment programs for expedited screenings at ports of entry.

The 108th Congress proposed measures to enhance monitoring of individuals entering and exiting the US, including requiring visa applicants aged 12-65 to be interviewed by consular officers prior to visa issuance, subject to waiver in certain circumstances. Additionally, the President is authorized and encouraged to enter into international agreements to curtail terrorist travel by upgrading verification and information-sharing systems. The President's ability to waive general statutory requirements for U.S. citizens traveling abroad or attempting to enter the United States is limited to those traveling to or from foreign contiguous territories bearing identification documents designated by DHS. The House-passed proposal limits waivers for U.S. citizens traveling to or from foreign contiguous territories to those with specific identification documents designated by DHS as reliable proof of citizenship. Waivers for arriving foreign nationals can only be granted through a joint determination by the Secretary of Homeland Security and Secretary of State based on reciprocity.

Arriving foreign nationals can only be granted waivers through a joint determination by the Secretary of Homeland Security and Secretary of State based on reciprocity. The Secretary of State, in consultation with DHS, must develop and implement a plan for the use of biometric passports for U.S. citizens and foreign nationals from contiguous territories or adjacent islands. The Senate-passed proposal requires aliens waived in INA \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd 214(d)(4) to present biometric passports for travel into the United States.

Congress has expanded grounds for inadmissibility and deportation, while also restricting relief from removal and judicial review of removal decisions. The Supreme Court has emphasized the importance of judicial review in the absence of clear congressional intent. After the 9/11 attacks, Congress expanded terrorism grounds for inadmissibility, removal, and mandatory detention in response to concerns.

Aliens seeking asylum must demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution based on specific characteristics. The United States will not return a foreign national to a country where their life or freedom is threatened. Regulations also implement the United Nations Convention Against Torture. Regulations implementing the United Nations Convention Against Torture prohibit the return of individuals to countries where there is a risk of torture. Proposed modifications to asylum and relief from removal include establishing stricter standards for applicants accused of terrorist activities. The House-passed legislation aims to require asylum applicants accused of terrorist or guerrilla-related activities to prove persecution based on race, religion, nationality, social group, or political opinion. It also allows for indefinite detention of aliens deemed a danger to national security pending removal. The House-passed legislation allows for indefinite detention of aliens accused of terrorist activities, with concerns about terrorist aliens acquiring U.S. identification documents. The 9/11 Commission highlighted that most of the hijackers obtained U.S. identification documents through fraud, aiding them in their terrorist activities. To prevent this, national standards for birth certificates and drivers' licenses issuance were recommended. The controversy surrounding national ID standards has persisted, despite not being directly related to immigration policy. The controversy over forms of identification, known as \"breeder documents,\" has been linked with immigration legislation. Congress provided standards for state drivers' licenses and birth certificates under \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd 656 of the IIRIRA, but this provision was repealed in 2000 amid concerns of a national ID card. Following the 9/11 Commission's recommendations, proposals were made to enhance federal oversight and security of drivers' licenses. Following the repeal of standards for state drivers' licenses and birth certificates in 2000, proposals were made to increase federal oversight and improve security measures for personal identification documents, including Social Security documents and verification procedures for benefits under the INA.

An alien in the United States can use a valid foreign passport or immigration document issued by DHS or the Department of Justice for identification to a federal employee. Other documents are not accepted for this purpose. The DHS is responsible for enforcing immigration laws and securing the border, with specific bureaus like CBP patrolling the U.S. border and conducting immigration inspections. Various reports address issues related to driver's licenses for undocumented aliens, consular identification cards, national identification cards, and the Social Security Number. The DHS Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) patrols the U.S. border and conducts immigration and customs inspections at ports of entry.
