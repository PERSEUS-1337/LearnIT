    "content": "In 1976, President Gerald Ford signed the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) into law, authorizing the EPA to regulate toxic chemicals in U.S. commerce to prevent harm to human health or the environment. The EPA evaluates risks throughout the chemical life-cycle and has various regulatory options to address them. Congress has added five titles to TSCA and made amendments since its inception. Since 1976, Congress has added five titles to the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) and made amendments to target specific chemical concerns. Various bills have been introduced since 2005 to revise the chemical evaluation process, but none have been enacted due to ongoing legislative debate on amending regulatory criteria and other elements of the law. Since 1976, Congress has added five titles to the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) and made amendments to target specific chemical concerns. Various bills have been introduced since 2005 to revise the chemical evaluation process, but none have been enacted due to ongoing legislative debate on amending regulatory criteria and other elements of the law. The debate continues on amending the evaluation process, regulatory criteria, and other elements of the law under TSCA, as more chemicals enter the U.S. market and scientific understanding of chemical risks evolves. Critics argue that the current regulatory framework for chemicals is not sufficiently protective of the public or the environment. EPA's evaluation of risks is ultimately dependent. Proponents argue that amending Title I of TSCA is necessary as the current regulatory framework for chemicals is not sufficiently protective. States have enacted statutes to address specific chemical concerns not covered by EPA, leading to potential inconsistencies in regulations. Manufacturers and processors believe compliance with varying state regulations for the same chemical is inefficient due to interstate commerce. Proponents argue for state regulations to lead in trying alternative approaches for chemicals not covered by EPA. Non-governmental programs like labeling products as \"sustainable\" have emerged as alternative regulation methods. This report tracks legislative status in the 114th Congress for amending Title I of TSCA. In the 114th Congress, bills were introduced to amend Title I of TSCA, including the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act (S. 697) and the Alan Reinstein and Trevor Schaefer Toxic Chemical Protection Act (S. 725). This report does not provide a comprehensive analysis of all provisions but discusses selected issues that have received attention. In the 114th Congress, bills were introduced to amend Title I of TSCA, including S. 697 and S. 725. Senate EPW held hearings and marked up amendments for S. 697, which was reported out for Senate floor consideration. House Committee announced a discussion draft for targeted changes. On April 7, 2015, the House Committee on Energy and Commerce introduced a discussion draft called the TSCA Modernization Act of 2015, which takes a targeted approach to amending Title I of TSCA. A hearing was held on April 14, 2015, and on May 14, 2015, the subcommittee voted 21-0 to forward the revised draft to the full House Committee for consideration. On May 26, 2015, H.R. 2576, also known as the TSCA Modernization Act of 2015, was introduced. The TSCA Modernization Act of 2015, H.R. 2576, was introduced and forwarded to the full House Committee on Energy and Commerce for consideration. The bill was approved with technical amendments and passed by the House under suspension of the rules on a 398-1 vote. The House passed H.R. 2576 on June 23, 2015, addressing various issues related to regulating chemical substances under TSCA. Key debated topics include prioritizing existing chemicals for risk evaluation, regulatory criteria for restricting substances, EPA's options for regulation, requiring new information development, and preemption of state laws on chemical regulation. The report compares approaches in amending Title I of TSCA to address key issues such as regulation, development of new information, preemption of state laws, disclosure of information, and resources available for EPA. The evaluation of risks for chemicals in the marketplace is limited by finite resources, making criteria selection for evaluation a perennial issue. The EPA has discretion in selecting which chemicals to evaluate for risks under the current TSCA, with no mandate to review all chemicals. Over 83,000 chemical substances may be evaluated, including those on the initial inventory and those reported in premanufacture notices. In 2012, EPA identified 1,200 substances for evaluation based on prioritization criteria, leading to 90 substances prioritized for risk assessment. EPA has assessed five chemicals, with three found to pose risks. EPA assesses risks of chemical substances through PMNs, with 5 out of 90 prioritized chemicals found to pose risks. Manufacturers must submit a PMN 90 days before manufacturing a new chemical, allowing EPA to evaluate risks and determine regulation. EPA has received over 36,000 PMNs and 13,000 exemption applications from July 1979 to September 2010. EPA received over 36,000 PMNs and 13,000 exemption applications from July 1979 to September 2010. S. 697 and S. 725 would prioritize existing chemical substances for risk evaluation, while H.R. 2576 would evaluate chemicals based on specific criteria. H.R. 2576 would allow EPA to assess chemicals with potential unreasonable risks from hazards and exposures under intended use. S. 697 and S. 725 differ in prioritization factors and criteria. The Senate bills S. 697 and S. 725 aim to prioritize chemical substances for evaluation based on various factors, including active and inactive substances in the marketplace. The process involves conducting risk-based safety evaluations and taking regulatory action accordingly. Persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic (PBT) substances are also addressed in all three bills. The bills S. 697 and H.R. 2576 propose a process for manufacturers to request EPA to prioritize substances for evaluation by paying a fee. EPA would have discretion under S. 697, while H.R. 2576 requires evaluation for substances where costs are paid. Under H.R. 2576 and S. 697, EPA would evaluate risks for substances requested by manufacturers who have paid the costs. S. 697 requires EPA to designate at least 25 chemicals as high priority and begin safety assessment within five years. EPA must make efforts to complete designations in a timely manner and publish an annual goal. EPA would be required to designate at least 25 chemicals as high priority and begin safety assessment within five years after enactment of S. 697. Safety assessments must be completed within three years after designation, with a rule promulgated within two years after a negative safety determination. The procedures in S. 725 are similar to S. 697 but with tighter deadlines and differing conditions. H.R. 2576 would require risk evaluations to be published within three years after a manufacturer's request or EPA finding of potential risk, with at least 10 evaluations initiated per year. There is no limit on manufacturer requests, as long as they fully pay for the evaluation. The Senate bills S. 697 and S. 725 propose amending TSCA Section 5 to establish a process for EPA to review notices and information submitted by manufacturers for new chemical substances. EPA would need to determine if regulatory action is necessary for new chemicals after the submission of a PMN. The Senate bills S. 697 and S. 725 propose amending TSCA Section 5 to establish a process for EPA to review notices and information submitted by manufacturers for new chemical substances. EPA would need to make a determination within 90 days of receiving a PMN on whether regulatory action is warranted for new chemicals. Once a new chemical is added to the TSCA Inventory, it would be subject to the same safety assessment procedures as existing chemical substances. The current TSCA establishes a standard for regulating chemical substances based on the risk of harm to human health or the environment. This threshold is used for new and existing chemicals under Sections 5 and 6. Some argue that the regulatory threshold for restricting chemicals under TSCA is challenging for the EPA to prove and open to interpretation. The debate revolves around amending the threshold to clarify criteria for determining if substances need regulatory control, as the \"unreasonable risk\" standard is not clearly defined in the statute. The \"unreasonable risk\" standard under current TSCA is not clearly defined in the statute, leading to challenges for the EPA in proving regulatory control over chemicals. The Fifth Circuit interpreted this standard as a multi-factor balancing test in the influential 1991 Corrosion Proof Fittings v. EPA decision, emphasizing the need to consider environmental, economic, and social impacts when evaluating risks. The Fifth Circuit ruled that EPA's asbestos ban did not consider the cost side of the TSCA equation, deeming it unreasonable to spend $200-$300 million to save approximately seven lives over thirteen years. This decision highlights the need for a balanced approach considering environmental, economic, and social impacts when evaluating risks under the \"unreasonable risk\" standard in current TSCA. The Fifth Circuit ruled that EPA's asbestos ban, costing $200-$300 million to save seven lives over thirteen years, was deemed unreasonable under the \"unreasonable risk\" standard. S. 697 aims to establish a statutory definition for \"safety standard\" based on the regulatory threshold of \"unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment\" in current TSCA. S. 697 aims to establish a new safety standard for evaluating chemical risks, including potentially exposed populations, and prohibiting the consideration of cost and non-risk factors. S. 725, like S. 697, defines a safety standard for measuring chemical risks without considering cost or non-risk factors. The standard aims to ensure no harm to human health or the environment under intended conditions of use. H.R. 2576 does not define a safety standard but retains the regulatory threshold based on unreasonable risk in current TSCA. It adds requirements for EPA's risk evaluation process, including assessing risks to potentially exposed populations and prohibiting consideration of cost and non-health/environment related factors. H.R. 2576 prohibits EPA from considering costs or non-risk factors when evaluating risks under TSCA. EPA must address unreasonable risks to health or the environment without balancing costs and benefits. The EPA is directed by Section 6 of TSCA to regulate chemical substances that pose unreasonable risks to health or the environment using the least burdensome requirement. This can range from a complete ban to notifying distributors of risks. Some argue that EPA's options are limited in choosing regulatory requirements. The EPA is directed by Section 6 of TSCA to regulate chemical substances that pose unreasonable risks to health or the environment using the least burdensome requirement, which can range from a complete ban to notifying distributors of risks. In practice, the \"least burdensome\" requirement imposes an additional standard on EPA beyond that imposed by the requirement to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of the chosen alternative. The Fifth Circuit required EPA to show that each less burdensome requirement would not adequately protect against the unreasonable risk. S. 697, S. 725, and H.R. 2576 aim to eliminate the least burdensome regulatory option for restricting chemical substances, directing EPA to choose a regulatory option that is \"necessary.\" S. 697, S. 725, and H.R. 2576 would direct EPA to choose a regulatory option that is \"necessary\" for a chemical substance to meet safety standards, considering factors like costs and alternative regulations. H.R. 2576 would require EPA to promulgate rules that adequately protect against risks, including those to potentially exposed subpopulations, and be \"cost-effective\" as determined by EPA. The bills would require EPA to promulgate rules on chemical substances that are deemed \"cost-effective\" by the agency, with provisions for exemptions in certain circumstances like national security or critical uses. H.R. 2576 would authorize EPA to grant \"critical use exemptions\" for specific uses of a chemical substance if deemed necessary for national security or critical infrastructure, with a focus on reducing risk to the greatest extent feasible. EPA would be authorized to grant critical use exemptions for specific uses of a chemical substance to reduce risk. Exemptions would be initially for up to five years, renewable for additional five-year periods if requirements are met. EPA relies on scientific information to evaluate risks and can require reporting on chemicals under Section 8 of TSCA. Section 8 of TSCA allows EPA to require reporting and record-keeping of existing information on chemicals by manufacturers, processors, and distributors. Section 4 mandates testing if risks are unknown, with EPA needing to find either unreasonable risks or substantial production quantities. EPA can require testing for chemical substances if they may pose unreasonable risks or have substantial production quantities that could enter the environment or lead to significant human exposures. Over 200 chemical substances have undergone additional testing. Some argue that limits on EPA's authority under TSCA hinder its ability to assess chemical risks. EPA contends that finding a substance may present unreasonable risks is necessary to mandate further information development on its health and environmental effects. EPA can require testing for chemical substances that may pose unreasonable risks based on production volume and exposure likelihood. Developing new information for risk assessment can be time-consuming and costly. Section 4 of TSCA mandates EPA to require testing under certain conditions. The EPA can require testing for chemical substances that may pose risks based on production volume and exposure likelihood. S. 697 and S. 725 would give EPA discretion to require testing if necessary, while H.R. 2576 would still require certain findings for testing under TSCA Section 4. All three bills authorize EPA to require new information for risk evaluation. The three bills would authorize EPA to require new information for risk evaluation, including minimizing animal testing. State chemical regulations and TSCA preemption issues are key considerations in the discussions. The scope of TSCA preemption at the federal level has been a long-standing issue. Congress can preempt state action within a field entirely or permit state action to some degree. Current TSCA preemption gives EPA a primary role in managing chemicals but allows states some ability to set their own requirements under certain circumstances. Section 18 of TSCA allows states to set their own chemical requirements under certain circumstances, with exceptions to preemption for state requirements that are not duplicative of federal regulations. States can co-enforce federal requirements by adopting them as their own law and are also authorized to regulate disposal and establish chemical requirements under other authorities. In the context of TSCA amendments, advocates argue for federal preemption to establish a uniform national regulatory framework for chemicals, claiming it can provide adequate protection from risks. They believe that without preemption, varying state regulations could lead to increased compliance costs and economic repercussions across industries. S. 697 would make changes to TSCA preemption and the state-federal relationship in chemical management. Supporters of preemption argue for a uniform national regulatory framework to avoid conflicting state regulations and reduce compliance costs. Opponents believe states should have the flexibility to implement more stringent policies to protect their citizens. S. 697 would modify TSCA preemption rules regarding state-federal relations in chemical management. States could act if EPA had not taken action on a chemical, but the bill would change the criteria for preemption, scope of state laws affected, and waiver provisions. States would be restricted from regulating chemicals that meet EPA safety standards. The bill would restrict states from regulating chemicals that meet EPA safety standards, preempting new state restrictions on high priority chemicals for safety assessment defined by EPA. The bill would restrict states from regulating chemicals that meet EPA safety standards, preempting new state restrictions on high priority chemicals for safety assessment defined by EPA. If EPA determines a chemical does not meet safety standards, preemption would be lifted until the effective date of the EPA rule restricting the chemical. The bill retains preemption exceptions provided by current TSCA, except for the exception allowing states to prohibit use of chemicals, which would be removed. States would be prohibited from imposing duplicative or more stringent requirements identical to federal requirements. The bill would refine TSCA's exception for states to enforce identical federal requirements, prohibiting states from imposing more stringent penalties. New exceptions to preemption would be added, allowing states to enforce certain requirements under state environmental laws. Certain state actions before August 1, 2015, and actions under state laws in effect as of August 31, 2003, would not be preempted. Savings clauses would clarify that common law or statutory causes of action are not affected. S. 697 would add savings clauses clarifying that common law or statutory causes of action, private remedies, or evidentiary authorities of courts would not be affected. States could apply for waivers based on peer-reviewed science, which EPA would have to grant if requirements are met. Waivers would be automatically granted if EPA fails to make a decision within 90 days or misses the deadline for a safety determination on the chemical. H.R. 2576 would make smaller changes to TSCA preemption compared to Senate bills, allowing states to impose different regulations for chemicals if EPA has taken no action. H.R. 2576 would provide for preemption of state laws on chemicals if EPA determines they do not pose unreasonable risks, aligning with EPA's risk evaluation process. H.R. 2576 aligns preemption with EPA's risk evaluation process for chemicals, including state enforcement of identical requirements with penalties. Past state actions before August 2015 and actions under state laws in effect since 2003 would not be preempted. The bills would not preempt past state actions taken before August 2015 or future state actions under state laws in effect as of 2003. They also include savings clauses for common law causes of action and court authorities in civil actions. TSCA requires chemical companies to provide information to EPA, such as chemical structures and safety data, raising concerns about balancing public access. The amendment of TSCA raises concerns about balancing public access to chemical information with protection of trade secrets and competitiveness. Section 14 prohibits disclosure of exempt information, with wrongful disclosure being a criminal act. Under TSCA, disclosure of confidential business information (CBI) is prohibited, with exceptions. Wrongful disclosure by EPA employees or contractors is a criminal act. Protection of CBI does not prevent disclosure of health and safety studies, but data revealing manufacturing processes or proprietary mixtures is safeguarded. EPA has protected chemical identities and other information as CBI in various situations. Exceptions in TSCA Section 14 require disclosure of CBI if deemed necessary by EPA to protect certain interests. TSCA Section 14 contains exceptions for disclosing CBI if EPA deems it necessary to protect health or the environment. EPA must notify the submitter before disclosing CBI if it does not meet protection standards. Submitting information as CBI only requires designation, no substantiation or EPA review is needed. Since 2010, EPA has increased its review of confidentiality claims, particularly regarding chemical identities in health and safety studies. The agency has also initiated a \"CBI Declassification Challenge\" for industry to voluntarily withdraw CBI claims and has implemented other initiatives to enhance transparency. The EPA has increased its review of confidentiality claims, especially regarding chemical identities in health and safety studies. They have issued a \"CBI Declassification Challenge\" for industry to voluntarily withdraw CBI claims and have taken other steps to improve transparency. The proposed bills would require or authorize the EPA to disclose CBI in additional circumstances, such as in response to requests from state, local, or tribal officials for enforcement purposes, environmental releases, or health care professionals. The Senate bills propose extensive revisions to Section 14 of TSCA, with detailed procedural requirements for information submitters and more review requirements for EPA. They also list categories of information presumed protected from disclosure, including specific chemical identity before commercial distribution. The Senate bills propose revisions to TSCA, protecting chemical identities before distribution. H.R. 2576 safeguards confidentiality in health and safety studies, requiring substantiation every 10 years. EPA must notify submitters before confidentiality expiration. H.R. 2576 requires EPA to notify submitters before confidentiality claims expire. Congress faces a decision on funding EPA's activities under TSCA. Under TSCA, EPA's funding is authorized through annual appropriations and fees on chemical manufacturers, importers, or processors. The fees are limited to $2,500 for certain actions required under the statute. EPA's authority to collect fees does not have a sunset date. EPA's authority to collect fees under TSCA is limited to a maximum of $2,500 for specific actions required by the statute. Section 26(b) provides an exception for small businesses, capping fees at $100. Additionally, EPA can assess fees within these limits for evaluating testing data on chemical substances. EPA can assess fees under TSCA for evaluating testing data on chemical substances, with a maximum cap of $2,500, or $100 for small businesses. Fees collected are treated as miscellaneous receipts and deposited into the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury. Availability of these fees for EPA's use is subject to annual appropriations. S. 697 and S. 725 would repeal the expired authorization of appropriations under TSCA Section 29, while H.R. 2576 would not amend this section. The bills S. 697, S. 725, and H.R. 2576 address the authorization of appropriations and the authority to collect fees under TSCA. S. 697 would allow fees for submissions of information on chemicals, contingent on minimum appropriations. S. 697 would establish fees for chemical information submissions, tied to minimum appropriations, to sustainably fund EPA activities. Total fees capped at $18 million, with receipts deposited in a dedicated fund for evaluating submissions without fiscal year limitation. The bill H.R. 2576 authorizes EPA to collect fees from manufacturers for evaluating chemical submissions, without a fiscal year limitation. The agency can collect fees sufficient to cover administrative costs under TSCA, with no limit on the amount per submission. The bills H.R. 2576, S. 697, and S. 725 authorize EPA to collect fees from chemical manufacturers to cover administrative costs under TSCA. The fees collected would be deposited into a dedicated fund with no fiscal year limitation, and the agency would set fees at a sufficient level for operations. S. 725 aims to remove the statutory limit on EPA fees per notice submission under TSCA and ensure fees cover agency responsibilities. Fees collected would go to the General Fund, subject to discretionary appropriations. Congressional Budget Office has estimated budget impacts of related bills. The Congressional Budget Office has published cost estimates for S. 697 and H.R. 2576, presenting potential budgetary impacts of the bills. Cost estimates for S. 697 and H.R. 2576 are included in S.Rept. 114-67 and H.Rept. 114-176, respectively."
