The Act titled the \"Community Hazard Assessment and Mitigation Program Act\" acknowledges the devastating impact of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami in Southeast Asia, highlighting the potential risk of a similar event along the Cascadia Subduction Zone on the west coast of the United States in the next 50 years. A potential geological event along the Cascadia Subduction Zone could lead to a large-scale earthquake and tsunami, causing significant damage to infrastructure and emergency response services. Coastal communities have shown a lack of preparedness through numerous false alarms in the past year. The purpose and goals of addressing the potential geological event along the Cascadia Subduction Zone are outlined in Section 3. The Community Hazard Assessment and Mitigation Program (CHAMP) aims to provide one-year grants to emergency management departments for tsunami warning infrastructure and post-tsunami needs. The program supports departments lacking resources to protect public health and safety during a tsunami and its aftermath. Improving warning systems for coastal communities is essential for enhancing all hazard capabilities and ensuring the safety of the public and emergency response personnel during a tsunami and its aftermath. The grant program is established to improve warning systems for coastal communities during tsunamis. The Secretary of Homeland Security may provide grants to certain areas to prepare for tsunamis, prioritizing areas with a 10 percent or greater likelihood of being struck in the next 50 years. Grants will be awarded competitively based on financial need, community benefit, and cooperation with other emergency service providers. SEC. 5. USE OF FUNDS. An emergency management department receiving a grant under this Act can use funds for warning systems, rescue equipment, and reinforcing buildings and facilities for critical services. This includes sirens, weather radios, communications gear, reverse 911 systems, police stations, fire stations, and emergency management facilities. The grant funds can be used for ensuring continuity of critical services such as police stations, fire stations, emergency management facilities, hospitals, shelters, and sewer sanitation systems. It also includes post-tsunami shelters and supplies, as well as outreach programs to educate residents and tourists on different types of tsunamis and how to react to each type. SEC. 6. MATCHING FUNDS. To be eligible for a grant under this Act, emergency management departments serving areas with different population sizes must contribute a percentage of the total project cost with non-Federal funds. Emergency management departments serving areas with populations under 20,000 must provide 5% of the project cost with non-Federal funds to be eligible for a grant under this Act. In-kind contributions can also be considered, not exceeding 50% of the department's non-Federal funds contribution. SEC. 7. EVALUATION AND REPORT.\n\nThe Director will assess if emergency management departments meet tsunami readiness standards and evaluate program effectiveness within 180 days of grant awards. A report on the findings will be submitted to Congress within 90 days of the evaluation completion. The term \"Director\" refers to the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Administration. The term \"emergency management department\" refers to an agency responsible for planning and managing emergencies. The term \"State\" includes all 50 states. The term \"State\" refers to each of the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and other US territories. Authorization of Appropriations: $100,000,000 is authorized annually from 2007 to 2012 for the Community Hazard Assessment and Mitigation Program under the Department of Homeland Security. 5% may be reserved for administrative costs, and the funds remain available until expended."
