    "content": "The Act titled \"Small Business Review Panel Technical Amendments Act of 1999\" is for the purpose of making technical amendments. The Congress acknowledges the importance of a vibrant small business sector in creating jobs and recognizes the regulatory burdens faced by small businesses. Federal agencies are required to consider the impact of regulations on small businesses early in the rulemaking process. The Small Business Advocacy Review Panel process, established in 1996, allows small businesses to participate in the development of rules. The Fairness Act of 1996 has enabled small businesses to participate in regulatory processes of the EPA and OSHA. Its purposes include providing a forum for small business participation, strengthening the Small Business Advocacy Review Panel process, and expanding the agencies required to convene these panels. SEC. 3. Ensuring full analysis of potential impacts on small entities of rules proposed by certain agencies. Section 609(b) of title 5, United States Code, is amended to require covered agencies to notify the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration before publishing an initial regulatory flexibility analysis. This notification should include information on the potential impacts of the proposed rule on small entities. The proposed rule requires covered agencies to notify the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration about the potential impacts on small entities. Within 30 days, they must identify affected small entity representatives and seek their advice on the draft proposed rule. The draft proposed rule requires covered agencies to convene a review panel consisting of federal employees, the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, and the Chief Counsel to review prepared material. The draft proposed rule mandates covered agencies to establish a review panel comprising federal employees, the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, and the Chief Counsel. The panel is tasked with reviewing agency-prepared material, gathering input from small entity representatives on specific issues, and allowing these representatives to give oral presentations if requested. The review panel established by covered agencies must report to the agency head within 60 days, including comments from small entity representatives and findings on specific issues. The head of the covered agency must publish the review panel's report in the Federal Register within 120 days of receiving it or as part of the proposed rulemaking publication. The agency should make appropriate modifications to the draft proposed rule or regulatory analysis if necessary. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. Amends Section 609(d) of title 5, United States Code to define 'covered agency' as EPA, OSHA, and IRS, and 'small entity representative' as a small entity or its representative. SEC. 5. EFFECTIVE DATE. The Act will take effect 90 days after enactment."
