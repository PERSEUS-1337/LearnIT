For example, if the cost of providing healthcare benefits to women is $100 more than men, insurers may be paid $100 more for women to prevent gender bias in enrollment. One way to level the playing field in enrollment is to risk adjust payments to insurers by paying them $100 more for women than for men. This would make insurers indifferent between enrolling men or women into their plan, considering factors like age, geography, health status, and tobacco use. Risk adjustment models consider factors like age, geography, health status, and tobacco use, but do not fully explain differences in health care spending. This report explains how CMS pays private health plans under Medicare Advantage, how payments are risk adjusted, and how risk scores for MA enrollees are generated and change over time. It also discusses CMS audits of risk-adjusted MA payments and potential issues. Medicare Advantage provides private plan options for Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in both Parts A and B. Health plans receive capitated monthly payments adjusted for demographics and health status of enrollees. CMS audits risk-adjusted payments and discusses potential issues with risk adjustment. The Medicare Advantage plan receives a capitated monthly payment based on the demographics and health status of beneficiaries. The plan is at-risk if costs exceed payments, and can retain savings if costs are less than payments. Payments are based on each plan's estimated cost compared to the maximum amount the government will pay. The federal government pays for benefits in a Medicare Advantage plan's service area based on bids that reflect the plan's estimate of covering an average beneficiary. CMS sets a benchmark, and adjusts payments based on the characteristics of enrolled beneficiaries. Plans receive a base rate equal to the benchmark if their bid is above it, or equal to their bid if below. The current Medicare Advantage risk adjustment methodology adjusts payments to plans based on demographic and health factors of enrollees identified in a base year. This adjustment aims to estimate next year's healthcare expenditures accurately. CMS determines risk adjustment for MA plan payments based on beneficiary demographic and health factors, including age, gender, Medicaid eligibility, disability, and original Medicare eligibility. Incorporating health status into Medicare payments involves using ICD-9-CM codes to diagnose conditions for reimbursement. Physicians submit these codes for accuracy, which helps determine payment adjustments for MA plans. ICD-9-CM codes are used by physicians to denote signs, symptoms, injuries, diseases, and conditions for Medicare reimbursement. There are over 13,000 ICD-9-CM codes organized into diagnostic groups and condition categories. The codes have a hierarchical structure where only the most significant manifestation of a disease is coded for payment purposes. ICD-9-CM Ischemic Heart Disease codes are organized into the Coronary Artery Disease hierarchy, consisting of four CCs arranged in descending order of clinical severity and cost. A person with a code in one CC is excluded from being coded in others, even if codes that group into those categories were also present. Hierarchical coding ensures that the most costly form of the disease dictates the basis for reimbursement. Only 70 HCC codes are currently incorporated into the CMS model, which are chronic codes that best predict Medicare expenditures. Starting in 2012, 87 HCC codes will be included in the model. In 2012, 87 HCC codes will be used to predict Medicare Part A and Part B expenditures. Figure 2 shows how ICD-9-CM codes are converted into HCC codes for a 76-year-old female with various diagnosed conditions. Not all diagnoses result in an HCC code. Some diagnoses do not result in an HCC code, such as acute myocardial infarction and unspecified angina pectoris. Conditions like chest pain and ankle sprain are excluded from the CMS model as they are not chronic or short-term illnesses. The models focus on capturing chronic conditions for predicting Medicare expenditures. The CMS model excludes short-term illnesses and non-chronic conditions, focusing on chronic conditions to predict Medicare expenditures. The model uses the highest code in a related disease category and adds risk factors across unrelated categories. For example, a 76-year-old female's total risk score is the sum of individual risk factors. The risk factors estimated for each condition are depicted in Figure 2, Table 1. A beneficiary's total risk score is calculated by summing individual risk factors, considering disease hierarchy. This score is then multiplied by the MA plan's base rate to determine the risk-adjusted base payment. Presence of multiple conditions can lead to interaction effects, resulting in higher costs than just additive effects. Empirical study has shown interaction effects between multiple conditions, leading to higher costs than just additive effects. For example, health care costs for individuals with both diabetes and congestive heart failure are higher than expected. Additionally, there are interaction effects between certain diseases and disability, resulting in higher costs for individuals with both a disability and diabetes. The CMS-HCC model incorporates interaction effects between disabilities and diabetes, leading to higher healthcare costs than just additive effects. Adjustments to payments for MA plans account for the cost differences based on demographic characteristics and diagnoses through a mathematical model in the CMS-HCC model, which predicts expenditures based on diagnoses and demographic variables. The CMS-HCC model is a linear regression model that predicts healthcare expenditures based on diagnoses (CMS-HCCs) and demographic variables, including interactions between certain diseases and permanent disability. The model uses actual claims data for Medicare Parts A and B, with relative risk factors periodically recalculated using current data. The CMS-HCC model predicts healthcare expenditures based on diagnoses and demographic variables using Medicare Parts A and B claims data. Risk scores can be standardized to reflect costs compared to average Medicare beneficiaries. The risk scores can be standardized to reflect costs compared to average Medicare beneficiaries, allowing CMS to adjust payments to plans based on health status and demographics. This individualized approach aims to predict average expenditures rather than specific individual costs. The CMS estimates adjustments to payments for Medicare Advantage beneficiaries based on risk scores attributed to MA enrollees. New enrollees without 12 months of Part B eligibility have rates based on age, sex, Medicaid status, and original reason for Medicare entitlement. In the preceding calendar year, rates for Medicare Advantage beneficiaries are determined by age, sex, Medicaid status, and original reason for Medicare entitlement, not on diagnoses. CMS collects data from MA plans to update the risk score of each beneficiary. The Encounter Data Processing System (EDPS) allows CMS to update risk scores of MA beneficiaries using encounter level data with dates of service and ICD-9-CM codes. Risk scores can be adjusted twice a year on January 1 and July 1, with data submission and payment updates following a typical schedule. The Encounter Data Processing System (EDPS) allows CMS to update risk scores of MA beneficiaries using encounter level data with dates of service and ICD-9-CM codes. Risk scores can be adjusted twice a year on January 1 and July 1, with data submission and payment updates following a typical schedule. The basis of risk-adjusted payment is data from a prior 12-month period, with few sources of error in the calculation, such as age, gender, disability status, Medicaid eligibility, or disease. Demographic data, disability status, and Medicaid eligibility are typically sourced from administrative files. The health status information for Medicare Advantage plans is submitted to CMS by plans to justify risk-adjusted payments, which are audited by CMS to ensure accuracy and support from medical records. CMS audits Medicare Advantage plans to verify the accuracy of risk-adjusted payments claimed, known as RADV audits. Previously, audits only focused on recovering payment errors from sampled enrollees, but a new proposal aims to extrapolate error rates to the entire plan contract, potentially saving $2.27 billion over five years. In December 2010, CMS released a proposed methodology for auditing plan data and extrapolating contract errors. CMS released a final notice in February 2012 detailing the methodology for auditing Medicare Advantage plans and extrapolating payment errors. Plans may face challenges as CMS aims to recover larger amounts, leading to potential pushback. Audits at the contract level could pose problems for some Part C plans. CMS released a final notice in February 2012 detailing the methodology for auditing Medicare Advantage plans and potential recoveries. Audits are conducted at the contract level, with a three-step process: sampling, medical record review, and error rate calculation/payment adjustment. CMS uses samples to reduce the burden on plans, with 201 enrollees considered a sufficient sample size. The enrollee sample for auditing Medicare Advantage plans is drawn from eligible beneficiaries enrolled in the contract in January of the payment year. Enrollees must meet specific criteria such as continuous enrollment in the same MA contract for 12 months, non-ESRD status, non-hospice status, and Medicare Part B coverage for the entire data collection period. Enrollees for auditing Medicare Advantage plans must have continuous enrollment in the same MA contract for 12 months, non-ESRD status, non-hospice status, and Medicare Part B coverage for the entire data collection period. Eligible enrollees are divided into three equal groups based on specific criteria. The eligible enrollees for auditing Medicare Advantage plans are divided into three equal groups based on specific criteria. The goal is to sample 201 eligible enrollees, with each group consisting of 67 enrollees randomly drawn based on risk scores. Sampling weights are constructed to ensure representation of each group. The eligible enrollees for auditing Medicare Advantage plans are divided into three equal groups based on risk scores. Sampling weights are constructed to represent each group, with each sampled enrollee assigned a weight of 14.925. These weights are used to scale-up the sample payment error findings to the entire population. The Medicare Advantage plan uses multipliers to scale-up sample payment error findings to the population it represents. The plan must provide evidence from medical records to substantiate each HCC code it was paid for within 12 weeks for the sampled enrollees. The CMS contractor reviews the medical records to confirm the diagnosis for risk-adjusted payments. The Medicare Advantage plan must provide evidence from medical records to substantiate each HCC code it was paid for within 12 weeks for sampled enrollees. The CMS contractor reviews the medical records to confirm the diagnosis for risk-adjusted payments. If the record confirms the diagnosis, the payment is justified; if not, it is considered an error. Plans can appeal findings and the final decision is binding unless reviewed by the CMS Administrator. The CMS reviews medical records to confirm diagnoses for risk-adjusted payments in Medicare Advantage plans. Payment errors can be positive (overpayment) or negative (underpayment). Underpayments cannot be supported by submitting additional medical records. Risk scores are corrected based on supported HCCs in the RADV medical record review. The CMS reviews medical records to confirm diagnoses for risk-adjusted payments in Medicare Advantage plans. Payment errors can be positive (overpayment) or negative (underpayment) and are corrected based on supported HCCs in the RADV medical record review. Enrollee-level payment errors are calculated for each sampled enrollee based on the difference between the original payment and the corrected payment. The MA selected contract during the payment year. Estimated payment error for each MA contract is calculated by multiplying the total payment error for each sampled enrollee by the enrollee's sampling weight. The payment recovery amount for each audited MA contract is determined by the lower bound of the 99% confidence interval around the payment error estimate, adjusted by a fee-for-service (FFS) adjuster. The payment error calculation for MA contracts is determined by the lower bound of the 99% confidence interval, adjusted by a fee-for-service (FFS) adjuster to address methodological concerns raised by the American Academy of Actuaries. The calculation involves selecting 201 eligible enrollees per contract for review and establishing a total error in payment for each based on identified errors. The payment error calculation for MA contracts involves selecting 201 eligible enrollees per contract for review. Errors are identified and a total error in payment is established for each enrollee. The impact of each enrollee is then extrapolated to the contract by weighting and adjusting for time in the plan. The sum of errors for the sampled enrollees is calculated, with a hypothetical example showing an estimated plan level error of $1,187.50. A 99% confidence interval is then calculated for the estimated plan error. The estimated plan level error across all enrollees is $1,187.50, with a 99% confidence interval from $1,037.50 to $1,337.50. This interval indicates a certainty of over 99% that the actual error in payment will fall within this range. If the interval includes $0 or is below $0, the recovery amount would be limited to $0. The recovery amount in RADV audit is constrained to $0 if the 99% confidence interval includes $0. If the interval does not include $0, a fee-for-service adjuster modifies the lower bound for reimbursement. Concerns have been raised about risk adjustment in Medicare Advantage. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) and a study on risk adjustment have raised concerns about Medicare Advantage. Plans may manipulate screening efforts to enroll beneficiaries who are below average cost. MedPAC and a study on risk adjustment have raised concerns about Medicare Advantage plans potentially enrolling beneficiaries below average cost to experience below average expenses while being reimbursed at average rates. Special needs plans and PACE plans may enroll high-cost individuals but be reimbursed for average cost enrollees. The American Academy of Actuaries (AAA) expressed concerns about the audit process and the validation of Medicare fee-for-service data used for risk adjustments in Medicare Advantage plans. The American Academy of Actuaries raised concerns about the inconsistency in the audit process for Medicare Advantage plans. They highlighted issues with the validation of Medicare fee-for-service data used for risk adjustments, emphasizing the importance of consistency in developing and applying risk adjustment factors. The American Academy of Actuaries raised concerns about the inconsistency in the audit process for Medicare Advantage plans, emphasizing the importance of consistency in developing and applying risk adjustment factors. The CMS-HCC risk adjustment factors were developed with FFS data that were not validated for accuracy, leading to potential discrepancies in the RADV audit process. The RADV audit may result in inadequate payments for diabetic members if lower-cost enrollees are no longer considered diabetic. This is because the risk score factor associated with diabetes would be understated, leading to potential discrepancies in the audit process. The inconsistency in data validation for diabetics in the RADV audit could lead to underpayment and payment inequities in the risk adjustment system for Medicare Advantage plans. The post-audit risk score may complicate actuaries' estimation of the plan's risk score and certification of the plan bid. Adjusting premium payments to MA plans based on RADV payment-error calculations is a significant change in risk adjustment methodology. The Health Practice Council is concerned that this modified payment methodology may not accurately reflect the enrollees' risk profile in affected MA plans. The final calculation methodology includes a fee-for-service adjustment to address these concerns. More information on the fee-for-service adjuster is forthcoming. The risk adjustment for Medicare Advantage plans may not accurately compensate plans enrolling sicker or healthier beneficiaries. Concerns have been raised about using Medicare fee-for-service data for risk adjustment coefficients. Some plans fear financial risk from recoveries in RADV audits. The risk adjustment coefficients for Medicare Advantage plans are generated to account for the variation in healthcare costs among beneficiaries. Concerns have been raised about financial risks from RADV audit recoveries. Different models have been used for risk adjustment, each increasing in complexity and explanatory power. The appendix briefly describes various risk adjustment models used for Medicare private plan payments, showing the year each model was in use and the percentage of variation in individual expenditures predicted by each model (R2). The range of spending by Medicare beneficiaries varies widely. The range of Medicare beneficiary expenditures varies widely, from $0 for healthy individuals to hundreds of thousands for very ill beneficiaries. Models predict spending based on beneficiary characteristics, with the R2 quantifying the model's predictive accuracy. The AAPCC model has an R2 of 0.0077. The AAPCC model has an R2 of 0.0077, explaining 0.77% of the variation in beneficiary expenditures. CMS's subsequent models have increased the percentage of variation explained, with the most recent proposed model able to explain approximately 12.5% of the expenditure variation. In the year 2000, private plan payments under the Medicare+Choice and TEFRA risk programs were risk adjusted for certain demographic characteristics like age, sex, Medicaid enrollment, institutionalized status, and working aged status. These variables explain less than 1% of the variation in Medicare beneficiary expenditures. The model did not consider health costs. Demographic data explain less than 1% of the variation in Medicare beneficiary expenditures. Private plan enrollees were healthier than original Medicare enrollees, leading to higher payments. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 required CMS to implement a risk adjustment methodology by 2000. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 mandated CMS to implement a risk adjustment methodology by 2000, which led to the use of the PIP-DCG model from 2000 to 2003. This model considered beneficiary health status and the worst principal inpatient diagnosis, but had limitations such as not accounting for illnesses with high expenditures that did not result in hospital admissions. The PIP-DCG model used from 2000 to 2003 had limitations, such as not counting illnesses with high expenditures that didn't lead to hospital admissions. The phase-in schedule for the model was held at 90% demographic-only method/10% PIP-DCG method through 2003 to soften the financial impact on M+C organizations. Starting in 2004, Medicare plan payments were adjusted by the CMS-HCC model. The CMS-HCC model, implemented in 2004, adjusts Medicare plan payments based on the severity of a beneficiary's illness and the cumulative effect of multiple diseases. It considers information from various healthcare settings and compensates for the most severe manifestation reported. The CMS-HCC model, implemented in 2004, adjusts Medicare plan payments based on the severity of a beneficiary's illness and the cumulative effect of multiple diseases. Updates to the CMS-HCC model, such as Version 12, account for changes in diagnosis codes and recalibrate with recent data to explain nearly 10% of the variation in beneficiary expenditures. Version 21 of the CMS-HCC model includes updates to diagnosis codes and recalibration with recent data, increasing predictive power to approximately 12.5%. This version underwent a major clinical revision in 2009 to adjust for changes in disease patterns, treatment methods, and coding practices. Version 21 of the CMS-HCC model, with updates to diagnosis codes and recalibration, increased predictive power to approximately 12.5%. Scheduled for implementation in 2012 for PACE plans."
