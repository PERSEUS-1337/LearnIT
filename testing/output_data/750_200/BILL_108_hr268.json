The United States Weather Research Program, established under the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Authorization Act of 1992, focuses on hurricanes, floods, heavy precipitation, improving weather forecasts, and quick progress in impactful areas. The United States Weather Research Program, established in 1992, focuses on hurricanes, floods, heavy precipitation, and improving weather forecasts. It aims to make quick progress in impactful areas by providing attention and resources, establishing collaborative goals, and making research grants to universities and research institutions. The United States Weather Research Program, established in 1992, focuses on hurricanes, floods, heavy precipitation, and improving weather forecasts. It aims to make quick progress in impactful areas by providing attention and resources, establishing collaborative goals, and making research grants to universities and research institutions. Program research priorities are outlined in Section 3. The United States Weather Research Program's research priorities include improving hurricane forecasts for landfall location and strength, enhancing forecasts for heavy precipitation events like winter storms and rain storms, and improving flood forecasting and warning systems for inland flooding related to tropical cyclones. The United States Weather Research Program focuses on improving hurricane forecasts, enhancing predictions for heavy precipitation events, and developing flood forecasting systems for inland flooding related to tropical cyclones. Additionally, they work on improving short and medium-range weather predictions, filling observational gaps in the Northern Hemisphere, and testing advanced data assimilation techniques in global models.

They also focus on improving short and medium-range weather predictions, filling observational gaps in the Northern Hemisphere, and testing advanced data assimilation techniques in global models. Additionally, the program evaluates societal and economic impacts of adverse weather, identifies effective ways to deliver weather information, assesses the usefulness of weather information to decision makers, and conducts research on societal and economic impacts. The United States Weather Research Program evaluates the usefulness of weather information to decision makers and conducts research on societal and economic impacts. They also test research concepts at test bed centers to enable technology transfer to operational meteorologists. SEC. 4. INTERAGENCY PLANNING AND PROCESS. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration leads the US Weather Research Program, coordinating with other federal agencies to develop a five-year plan for weather research and information dissemination. The US Weather Research Program coordinates with federal agencies to develop a five-year plan for weather research, dissemination of information, and transferring research results to forecasting operations. SEC. 5. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. The Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration must provide an annual report to specific congressional committees, detailing the five-year plan, federal agency roles, funding, and any changes made to the plan. The Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration must provide an annual report to specific congressional committees, detailing the five-year plan, federal agency roles, funding, changes made to the plan, and a detailed assessment of plan objectives achieved. SEC. 6. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Authorization of appropriations for the Office of Atmospheric Research of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration includes $15,000,000 for fiscal year 2004 and $15,500,000 for fiscal year 2005, with at least 50% allocated for grants to institutions of higher education. For fiscal year 2006, $16,000,000 is allocated for competitive grants to institutions of higher education, with at least 50% designated for merit-reviewed grants."
