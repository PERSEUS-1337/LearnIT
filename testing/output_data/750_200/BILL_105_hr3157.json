Congress acknowledges the record-high enrollment in elementary and secondary schools, with an expected increase of over a million students in 1998. The trend is projected to continue for the next decade, with an additional 3 million students expected, particularly in secondary schools. The unprecedented increase in student enrollment, particularly in high poverty urban and rural areas, is expected to rise by more than 13 percent. To accommodate the growing number of students, schools will need to hire 150,000 additional teachers in the next decade. Data from the State of Tennessee's Student/Teacher Achievement Ratio project (Project STAR) supports these findings. The Project STAR study in Tennessee found that students in smaller classes learn more in the early grades, maintain an academic edge even after returning to normal-sized classes, and show that adding students to a classroom diminishes learning for the rest. It emphasizes the importance of adequately educating children for the future and global economy. It is crucial to adequately educate and prepare America's children for the future and global economy. Congress needs to fund positions for teachers without increasing the Federal bureaucracy, deficit, or debt, provide resources to keep up with growing enrollment, and possibly reduce classroom sizes. The grant program is established. The Secretary of Education can award grants to Governors for hiring teachers to reduce overcrowded classes. Governors must apply to be eligible for the grant, and the Secretary cannot disapprove eligible applications. To receive a grant from the Governor, a local educational agency must establish a trust fund for payments, deposit funds into the account, hire new teachers or personnel within 2 years, and use funds only for specified purposes. To receive a grant from the Governor, a local educational agency must establish a trust fund for payments, hire new teachers or personnel within 2 years, use accounting practices stipulated by the Governor, achieve a net gain in teachers, review personnel performance annually, and obligate hired personnel accordingly. The agency must hire qualified personnel, obligate them for a maximum of one year, repay any unspent funds to the State within 27 months, use funds only to supplement non-Federal sources for student education, and not replace existing funds.
