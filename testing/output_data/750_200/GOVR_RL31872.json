    "content": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones, are defined by the Department of Defense as powered aerial vehicles that do not carry a human operator, can fly autonomously or be piloted remotely, and can carry a lethal or nonlethal payload. They are different from RPVs as they are designed to fly autonomously. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), or drones, are designed to fly autonomously and can carry surveillance sensors. They are used in military conflicts like Iraq, Afghanistan, and Kosovo, offering advantages over manned aircraft. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), or drones, are used for tasks historically done by manned aircraft. They offer advantages like eliminating pilot risk and having aeronautical capabilities not limited by humans. UAVs may be cheaper to procure and operate but have a higher crash risk. They perform \"3-D\" missions that don't require a pilot in the cockpit. The lower procurement cost of UAVs must be weighed against their greater crash risk, while the minimized risk should be considered against the dangers of unmanned vehicles sharing airspace with manned assets. UAVs have seen recent growth due to advancements in navigation and communication technology. The preference for manned aviation over unmanned, known as the \"silk scarf syndrome,\" has decreased as UAVs have become more mainstream. Despite being recently procured in significant numbers by the United States, UAVs have a century-old history in aviation. UAVs have a century-old history in aviation, with the Firebee being used in surveillance during the Vietnam War and later modified as an armed UAV in 2002. Israeli Air Force pioneered UAVs in the late 1970s and 1980s eventually integrated into the United States's UAV. The Israeli Air Force pioneered UAVs in the late 1970s and 1980s, which were eventually integrated into the United States's UAV inventory. This marked the transition of UAVs in the United States from experimental projects to acquisition programs. One of the UAVs acquired from Israel, Pioneer, emerged as a useful source of intelligence at the tactical level. The transition of UAVs in the United States from experimental projects to acquisition programs was marked by the acquisition of the Pioneer UAV from Israel. It proved valuable during Operation Desert Storm for intelligence gathering. The Air Force's Predator quickly gained new capabilities and was used in the Balkans conflict for surveillance missions. Operations in Afghanistan featured the Global Hawk for reconnaissance. The use of UAVs in the United States has evolved from experimental projects to acquisition programs. Operations in Afghanistan have showcased the Air Force's Global Hawk and Predator for surveillance missions and armed reconnaissance. Congress has shown increased support for UAVs, with annual investments growing from $667 million in FY2001 to over $1.1 billion in FY2003. The Pentagon has requested $1.6 billion for UAVs. The Pentagon's investment in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has been increasing annually, with funding reaching over $1.1 billion in FY2003 and a request for $1.6 billion in FY2006. Congress has played a proactive role in UAV program management, directing the formation of joint program offices to ensure commonality between services' programs and expressing concerns about the lack of a clear path for the future of UAVs. Congress has advocated for a more aggressive approach to fielding UAVs, with concerns about the lack of a clear path for the future of UAVs. In 1996, the House Armed Services Committee supported legislation to weaponize the Predator and Hunter UAVs, despite DOD opposition. Congress has shown support and confidence in UAV technology, predicting that one-third of the U.S. military would utilize UAVs within ten years. The report accompanying the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 predicted that one-third of U.S. military deep strike aircraft would be unmanned within ten years. The pace of UAV development has accelerated, expanding the scope of missions and applications. Questions arise about managing these efforts cost-efficiently, effectively, and interoperably, avoiding duplication of effort and ensuring responsiveness to congressional direction. Investment priorities may shift as UAVs are introduced into the U.S. inventory. Investment priorities may change as UAVs are integrated into the U.S. inventory. Congress may assess DOD's UAV efforts to ensure alignment with new investment goals and strategies. UAVs are now used in unexpected roles beyond reconnaissance and surveillance, raising questions about cost-effectiveness compared to manned aircraft. The flexibility and capability of UAVs have expanded their roles beyond reconnaissance and surveillance, leading to suggestions that unmanned aircraft could replace manned aircraft in many missions. Congress may need to consider replacing a significant portion of manned aircraft with yet-to-be-designed unmanned aircraft. The main concern with the introduction of a large number of UAVs is the potential for personnel issues to arise. The potential impact of widespread deployment of UAVs on military personnel and the industrial base needs to be considered. If defense companies focus more on developing unmanned aircraft, there may be concerns about the erosion of skills and technologies needed for manned aircraft design. Arguments about UAVs replacing manned aircraft in the future are not conclusive. The potential impact of widespread UAV deployment on military personnel and the industrial base needs consideration. Concerns arise about the erosion of skills and technologies for manned aircraft design as defense companies prioritize unmanned aircraft development. Debates persist on whether UAVs will replace manned aircraft in the future. As U.S. companies compete in the international UAV market, concerns may arise about the proliferation of these systems. Congress may need to assess the balance between supporting U.S. exports and controlling the spread of UAV technologies. Congress may need to evaluate the management of UAVs, considering the growing diversity of designs and applications. Questions arise about the development speed and DoD's plan for incorporating UAVs into future military capabilities. UAV programs vary from combat-tested to not yet tested models. The evolution of UAVs includes combat-tested models like Pioneer, Hunter, Predator, and Global Hawk, as well as not yet tested models like the Air Force and Navy's Unmanned Combat Air Vehicles. UAVs vary in size and range, from the Wasp Micro UAV with a combat radius of 5 nautical miles to the Global Hawk with a combat radius of 5,400 nm. Various UAV programs have been initiated recently, as shown in Figure 1, and the total UAV inventory is outlined in Table 1. The UAV inventory has significantly increased since February 2003, with 604 UAVs including 2nd generation derivatives like Predator B and I-Gnat-ER, as well as non-traditional vehicles like Snow Goose, Onyx, and Neptune. Source: OSD, UAS Roadmap 2005-2030, August 2005. The UAV inventory has increased significantly since February 2003, with 604 UAVs including 2nd generation derivatives like Predator B and I-Gnat-ER, as well as non-traditional vehicles like Snow Goose, Onyx, and Neptune. The increase in DoD's UAV inventory is largely due to the rising demand for UAVs to conduct a wide variety of missions beyond typical ISR applications. The UAV inventory has grown significantly due to increased demand for UAVs to conduct various missions beyond traditional ISR applications. Predator B has strike capabilities, while Predator As have been modified to carry weapons. The Joint-Unmanned Combat Air Systems (J-UCAS) will target air defenses, and UAVs are being considered for roles such as mine detection, border patrol, medical resupply, and force perimeter protection. DOD's UAV research and development funding has also increased due to UAVs being seen as a growth industry. DOD's UAV research and development funding has grown significantly for various reasons, including the industry's growth and the relatively low production costs of UAVs. R&D funding in FY2006 for UAVs is more than double the total procurement funding, indicating continued accelerated acquisition of UAVs in the future. Comparing manned aircraft inventories to unmanned inventories can provide insight into the pace and scope of UAV acquisition. Despite the dominance of manned aircraft in the DoD inventory, UAV production is accelerating. UAVs are seen as complements to manned aircraft rather than replacements. The pace of UAV production is expected to continue or increase in the coming years, according to internal recommendations and the Defense Science Board. The Defense Science Board recommends accelerating UAV production in the coming years, with plans to grow UAV operations in the Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve. Former Air Force Chief of Staff, General John Jumper, supports a faster pace of production for UAVs like the Predator. Former Air Force Chief of Staff, General John Jumper advocated for increased production of UAVs, specifically the Predator, urging General Atomics to maximize their production capacity. This raises concerns about the current pace of UAV development and whether it aligns with Congress's push for faster acquisition and incorporation of capabilities. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 aimed to have one-third of U.S. military deep strike aircraft unmanned within ten years. In 1996, the House Armed Services Committee supported weaponizing the Predator and Hunter drones, despite DoD opposition. Some in the 109th Congress advocated for increased procurement and use of UAVs for non-military purposes. Representative Peter King supported the use of UAVs for non-military roles. Some critics have expressed concerns about the Department of Defense's growing enthusiasm for UAVs, fearing it may lead to a lack of clear direction for the future of UAVs. There are worries that an overly ambitious pace could impact the quality of the end product and the efficiency of the acquisition process, making congressional oversight more challenging. Representative Curt Weldon cautioned against aggressively fielding new UAVs without addressing fundamental issues to ensure they are designed and fielded properly. Some services are purchasing expensive UAVs using operations and maintenance funds. Some services are acquiring expensive UAVs using unauthorized funds, while others are leasing UAV services for combat operations. Congressional oversight has been reduced by incorporating UAV projects into larger program requests. The Global Hawk's rapid development exemplifies the challenges highlighted by Representative Weldon. The Global Hawk program faces challenges due to its ambitious pace, as highlighted in a 2004 GAO report. The report suggests that a slowdown in production and management changes are necessary to address technology immaturity. Some argue that the program's rapid production rate is appropriate despite its problems. Many in Congress support UAV programs but want assurances on taxpayer spending, as seen in Section 142 of the FY2006 Defense Authorization Act. The Defense Authorization Act (H.R. 1815) requires written approval for new unmanned aerial vehicle systems procurement by the military services. Congressional focus includes evaluating DoD's administrative processes for UAV development and acquisition. Heightened attention on DoD's development and acquisition programs has been seen in recent Congresses. The 108th and 109th Congresses have focused on DoD's acquisition process, particularly regarding the Air Force's attempt to lease KC-767 tanker aircraft and the Army's Future Combat System. There is concern about potential duplication of effort in acquiring UAVs by all military services and the U.S. Special Operations Command, leading to calls for centralization of UAV acquisition authority to prevent wasteful duplication. Centralization of UAV acquisition authority is being called for to prevent duplication of effort and reduce wasteful spending. However, concerns exist that too much centralization may stifle competition and innovation. Cost is also a management issue, with UAVs now rivaling manned aircraft in terms of expenses. For example, the Global Hawk program is estimated to cost $6.5 billion for 51 aircraft. According to DoD's estimate, the Global Hawk program will cost $6.5 billion to purchase 51 aircraft, with a unit acquisition cost of $128 million per UAV. The program has seen $194 million in development cost overruns, leading to concerns about cost growth and management practices. Factors like \"mission creep\" and adding multiple sensors have driven up Global Hawk costs. Global Hawk costs have been driven up by adding multiple sensors, requiring larger wings and more powerful engines, increasing the UAV's price. Originally intended to carry one primary sensor, the requirement was changed to carry two or more sensors, further raising costs. The Global Hawk's cost has increased due to the addition of multiple sensors, larger wings, and more powerful engines. The Joint Unmanned Combat Air System (JUCAS) has evolved into a larger aircraft with a heavy payload, leading to increased costs. The DoD has cut over $1 billion from the JUCAS budget and transferred management from DARPA to the Air Force, potentially impacting cost and procurement numbers. The management of UAV programs has undergone various changes over the years, from military services to a Navy-run Joint Program Office (JPO) and then back to the services under OSD. The establishment of the JPO in 1988 faced criticism in Congress, with serious reservations expressed in 1992. The Defense Airborne Reconnaissance Office (DARO) was established in 1993 to manage DoD's airborne reconnaissance programs, including UAVs, after criticism of the Joint Program Office (JPO). DARO was disbanded in 1998 due to ongoing problems and accidents. Since DARO's disbandment in 1998, there has been no centralized procurement focal point for managing DOD UAV efforts. Oversight authority now rests with the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence (OASD(C3I)), while the military services handle program development and acquisition. The OSD established the Joint UAV Planning Task Force in 2001 under the authority of the Pentagon's acquisition chief to increase joint coordination of UAV programs, standardize payload development, and promote a common vision for future efforts. The Joint UAV Planning Task Force, established in 2001 by the OSD, aims to coordinate UAV programs, standardize payload development, and promote a common vision for future efforts. Dr. Glenn Lamartin, Director of Defense Systems, emphasized the task force's role in instituting requirements and providing structure to individual programs. The task force has published three UAV Roadmaps to help realize a common UAV vision. Congressional concerns remain regarding UAV acquisition management. The OSD has published three UAV Roadmaps in April 2001, December 2002, and August 2005. Congressional concerns persist regarding UAV acquisition management and program duplication. Additional management mechanisms have been implemented, including the U.S. Joint Forces Command leading UAV experimentation in 2003. In 2003, the U.S. Joint Forces Command took the lead in UAV interoperability experimentation. The DoD established the UAV Interoperability Working Group for joint-service and international cooperation in UAV programs. The Joint Requirement Oversight Council (JROC) created a UAV Special Studies Group for advisory and action on UAV systems development. The DoD established a UAV Special Studies Group for advisory and action on UAV issues under JROC's purview. In 2005, OSD considered appointing a service as the executive agent for UAV programs, but later abandoned the idea in favor of two smaller organizations focusing on interoperability. The DoD established a UAV Special Studies Group for advisory and action on UAV issues under JROC's purview. In 2005, OSD considered appointing a service as the executive agent for UAV programs, but later abandoned the idea in favor of two smaller organizations focusing on interoperability. The Joint UAV Overarching Integrated Product Team (OIPT) identifies and solves interoperability issues, while the Joint UAV Center of Excellence coordinates with the OIPT to enhance UAV applications through technology examination and training. Management initiatives have aimed to increase system uniformity and interoperability over the past three years. The DoD has established organizations to promote joint coordination of production and address UAV management concerns. The recent establishment of the Joint UAV OIPT and Joint UAV COE is seen as a step in the right direction towards developing a final UAV oversight structure for military needs. The recent establishment of the Joint UAV OIPT and Joint UAV COE is viewed as a positive step towards creating a centralized oversight body for UAV development in the military. This initiative was influenced by a GAO testimony in March 2005, which highlighted the need for better guidance and investment decisions in UAV programs within the DoD. The DoD is considering establishing a centralized oversight body for UAV development, with differing views on its purpose. The UAV Center of Excellence is described as a 'one-stop shop' for evaluating UAV operating systems and usage possibilities. The DoD is considering establishing a centralized oversight body for UAV development, with questions arising over where final management authority resides. Congress may need to address these issues in the future. The Joint UAV Task Force has released UAV Roadmap and UAS Roadmap for the future of U.S. warfighting. The Joint UAV Task Force released the UAV Roadmap and UAS Roadmap to guide the future roles, technological progress, and investment needs of UAVs. The 2005 UAS Roadmap reiterated the need for a strategic plan and clearly defined investment priorities. The 2005 UAS Roadmap outlines strategic goals for UAVs without clearly defined investment priorities, providing guidance on future technology capabilities for warfighters. The 2005 UAS Roadmap offers guidance on incorporating new capabilities for UAVs, without establishing a definitive plan for their development. The difference in authority between the DoD and GAO's views on UAV management may spark debate, leading Congress to reassess recommendations and the Roadmap's mandate for integrating UAVs effectively. Congress may need to review GAO recommendations and assess the Roadmap mandate for integrating UAVs into warfighting capabilities. All military services, SOCOM, and the Coast Guard are investing in UAVs. A coordinated DOD-wide UAV investment strategy is crucial to avoid duplication and maximize resources. Congress can arbitrate between competing UAV investments and impact DOD's investment plan. Key questions include how UAV costs are quantified. Key questions arise regarding UAV cost quantification, spending balance between UAVs and manned aircraft, and balancing cost with capability for DoD, Congress, and UAV manufacturers. Maximizing UAV capabilities through strategic investment is crucial. Quantifying UAV cost efficiency remains a complex task, with various cost measurements such as flyaway cost being commonly used. UAV costs can be measured by flyaway cost and program acquisition unit cost (PAUC). Flyaway cost includes prime mission equipment, systems engineering, program management, and allowances for engineering changes. PAUC is the total acquisition-related appropriations divided by the total quantity of fully configured end items. The PAUC, defined by the Government Accountability Office, is the total acquisition-related appropriations divided by the total quantity of fully configured end items, taking into account previous years' acquisition costs. Global Hawk's PAUC of $128.7 million is significantly higher than its flyaway cost of $64.1 million in FY2005, highlighting the discrepancy between these cost descriptions. Comparing the cost of individual remotely piloted vehicles to other aircraft can be misleading as UAVs operate as part of a system. Comparing the cost of individual remotely piloted vehicles to other aircraft can be misleading as UAVs operate as part of a system, including a ground control station, ground crew, communication links, and other air vehicles. Analysts need to consider the cost of supporting elements and operational infrastructure when evaluating UAV costs. Budgeting conventions can also complicate monitoring UAV costs. Monitoring or evaluating UAV costs can be complicated by budgeting conventions. UAV funding requests are found in different accounts depending on the service branch, making it challenging to build a complete cost picture. Some UAV costs are covered in the Intelligence budget rather than the DOD budget, further complicating cost analysis. Once a uniform cost comparison mechanism is established, the next step for Congress may be to address the issue. The DOD budget complicates cost analysis for UAVs. Congress may need to balance spending between UAVs and manned aircraft. UAV funding is projected to exceed $18 billion from 2001-2010, far surpassing manned aircraft spending. The Department of Defense is projected to have spent over $18 billion on UAVs from 2001-2010, surpassing the $3.5 billion spent in the previous decade. Funding for UAV programs is expected to remain steady, with the Joint Unmanned Combat Air System budget reaching over $1 billion by FY2011. The Department of Defense is projected to have spent over $18 billion on UAVs from 2001-2010, surpassing the $3.5 billion spent in the previous decade. Combat AirSystem is expected to break $1 billion by FY2011, indicating the direction of UAV funding. UAV funding remains under 10% of total military aviation spending, representing only three percent of all military aviation funding. Cost savings have long been touted by UAV advocates as one of the advantages offered by unmanned aircraft over manned aircraft. Critics point out that acquisition cost savings are often negligible as money saved by not having a pilot in the cockpit must be applied to the \"ground cockpit\" of the UAV aircrew operating the UAV from the ground control station. Another cost question concerns personnel, as UAV \"pilots\" may not necessarily cost less to train and keep proficient than pilots of manned aircraft. The cost savings of UAVs over manned aircraft are often debated. While the air vehicle may be cheaper, the overall UAV system may not always be less expensive due to higher attrition and maintenance costs. However, UAV ground control stations can fly multiple UAVs simultaneously, partially offsetting the cost disadvantage. Stations can fly multiple UAVs simultaneously, partially offsetting cost disadvantage. Studies show replacing manned helicopters with UCAVs may not save significant procurement costs. Development costs for manned vs. unmanned aircraft are similar. The DoD studied the costs of manned vs. unmanned aircraft in their UAV Roadmap 2000, finding similar development costs but savings in procurement costs for unmanned combat aerial vehicles. The OSD faces the challenge of balancing cost and capability, with concerns over rising prices of some UAVs expressed by members of the House Armed Services Committee. In a March 9, 2005 hearing, members of the House Armed Services Committee expressed concern over the rising cost of UAVs, including both high-tech and less technologically ambitious models. Former Air Force Secretary James Roche noted that sensors have consistently driven up the cost of UAVs. The design of small UAVs like Desert Hawk and Dragon Eye is inexpensive compared to the cost of their electro-optical/infrared cameras. The cost of UAVs is increasing due to the high cost of sensor payloads, which can represent a significant percentage of the overall vehicle cost. This is driven by growing demand and limited competition in the UAV sensor market. Some suggest equipping UAVs with self-protection devices to address rising sensor costs. UAV sensor producers face little competition, keeping costs down. Some recommend equipping UAVs with self-protection devices as they are no longer considered expendable. Two schools of thought for UAV employment aim to balance cost with capability: fielding many smaller, less expensive UAVs controlled through a highly interconnected network. An example is the Army's Future Combat System, which networks inexpensive UAVs like the Raven, Shadow, and Fire Scout with other weapons platforms. The Army's Future Combat System networks inexpensive UAVs like the Raven, Shadow, and Fire Scout with other weapons platforms. One approach advocates for a robust communications network to distribute mission duties among specialized platforms, while another approach suggests using fewer, more expensive UAVs like the Global Hawk for high altitude surveillance without networked cooperation. The Global Hawk is a high altitude surveillance platform with long endurance, facing delays and funding cuts since 2003. The Army's Future Combat System also experienced delays due to management and technology issues. Investment in UAV interoperability is crucial for maximum effectiveness. Investment in UAV interoperability is crucial for maximum effectiveness, as highlighted by the slow pace of advancement in this area. Lack of interoperability could lead to the Department of Defense losing interest in UAVs. Key issues for UAV effectiveness include interoperability, reliability, force multiplication/autonomy, and engine systems. The DoD's future plans for UAV usage in larger battlefield operations require seamless communication between UAVs and various ground components, as well as compatibility with different ground control systems. The lack of interconnectivity has complicated missions and reduced effectiveness, leading to concerns raised by Dyke Weatherington in 2004. Advancing UAV interoperability is crucial for DoD's future plans. The OSD is investing in establishing inter-communication between UAVs to facilitate interoperability among different categories. The goal is to integrate an interface for situational awareness to improve data sharing and coordination among services and components. The DoD aims to enhance UAV interoperability by integrating interfaces for situational awareness, payload transfer, weapons coordination, and air vehicle control. These interfaces will enable seamless communication and coordination among unmanned aircraft and ground elements. The House of Representatives version of the FY2006 Defense Authorization Act encouraged inter-platform communication by requiring all tactical unmanned aerial vehicles to be equipped with the Tactical Common Data Link for standardized communication. The 2005 Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Roadmap aims to equip all tactical and large unmanned aerial vehicles with the Tactical Common Data Link for standardized communication, essential for real-time situational awareness and targeting data. Achieving interoperability as envisioned by the OSD will require a focus on implementing the Common Data Link. The OSD envisions achieving interoperability for UAVs through the Common Data Link communications system goal. The finite bandwidth available for military aircraft may limit the expansion of UAV applications, especially with the increased use of UAVs in recent wars. The increased use of UAVs in recent wars highlights the growing need for a more robust information transfer system due to the mass consumption of bandwidth. The military currently lacks sufficient bandwidth to download video and radar images from multiple UAVs simultaneously, hindering their effective use according to Representative Curt Weldon. The United States has an extensive fleet of UAVs, but many are grounded due to inadequate bandwidth for effective use. In Iraq and Afghanistan, some UAVs are unable to operate due to limited information transfer capacity. The Transformation Satellite Communications (TSAT) project aims to address this issue by providing unlimited communication capabilities to the U.S. armed forces. The DoD's Transformation Satellite Communications (TSAT) project aims to provide unlimited communication capabilities to the U.S. armed forces using a laser and satellite communications system. The project, also known as \"the internet in the sky\", is facing funding cutbacks and is expected to be deployed between 2015 and 2016. As an interim option, the DoD is considering a more autonomous UAV to reduce bandwidth requirements. One solution to alleviate bandwidth issues for UAVs is to operate them from a manned stand-off aircraft, reducing reliance on satellites for communication. This approach would simplify command and control, address pilot manpower concerns, and potentially decrease bandwidth requirements. Investment in reliability upgrades is a high priority for UAVs to address potential mishap rates that could impede their widespread fielding. Experimentation is ongoing to enable pilots to control UAVs' sensor payload from the air, allowing them to \"fly\" while operating the UAV. The 2005 UAS Roadmap highlights the high UAV mishap rates compared to manned aircraft. The Defense Science Board emphasizes the need for reliability upgrades to reduce mishap rates and improve UAV performance. The UAVs have low mishap rates due to system design improvements and reliability upgrades, except for Predator. Most UAVs have flown missions during development, with Predator and Global Hawk rushed into combat before full operational capability. The DSB's report suggests that investments in emerging technologies could reduce UAV mishap rates. The 2005 UAS Roadmap proposes upgrades like self-repairing flight control systems and heavy fuel engines. The 2005 UAS Roadmap proposes investments in emerging technologies such as self-repairing flight control systems, auto take-off and recovery instruments, heavy fuel engines, and advanced materials to enhance UAV reliability and survivability in adverse environments. One technological priority is enabling one ground operator to pilot multiple UAVs simultaneously. The goal in the industry is to reduce operator workload by enabling one ground operator to pilot multiple UAVs at once. Currently, most UAVs require at least two ground operators, but the end goal is to have a 2:1 operator-vehicle ratio and increase autonomy and interoperability to pilot two or more vehicles. The goal for UAV manufacturers and users is to reduce the 2:1 operator-vehicle ratio and increase autonomy and interoperability. Achieving this would enhance UAVs as a force-multiplier on the battlefield, but significant time and investment are required. The 2005 UAS Roadmap emphasizes the need for control technologies to enable groups of UAVs to work together towards a common objective. Investing in distributed control technologies is crucial for UAVs to work together towards a common objective. Improving autonomous flight capabilities can reduce operator workload. The degree of UAV autonomy varies, with some needing continuous operator intervention in poor weather conditions. The OSD quantifies UAV autonomy on a scale of one to ten. The OSD quantifies UAV autonomy on a scale of one to ten, with the Global Hawk maintaining an ACL of approximately 2.5. UAVs need to achieve a level of at least eight for maximum use when controlled by a single pilot. J-UCAS plans aim to make combat UAVs capable of autonomous flight. Global Hawk, considered one of the most autonomous UAVs in service, has an ACL of 2.5. Plans for J-UCAS aim to increase autonomous flight levels to six. The FAA, UAV industry, and Department of Defense are collaborating on \"see and avoid\" technology to enhance UAV autonomy and potentially raise the standard ACL to four. Inter-UAV communication and interoperability are crucial for matching autonomous flight capabilities. The advancement towards one operator controlling multiple UAVs is already underway, with recent Air Force evaluations showing the ability for one operator to pilot up to four UAVs using the Multi-Aircraft Control system. This system allows for coordinated flight plans and task consolidation among the UAVs. The development of heavy fuel engines for UAVs is a top investment priority, as outlined in the OSD's Unmanned Aviation System Roadmap. The Defense Science Board has urged the DoD to lead in investing in this technology to replace gasoline-powered engines. The Defense Science Board urged the DoD to invest in heavy fuel engines for UAVs due to lack of commercial demand. The military has established the need for these engines, but industry has been slow to respond. The military requires heavy fuel burning engines for UAVs to improve performance, reliability, and reduce maintenance costs. Heavy fuel engines can help UAVs climb faster, operate at higher altitudes, and decrease servicing time on the ground. Additionally, heavy fuel is more cost-effective and readily available compared to other fuel options. The heavy fuel engine for UAVs can improve performance, reliability, and reduce maintenance costs. It is cheaper and more abundant than gasoline. However, applying heavy fuel engines to medium-sized UAVs like Shadow, Pioneer, and Predator may increase initial acquisition costs and production costs. Developers are facing challenges in designing the engine. Developers are facing challenges in designing an engine light and small enough for lighter UAVs, with the cost being a concern. An alternative being considered is a modified fuel cell that could double efficiency and reduce detection and targeting risks. Air Combat Command is sponsoring the project to use fuel cells in smaller UAVs. The Air Combat Command is sponsoring a project to use fuel cells in smaller UAVs to make them more difficult to detect and target. Questions arise about the DoD's coherent plan for UAV roles and applications, including whether UAVs are being applied to new roles aggressively enough and if there are alternatives to consider for their missions. Most UAVs are primarily used for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions. ISR applications vary from high altitude missions by the Global Hawk to reconnaissance and sniper spotting by the Army's Raven UAV. In 2003, all of DoD's major UAV programs focused on ISR. In 2005, 87 percent of major UAV programs are designed for ISR missions, indicating diversification and rapid growth. Concerns arise about unnecessary duplication due to the increase in ISR UAV production. Some question if the development of UAVs will face the same challenges as joint manned aircraft in the past. The differentiation among ISR UAVs lies in their altitude, communications range, flight endurance, and landing/takeoff procedure. Congress may intervene in the future regarding UAV procurement. The differentiation among ISR UAVs lies in altitude, communications range, flight endurance, and landing/takeoff procedure. Congress may intervene in future UAV procurement decisions. ISR-capable UAVs typically have an endurance of 4 to 8 hours, altitude of 10,000-20,000 ft, max speeds between 105 and 125 knots, and radiuses of 100 to 150 nm. Critics question the need for multiple UAVs with similar performance capabilities, suggesting a consolidated inventory of RQ-4B Global Hawk, RQ/MQ-1 Predator, and RQ-2 Pioneer could fulfill the same duties. However, proponents argue that basic performance capabilities alone do not justify the necessity of diverse UAV platforms. In recent years, the role of UAVs in combat missions has significantly increased, with the first public acknowledgment of UAVs being used for combat operations in 2002. Critics question the need for multiple UAVs with similar performance capabilities, while proponents argue that the variety of UAVs reflects the specific needs of missions and users, taking into account factors such as landing/takeoff capabilities, durability, storage requirements, and overall cost. The use of UAVs in combat operations has significantly increased since 2002, with various types of UAVs now equipped with different munitions for offensive applications. The J-UCAS program aims to create the first UAV designed primarily for offensive missions, making UAVs a valuable tool for delivering air-to-ground munitions. The use of UAVs in combat operations has increased, with the J-UCAS program aiming to create the first UAV for offensive missions. Cost and effectiveness comparisons between manned and unmanned aircraft are necessary to determine when using UAVs for combat operations is more advantageous. The MQ-9 Predator B costs $11.7 million, while the F-16 Falcon costs $35.5 million and can carry four times the payload of the Predator B. The F-16 Falcon costs $35.5 million and can carry four times the payload of the Predator B, making it more cost-effective for air-to-ground combat missions. The Predator B costs $11.7 million and has a higher cost per pound of munitions delivered compared to the F-16. The F-16 is a versatile combat aircraft that can perform missions the Predator B cannot, suggesting that manned aircraft may generally be more cost-effective for combat operations. UAVs are more cost-effective than manned aircraft for niche circumstances like extreme danger. Other missions include electronic attack and psychological operations. UAVs like the Army's Shadow are studied for delivering medical supplies. UAVs are well established in foreign theaters, with new missions for homeland defense and security. Coast Guard is involved in UAV missions. Interest is growing in using UAVs for homeland defense and security, with plans to deploy them for coastal waters surveillance, border patrol, and protection of critical infrastructure like oil and gas pipelines. Congressional support exists for using UAVs like the Predator for border security, with domestic agencies being considered for carrying out this mission. Interest is increasing in using UAVs for various domestic roles, such as long-duration law enforcement surveillance and security tasks like following trucks with hazardous cargo. The GoldenEye 100 UAV is expected to play a role in these missions. The Energy Department is developing high-altitude instruments to measure radiation in the atmosphere. The GoldenEye 100 UAV is a cost-effective option for medium-range transport and could be used by local law enforcement during civil unrest. UAVs may also be utilized in remote areas of the western United States for forest fire detection. Global Hawk UAVs could assist in disaster relief efforts post-natural disasters like Hurricane Katrina. Countries like South Korea and Japan have been using UAVs for agricultural purposes for years. UAV advocates emphasize the need for FAA regulations to align with UAV safety requirements for their involvement in homeland security. Meeting this common ground is a primary challenge, as stated by FAA spokesman William Shumann. The FAA is working with the Department of Defense to develop vehicles that meet safety requirements for flying in crowded airspace. The Air Force has received a certificate of authorization for national airspace operation, marking progress towards reconciling discrepancies. Upgrading UAVs collision avoidance capabilities is crucial for reaching common ground. The FAA's Unmanned Aircraft Systems Working Group will collaborate with the Department of Defense to ensure safe UAV operations and flight requirements. The Defense Department is working on integrating UAVs into national airspace, with the FAA collaborating to ensure safe operations. There are concerns about the cancellation of funding for a program to facilitate UAV incorporation, which could hinder progress. Advocates of UAVs are concerned about the disbanding of Access 5, which could impede the development of UAVs and their global applications. In the future, large UAVs could potentially take on aerial refueling tasks currently done by manned tanker aircraft. The Defense Department has not yet planned to explore this role, but it could be a suitable mission for unmanned aircraft. The flight profiles of KC-10 and KC-135 aircraft are relatively benign, operating far from enemy air defenses. The refueling crew's main job is to keep the aircraft flying straight and level while refueling Air Force aircraft. Global Hawk UAVs have demonstrated the ability to fly missions similar to aerial refueling. Future tasks may include air-to-air combat, with the DOD experimenting with outfitting UAVs with sensors and weapons for such missions. The DOD is exploring the possibility of outfitting UAVs for air-to-air combat missions. A Predator UAV reportedly engaged in air-to-air combat with an Iraqi fighter aircraft, launching a Stinger missile before being shot down. This development, though in its early stages, signifies a significant step towards UAVs performing challenging aerial combat missions. The recent Predator launch of an air-to-air missile is a significant development in UAV capabilities for combat missions. Various platforms like manned aircraft, blimps, and space satellites offer advantages and disadvantages for these roles. Some defense contractors are developing unmanned blimps that can float for months at 70,000 feet, carrying 4,000 pounds of payload. The OSD's 2005 UAS Roadmap includes lighter-than-air blimps for various roles like psychological operations and border monitoring, offering cost-effective border surveillance compared to UAVs. However, these platforms have a drawback of lacking flexibility. Lighter-than-air platforms offer cost-effective border surveillance compared to UAVs, with potential to carry out various missions for homeland security. Space satellites provide advanced capabilities but can be cumbersome to task due to competing national priorities and limited availability. The limited number of space satellites can serve only a few customers at a time, lacking the loitering capability of UAVs. Due to high costs, UAVs like Global Hawk are being considered as substitutes for satellite constellations. Concerns exist about UAVs replacing manned aircraft in large numbers. Critics warn that mass UAV production may lead to a decline in pilot skills and the loss of tactical flexibility in combat operations. Aviation culture has struggled to adapt to flying aircraft remotely. Deputy Secretary of Defense Wolfowitz encourages pilots to consider UAV piloting as a major mission. The Air Force is encouraging rated pilots to consider piloting UAVs as a major mission, offering incentives such as plum assignments and allowing pilots to maintain manned flying hours. This shift aims to address retention concerns as more UAVs are fielded, challenging the belief that recruitment and retention would suffer due to a preference for manned aircraft over unmanned ones. The future impact of DoD's UAV programs on recruitment and retention is more complicated than just a preference for manned aircraft over unmanned ones. While the Army is facing recruitment difficulties, the Air Force and Navy are actively reducing their number of uniformed personnel. Therefore, the reduced enlistments due to increased UAV use may not have the anticipated impact. Increased UAV use may not have the anticipated impact on recruitment and retention due to different qualifications required for UAV operators in the military services. The Air Force requires pilot-rated officers for Predator and Global Hawk operators, while other services do not have this requirement, reducing competition between manned and unmanned aircraft for pilots. Many enlist in the military without the intention to fly manned aircraft, and some lack the physical qualifications to do so. The increased use of UAVs in the military may attract personnel who are not qualified to fly manned aircraft or who have no desire to do so. Flying armed UAVs could be more appealing to those inclined to fly manned aircraft, and flying UAVs may be seen as a compromise for certain personnel. The Air Force believes that flying non-armed UAVs from control stations in the United States will be attractive to some Reservists and Guardsmen who may not want to experience the hardships of flying manned aircraft. UAVs like Global Hawk that operate autonomously do not require a pilot, unlike the Predator and other remotely piloted vehicles. The Air Force's UAVs, such as Global Hawk, can operate autonomously without a pilot. However, the Air Force maintains that their UAVs are more technologically advanced and require a trained pilot for effective operation. As UAV autonomy improves, there may be a review of the policy requiring pilot-rated officers to operate UAVs. Increased use of UAVs could attract enlistment in other specialties if they are seen as effective in their missions. Increased use of UAVs could potentially boost enlistment in other specialties, especially if perceived as offering improved force protection and CAS capabilities over manned aircraft. Congress faces defense industrial base issues regarding dependency on foreign suppliers, government subsidies for foreign competitors, and the encouragement or discouragement of defense industry consolidation. The use of UAVs in defense raises concerns about funding for manned aircraft programs and the erosion of technical expertise. Congress must address issues related to defense industrial base dependency on foreign suppliers, government subsidies for competitors, and industry consolidation. As funding for manned aircraft programs decreases, there are concerns about the erosion of technical expertise in designing combat aircraft. Some argue that the U.S. should protect its ability to produce world-class combat aircraft, while others believe that the future lies in advanced UAVs. The debate centers around whether the industrial base is evolving towards UAVs or risking atrophy. Some argue that focusing solely on unmanned aircraft design could lead to the loss of crucial skills and technologies needed for tactical manned aircraft. They believe that UAVs, while effective, will not replace manned aircraft in the near future, potentially causing a decline in U.S. dominance in tactical aircraft design. Some believe that critical manned aircraft design skills are not at risk with the increased focus on UAVs, as there are similarities in requirements between manned and unmanned combat aircraft. Major defense contractors are shifting towards unmanned aircraft design to stay competitive, as UAVs are playing a significant role in modern warfare. Major defense contractors like Boeing and Northrop Grumman are focusing on unmanned aircraft design to remain competitive in the evolving landscape of warfare. The skills and technologies needed for building manned aircraft are also applicable to unmanned aviation design, making it a promising area for growth. Boeing has created a new business unit to pursue UAV business aggressively. The global UAV market is growing rapidly, with estimates showing expenditures doubling from $2.1 billion in 2005 to $5 billion in 2014. The global market for combat aircraft is much larger at approximately $12.5 billion in 2005, but the UAV market is projected to grow at a faster rate. The global market for combat aircraft is much larger than the UAV market, but the UAV market is projected to grow at a faster rate. Capturing new business in the UAV market is crucial to prevent other countries from taking over. Developing expertise in UAV technology areas is essential for U.S. companies to stay competitive. Developing expertise in UAV technology areas is crucial for U.S. industry to remain competitive and healthy. The global growth of UAVs raises concerns about proliferation and export controls, with policy makers focusing on the difficulty of controlling UAV and cruise missile proliferation. The proliferation of UAVs with weapon payloads is a concern for policy makers due to difficulties in controlling their spread and the potential accessibility to various countries or non-state actors. The proliferation of UAVs with weapon payloads is a concern for policy makers due to difficulties in controlling their spread and the potential accessibility to various countries or non-state actors. Al Qaeda has used UAVs to monitor Pakistani soldiers, which could be cost-effective weapons and pose a threat if armed. The George W. Bush Administration expressed concern over the military effectiveness of UAVs in the wrong hands. Prior to Operation Iraqi Freedom, White House and DoD officials focused on Iraq's UAVs and their potential use in attacking neighboring countries with weapons of mass destruction. Foreign companies are gaining access to technologies that could enhance future UAV capabilities, such as stealth technology and efficient engines. As the use of UAVs increases, policymakers may need to address policy issues related to exports of advanced technologies. As the use of UAVs increases, policymakers may need to address policy issues related to exports of advanced technologies to prevent dissemination of critical UAV technologies and balance military aid to allies with concerns about weapon system proliferation. The use of UAVs for ISR can help reduce collateral damage and positively identify enemy combatants. Policymakers may need to consider revising non-proliferation accords to control the spread of UAVs and their technology, balancing the benefits of reducing collateral damage with the risk of enemy acquisition and use against the United States. The section discusses the need for tighter controls on UAVs, particularly in relation to non-proliferation accords like the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR). It focuses on the status and funding of prominent UAV programs pursued by the Department of Defense, without providing a comprehensive survey or classification system for different types of UAVs. The subsection \"Small UAVs\" describes man-portable UAVs with short range and loiter time, not weaponized and lacking detailed cost documentation. These UAVs are popular with ground forces but receive less congressional attention compared to larger UAV programs like Predator or Global Hawk. They are likely to increasingly compete with major UAVs. The man-portable UAVs, although smaller in size, are gaining more congressional attention and funding, competing with larger UAV programs like Predator and Global Hawk. The MQ-1 Predator, developed by General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, has become the most recognizable UAV for the Department of Defense due to its high-profile use in Iraq and Afghanistan, integrated surveillance payload, and armament capabilities. This has led to accelerated development schedules and increased procurement funding for the Predator. The MQ-1 Predator UAV, developed by General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, is known for its integrated surveillance payload and armament capabilities. It has enjoyed accelerated development schedules and increased procurement funding. The Predator is a medium-altitude, long-endurance UAV with long, thin wings and a tail like an inverted \"V\". Operating at 10,000 to 15,000 feet, it can reach a maximum altitude of 25,000 feet. The MQ-1 Predator UAV operates at 10,000 to 15,000 feet for optimal imagery, with a maximum altitude of 25,000 feet. It can stay on station 500 nautical miles away for 24 hours. The Air Force's Predator fleet is operated by the 11th, 15th, and 17th Reconnaissance Squadrons. The CIA also operates Predators for reconnaissance and target missions. The Predator UAV is used for reconnaissance and target acquisition with a 450-lb surveillance payload including cameras and a Multi-Spectral Targeting System sensor ball for tracking moving targets. The CIA also operates Predators for similar missions. The Predator UAV is equipped with a Multi-Spectral Targeting System sensor ball for tracking moving targets and a synthetic aperture radar for seeing through inclement weather. It also has satellite communications for beyond line-of-sight operations and the ability to carry two Hellfire missiles for precision attacks on time-sensitive targets. The addition of anti-tank ordinance allows the UAV to launch precision attacks on time-sensitive targets with minimized \"sensor-to-shoot\" time cycle. The Air Force changed the Predator's military designation from RQ-1B to MQ-1. The MQ-9 Predator B is General Atomic's follow-on to the MQ-1, aiming to advance its mission capabilities. The Predator B, General Atomic's follow-on to the MQ-1, is a medium-to-high altitude UAV optimized for surveillance, target acquisition, and armed engagement. It is longer and has a larger wingspan than its predecessor, with a more powerful engine allowing for higher altitude, speed, and endurance capabilities. The Predator B, General Atomic's successor to the MQ-1, has upgrades that include a more powerful engine, reaching a maximum altitude of 50,000 feet, a speed of 225 knots, and an endurance of 32 hours. It can carry up to 16 Hellfire missiles or a mix of other weapons, making it more capable than its predecessor. Predator B, known as \"Mariner,\" is a hybrid of the Predator B and NASA's Altair UAV, created for the Navy's BAMS program. It can carry up to 16 Hellfires or a mix of 500-pound weapons and Small Diameter Bombs, similar to an F-16's payload. Raytheon has also developed a mini-UAV called \"Silent Eyes\" for target identification. The Mariner UAV, a hybrid of Predator B and NASA's Altair UAV, was created for the Navy's BAMS program. It has an extended range with an 86 ft. wing from the Altair, capable of flying at altitudes of 50,000 feet and endurance of 49 hours. General Atomic partnered with Lockheed Martin to integrate a maritime radar for advanced surveillance capabilities. General Atomics is developing the Mariner UAV with an exterior-mounted maritime radar to enhance surveillance capabilities. The Mariner aims to compete with Northrop Grumman's Global Hawk for the BAMS contract, with a target flyaway cost of $19 million per vehicle. Additionally, General Atomics is working on the Predator C, a third-generation UAV with a turbo-jet engine for long-endurance, high-altitude missions. The Predator C will have a similar payload capacity and flight performance to the Global Hawk. The Predator C, developed by General Atomics, will use the fuselage of the Predator B and have similar payload capacity and flight performance to Northrop Grumman's Global Hawk. It is not intended to directly compete with the Global Hawk. The I-Gnat-ER, used by the Army as a gap-filler for the RQ-5 Hunter, is described as a downsized version of the Predator UAV. The I-Gnat-ER, a surveillance and reconnaissance platform manufactured by General Atomics, is an upgraded version of the Gnat-750. It has similar characteristics to the MQ-1 Predator A but can stay in the air for 30 hours, lacks SAR and BLOS capabilities, and has a shorter flight radius. The Army owns three I-Gnat vehicles, with two equipped with SATCOM. The Army owns three I-Gnat vehicles, with two equipped with SATCOM, MTS sensor/target designators, and Hellfire missiles. The I-Gnat will continue to augment Hunter operations in Iraq. Predator UAVs are operated as part of a system with four air vehicles, a ground control station, and a Predator Primary Satellite Link. The current year cost for one Predator A system was approximately $18.0 million in FY2005. The Air Force currently has 57 deployable MQ-1 Predators and 6 MQ-9 Predator Bs, with plans to increase the latter to 46 by FY2011. General John Jumper stated that Predators are valued assets for the Air Force. The Air Force values Predators as assets. General John Jumper emphasized the importance of building more Predators. However, the initial operation capability of Predator B has been delayed to FY2009 to ensure proper infrastructure and strategies are in place. Congressional funding for Predator R&D and Procurement increased in FY2005 and FY2006. In FY2005 and FY2006, Congressional appropriators increased funding for Predator R&D and Procurement from the President's Budget Request. Senate Authorizers supported research on integrating \"Viper Strike\" munitions on the Predator. See Table 7 for complete budget activity details. The Pioneer UAV, developed by Israeli Aircraft Industries, has served the Navy, Army, and Marine Corps for nearly twenty years. It was used during Operation Desert Storm in 1991 for reconnaissance and Naval gun spotting missions. The Pioneer UAV, used by the Navy, Marine Corps, and Army, was employed during Operation Desert Storm in 1991 for reconnaissance and gun spotting missions. The Navy ended its use in FY2002, passing assets to the Marine Corps, which plans to use the RQ-2 until 2010 or until a VTUAV is ready. The Pioneer is known for its durability and has undergone performance upgrades. It is 14 feet long, half the size of the Air Force's MQ-1 Predator A. The Pioneer UAV, known as \"Old Reliable,\" has undergone performance upgrades and is 14 feet long. It can reach a maximum altitude of 15,000 feet and has a flight range of 100 nautical miles. The propeller-driven SF-350 piston engine allows for up to five hours of flight time. Since 1986, the Pioneer has flown over 36,500 hours. The Pioneer UAV can stay aloft for up to five hours and has flown over 36,500 hours since 1986. It can land on a runway or be recovered with a retrieval net. The mission of the Pioneer is to provide real-time intelligence and reconnaissance capabilities to field commanders, with a payload including an E-O/IR camera. Other demonstrated payloads include a meteorological sensor and a mine detection sensor. The Pioneer UAV, with a 75 lb payload including an E-O/IR camera, has various demonstrated payloads such as a meteorological sensor and a mine detection sensor. The Navy planned to retire the Pioneer in 2004 but transferred all systems to the Marine Corps. Current procurement funds focus on post-production support and upgrades, with no new system or vehicle procurement appropriations in recent years. In FY2005 and FY2006, DoD's Pioneer procurement requests focused on upgrade kits only, with no new system or vehicle procurement appropriations. The Pioneer system, costing $17.2 million in FY2004 dollars, includes five vehicles, a ground control station, and launch/recovery devices. The Marine Corps currently operates 35 Pioneer UAVs at various locations. Northrop Grumman's RQ-4 Global Hawk is the largest and most expensive UAV currently in operation for the Department of Defense, with diverse surveillance capabilities that rival manned spy planes. The Global Hawk's success in surveillance missions has positioned it as a key player in the future of ISR. The RQ-4 Global Hawk, a successor to the RQ-4B, is crucial for ISR. Despite challenges in adding intelligence systems, its high altitude and endurance are impressive. Concerns over costs have slowed its development. The Global Hawk is comparable in size to a medium corporate jet, flies at high altitudes, and has extensive surveillance capabilities. Global Hawk, at 44 feet long and 26,750 lbs, is as large as a medium corporate jet. It flies at twice the altitude of commercial airliners, staying aloft at 65,000 feet for up to 35 hours. Capable of flying 5,400 nautical miles, loitering at 60,000 feet for 24 hours, and returning, it was designed as an autonomous drone but requires frequent operator intervention. The RQ-4B is similar to the RQ-4A but with a larger airframe. The RQ-4B Global Hawk UAV, designed by Northrop Grumman, features a larger airframe than the RQ-4A, with increased length and wingspan. This allows it to carry an extra 1000 lbs. of surveillance payload, providing military commanders with persistent high-quality imagery for surveillance purposes. The RQ-4B Global Hawk UAV by Northrop Grumman offers a long-dwell presence with high-quality imagery for military commanders. Its imagery payload includes sensors like SAR, MTI, digital camera, and IR sensor. The RQ-4B has an open-system architecture for carrying multiple payloads. The RQ-4B Global Hawk UAV has an open-system architecture that allows it to carry multiple intelligence payloads, including signals intelligence and electronic intelligence sensors. It will also be equipped with the Multi-Platform Radar Technology Insertion Program (MP-RTIP) payload to enhance radar capabilities. Future plans involve adding hyper-spectral sensors for improved imagery precision and incorporating laser communications for better information transfer. Future plans for the RQ-4B Global Hawk UAV include adding hyper-spectral sensors for increased imagery precision and incorporating laser communications for expanded information transfer capabilities. The end goal is to create a UAV that works with space-based sensors to prevent enemies from establishing a tactical surprise. In August 2003, the Federal Aviation Administration granted the Global Hawk authorization to fly in U.S. civilian airspace, further expanding its mission potential for anti-drug smuggling and Coast surveillance. The Global Hawk UAV, developed by Northrop Grumman Corporation, is considered for anti-drug smuggling and Coast Guard operations. The RQ-4A is expected to reach initial operational capability in 2006. The Air Force plans to acquire 51 Global Hawks at a cost of $6.6 billion. Currently, the Air Force has 12 RQ-4A vehicles. The Air Force plans to acquire 51 Global Hawks at a cost of $6.6 billion. Currently, they possess 12 RQ-4A vehicles. The program-unit cost for the Global Hawk is $128.7 million. The program had overrun by 18% due to increasing aircraft capacity for more sophisticated sensors. The program had increased by nearly $900 million since 2001, leading to a recommendation to delay future purchases. The Government Accountability Office recommended delaying future Global Hawk purchases due to a $900 million cost increase since 2001. Concerns over rising costs and Air Force mismanagement have sparked debate in Congress and the Pentagon. The FY2005 Defense Authorization Bill criticized the Air Force for not using authorized funds for a counter-drug surveillance program. The Air Force's management strategy was criticized for not using authorized funds for a counter-drug surveillance program, leading to a cut in the R&D request for the Global Hawk. The House Appropriations Committee expressed concern over the Air Force's accelerated development strategy and reduced the president's budget request for advanced programs. In June 2004, the House Appropriations Committee cut the president's budget request for Air Force procurement by $21.3 million for advanced procurement and $89.86 million for current year procurement. One RQ-4A was transferred to the Navy for FY2005. The cuts did not survive conference, and the Air Force's procurement budget request was fully funded for FY2005. In December 2004, Michael Wynne emphasized that DoD would not purchase UAVs that cost as much as manned aircraft of equivalent capabilities. In early 2005, the Air Force planned to restructure the Global Hawk program to lower costs and achieve Initial Operational Capability by the end of the year. The House Appropriations Committee reduced the President's FY2006 procurement request for Global Hawk by $110 million and increased R&D funding by $21 million. Final decisions are pending Senate approval. The House Appropriations Committee reduced the President's FY2006 procurement request for Global Hawk by $110 million, advanced procurement request by $10 million, and increased Global Hawk R&D by $21 million. Final appropriations and authorizations are pending Senate approval. Originally co-developed by Israel Aircraft Industries and TRW (now owned by Northrop Grumman), the Hunter system has become one of the Army's principal unmanned platforms, deployed for tactical ISR in support of ground operations worldwide. The Hunter system, a key Army unmanned platform, was initially planned to acquire 52 integrated systems but faced program turbulence. The RQ-5A production was canceled in 1996, with 18 MQ-5B Hunter IIs acquired later. The MQ-5B offers longer endurance and can be equipped with anti-tank munitions, currently operated by the 224th Military Intelligence Battalion. The MQ-5B Hunter II has longer endurance and can carry anti-tank munitions. It is operated by multiple military intelligence battalions and has improved characteristics such as higher altitude, speed, and flight time compared to the RQ-5A. The MQ-5B Hunter II has an elongated wingspan of 34.3 feet and a more powerful engine, allowing it to stay airborne for three extra hours and reach altitudes of 18,000 feet. The Army has explored expanding the Hunter's missions to include weaponization for tactical reconnaissance/strike operations and border surveillance for the Department of Homeland Security. The Hunter primarily uses a gimbaled E-O/IR sensor payload for ISR functions. The Hunter II, with an elongated wingspan of 34.3 feet and a more powerful engine, can stay airborne for three extra hours and reach altitudes of 18,000 feet. It has been tested with a new ground operated SAR/MTI sensor for potential Tactical Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Radar (TUAVR) use. The Hunter II is also set to receive an advanced software architecture for easier integration of future payloads and to extend its service-life. Northrop Grumman tested various munitions for the Hunter payload, including the Viper Strike precision guided munitions. Northrop Grumman tested Viper Strike precision guided munitions for the Hunter payload, making it the Army's first armed UAV. The Army has halted production on the RQ-5 Hunter and now uses the I-Gnat-ER to fill service gaps. All 32 Hunter UAVs are still operational and receive upgrades periodically. The Hunter system consists of eight aircraft and ground control. In February 2005, all 32 Hunter UAVs were still operational and received upgrades. The Hunter system includes eight aircraft, ground control systems, and support devices. The final year of Hunter procurement in FY2004 cost $26.5 million. The Army awarded General Atomic's Warrior UAV the contract for the Extended Range-Multi Purpose (ER-MP) UAV program in August 2005, despite Northrop Grumman's loss with the Hunter II. Northrop Grumman plans to continue marketing the Hunter II despite losing the ER-MP UAV program. The Army selected AAI's RQ-7 Shadow for its TUAV program after exploring various options, including the cancelled RQ-6 Outrider system. The Army opted for the low-cost, simple design of the RQ-7 Shadow 200 in 1997 after considering other alternatives. Built by AAI Corporation, the Shadow has a wingspan of 13 feet, a range of 68 nautical miles, and an average flight duration of five hours. It is the primary airborne ISR tool for many Army units worldwide and is expected to remain in service through the decade. The RQ-7 Shadow is an Army UAV with a wingspan of 13 feet and a range of 68 nautical miles. It has a maximum altitude of 14,000 feet but operates best at 8,000 feet. The UAV is launched from a rail-launcher and has automatic takeoff and landing capabilities. The upgraded RQ-7B version has a larger wingspan and fuel capacity, allowing for two extra hours of flight endurance. It provides real-time reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition information to the Army at the brigade level, with potential missions including medical resupply. The RQ-7 Shadow UAV provides surveillance and target acquisition information to the Army at the brigade level. It is being considered for a medical resupply role, delivering crucial items to troops via parachute. The UAV's payload includes an E-O/IR sensor turret for day or night video relayed in real-time to a ground station. Unlike the RQ-5 Hunter, the Shadow does not have weapons capabilities. The RQ-7 Shadow UAV is equipped with a sensor turret for day or night video relayed in real-time to a ground station. The Army plans to outfit it with the Tactical Common Data Link to network the UAV with battalion commanders and ground units. The program currently has an inventory of 100 Shadow UAVs at various military bases and National Guard units. The Army's Shadow UAV program includes four vehicles, ground control equipment, launch and recovery devices, remote video terminals, and High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles for transportation. The program cost reached $16.4 million in FY2005. The Army plans to use the Shadow as the interim Class III TUAV for the future combat systems project, expected to reach IOC in 2014. In FY2005, eight TUAV systems were procured, with a $26 million request in FY2006 for retrofitting the existing Shadow fleet. Total RDT&E requests were $53.6 million in FY5 and $139.6 million. In FY2006, $26 million was allocated for retrofitting the existing Shadow fleet with upgrades. The Pentagon developed UAVs for combat missions in the mid-1990s, resulting in separate UCAV programs for the Air Force and Navy. The Air Force favored Boeing's X-45 for its program. The Air Force and Navy had separate Unmanned Aerial Combat Vehicles (UCAV) programs, with Boeing's X-45 favored by the Air Force and Northrop Grumman's X-47 Pegasus and Boeing's X-46 competing for the Navy's project. In June 2003, the Pentagon merged the programs to establish the Joint Unmanned Combat Air Systems (J-UCAS) project under DARPA to create a flexible offensive network for specific combat missions. The Joint Unmanned Combat Air Systems (J-UCAS) project was established in June 2003 by merging separate UCAV programs from the Air Force and Navy. DARPA was directed to transfer administration to the Air Force as part of Program Budget Decision 753 in December 2004. The program consists of two variants with a length of 39 feet and a wingspan of 49 feet, aiming to maintain a competitive environment between Boeing and Northrop Grumman. The X-45C, part of the J-UCAS project, is a hybrid of previous Air Force and Navy programs. It has a length of 39 feet, a wingspan of 49 feet, and is powered by a GE F404-102D turbojet engine. Capable of speeds up to 450 knots and altitudes of 40,000 feet, it can stay aloft for seven hours and operate at a range of 1,200 nautical miles. Boeing focused on maximizing the UAV's stealth capabilities during its engineering. Boeing's X-45C UAV can stay aloft for up to seven hours and has a range of 1,200 nautical miles. The airframe design maximizes stealth capabilities, resembling the B-2 Spirit Bomber. Northrop Grumman's X-47B, a competitor, has a larger wingspan of 62 feet, allowing for nine hours of endurance and a range of 1,600 nautical miles. The X-47B, equipped with a Pratt & Whitney F100-220U turbojet engine, has a nine-hour endurance and a range of 1,600 nautical miles. It features folding wing-tips for storage on aircraft carriers and a common operating system for both Air Force and Naval technology. The aircraft has automated flight capabilities and is optimized for stealth. Both the X-45 and the Navy's UCAV have automated flight capabilities. The Air Force's X-45 is focused on suppression of enemy air defenses and electronic attack warfare, while the Navy's UCAV is intended for armed intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions. Both aircraft will have internal weapons bays and be able to carry guided weapons similar to conventional strike aircraft. Both Boeing and Northrop Grumman's UCAV systems will have internal weapons bays and carry guided weapons like the GBU-31 JDAM. They will feature SARs, ESM sensor suites, and GMTI. The X-47B will also have an E-O/IR camera for surveillance missions. The UCAV programs have faced changes in administration, potentially affecting development pace. The UCAV programs have experienced changes in administration and organization, impacting development pace. In 2003, the Air Force and Navy's projects were combined under the DARPA-controlled J-UCAS program for interoperability. DARPA then hired Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab to promote cooperation. The Office of the Secretary of Defense later instructed the Air Force to take control of the project. The Office of the Secretary of Defense instructed the Air Force to take control over the J-UCAS project, leading to management fluctuations. The program's development has been advanced through spiral development, with two X-45A and one X-47A air vehicles currently in inventory. Plans indicate delivery of three X-45Cs and X-47Bs by the end of 2006, with operational flight assessments expected in 2007. Total spending on the program exceeded $1.45 billion prior to FY2006. The J-UCAS/UCAV program, with over $1.45 billion spent in RDT&E funding, is one of the most expensive UAV ventures by DoD. The FireScout, initially designed for the Navy, is now in the engineering and manufacturing development phase for reconnaissance and targeting. The Fire Scout, a vertical take-off UAV, was rejuvenated by the Army in 2003 and designated as the interim Class IV UAV for the future combat system. Recent efforts have explored arming the Fire Scout and adding new mission capabilities. The design is based on a commercial helicopter, with potential for multiple mission capabilities. The RQ-8B Fire Scout, based on a commercial helicopter design, features a four-blade rotor to reduce acoustic signature. It can stay aloft for up to 9.5 hours with a basic payload, but endurance decreases to six hours with a full sensor payload. The UAV has autonomous flight capabilities and a surveillance payload including a laser designator, IR camera, and multi-color EO camera for mine-detection. The Fire Scout UAV has surveillance capabilities including a laser designator, IR camera, and multi-color EO camera for mine-detection. Plans are underway to expand communication capabilities and arm the UAV for strike missions with weapons like Hydrafolding-fin rockets. The Fire Scout UAV has surveillance capabilities and plans to arm it for strike missions with weapons like Hydrafolding-fin rockets. Currently, five RQ-8A air vehicles are in the developmental testing phase, with a future inventory estimate of 192 vehicles. Future missions include border patrol, search and rescue, medical resupply, and submarine spotting operations. The Fire Scout UAV is in the acquisition process, with plans for full-rate production by 2008 and IOC by 2010. The Army and Navy anticipate a future inventory of 192 vehicles. The Army plans to use the Fire Scout for its Future Combat System program, while the Navy selected the RQ-8B for the Littoral Combat Ship class. Funding for Fire Scout comes from various Navy and Army programs. In 2003, the Coast Guard selected Bell Helicopter Textron's TR911D Eagle Eye UAV for its Deepwater Modernization. The Coast Guard selected the Bell Helicopter Textron's TR911D Eagle Eye UAV for its Deepwater Modernization program in February 2003. The $3 million Eagle Eye can take off vertically like a helicopter and then tilt its rotors to fly like a plane. The Coast Guard plans to acquire 69 vehicles to enhance surveillance capabilities for patrolling the U.S. coastline. The Coast Guard selected the Bell Helicopter Textron's TR911D Eagle Eye UAV for its Deepwater Modernization program in February 2003. The Eagle Eye can patrol the U.S. coastline for various purposes, including drug smuggling and ship distress, with the ability to transmit video and infrared images. It has a flying speed of up to 220 knots and an operational radius of roughly 300 miles, surpassing other similar VUAVs. The Marine Corps is interested in using the Eagle Eye as a replacement for the RQ-2 Pioneer. Lockheed Martin's Force Protection Aerial Surveillance System (FPASS) is currently used by the Air Force for airbase defense in Iraq and Afghanistan. Lockheed Martin's Force Protection Aerial Surveillance System (FPASS), also known as the Desert Hawk, is used by the Air Force to monitor airbase perimeters in Iraq and Afghanistan to prevent enemy incursions or terrorist attacks. Developed in 1999 at the request of U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), the Desert Hawk improves situational awareness through area surveillance, patrols, and aerial spotting for ground convoys. Its small size, light weight, and Styrofoam body have led to comparisons to remote-controlled model planes. The Desert Hawk, a small and lightweight aerial surveillance system used by the Air Force, is compared to remote-controlled model planes due to its simple design. It can be easily repaired on the job with tape or glue and is launched by a slingshot device. The aircraft flies preprogrammed paths for up to one hour, carries a camera, and can operate up to six nautical miles away. The Air Force has 126 Desert Hawks in inventory, with each system costing approximately $300,000. The Air Force's inventory of Desert Hawks stands at 126 vehicles, each costing approximately $300,000. AeroVironment's Dragon Eye provides reconnaissance and surveillance capabilities with autonomous GPS navigation and real-time image relay. Dragon Eye UAVs use infrared cameras for reconnaissance and surveillance, with autonomous GPS navigation. The compact design allows for a 45-minute operational endurance and a range of two and a half nautical miles. Low-rate initial production began in 2001, with a full-rate production contract awarded in 2003 for approximately 300 systems. Each system includes three air vehicles and one ground station, with a unit cost of $154,000 as per the FY2006 Marine Corps procurement budget request. The Pointer UAV, developed by AeroVironment, is currently in service in Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. It has a flight endurance of two hours, a weight of 8.5 lbs, and a 9-foot wingspan. The system includes two air vehicles and a ground control unit, which decreases portability. The Pointer UAV, developed by AeroVironment, weighs nearly 8.5 lbs with a 9-foot wingspan, making it less portable when part of a system with two air vehicles and a ground control unit. It carries either an IR or daytime E-O sensor and is used for short-range ISR missions by the Air Force and Special Operations Command. Currently, 50 Pointer systems are owned by these organizations, with plans to purchase an additional 50 for future operations. AeroVironment is developing the Puma as the Pointer's successor, expected to have a four-hour endurance. AeroVironment is developing the Raven as a successor to the Pointer UAV, with plans for 50 systems in the near future for OIF and OEF. The Raven is smaller and lighter than its predecessor, providing Army and SOCOM personnel with reconnaissance, sniper spotting, and surveillance capabilities for convoy routes. The Raven UAV is backpackable and provides Army and SOCOM personnel with reconnaissance, sniper spotting, and surveillance capabilities for convoy routes. It is powered by an electric battery and can be hand-launched by a running start. The vehicle lands via a controlled crash and can carry either an IR or an E-O camera for transmitting real-time images. The Raven UAV, with Kevlar plating for protection, can carry IR or E-O cameras and transmit real-time images. It is a simple system that allows for quick training in-theater. The Army, SOCOM, and Air Force have purchased different configurations of the Raven systems. The cost of a three-aircraft system is around $250,000. The Silver Fox, developed by Advanced Ceramic Research and ONR, is another UAV option. The Silver Fox UAV, developed by Advanced Ceramic Research and ONR, is a Diesel-powered front propeller UAV designed for tactical ISR support. It has a five-foot fuselage, an eight-foot wingspan, and houses both a daylight E-O and micro-IR camera for surveillance. The vehicle supports U.S. forces in Iraq through undisclosed applications. The Silver Fox UAV, developed by ONR and Advanced Ceramic Research Inc., supports U.S. forces in Iraq through undisclosed applications. The Scan Eagle, developed by Boeing and the Insitu Group, is known for its long endurance capabilities and low cost, with a wingspan two and a half times the length of its fuselage, reaching altitudes of 19,000 feet and distances of over 60 nautical miles. The Scan Eagle UAV, developed by Boeing and the Insitu Group, can reach altitudes of 19,000 feet, fly over 60 nautical miles, and has a flight endurance of nearly 20 hours. It autonomously flies to designated points of interest, equipped with E-O and IR sensors for force-protection ISR for Marine Corps units in Iraq. The UAV is launched using a pneumatic launcher and lands using the Skyhook recovery system, and can also be launched from a ship's deck. The sensor data links feature the \"Cursor-on-Target\" capability, making it a system of eight vehicles. The Scan Eagle UAV, developed by Boeing and the Insitu Group, can reach altitudes of 19,000 feet, fly over 60 nautical miles, and has a flight endurance of nearly 20 hours. It can be launched from a ship's deck and has a sensor data link feature called \"Cursor-on-Target\" for interoperability with other UAV systems. The Marine Corps is evaluating two systems under lease, with an expected price of approximately $100,000 per Scan Eagle."
