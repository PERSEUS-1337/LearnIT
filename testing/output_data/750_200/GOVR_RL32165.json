The Chinese central bank controlled the peg by buying or selling dollar-denominated assets to balance demand for the yuan. This kept the exchange rate stable despite economic changes. The Chinese government maintained a currency peg to the U.S. dollar at an exchange rate of 8.28 yuan to the dollar from 1994 to July 21, 2005. The peg was controlled by the central bank through buying or selling dollar-denominated assets. However, economic conditions changed towards the end of the peg, leading to the decision to make the yuan's exchange rate adjustable based on market supply and demand. The yuan's exchange rate was adjusted to be based on market supply and demand, referencing a basket of currencies including the dollar, yen, and euro. The U.S. dollar against the yuan was immediately adjusted to 8.11, appreciating by 2.1%. The yuan could fluctuate daily by 0.5% against the basket, but remained not fully convertible internationally with tight capital transaction controls in place. Since July 2005, China has allowed the yuan to appreciate steadily but slowly, accumulating foreign reserves rapidly. The yuan's exchange rate is based on market supply and demand against a basket of currencies, with daily fluctuations of 0.5%. China maintains tight controls over capital transactions, describing the current situation as a \"managed float\" where market forces influence the yuan's movement, but government intervention slows its appreciation rate. China's foreign exchange reserves grew rapidly from $403 billion in 2003 to $1.7 trillion in March 2008, with a large trade surplus of $262 billion in 2007. Since the 2005 reforms, the yuan has appreciated 16% against the dollar, raising concerns about the U.S. economy's stability due to the dollar's significant devaluation. The falling dollar has raised concerns about destabilizing the U.S. economy, with China's reluctance to adjust its currency adding to worries. Despite the yuan's increase, U.S. exports are growing, but concerns persist. This paper examines the economic issues surrounding China's currency policy. This paper reviews economic issues raised by China's currency policy, including concerns from the United States, China's fixed exchange rate regime, studies on China's real exchange rate, U.S.-China trade imbalance trends, and economic consequences for both countries. China's currency policy has economic consequences for both China and the United States, with China's massive accumulation of foreign exchange reserves and purchases of U.S. federal debt instruments. U.S. policymakers are seeking ways to induce China to reform its currency policy, as many believe that the Chinese currency is significantly undervalued compared to the U.S. dollar, affecting trade between the two countries. China's undervalued currency has led to a significant trade deficit with the United States, impacting U.S. production and employment in various manufacturing sectors. Analysts argue that this policy also influences other East Asian countries to intervene in currency markets. Many analysts argue that China's currency policy leads other East Asian countries to keep their currencies weak against the dollar to compete with Chinese goods. Groups are urging the Bush Administration to pressure China to revalue its currency or allow it to float freely in international markets. President Bush and officials have criticized China's currency policy, advocating for market-determined exchange rates. The Bush Administration criticized China's currency policy, initially rejecting calls to pressure China to abandon its currency peg. Instead, they encouraged China to reform its financial system and take measures towards a more flexible currency policy. The Administration's stance toughened in April 2005 when Treasury Secretary John Snow asserted at a G-7 meeting. The Administration's position on China's currency peg toughened in April 2005, with Treasury Secretary John Snow stating that China was ready for a more flexible exchange rate. This shift was influenced by growing complaints from Members and the introduction of currency bills in Congress. In response to a failed amendment by Senator Schumer to impose a tariff on Chinese goods, the Senate Republican leadership negotiated an agreement to allow a vote on a similar bill at a later date. The Senate Republican leadership negotiated an agreement with Senator Schumer to allow a vote on a bill related to Chinese goods. In the past year, significant events regarding China's currency policy included a 4.1% increase in import prices from China. Prices from China increased 4.1%, the largest 12-month increase since December 2003. U.S. imports from China rose by 1.8% in the first three months of 2008. The exchange rate with the dollar was 7.00 yuan, appreciating by 15.9% since July 2005. China's foreign exchange reserves reached $1.68 trillion in March 2008. The China Investment Corporation (CIC) was officially launched on September 29, 2007. China Investment Corporation (CIC) was established by the Chinese government on September 29, 2007, with an initial capitalization of $200 billion to manage foreign exchange reserves. CIC is one of the world's largest state-owned funds. In December 2007, CIC announced a $5 billion investment in Morgan Stanley. China confirmed on August 13, 2007, that it had no plans to sell off its dollar assets in response to rumors. In response to a Daily Telegraph article, high-level Chinese officials stated China would sell dollar assets if US imposed sanctions over currency policy. China eliminated regulations on converting foreign exchange holdings into yuan. IMF defined currency manipulation as policies affecting exchange rates to increase exports. IMF aims to discourage manipulation. The IMF aims to discourage currency manipulation by delivering clear policy messages to members. In 2007, a Section 301 petition was filed over China's currency practices, but the USTR's office declined the petition. The Treasury Department is required to report annually on foreign countries' exchange rate policies. The Treasury Department declined a petition regarding currency manipulation under the 1988 Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act. This Act requires annual reports on exchange rate policies of countries with large surpluses and trade with the US to determine if they manipulate their currencies for unfair trade advantages. Treasury has been issuing semi-annual reports on this matter. The Treasury Department has been issuing semi-annual reports on international economic and exchange rate policies, focusing on major U.S. trading partners. China was cited for currency manipulation in the past due to a dual exchange rate system and restrictions on foreign exchange access by domestic firms. However, no country has been designated as a currency manipulator since 1994. Recently, the reports have increased focus on China's currency policy. Since 1994, China has not been designated as a currency manipulator. The Treasury Department has increased its focus on China's currency policy and criticized the pace of its reforms, particularly regarding the implementation of flexible exchange rate mechanisms and market forces. China's new managed float exchange rate regime has been described as based on market supply and demand. The Treasury Department did not cite China as a currency manipulator under U.S. trade law, despite concerns that the new managed float exchange rate regime was still a tightly managed currency peg against the dollar. China's commitment to enhanced, market-determined currency flexibility was a key factor in this decision. The Treasury Department did not label China as a currency manipulator under U.S. trade law, citing assurances from Chinese officials regarding market-determined currency flexibility and domestic growth promotion. Despite China's heavy intervention in currency markets and undervalued currency, it did not meet technical requirements for manipulation. Treasury continues to address the Chinese exchange rate regime with officials. The Treasury Department did not label China as a currency manipulator under U.S. trade law, citing assurances from Chinese officials regarding market-determined currency flexibility and domestic growth promotion. The report emphasized the need for China to accelerate the appreciation of the RMB's effective exchange rate to minimize risks for the world economy. Many Members criticized Treasury's decision not to cite China as a currency manipulator despite its interventions in currency markets and growing trade surpluses with the United States. Despite large scale currency interventions, global current account surpluses, and growing trade surpluses with the United States, Chinese officials argue that their currency policy is not aimed at favoring exports or limiting imports. They claim that adopting a currency peg to the dollar is a common practice among developing countries to promote economic growth. Chinese officials argue that their currency policy, a peg to the dollar, is not to favor exports or limit imports but to promote economic growth. They fear abandoning this policy could lead to an economic crisis, especially damaging export industries during economic reforms. They are also concerned about rural unrest due to income disparities with urban areas. Chinese officials are worried about rising unrest in rural areas due to income disparities with urban areas. They argue that appreciating the currency could lower farmers' income and further raise tensions. They also believe the banking system is too underdeveloped to handle speculative pressures with a fully convertible currency. The Chinese banking system is underdeveloped and burdened with heavy debt, making it unable to effectively handle speculative pressures that come with a fully convertible currency. This combination, along with a poorly regulated financial system, was a factor in the 1997-1998 Asian financial crisis. Chinese officials considered currency policy reform before the crisis but were deterred by the negative impact on East Asian countries with floating currencies. China's currency peg was seen as a factor in the country's immunity from crisis. Officials are urged to reform the financial sector and make the currency more flexible. Fixed exchange rates have a long history of use. China's currency policy involved a fixed exchange rate system until July 2005, where the central bank maintained a constant yuan-dollar exchange rate. This system has historical roots, including the Bretton Woods system and the international gold standard. The policy has since evolved to allow for a more flexible exchange rate, with measures such as widening the band and reducing intervention in currency markets. The central bank maintained a fixed yuan-dollar exchange rate until July 2005, keeping it constant at around 8.28 yuan per dollar. The alternative would be a floating exchange rate system like the US has with the Euro area, where supply and demand determine the exchange rate. The central bank maintained a fixed yuan-dollar exchange rate at around 8.28 yuan per dollar until July 2005. If the demand for Euro area goods or assets increased, the euro would rise in value to restore equilibrium. If China had a floating exchange rate, appreciation would likely have occurred due to productivity and quality improvements. Chinese maintained a floating exchange rate, appreciation would likely have occurred in recent years due to productivity and quality improvements, increasing demand for Chinese goods and foreign direct investment. The central bank adjusts currency supply to match market demand by altering foreign exchange reserves. This is reflected in the country's international balance of payments. The central bank of China adjusts currency supply by altering foreign exchange reserves to maintain the exchange rate peg. Net exports and net private capital inflows impact the need for foreign exchange reserves to increase. Excess demand for yuan has led to an increase in reserves to support the peg. Since 2005, China has maintained an exchange rate peg by accumulating foreign reserves through buying dollars with newly printed yuan. The central bank holds U.S. financial securities instead of U.S. dollars to support the peg, primarily U.S. Treasury securities and U.S. Agency securities. China has continued to rapidly accumulate foreign reserves since July 2005. China has accumulated foreign reserves rapidly since July 2005, overtaking Japan in 2006 to become the world's largest holder of foreign exchange reserves. Foreign reserves grew from $75 billion in 1995 to $1.53 trillion in 2007. Despite not purchasing enough foreign reserves to entirely prevent the yuan from appreciating against the dollar, China's foreign exchange holdings rose by $463 billion, or 43%, from 2006 to 2007. China's foreign reserves have grown rapidly since July 2005, making it the world's largest holder of foreign exchange reserves in 2006. Despite not purchasing enough reserves to prevent the yuan from appreciating against the dollar, the yuan has steadily appreciated by about 16% by April 2008. The current situation can be described as a \"managed float\" where market forces determine the yuan's movement, but government intervention slows its appreciation rate. China's rapid growth in foreign reserves since 2005 has made it the world's largest holder. The yuan has appreciated by about 16% by April 2008, despite government intervention to slow its rate. The accumulation of reserves suggests that allowing the yuan to freely float would lead to a more rapid appreciation. China's rapid growth in foreign reserves since 2005 has made it the world's largest holder. The increase in China's foreign exchange reserves has outpaced GDP and imports growth. Little public information is available on the nature of China's reserves, including the share held in U.S. assets. China's foreign reserves have grown rapidly since 2005, making China the world's largest holder. The composition of China's reserves, including the share held in U.S. assets, is not publicly known. The real exchange rate, rather than the nominal exchange rate, determines economic activity. China had higher inflation than the United States from 1994 to 1997, causing the real and nominal exchange rates to diverge. This led to an appreciation of the real exchange rate from China's perspective, making exports more expensive. However, from 1997 to 2003, the real and nominal exchange rates converged as China's inflation rate was lower than the U.S. This resulted in the Chinese exchange rate reaching its lowest level in 2003, making exports cheaper. In 2003, the Chinese exchange rate reached its lowest level since 1994 in real terms, making exports progressively less expensive. The yuan has since appreciated, almost returning to its 1998 level in real terms. If the demand for Chinese goods increases, the floating yuan would appreciate further. If the demand for Chinese goods increases, a floating yuan would appreciate until the excess demand is exhausted. With a fixed exchange rate, the real exchange rate adjusts through price changes, causing Chinese exports to be cheaper and U.S. imports to be more expensive. The fixed exchange rate keeps Chinese exports cheaper and U.S. imports more expensive, leading to a trade surplus with the United States. This surplus results in capital flowing from China to the U.S., with part being used to purchase U.S. assets and the rest accumulating as dollar reserves by the Chinese central bank. The increase in dollar reserves by the central bank leads to a rise in inflation in China. The central bank of China is increasing yuan supply, leading to inflation. This inflation causes prices to rise, impacting exports and imports. Despite the fixed exchange rate, the real exchange rate adjusts over time, eliminating any competitive advantage for exporters and import-competing industries. Floating exchange rates return to equilibrium value quicker than fixed exchange rates, limiting a country's ability to use monetary and fiscal policy to counteract changes in the business cycle. This loss of policy flexibility can hinder a country's ability to lower interest rates during an economic downturn, leading to capital outflows and currency devaluation. When a country fixes its exchange rate, it may lose monetary autonomy during economic downturns as capital flows out to higher interest rate assets globally, putting pressure on the currency peg. This loss is more significant for countries tied to partners with different business cycles, limiting their ability to adjust interest rates. China maintains some monetary autonomy despite a fixed exchange rate by using capital controls. The currency is convertible for trade but not for financial flows, and Chinese enterprises must comply with these regulations. China maintains monetary autonomy through capital controls, allowing the currency to be convertible for trade but not for financial flows. Chinese enterprises are required to turn over foreign currency holdings to China's state bank in exchange for yuan, and purchases of foreign exchange are closely regulated. This control gives China flexibility over its monetary and fiscal policy despite the fixed exchange rate. The yuan's potential appreciation is uncertain due to the central bank's increase in foreign reserves. Estimates of the yuan's undervaluation have been discussed, but many are outdated. The report evaluates estimates of the yuan's undervaluation, noting that many estimates are outdated. Estimates are categorized into two methods: the fundamental equilibrium exchange rate method and the purchasing power parity method. The fundamental equilibrium exchange rate method is used to estimate misalignments in exchange rates based on current account balances. The fundamental equilibrium exchange rate (FEER) method estimates misalignments in exchange rates based on current account balances, aiming to calculate necessary exchange rate adjustments for alignment. Many economists dispute this method's accuracy in predicting and adjusting current account balances globally. Ernest Preeg estimated that the yuan was undervalued by 40% in 2003, based on rule-of-thumb estimates. This claim is not supported by formal analysis but is derived from observations on Chinese foreign exchange reserves and trade surplus. In the first six months of 2002, Chinese foreign exchange reserves increased, equaling 100% of the trade surplus minus net foreign direct investment. A 1% decline in the dollar could lead to a $10 billion decrease in the US trade deficit, which was around $400 billion in 2002. To eliminate the trade deficit, the dollar would need to decline by 40%. The U.S. trade deficit was around $400 billion in 2002. Chinese trade surplus plus net FDI flows equaled the increase in foreign exchange reserves. If the yuan floated, the surplus less FDI would be zero, leading to a 40% yuan appreciation. The yuan was estimated to be undervalued by 15%-25% in 2003. The underlying current account surplus was 2.5%-3% of GDP in 2003. The current account surplus in 2003 was larger than the actual surplus, leading to a recommendation to reduce it by $50 billion to achieve equilibrium. This would result in a deficit of 1%-1.5% of GDP. The revaluation needed to reduce the surplus is considered unusually large due to the high use of imports in Chinese exports. Goldman Sachs estimated that the yuan was 9.5%-15% undervalued in 2003, suggesting a revaluation to achieve equilibrium in China's balance of payments and reduce global payment imbalances. They argue that a 9.5%-15% revaluation could bring China's current account deficit equal to FDI, based on elasticity. Goldman Sachs estimated that the yuan was undervalued by 9.5%-15% in 2003, suggesting a revaluation to achieve equilibrium in China's balance of payments. Virginie Coudert and Cecile Couharde argue that China has an underlying current account deficit of 1.5%-2.8% of GDP, based on their analysis of elasticity and other factors. Goldman Sachs estimated the yuan was undervalued by 9.5%-15% in 2003, while other estimates suggest a larger undervaluation of 44%-54%. These estimates are not based on econometric models but on simple assumptions. The estimates of the yuan's undervaluation are not grounded in econometric models but are based on simple \"rule of thumb\" assumptions. The main source of contention is defining an \"equilibrium\" current account balance, with no consensus on what equilibrium would be. There is no consensus on what equilibrium would be for China's current account balance. The assumption of equilibrium is crucial, as changing it by 2 percentage points of GDP can significantly impact the estimated undervaluation. Some argue that the current account balance would always be close to zero in equilibrium, but this overlooks the differences in saving and investment rates among countries. Some studies suggest that China's current account balance may not always be close to zero in equilibrium due to different saving and investment rates among countries. The estimates by Preeg, IIE, and Goldman Sachs indicate a less favorable equilibrium for China, with a deficit in the overall current account position. They allow for foreign direct investment inflows while calling for balance only in official and portfolio borrowing. China's overall \"equilibrium\" current account position is estimated to be a deficit, leading to smaller estimates of the yuan's undervaluation if balance had been chosen as the benchmark. The current arrangement where China lends to the rest of the world is questioned as unsustainable, especially with capital controls limiting portfolio flows. Increasing foreign reserves is seen as the only way for China to prevent its net foreign indebtedness from rising. China must increase foreign reserves to prevent its net foreign indebtedness from rising, as capital controls limit portfolio flows. Determining the equilibrium current account balance in China is challenging due to these controls. If capital controls are maintained post-currency reform, the current account balance may remain stable. However, if controls are eliminated, the economic situation could change significantly. If capital controls were eliminated in China, the economic situation would change entirely, leading to persistent borrowing or lending by private citizens. This could result in a trade deficit or surplus, impacting the equilibrium market exchange rate and trade deficit. If capital controls were eliminated in China, the equilibrium market exchange rate would be affected by private capital outflows. China's high national saving and investment rates make it uncertain whether the country would be a net borrower or lender if their currency floated. Bosworth argues that China's high internal saving rate can finance its investment, offsetting FDI inflows with official outflows in foreign reserve accumulation. Foreign reserve accumulation should not be seen as proof of undervaluation. Wang suggests China's equilibrium current account surplus may be even larger based on estimates from other developing economies. Based on estimates from other developing economies, Wang argues that China's equilibrium current account surplus may be larger than the actual surplus, suggesting that the yuan is overvalued. The FEER approach believes that the overall U.S. trade deficit is unsustainable and revaluing the yuan would help reduce it. This argument goes beyond China fixing the yuan at a low level, suggesting that the dollar is incorrectly valued against most trading partners. For example, the Coudert and Couharde estimate that the yuan is 54% undervalued is based on a corresponding estimate that the dollar was 35% overvalued. The value of the dollar and the size of the trade deficit are not unsustainable in the medium run, as rational markets would adjust. There is no widely accepted theoretical approach to determine trade deficit sustainability, and evidence does not suggest the U.S. trade deficit is unsustainable in the next few years. The U.S. trade deficit is not unsustainable in the next few years, as evidenced by its duration, lack of impact on economic growth, and absence of significant dollar declines. Even if China reduces its trade deficit with the U.S., the overall U.S. trade deficit may not decrease proportionally. China's bilateral trade deficit with the United States may not result in a proportional decrease in the overall U.S. trade deficit. Other countries could still lend to the U.S., leading to potential widening of other bilateral trade deficits. It is uncertain if a fair share of the reduction in the U.S. trade deficit can be attributed to China, even if China's overall trade surplus is eliminated. International experience suggests that countries, including the U.S., have varying trade balances with different trading partners. The experience of other East Asian countries, including South Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Indonesia, and Thailand, showed mixed results in their current account balances from 1980 to 1997. Some ran deficits while others had surpluses. Since the Asian financial crisis in 1997, all these countries have had large current account balances. Since the Asian financial crisis in 1997, East Asian countries like Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Indonesia, and Thailand have all been running large current account surpluses. This trend suggests that the current economic environment may not be favorable for developing world borrowing. Other countries in the region also exhibit similar patterns of large foreign exchange reserves and current account surpluses, regardless of their exchange rate regimes. China's current account balance, although large compared to other regions, is in line with its neighbors. China's current account balance is in line with its neighbors, with estimates of the yuan's undervaluation based on purchasing power parity theory. The Economist's Big Mac Index estimated a 56% undervaluation of China's currency in February 2007. The Economist's Big Mac Index estimated that China's currency was undervalued by 56% in February 2007. However, relying too heavily on this index has drawbacks as it compares the price of a Big Mac in China and the United States, which may not accurately reflect purchasing power parity. Li Ong estimates that most of the value of a Big Mac comes from services, not the hamburger itself. The value of a Big Mac is mostly from services, not the hamburger itself, making it non-tradeable. Only a small fraction of its value is determined by purchasing power parity, resulting in price differences between locations. The Big Mac Index suggests that prices vary between locations, with New York City having higher prices than the rural south. While purchasing power parity (PPP) is a powerful concept in theory, it has proven to be unreliable in reality, especially in predicting exchange rates over the long run. Estimates based on purchasing power parity (PPP) should be approached with caution as they may only predict exchange rates accurately in the long run. The PPP approach can identify a country's currency as overvalued or undervalued compared to another country, but it may not change significantly over time even with changing trade deficits. Economist Jeffrey Frankel suggests regressing income levels on exchange rates to establish a predictable relationship based on PPP. Based on PPP, income levels can predict exchange rates, with China's undervaluation estimated at 36% in 2000 and potentially increasing since then. Coudert and Couharde calculated the yuan to be undervalued by 41%-51% in 2003. However, PPP may only hold in the long run, and financial flows can cause exchange rates to diverge significantly. The analysis has some caveats: PPP is only valid in the long run, financial flows can impact exchange rates, the regression lacks control for other factors, and gradual exchange rate adjustments are recommended. An immediate effect on the US trade deficit or employment from an appreciation of the renminbi against the dollar may not be significant. A theoretical rationale is necessary for linking income levels to exchange rate values to ensure accurate results. One rationale for linking income levels to exchange rate values is the \"Balassa-Samuelson\" effect, where as countries get richer, their exchange rates are predicted to appreciate due to productivity growth. Income levels can serve as a proxy for differences in productivity growth, but if the proxy is inaccurate, the results will be as well. Another proxy is the ratio of the consumer price index to the producer price index. The yuan's undervaluation in 2003 was estimated using different proxies: the consumer price index to the producer price index ratio. Estimates ranged from 18% to 47%, with some suggesting only modest undervaluation. However, caution was advised as the price index proxy may not be accurate for China. In a regression analysis, Cheung et al. find evidence that the yuan was only modestly undervalued in 2003. They caution that the price index proxy may be inaccurate for China due to non-market determined consumer prices. Restrictions on labor and capital mobility in China could interfere with the Balassa-Samuelson effect. While able to replicate others' results of undervaluation, Cheung et al. point out that these estimates do not meet statistical inference standards, as they are not statistically significant. The undervaluation estimates for the yuan are not statistically significant, indicating a lack of robustness in the results. Adjusting the model for serial correlation and adding explanatory variables like trade openness leads to a much smaller estimated undervaluation. Minor changes in the model can greatly affect the estimate. The Treasury Department's report on exchange rates discusses using economic models to estimate currency misalignment. Different variables and changes in the model can greatly impact the estimate of fair market exchange rates. The Treasury Department's report on exchange rates highlights the limitations of economic models in estimating currency misalignment. It suggests focusing on serious misalignments, using real effective exchange rates, employing multiple models, and supplementing analysis with empirical data and market-based reasons. The Treasury Department's report on exchange rates emphasizes the need to supplement judgments about currency misalignment with empirical data, indicators, policies, and institutional factors. It also mentions the importance of verifying market-based reasons for a currency's misalignment, highlighting the limitations of models that estimate equilibrium exchange rates based on trade flows. Critics of China's currency peg often point to the U.S.-China trade imbalance as evidence of the yuan being undervalued, but bilateral trade balances reflect structural causes as well as exchange rate issues. The bilateral trade deficit with China is often attributed to the undervaluation of the yuan, but other factors also play a role. In 2007, China had a small trade surplus with the world excluding the United States, indicating that the issue is more complex than just currency manipulation. In 2007, China had a small trade surplus with the world excluding the United States. Despite the undervaluation of the yuan against the dollar, China still ran trade deficits with several countries. The U.S. trade deficit with China has been rising, but U.S. exports to China have also been increasing sharply. In 2007, U.S. exports to China rose significantly faster than to any other major trading partner. China became the third largest U.S. export market, with evidence suggesting that a growing share of imports from China is coming from export-oriented multinational companies in East Asia. The share of China's exports and imports from foreign-invested enterprises (FIEs) has significantly increased over the years, with FIEs accounting for 57.1% of exports and 47.9% of imports in 2007. This trend is driven by export-oriented multinational companies from East Asia moving production to China for its low-cost labor. China's exports and imports from foreign-invested enterprises (FIEs) have increased significantly over the years, reaching 57.1% and 47.9% respectively in 2007. FIEs import raw materials for assembly in China, leading to trade deficits with East Asian countries and surpluses with high consumer demand countries like the United States. This has contributed to the rise in U.S. imports and the growing trade deficit with China. The increase in U.S. imports and trade deficit with China is mainly due to China becoming a production platform for foreign companies, rather than unfair trade policies. Foreign direct investment in China has grown significantly, leading to a rise in the share of China's trade by foreign-invested enterprises. Foreign direct investment in China grew significantly from $1.9 billion in 1986 to $74.8 billion in 2007, with a large portion going to export-oriented manufacturing. This led to a rapid increase in the U.S. trade deficit with China in the early 1990s. Foreign-invested enterprises (FIEs) import about 80% as much as they export, having little effect on China's overall trade balance. Foreign direct investment in China grew significantly from $1.9 billion in 1986 to $74.8 billion in 2007, with a large portion going to export-oriented manufacturing. This led to a rapid increase in the U.S. trade deficit with China in the early 1990s. FIEs import about 80% as much as they export, having little effect on China's overall trade balance. Foreign multinational companies shifted production to China, making it the largest foreign supplier of computer equipment to the U.S. in 2007. In 2007, China was the largest foreign supplier of computer equipment to the U.S., accounting for 51.5% of total imports. U.S. imports of computer equipment from China increased by 436% over seven years, while the total value of U.S. imports from the world rose by only 26%. The rise in Chinese computer production is attributed to foreign companies moving manufacturing facilities to China. The undervaluation of the yuan against the dollar has both benefits and costs for the economies of China and the United States. If the yuan is undervalued, Chinese exports to the United States are cheaper, benefiting China's export industries and attracting foreign investment in production facilities. This boosts technology transfers and economic development. Foreign investment in Chinese production facilities, mainly from U.S. firms, facilitates technology transfers for economic development. However, an undervalued currency raises import costs, disadvantaging Chinese consumers and firms reliant on imported goods. This benefits Chinese exporting firms, owned by foreign multinational corporations, at the expense of non-exporting Chinese firms, potentially hindering resource allocation efficiency in the long term. A yuan revaluation could decrease aggregate spending in China by increasing imports. A revaluation of the yuan could impact resource allocation in the Chinese economy in the long run. It may reduce aggregate spending by increasing imports and decreasing exports, potentially affecting the current state of the economy. Some argue that revaluation could help prevent inflation and promote sustainability, while others believe it could disrupt the absorption of underemployed labor in rural China. China's currency policy is a point of contention among economists. China's undervalued yuan is seen as absorbing economic challenges, but some economists argue that it hinders the government's ability to use monetary policy effectively. They believe the currency policy leads to an overreliance on fixed investment and exports, which may not be sustainable in the long run. Additionally, easy credit from the policy could undermine the financial stability of the banking system. China's currency policy is criticized for expanding easy credit, leading banks to make risky loans and increasing non-performing loans. It also attracts \"hot money\" for speculative ventures like real estate and stocks, limiting banks' ability to regulate investments through interest rates. China's currency policy is criticized for expanding easy credit, leading banks to make risky loans and increasing non-performing loans. It also attracts \"hot money\" for speculative ventures like real estate and stocks, limiting banks' ability to regulate investments through interest rates. Raising interest rates beyond a certain level could increase flows of foreign capital into the country, while keeping rates low in a booming economy may prevent efficient capital allocation and lead to overproduction in some sectors. China's large foreign exchange reserves could facilitate a quicker move towards a fully convertible currency, but also entail opportunity costs as these funds could be used for other purposes. China's large foreign exchange reserves have opportunity costs as they could be used for China's development needs like infrastructure, education, and social safety net. This could provide higher returns to the economy than holding U.S. Treasuries or Chinese bonds for exchange rate intervention. When China accumulates foreign reserves, it affects the yuan's value, making Chinese exports cheaper to the U.S. and U.S. exports to China more expensive. This leads to a decrease in U.S. exports and production of goods competing with Chinese imports, particularly impacting the manufacturing sector. Consequently, the U.S. trade deficit increases, reducing aggregate demand in the short run. China is a significant supplier of imports to the U.S., further exacerbating the trade deficit. China has become the United States's second largest supplier of imports, with a focus on labor-intensive consumer goods. While some products do not directly compete with U.S. producers, industries like machine tools, hardware, and furniture are feeling the competitive pressure from China. The competitive challenge posed by China is a concern for industries like machine tools, hardware, plastics, furniture, and tool and die. An undervalued Chinese currency may impact the output of these industries. U.S. producers also import capital equipment and inputs from China, with U.S. computer firms relying on imported parts. An undervalued yuan lowers the price of U.S. products, increasing their competitiveness in world markets. An undervalued yuan benefits U.S. products by increasing their competitiveness in world markets. It also affects U.S. borrowers when the country runs a current account deficit with China, leading to capital inflows from China to the United States. This allows for more U.S. capital investment in plant and equipment. Chinese central bank and private citizens investing in U.S. assets lead to increased capital investment in plant and equipment due to lower interest rates. This boosts aggregate spending in the short run and expands the economy in the long run by increasing the capital stock. The lower interest rates also benefit interest-sensitive household spending. Private firms and interest-sensitive household spending benefit from lower interest rates due to capital inflow from China. China holds a significant amount of U.S. Treasury securities, funding U.S. federal budget deficits. If the U.S. trade deficit with China were eliminated, it would impact Chinese investments in U.S. assets. China holds a large amount of U.S. Treasury securities, being the second largest foreign holder after Japan. If the U.S. trade deficit with China is eliminated, the U.S. government would need to find other buyers for its securities at higher interest rates, increasing the budget deficit. An undervalued yuan allows the U.S. to consume more goods, both imported and domestically produced. An undervalued yuan lowers import prices from China, increasing U.S. consumption of goods. This improves terms-of-trade and purchasing power for U.S. consumers. The rise of the yuan may impact Chinese product prices in the U.S. The yuan's value against the dollar and rising raw material prices are affecting Chinese product prices in the U.S. Import prices from China increased by 4.1% from April 2007 to April 2008, the largest 12-month increase since December 2003. U.S. imports from China rose by 1.8% from January to March 2008, lower than the previous period. Critics argue that the undervalued yuan has harmed the U.S. manufacturing sector, leading to the loss of 2.7 million factory jobs since July 2000. Critics of China's currency policy argue that the low value of the yuan has significantly impacted the U.S. manufacturing sector, resulting in the loss of 2.7 million factory jobs since July 2000. However, there is no clear link between job losses and imports from China, as manufacturing output has reached an all-time high and the overall trade deficit is still increasing. The growing trade deficit, shifting U.S. employment from manufacturing to the service sector, is a long-term trend driven by changing technology and comparative advantage, rather than just the Chinese currency issue. U.S. manufacturing employment has decreased significantly over the years due to technological advancements and globalization. The growing trade deficit and shift in U.S. employment from manufacturing to the service sector are driven by technology and comparative advantage. Globalization leads to more manufacturing abroad, with the United States focusing on knowledge- and technology-intensive goods for trade with countries like China. This trend is expected to continue regardless of China's currency policy. Alan Greenspan testified in 2005 that an undervalued yuan does not significantly increase manufacturing activity and jobs in the United States. Instead, it leads to a shift in U.S. production towards firms benefiting from lower interest rates due to Chinese capital inflows. The shift in U.S. production towards firms benefiting from lower interest rates due to Chinese capital inflows is expected to have no medium- or long-run effect on aggregate U.S. employment or unemployment. Despite the widening trade deficit with China, the overall unemployment rate has fallen. However, the impact of the trade deficit on employment and production will vary across regions and sectors. The trade deficit has caused a shift in U.S. production towards sectors benefiting from Chinese capital inflows. This shift has not had a medium- or long-run effect on overall U.S. employment. However, the impact of the trade deficit on employment and production will vary across regions and sectors, with some areas gaining while others lose. In the short run, there may be adverse consequences if output in the trade sector falls more quickly than the output of U.S. recipients of Chinese capital rises, leading to temporary declines in aggregate spending and employment. In the short run, a fall in aggregate spending and employment could occur due to a decline in the trade sector output. This may lead to a temporary decrease in the inflation rate, which can be beneficial or harmful depending on the current inflation level. However, government macroeconomic policy adjustments and market forces can help compensate for this decline by expanding other elements of aggregate demand. Shifting the composition of U.S. output towards a higher capital base could result in a larger economy in the long run due to capital inflow/trade deficit. In the long run, shifting U.S. output towards a higher capital base could lead to a larger economy due to capital inflow/trade deficit. While China is a significant trading partner, it accounted for only a portion of U.S. imports in 2007. This shift may result in higher productivity and wages for U.S. workers using Chinese-owned capital. The United States has a trade deficit due to a domestic imbalance between saving and investment, with declining saving rates over the past two decades. Despite high productivity and strong economic fundamentals, there is a low household saving rate and negative government saving rate. The United States has a trade deficit due to low saving rates, leading to foreigners financing profitable investments. In contrast, China has a much higher saving rate compared to the U.S. China's gross national saving as a percent of GDP is significantly higher than the U.S., leading to excess savings that China can invest overseas. In contrast, the United States has a higher rate of private consumption and must borrow from abroad to fund its investment needs. China has a higher gross national saving rate compared to the United States, leading to excess savings that China can invest overseas. This results in a current account balance of 9.0% for China versus -6.2% for the United States. Both countries would need to adjust their saving/investment patterns to reduce the U.S. trade deficit and China's trade surplus in the long run. Some analysts believe China is moving towards boosting consumer spending to address this issue. Some analysts believe China is transitioning towards increasing consumer spending to address its trade surplus in the long run, despite the challenge of shifting from reliance on exports and domestic investment to consumption for GDP growth. Some analysts believe China is transitioning towards increasing consumer spending to address its trade surplus in the long run. Economists are more concerned with the overall trade deficit than bilateral trade balances, as countries naturally have varying trade relationships with different partners. For example, the United States has a trade deficit with Austria and a trade surplus with the Netherlands, despite both countries using the euro. The United States has a trade deficit with Austria and a trade surplus with the Netherlands, both using the euro. The US relies on foreign financing due to its low saving rate, including capital from China. The dollar depreciated against various currencies from 2002 to 2008. The dollar has depreciated 24% in nominal terms and 22% in inflation-adjusted terms against the Federal Reserve's broad index of currencies, with larger depreciation against the euro, pound, and Canadian dollar. Some economists fear a sudden plummet in the dollar's value due to the unsustainably large trade deficit, which could cause severe dislocations for the U.S. economy. The trade deficit is unsustainably large and could lead to significant dislocations in U.S. financial markets if investors suddenly realize that dollar depreciation is inevitable. This could interfere with efficient financial intermediation. The trade deficit could cause significant dislocations in U.S. financial markets if investors realize that dollar depreciation is inevitable. Central banks in China and other developing countries have accumulated foreign reserves to prevent their currency from appreciating against the dollar. Central banks in China and other developing countries have accumulated foreign reserves to prevent their currency from appreciating against the dollar, which could cause dislocations in U.S. financial markets. Other Asian countries may follow suit to compete with China in exports. The commitment to support the dollar's value by these countries has provided security for private investors in U.S. assets despite the trade deficit. If China and other countries stop intervening in currency markets, the dollar could experience a significant drop. If China and other countries stop intervening in currency markets, the dollar could fall significantly, potentially triggering a currency crisis. The United States has options to pressure China for exchange rate reforms, such as making the yuan fully convertible or allowing gradual currency appreciation. Options to induce China to reform its exchange rate regime include lessening intervention in currency markets, widening the fluctuation band of the currency, and implementing financial sector reforms for greater currency flexibility. There is a lively policy debate on the best approach to achieve these outcomes, with some Members of Congress expressing frustration over the Treasury Department's failure to designate China as a currency manipulator. Some Members of Congress are frustrated with the Treasury Department for not designating China as a currency manipulator since 1994. They believe this designation would increase pressure on China to reform its currency practices. Treasury is already negotiating with China on this issue. The process of making such a designation is complex and does not have a formulaic procedure. The bills H.R. 782, H.R. 2942, S. 796, and S. 1607 in the 110th Congress aim to identify \"fundamentally misaligned currencies\" instead of manipulated currencies. S. 1677 would require Treasury to cite a country for currency manipulation regardless of intent, potentially increasing pressure on China to reform its currency practices. China may face designation to reform its currency policy, with the U.S. government having the discretion to label the yuan as misaligned with the dollar. Efforts could be made through direct negotiations to persuade China to change its exchange rate policy, as it is believed to be detrimental to China's economy and global growth. The United States has been assisting China in financial reform. China's currency policy is detrimental to its economy, trading partners, and global growth. The United States has been helping China reform its financial sector and encourage policies to boost domestic consumption. China has been invited to G-7 finance meetings since 2004. China has been invited to G-7 finance meetings since 2004, where its currency policy is a major topic of discussion. The United States has been pressuring China to make its currency more flexible. The United States could build consensus within the G-7 to pressure China on currency reform or persuade China to engage in talks with other East Asian economies to reach a consensus on exchange rate policy. Proponents argue that other East Asian countries fear their exports will be uncompetitive without China's currency changes. The US could urge the IMF to work with China on economic risks and promote balanced growth through policy tools like increased domestic consumption. Key in negotiations is convincing China of the benefits of liberalization. The U.S. government could pressure China to liberalize its exchange rate system by threatening trade sanctions. Legislation like H.R. 1002 proposes additional tariffs on Chinese imports unless their currency appreciates. The U.S. government could pressure China to reform its currency policy by threatening trade sanctions. Proponents believe this tactic was effective in the past and should be used again, while opponents argue that sanctions may violate WTO rules and could backfire by discouraging Chinese officials from making reforms. Chinese officials may resist currency reform if pressured by the U.S. Some proposals suggest sanctions on misaligned currency policies without violating WTO rules. S. 1607 could restrict access to U.S. government procurement and OPIC financing for designated countries. Critics claim China's currency policy breaches WTO rules, prompting the U.S. to consider a case before the WTO's Dispute Settlement Body. Some critics accuse China of violating WTO rules with its currency policy. The US could take the issue to the WTO's Dispute Settlement Body, which could order China to adjust its currency policy. If China refuses, the US may be allowed to impose trade sanctions. Using the WTO offers a multilateral approach, but there is no guarantee of a ruling in favor of the US. The US could use the WTO's Dispute Settlement Body to address China's currency policy, potentially leading to trade sanctions. However, there is no guarantee of a ruling in favor of the US. If the US fails to follow WTO procedures and imposes unilateral sanctions, China may retaliate with a WTO case. States failed to utilize WTO dispute resolution procedures and instead imposed unilateral trade sanctions under Section 301. China may file a WTO case against the United States. In 2004, the Bush Administration rejected two Section 301 petitions on China's exchange rate policy. One was from the China Currency Coalition and the other from 30 Members of Congress. Both sought to have the US bring a case before the WTO against China for violating WTO rules. On May 17, 2007, 42 House Members filed a Section 301 petition with the USTR's office over China's currency practices. The WTO ruled that China's currency peg violated WTO rules. In May 2007, 42 House Members filed a petition with the USTR's office over China's currency practices, requesting a trade dispute case be brought to the WTO. The USTR declined the petition in June, expressing doubts about winning such a case in the WTO. Legislation has been proposed to require U.S. officials to bring a case against China over its currency policy. H.R. 321 proposes provisions for U.S. officials to address China's currency policy and calls for WTO rules on currency manipulation to be updated. U.S. countervailing laws allow relief from subsidized imports, but have faced challenges in applying to non-market economies like China. The Commerce Department decided to pursue a countervailing case against certain imported Chinese coated free sheet paper products in November 2006. On March 30, 2007, they issued a preliminary ruling to impose countervailing duties ranging from 11 to 20% against the products. Despite China being a non-market economy for U.S. trade laws, economic reforms have made some sectors relatively market-oriented. Commerce argues that despite China being a non-market economy for U.S. trade laws, certain sectors have become more market-based. This allows for the identification of government subsidies given to Chinese paper firms. Some members believe China's currency policy acts as an export subsidy, which should be addressed under U.S. countervailing laws. Proposed legislation like H.R. 782, H.R. 2942, S. 364, and S. 796 would apply countervailing laws to non-market economies and address currency misalignment or manipulation. Members argue that such laws would align with WTO regulations. Proposed legislation like H.R. 782, H.R. 2942, S. 364, and S. 796 would apply countervailing laws to non-market economies, including China, to address currency misalignment or manipulation. Critics argue that determining the subsidy level conveyed by China's currency would be challenging, and any U.S. countervailing measures against China could face challenges in the WTO. Critics argue that undervaluing the yuan affects Chinese exports to the US, harming US industries. Proposed legislation like H.R. 2942 and S. 1607 would consider currency misalignment in determining antidumping duties, but critics question the feasibility of accurately assessing undervaluation. Critics question the feasibility of accurately assessing undervaluation of a country's currency and its compatibility with WTO rules on trade remedies. Utilizing U.S. trade remedy laws, such as safeguard provisions under Sections 421-423 of the 1974 Trade Act, could provide temporary relief for U.S. domestic producers facing market disruption from imported Chinese products. The Bush Administration invoked the special China textile and apparel safeguard to restrict imports due to a surge in Chinese exports causing market disruption to U.S. domestic producers. An agreement was reached with China in November 2005 to limit certain textile and apparel exports to the United States until the end of 2008. The Bush Administration reached an agreement with China in November 2005 to limit textile and apparel exports to the US until 2008. H.R. 782 and S. 796 propose considering China's exchange rate misalignment in determining market disruption under the China-specific safeguard. Some analysts caution against pressuring China too much on its currency policy. Some analysts caution against pressuring China too much on its currency policy, arguing that it may not serve U.S. economic interests and could be ineffective. They suggest addressing China's currency policy as part of a broader U.S. trade strategy to encourage economic and trade reforms. This approach aligns with the Administration's policy in the SED talks, where U.S. officials have urged China to increase domestic consumption and adjust its currency policy for a long-term global solution. The U.S. officials have urged China to boost domestic consumption and make its currency policy more flexible as part of a long-term solution to global trade imbalances. Key concerns for the United States include market access, protection of intellectual property rights, industrial policies favoring domestic content, and subsidization of Chinese state-owned enterprises. Compliance with WTO commitments is crucial, with a focus on pressing China to adhere to its obligations. The United States aims to leverage China's WTO commitments to push for economic liberalization and market opening, rather than focusing on currency reform. Supporters believe that China is more likely to comply with international rules than direct U.S. pressure. Many U.S. policymakers are concerned about China's significant holdings and state-owned enterprises. China could potentially use its large holdings of U.S. federal debt as a political tool against the United States, threatening to make the dollar collapse by liquidating its Treasuries if trade sanctions are imposed to force a yuan revaluation. China could potentially use its large holdings of U.S. Treasuries as a political tool against the United States, threatening to liquidate them if trade sanctions are imposed to force a yuan revaluation. This raised concerns among U.S. policymakers, prompting Senator Charles Grassley to seek clarification from the Chinese government. The Chinese ambassador reassured that China does not have plans to drastically adjust its foreign reserves. The Chinese ambassador reassured Senator Grassley that China does not plan to drastically adjust its foreign reserves, including its holdings of U.S. government securities. China views these assets as important and considers itself a responsible investor. Liquidating a large portion of these assets would impact the value of the dollar in international currency markets, but it is unlikely that China would take such a drastic step. Liquidating a significant portion of China's dollar-denominated assets would have a major impact on the value of the dollar in international currency markets. However, it is unlikely that China would take such a step as it could lead to a sharp appreciation of the yuan, resulting in capital loss, lower asset value, and increased export costs. This move could also reduce economic growth in the United States and diminish demand for imports, including those from China. The Chinese government launched the China Investment Corporation (CIC) in 2007 to manage foreign exchange reserves, potentially diversifying away from dollar-denominated assets like Treasury securities. This move could impact U.S. interest rates. China's holding of Treasury securities has increased very little since 2007. If China allows its currency to be determined by market forces, the yuan could appreciate, boosting U.S. exports and reducing the bilateral trade deficit. This would also lead to the Chinese central bank no longer purchasing U.S. assets to maintain the peg. If China allows its currency to appreciate, U.S. exports could increase, reducing the trade deficit. The Chinese central bank would stop buying U.S. assets to maintain the peg, leading to higher interest rates in the U.S. and reduced investment spending, impacting the economy. Some analysts fear that a sudden decline in Chinese demand for U.S. assets could destabilize the U.S. economy due to the falling dollar. Rising inflation in the U.S. could lead to import price increases if the yuan appreciates, adding to inflationary pressures. Floating exchange rates fluctuate frequently and significantly, with potential effects on trade and asset demand. The floating exchange rate would depreciate in the future, leading to potential effects on trade and asset demand. China's opposition to a floating exchange rate is due to fears of capital outflow caused by the removal of capital controls. If China were to experience a large private capital outflow due to fears of unsafe deposits in its banking system, the floating exchange rate could depreciate. This would result in a reduction in output for U.S. exporters and import-competing firms, leading to an expansion of the U.S. bilateral trade deficit. China may consider floating its exchange rate while maintaining capital controls. China could potentially have private citizens buying U.S. assets instead of the Chinese central bank to avoid currency depreciation from a private capital outflow. This unconventional solution may make imposing effective capital controls more challenging. Another option is to maintain the current exchange rate, which could lead to a slow rise in the nominal exchange rate over time. Maintaining the status quo could lead to a slow rise in the nominal exchange rate over time, causing the real exchange rate to adjust as inflation rates diverge between countries. This adjustment would decrease the U.S. bilateral trade deficit and benefit U.S. exporters and import-competing firms, although pressures on the trade sector would persist in the meantime. No solution guarantees the elimination of the bilateral trade deficit. China's high saving rate and the US's low saving rate contribute to their trade imbalances. Even with a floating exchange rate, persistent trade deficits may continue. If China maintains low-cost labor and productivity gains, its exports to the US are likely to remain competitive. China's exports to the United States are likely to continue growing due to its combination of low-cost labor and productivity gains, regardless of the exchange rate regime. The appreciation of the yuan since 2005 has not reduced the trade deficit. U.S. policymakers are concerned about China's currency policy, the trade deficit, decline in manufacturing employment, and China's economic rise. The rise of China as a major economic power has led to a decline in U.S. manufacturing employment. China's currency, the yuan, has appreciated since 2005, but the trade deficit with the U.S. has not decreased. There is debate over the impact of further appreciation of the yuan on the trade deficit. The appreciation of the yuan has led to debates on its impact on the U.S. economy, with concerns about potential benefits and harms to different sectors and consumers. Despite the trade deficit with China, it has not hindered full employment in the United States. Various factors, such as productivity growth and shifts to the service sector, also influence manufacturing employment. Increased productivity growth and employment shifts to the service sector have impacted the overall trade deficit. The extent of production shifting to China from the United States versus other low-wage countries like Mexico, Thailand, and Indonesia is unclear. Foreign multilateral corporations' involvement in China's exports complicates who benefits from the trade, especially with the rising U.S. trade deficit with China. The effects of an appreciating yuan are also a concern. The effects of an appreciating yuan on the U.S. economy are debated, as an increase in the yuan's value means a decrease in the dollar's value. This impacts China's accumulation of U.S. assets and could potentially stabilize the falling dollar. Policy changes could have winners and losers in both countries. Chinese officials plan to gradually make the currency more flexible and eventually adopt a floating currency to avoid disruptions to the economy. However, the current currency policy may be undermining these efforts by expanding the money supply. The current currency policy in China may be expanding the money supply, leading to easy credit policies by banks and potentially more non-performing loans. Efforts to limit bank loans in certain sectors are mainly driven by government directives, undermining the establishment of a market-based financial system. China's currency policy also acts as a subsidy for export industries. China's currency policy acts as a subsidy for export industries, but it hinders efficient resource distribution. US officials criticize China's cautious exchange rate reforms, warning that it could disrupt global trade imbalances and world economic growth, impacting China's export-dependent economy. China's currency policy acts as a subsidy for export industries, but it hinders efficient resource distribution. US officials criticize China's cautious exchange rate reforms, warning that it could disrupt global trade imbalances and world economic growth, impacting China's export-dependent economy. Both countries agree on the need for major economic reforms to boost domestic consumption and savings. China plans to enhance economic development in the hinterland and increase spending on social security, healthcare, and education, but implementation may take years. Currency legislation in the 110th Congress addresses China's currency policy. Currency legislation in the 110th Congress on China's currency policy includes bills such as H.R. 321 and H.R. 782/S. 796. These bills aim to address China's currency manipulation by requiring the Treasury Department to determine if China has manipulated its currency, estimating the rate of manipulation, and imposing additional tariffs on Chinese products. Additionally, the bills call for the United States to file a WTO case against China over its currency policy and work within the WTO to clarify rules regarding currency manipulation. H.R. 782 (Tim Ryan)/ S. 796 (Bunning) would apply U.S. countervailing laws to products imported from non-market economies like China, establish a new methodology for estimating government subsidies, make exchange rate misalignment actionable under U.S. law, and require the Treasury Department to report on currency misalignment to Congress. H.R. 1002 (Spratt) and H.R. 2942 (Tim Ryan) propose measures to address currency misalignment with China, including additional tariffs and applying countervailing laws. H.R. 2942 (Tim Ryan) proposes applying countervailing laws to nonmarket economies and making undervalued currency a factor in determining antidumping and countervailing duties. It also requires Treasury to identify fundamentally misaligned currencies for priority action, with the USTR taking action in the WTO if consultations fail. S. 364 (Rockefeller) would apply U.S. countervailing laws on non-market economies and make exchange rate manipulation actionable under such laws. S. 1607 (Baucus) would require the Treasury Department to address currency issues. S. 1607 (Baucus) would apply U.S. countervailing laws on non-market economies and address currency issues by identifying misaligned currencies for priority action. If a country fails to adopt appropriate policies within 180 days, the U.S. would make currency undervaluation a factor in determining antidumping duties and impose bans on federal procurement and financing from the designated country. The bill S. 1677 (Dodd) requires the Treasury Department to identify countries that manipulate their currencies and take action, including filing a case in the WTO and possible intervention in international currency markets. The Senate Finance Committee approved S. 1677 (Dodd) on July 31, 2007, requiring the Treasury Department to identify currency manipulators and submit an action plan. S. 2813 (Bunning) also addresses currency manipulation and consults with the IMF. A comparison of major currency bills is provided in Table 8. A comparison of major currency bills introduced in the 109th Congress, including S. 1607, S. 1677, H.R. 782, S. 796, and H.R. 2942, is summarized in Table 8. One bill, S.Amdt. 309 (Schumer) to S. 600, proposed a 27.5% tariff on Chinese goods if China did not appreciate its currency. The Senate failed to reject the amendment, leading to a vote on S. 295 with similar language. In response to the vote on S.Amdt. 309, the Senate leadership agreed to allow a vote on S. 295 by July 27, 2005, with the condition that similar amendments would not be sponsored during the 109th Congress. Senator Schumer and other sponsors of S. 295 delayed consideration of the bill after being briefed on China's expected currency reforms. Schumer later pushed for consideration of S. 295 following disappointment over China's currency reforms in July 2005. Senator Schumer pushed for consideration of S. 295 after disappointment over China's currency reforms in July 2005. The Senate agreed to consider the bill by March 31, 2006, but Schumer and Graham later delayed it based on their assessment of China's currency policy. However, Schumer expressed disappointment with China's progress on currency flexibility in September 2006 and requested the Senate to take up S. 295. Senator Schumer expressed disappointment with China's currency policy and requested the Senate to consider S. 295. Senators Schumer and Graham later decided not to pursue a vote on the bill to give Secretary of Treasury Henry Paulson more time to negotiate with China. H.R. 3283 (English) aims to apply U.S. countervailing laws to non-market economies like China and requires the Treasury Department to define \"currency manipulation\" and report on China's currency regime. The House passed a bill on July 27, 2005, requiring the Treasury Department to define currency manipulation and report on China's new currency regime. A similar bill was introduced in the Senate."
