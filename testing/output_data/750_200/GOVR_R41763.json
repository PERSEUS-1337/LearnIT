    "content": "Regulation is a fundamental government function, with federal agencies issuing thousands of rules annually on various topics. The costs of complying with these regulations are not included in the federal budget process. Some policymakers are interested in measuring total regulatory costs and benefits, as seen in the Congressional Office of Regulatory Analysis Creation and Sunset and Review Act of 2011. The Congressional Office of Regulatory Analysis Creation and Sunset and Review Act of 2011 (H.R. 214, 112th Congress) would require the newly created office to issue an annual report estimating the total costs and benefits of all existing Federal regulations. This is a response to the difficulty in measuring total regulatory costs and benefits, as determining the baseline for measurement and aggregating study results pose challenges. The difficulty in measuring total regulatory costs and benefits is highlighted, with challenges in determining baselines for measurement and aggregating study results. Some doubt the possibility of accurately measuring total regulatory costs and benefits. In 2010, a report by the Small Business Administration stated that the annual cost of federal regulations in 2008 was about $1.75. The report by Nicole V. Crain and W. Mark Crain estimated the annual cost of federal regulations in 2008 to be $1.75 trillion. This was the fourth report prepared for the SBA Office of Advocacy in 15 years, with previous estimates ranging from $416 billion to $1.1 trillion. The $1.75 trillion estimate of federal regulatory costs in 2008 by W. Mark Crain has been widely cited as evidence for regulatory reform legislation and congressional oversight. Critics argue that the estimate may overstate the total cost of federal regulations. The $1.75 trillion estimate of federal regulatory costs in 2008 by W. Mark Crain includes economic regulations, environmental regulations, tax compliance, and regulations for safety and security. Economic regulations accounted for over 70% of the total cost. The estimated cost of economic regulations in 2008 was over 70% of the total federal regulatory costs, amounting to $1.75 trillion. Economic regulations impact businesses by influencing what they produce, how they operate, and their pricing strategies, both domestically and internationally. These regulations include restrictions and incentives that affect competition, production, employment, and prices. The cost of economic regulations in 2008 was over 70% of total federal regulatory costs, amounting to $1.75 trillion. These regulations include quotas and tariffs on foreign imports that limit competition, restrict production and employment, raise prices, and curtail U.S. economic activities. Crain and Crain used a Worldwide Governance Index (WGI) of regulatory quality to estimate the cost of economic regulations. The index measures perceptions of governments' ability to formulate and implement policies that promote private sector development. In 2008, Crain and Crain used the WGI regulatory quality index to analyze the impact of regulations on the US economy. They found that the US scored +1.579 on the index, representing minimal regulation. Regression analysis was used to determine the effect of changes in regulatory quality on GDP per capita, while controlling for other variables like population and education levels. Using the WGI regulatory quality index, Crain and Crain found that a one-unit change in the index represented a 9.4% change in real GDP per capita. The difference between the US index value of +1.579 and the maximum of +2.5 was calculated to result in an 8.7% reduction in GDP. In 2008, the United States had a regulatory quality index of +1.579, resulting in an 8.7% reduction in GDP according to Crain and Crain. This equated to about $1.236 trillion decrease in real GDP per capita. The WGI index for the US in 2008 was determined by aggregating expert-based measures and surveys scored on a 0 to 1 scale. The regulatory quality index for the United States in 2008 was determined by aggregating six expert-based measures and two surveys, each scored on a 0 to 1 scale. The Economist Intelligence Unit scored at 0.70 based on factors like access to capital markets and ease of starting a business. Global Insight Business Conditions and Risk Indicators (scored at 0.94) show that access to capital markets is easily available, corporate taxes are non-distortionary, labor regulations hinder business activities, and it is easy to start a business. The score is based on tax effectiveness and legislation. Global Risk Service (scored at 0.95) also assesses business risks. The Global Risk Service, with a score of 0.95, evaluates business laws and regulations, including export and import regulations, business ownership restrictions, and equity ownership restrictions. The Heritage Foundation Index of Economic Freedom, scoring 0.73, is a nongovernmental institute advocating conservative policies. The Heritage Foundation, a nongovernmental institute in Washington, advocates conservative policies. The WGI index describes it as focusing on \"foreign investment\" and \"banking/finance.\" The Institutional Profiles Database, provided by the French government, evaluates factors like \"ease of starting a business\" and \"competition regulation arrangements.\" Political Risk Services International Country Risk Guide (scored at 1.00) evaluates factors such as \"administered prices and market prices,\" \"competition in the productive sector,\" and \"competition regulation arrangements.\" The score is based on the investment profile judgment by experts. The Institute for Management and Development World Competitiveness Yearbook (scored at 0.50) is also used to develop the regulatory quality index. The regulatory quality index is based on a survey conducted by the Institute for Management and Development World Competitiveness Yearbook, scoring at 0.50. Business people in the United States comment on 16 factors related to business conduct, such as protectionism, access to capital markets, corporate taxes, and labor regulations. The World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Report (scored at 0.62) surveyed domestic and foreign-owned firms on factors like burdensome administrative regulations, distortionary tax systems, limited competition in the local market, and ease of starting a business. Labor regulations were found to hinder business activities. The World Economic Forum is an international organization based in Switzerland. The World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Report highlighted factors such as burdensome administrative regulations, distortionary tax systems, limited competition in the local market, and ease of starting a business. Some observers have questioned the accuracy of WGI indices, but the authors have defended their methodology. The WGI indices were developed and correlated with an OECD index of economic regulations. Crain and Crain chose the WGI regulatory quality index for their study due to its broader coverage and use of multiple sources. The WGI authors stated that indices like the regulatory quality index are useful for cross-country comparisons. The WGI authors indicated that indices like the regulatory quality index are useful for broad cross-country comparisons but may not be precise enough for specific governance reforms in individual countries. They emphasized the need for detailed, country-specific data to identify relevant constraints on governance. The validity of Crain and Crain's estimate of economic regulations' cost depends on various factors. The validity of Crain and Crain's estimate of the cost of economic regulations depends on the use of the WGI index of \"regulatory quality\" and its interpretation. Aart Kraay, a lead economist at the World Bank, provided his views on their use of the index. Aart Kraay, a lead economist at the World Bank, criticized Crain and Crain's interpretation of the WGI regulatory quality index in their report on regulatory costs. Kraay highlighted two main issues with their use of the index, stating that it measures perceptions of the regulatory environment's quality, not the stringency of regulations. Aart Kraay, a lead economist at the World Bank, criticized the interpretation of the WGI regulatory quality index in a report on regulatory costs. He noted that the index measures perceptions of the overall quality of the regulatory environment, not just stringency. Kraay mentioned that the United States ranks high on the index, with countries like Finland and Sweden ahead. He emphasized that the WGI indicators have margins of error, indicating imprecision in country rankings. Aart Kraay criticized the interpretation of the WGI regulatory quality index, noting that the indicators have margins of error and imprecision in country rankings. Kraay pointed out a misinterpretation of the units of the WGI by comparing the United States' score to a \"minimal amount of regulation.\" Aart Kraay criticized the interpretation of the WGI regulatory quality index, noting the imprecision in country rankings due to margins of error. He suggested comparing the US score on RQ with a country like Singapore or Denmark for a more relevant calibration of regulatory costs. Aart Kraay suggested comparing the US regulatory quality index with countries like Singapore or Denmark for a more relevant calibration of regulatory costs. Kraay noted the imprecision in country rankings due to margins of error in the WGI data. The regulatory quality index comparison between the US and Ireland using 2008 data showed a difference of 0.336. Crain and Crain's regression analysis indicated a 9.4% change in real GDP per capita for a one-unit change in the index. The 0.336 difference in regulatory quality index between the US and Ireland suggests a 3.16% reduction in GDP in the US compared to Ireland. This would amount to about $448 billion, less than previously calculated. Kraay indicated that higher values on the index reflect less stringent regulations. Kraay expressed concerns about the quality of the regression analysis by Crain and Crain, stating that high scores on regulatory quality are linked to other beneficial policies and institutions, making it difficult to determine the true impact of regulatory environment on GDP per capita. Crain and Crain responded to Kraay's concerns about the impact of regulatory quality on GDP per capita, stating that while it is challenging to control for all factors, their empirical evidence shows that their regulatory quality index does reflect changes in regulation stringency. The Crain and Crain index reflects changes in regulation stringency, capturing stakeholders' perceptions on various regulations. They did not compare the US to other countries due to the need to estimate total regulatory costs for small and large businesses. The Crain and Crain report estimated the total cost of regulations for small and large businesses, using the WGI measure to capture the regulatory environment. The report was peer-reviewed by economists before publication. The SBA Office of Advocacy had the study peer reviewed by economists Bob Litan and Richard Williams. Litan found the study \"terrific\" with no additions, while Williams called it a \"great project\" but expressed concerns about the index of regulatory quality potentially overstating the costs of regulation. Richard Williams, while acknowledging the study as a \"great project,\" expressed concerns that the Regulatory Quality Index may not accurately measure the costs of regulation and could potentially overstate them. He suggested that the index might also capture effects of other regulations, such as environmental, workplace, security, and tax regulations, leading to an overestimation of total costs. Williams also mentioned that there are reasons to believe the index may underestimate costs and proposed that better explanation of what the index measures could address some of the issues. The Regulatory Quality Index may underestimate costs, according to Richard Williams. He suggested a better explanation of what the index measures to address potential issues. The Center for Progressive Reform criticized a study on economic regulatory costs and requested the withdrawal of its sponsorship by SBA's Office of Advocacy. The Center for Progressive Reform criticized a study on economic regulatory costs and requested the withdrawal of SBA's Office of Advocacy sponsorship. CPR raised concerns about the lack of clarity in defining \"economic regulations\" and the simplistic relationship assumed between regulatory \"stringency\" and GDP in the report. The Crain and Crain report analyzed data for 25 OECD countries to assess the impact of economic regulation on GDP per capita. Economists believe a country's standard of living is influenced by various factors such as land, labor, capital, technology, and infrastructure. The report falsely suggests the United States has low regulatory quality despite ranking 11th out of over 200 countries. The availability of land, labor, capital, technology, and infrastructure, along with government interventions, can impact a country's standard of living. Crain and Crain's analysis examined the relationship between GDP per capita and regulatory quality, considering various independent variables. The analysis by Crain and Crain looked at the relationship between GDP per capita and regulatory quality, considering independent variables like country population, foreign trade, primary education, and fixed broadband subscribers. These control variables may not capture all factors affecting GDP per capita, and other measures may be more suitable. The Crain and Crain report analyzed the relationship between GDP per capita and regulatory quality, using control variables like country population, foreign trade, primary education, and fixed broadband subscribers. The report did not explain the selection of control variables or the estimation strategy used. Linear regressions on panel data were conducted for multiple countries over several years, with country-specific and year-specific control variables included. The two-stage estimation strategy used by Crain and Crain in their report, which includes fixed effects and year-specific control variables, has not been explored in peer-reviewed journals. Despite being asked, the authors did not provide the data used in their study. The authors did not provide the data used in their study despite being asked. A sensitivity analysis by CRS using different data and methods showed that the regulatory quality index had no independent effect on GDP per capita. This suggests that the analysis is highly sensitive to the choice of control variables and measures. The sensitivity analysis discussed in the previous paragraph suggests that the regulatory quality index may not have an independent effect on GDP per capita. Understanding this relationship may require more focused empirical tools. Crain and Crain developed cost estimates for environmental regulations following OMB's approach in its annual reports to Congress. They used OMB's estimates for environmental costs from 2001 and 2002 reports converted into 2001 dollars for regulations issued through the first quarter of 2000 and from April 1999 to September 2001, respectively. Crain and Crain estimated that environmental regulations issued between April 1999 and September 2001 cost between $175 billion and $280 billion in 2009. They used OMB reports to calculate these costs and only considered the upper-end estimate of $280 billion for cumulative cost analysis. Crain and Crain estimated that environmental regulations issued between April 1999 and September 2001 cost between $175 billion and $280 billion in 2009. They used OMB reports to calculate these costs and only considered the upper-end estimate for cumulative cost analysis, reflecting a judgment that cost estimates are absent for important environmental regulations. The data used represent a mix of academic and agency estimates of the costs of rules issued prior to 1988 and between 1987 and the first quarter of 2000. In its 2000 report to Congress, OMB criticized the practice of summarizing total costs and benefits of regulations by combining individual studies due to varying quality. The unit of analysis differs for rules issued before 2000 and major rules from April 1999 onwards, with methodologies varying as well. OMB criticized the practice of summarizing total costs and benefits of regulations by combining individual studies due to varying quality, methodologies, and potential for double counting. In calendar year 1987, baseline estimates of rules issued through the first quarter of 2000 overlap with estimates from April 1, 1999, to September 30, 2001. The authors of the analysis incorrectly recorded environmental regulatory costs from OMB reports for the periods October 2002 through September 2003 and October 2003 through September 2004. The OMB reported costs for environmental regulations were higher than the estimates provided by Crain and Crain. The authors did not include OMB's estimates of the benefits of environmental regulations in their analysis. Regulatory benefits were excluded as per the requirements of the Office of Advocacy. Table 1 displays both the estimated costs and benefits of environmental rules from OMB's reports. The estimated costs and benefits of environmental rules from OMB's reports were analyzed as required by the Office of Advocacy. In most time periods, the average estimated benefits exceeded the costs, with the lowest benefits higher than the highest costs in six out of nine periods. Only in one period were the highest costs higher than the lowest benefits. Crain and Crain assumed OMB's coverage of environmental regulations was comprehensive. Crain and Crain's report assumes OMB's coverage of environmental regulations is comprehensive. They used OMB's upper estimate of environmental costs due to the belief that cost estimates were lacking for some regulations. Regulatory experts have also noted OMB's conservative approach in estimating regulatory costs. Agencies are conservative in estimating regulatory costs, with studies showing they overestimate benefits and underestimate costs. The Center for Progressive Reform noted that agencies' estimates of environmental costs are often too high. The Center for Progressive Reform criticized agencies for relying on industry estimates for environmental costs, which tend to be inflated. They also pointed out that these estimates do not consider technological advancements that lower compliance costs. CPR cited studies showing agencies' initial cost estimates are often too high and questioned the use of outdated studies by Crain and Crain. The Center for Progressive Reform criticized agencies for relying on industry estimates for environmental costs, which tend to be inflated. CPR questioned the use of outdated studies by Crain and Crain, noting that some studies used data that are now more than 30 years old. OMB acknowledged the theory that agency estimates may systematically understate costs and overstate benefits due to agency self-interest in regulation. OMB acknowledged the theory that agencies may understate costs and overstate benefits due to self-interest in regulation. However, there is little documentation to support this view, as regulated entities may actually overstate costs to avoid regulations. Competitive firms often find cost-effective ways to comply over time. Competitive firms often find cost-effective ways to comply with regulations over time, utilizing new technologies. Agencies tend to overestimate the benefits of their programs, as technological progress reduces the long-term expected benefits of earlier regulations. Some commenters support this with upcoming case studies. The authors estimated that businesses, individuals, and nonprofits spent about 4.3 billion burden hours on tax paperwork in 2008, with 2.28 billion burden hours for business and 2.02 billion burden hours for individuals and nonprofits. In 2008, businesses, individuals, and nonprofits spent an estimated 4.3 billion burden hours on tax paperwork, costing about $159.6 billion. The breakdown was approximately 2.28 billion burden hours for business and 2.02 billion burden hours for individuals and nonprofits. The methodology used by Crain and Crain to compile data from the IRS website and the Tax Foundation was not disclosed in their report. In 2008, businesses, individuals, and nonprofits spent an estimated 4.3 billion burden hours on tax paperwork, costing about $159.6 billion. The methodology used by Crain and Crain to compile data from the IRS website and the Tax Foundation was not disclosed in their report. In May 2009, the IRS represented about 77.8% of the government-wide estimate and 99.5% of the Treasury estimate. If those ratios applied in 2008, IRS paperwork would have been about 7.5 billion burden hours\u20143.2 billion hours higher than in the Crain and Crain report. Certain aspects of how Crain and Crain monetized IRS burden hours are unclear, such as assumptions about who completes business tax paperwork and where hourly rates were sourced from. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, tax preparers received an average salary of $17.34 per hour in May 2009. Even with total compensation assumed to be one-third higher, the average compensation for tax preparers would still be just over $23 per hour. This figure could be used for all tax compliance to balance out businesses and individuals who prepare their own returns. The average compensation for tax preparers is just over $23 per hour. Multiplying this by 7.5 billion burden hours yields a total cost of about $172.5 billion, $12.9 billion higher than previous estimates. OMB does not include tax paperwork in its annual reports on regulatory costs. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) does not include tax paperwork in its annual reports on regulatory costs. OMB stated that filling out tax forms is a result of the tax code itself, with regulations providing interpretations and clarifications. The IRS paperwork burden is primarily driven by the complexities of the Tax Code, according to John D. Graham, administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) within OMB. The IRS paperwork burden is mainly driven by the complexities of the Tax Code, which requires collecting a significant amount of information to ensure taxpayer compliance. Congress passing numerous tax laws has led to increased reporting and recordkeeping requirements, adding to taxpayer burden. The IRS had to make changes to the 1040 schedules to implement the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001. The IRS had to make changes to the 1040 schedules to implement the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001, increasing the burden on taxpayers by 47 million hours. Other factors, such as economic and population growth, also contribute to the overall IRS burden hours. The final category of regulatory costs focused on workplace regulations related to safety and health, primarily from OSHA and homeland security. The estimated cost of occupational safety and health regulations before 2001 was over $64.3 billion in 2009 dollars, based on a study by Joseph M. Johnson and data from OMB's 2009 report. The authors synthesized studies on workplace regulations, adding data from OMB's 2009 report. They estimated the total cost for occupational safety, health, and homeland security regulations in 2008 to be about $75.2 billion. The estimated cost for occupational safety and health regulations in 2008 was approximately $75.2 billion, obtained from OMB's 2009 report. The costs were associated with four rules under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration program, ranging between $362 million and $389 million in 2001 dollars. The authors Crain and Crain used the upper-end of OMB's estimated cost range for regulations, including homeland security costs, which ranged from $440 million to $471 million in 2009 dollars. They obtained their estimate from page 18 of OMB's 2009 report. Crain obtained their estimate for homeland security costs from page 18 of OMB's 2009 report, which reported that agencies have finalized 17 major homeland security regulations imposing a total annual cost of $5.1 billion to $10.4 billion on the economy. The authors used the upper-end of OMB's cost estimates for environmental rules, believing agencies tend to underestimate regulatory costs. However, OMB stated agencies' cost estimates are not overly conservative. The Center for Progressive Reform found that occupational safety and health cost estimates likely overstate true compliance costs. The Center for Progressive Reform criticized the authors for using inflated cost estimates for occupational safety and health regulations, which they believe overstate true compliance costs. They argued that including fines for violations as regulatory costs is unjustified. The Center for Progressive Reform criticized the inclusion of fines for violations as regulatory costs, arguing that it inflates cost estimates. W. Mark Crain estimated federal regulatory costs at $1.11 trillion in 2004 and $1.75 trillion in 2008, attributing the increase to a change in methodology. The increase in federal regulatory costs from $1.11 trillion in 2004 to $1.75 trillion in 2008 was mainly due to a change in methodology. If not for the increase in economic regulations, the total estimated cost of other regulations would have decreased by about $6 billion. Congress has required OMB to submit annual reports on the costs and benefits of federal regulations for nearly 15 years. The requirement for OMB to submit reports on the costs and benefits of federal regulations was established in the Treasury, Postal Service and General Government Appropriations Act, 1997. This requirement was later made permanent in 2001 by the Regulatory Right-to-Know Act. The Government Appropriations Act, 2001, also known as the \"Regulatory Right-to-Know Act,\" mandates OMB to provide an accounting statement and report estimating the total costs and benefits of federal regulations. This includes quantifiable and nonquantifiable effects, aggregated by agency, agency program, and major rule. The report must also analyze the impacts of federal regulations on state, local, and tribal governments, small businesses, and wages. The OMB is required to provide an accounting statement and report estimating the total costs and benefits of federal regulations, including their impacts on various entities. In 1997, OMB estimated federal regulatory costs at $279 billion and benefits at $298 billion. In 1998, costs were estimated between $170 billion and $230 billion, with benefits between $260 billion. In its 1998 report, OMB estimated federal regulatory costs at $170-$230 billion and benefits at $260 billion to $3.5 trillion. The increase in benefits was mainly due to including EPA's estimate of Clean Air Act benefits, which was controversial. In its 2000 and 2001 reports, OMB estimated the cost of social regulations at $146-$229 billion and benefits at $254 billion to nearly $1.8 trillion. The drop in benefits was due to a decrease in the EPA's estimate of Clean Air Act benefits. OMB presented these estimates with strong caveats each year. In its reports, OMB highlighted methodological challenges in estimating the total costs and benefits of Federal regulations, citing unclear baselines and the difficulty in accounting for standard business practices. The difficulty in attributing costs or benefits to federal regulations, as opposed to other factors like state or local rules, voluntary standards organizations, insurance requirements, or the tort system, makes it challenging to accurately estimate the impact of regulations. Technological advancements can also render previous estimates of benefits and costs inaccurate, and aggregating results from different studies is problematic due to variations in methodologies. Aggregating results from different studies on regulatory costs and benefits is challenging due to variations in quality and methodology. OMB did not include \"transfer\" rules in its estimates of total regulatory costs, as it considered them to reflect a redistribution of wealth rather than social costs to society as a whole. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) excluded certain costs and benefits in its estimates of regulatory costs, such as payments reflecting wealth redistribution and costs associated with filling out tax paperwork. OMB also did not include estimates for rules published after 1987 without cost-benefit analyses. OMB's \"Regulatory Right-to-Know Act\" reports since 2001 have not included cost or benefit estimates for all rules, only those with costs or benefits of at least $100 million annually that were monetized. The report for 2002 covered regulations reviewed from April 1, 1995, to September 30, 2001, with a total cost of about. OMB reviewed regulations from April 1, 1995, to September 30, 2001, estimating costs at $50-53 billion and benefits at $48-101 billion. In 2003, they reviewed regulations from October 1992 to September 2002, with costs at $37-43 billion and benefits at $146-230 billion, noting EPA rules accounted for a significant portion. In 2003, OMB reviewed regulations from October 1992 to September 2002, with costs ranging from nearly $37 billion to nearly $43 billion (in 2001 dollars) and benefits ranging from $146 billion to $230 billion. EPA rules accounted for a substantial fraction of the aggregate benefits for all 107 rules. Each report since 2003 has provided information for rules meeting specific criteria during the previous 10 years. OMB's decision to present data for only certain rules during a limited time-frame was driven by the inconsistent and aged nature of many studies used to develop aggregate estimates. OMB decided not to reproduce aggregate estimates from regulations issued over ten years ago, citing their unreliability. The total costs and benefits of federal rules in effect were estimated to be significantly larger. Estimates for rules adopted prior to the 10-year period were deemed irrelevant. In 2003, OMB stated that estimates for regulations adopted over ten years ago are unreliable. John D. Graham emphasized that past estimates, like the Crain and Hopkins estimate of $843 billion, may not be accurate for regulatory accounting. The Crain and Hopkins estimate of $843 billion, produced in 2001 for the Small Business Administration, is a rough indicator of regulatory activity's impact on the macro economy. Based on previous estimates dating back to the 1970s, the underlying studies were conducted by academics using various techniques. The estimates of regulatory impact on the macro economy, dating back to the 1970s, may no longer be accurate due to changes over the years. Cost estimates combine various types of regulations, some imposing real costs and others causing income transfers. Information by agency and program is incomplete, and benefit information is lacking. The estimates of regulatory impact on the macro economy from the 1970s may no longer be accurate. Cost estimates combine different types of regulations, some imposing real costs and others causing income transfers. Information by agency and program is incomplete, and benefit information is lacking. The estimates might not meet OMB's information quality guidelines, as many studies relied upon lack transparency for reproducibility. In recent Reports to Congress, only the costs and benefits of major regulations prepared by agencies and reviewed by OMB over the last ten years are reported. OMB's 2009 report to Congress provided estimates of the total annual benefits and costs of 98 regulations reviewed over a 10-year period. Graham criticized the requirement for agencies to submit annual cost and benefit estimates, calling it \"not workable.\" The OMB's 2009 report to Congress estimated the costs and benefits of 98 regulations over a 10-year period. The estimated costs ranged from $51 billion to $60 billion, while benefits were between $126 billion and $663 billion in 2001 dollars. The OMB's 2009 report estimated costs and benefits of 98 regulations over a 10-year period, ranging from $51 billion to $60 billion in costs and $126 billion to $663 billion in benefits (in 2001 dollars). OMB noted that the estimates were not a complete accounting of all regulations issued during this period. The OMB's 2009 report estimated costs and benefits of 98 regulations over a 10-year period, ranging from $51 billion to $60 billion in costs and $126 billion to $663 billion in benefits. Aggregating benefit and cost estimates of individual regulations provides insight, but the resulting estimates are neither precise nor complete due to varying rigor, assumptions, and data in regulatory impact analyses. Comparing OMB's estimates with other sources like Crain and Crain is challenging due to different construction methods and presentation categories. Crain and Crain's estimates of annual regulatory costs in 2008 were much larger than OMB's estimates due to different methodologies. Crain and Crain included costs associated with all rules, while OMB only included major rules meeting specific criteria over a 10-year period. Crain and Crain's estimates of annual regulatory costs in 2008 were significantly higher than OMB's estimates as they included costs associated with all rules, including economic regulations and tax paperwork. Decision makers should be cautious when using studies on aggregate regulatory costs and benefits, considering the different methodologies used in these estimates. The validity and reliability of Crain and Crain's $1.75 trillion estimate of total federal regulatory costs in 2008 depend on the WGI index of regulatory quality for the United States, which reflects how economic regulations impact per capita real GDP. However, one of the authors of the index has stated that Crain and Crain misinterpreted it. One author of the regulatory quality index stated that Crain and Crain misinterpreted the index, emphasizing that higher values do not mean \"less stringent regulations.\" Comparing the US regulatory quality index to a country like Ireland would significantly reduce Crain and Crain's estimated cost of economic regulations. The cost estimate of economic regulations by Crain and Crain has been significantly reduced due to concerns about the regulatory quality index and regression analysis used. Despite criticisms, Crain and Crain maintain that the index reflects the stringency of economic regulations in the US. The World Bank cautions that regulatory quality index may not be useful for specific governance reforms. Crain and Crain's estimates for regulations mix old academic studies with agencies' cost estimates developed before rules were issued. Crain and Crain's approach to estimating regulatory costs is criticized for mixing old academic studies with outdated agencies' cost estimates. They selectively used the highest cost estimates from OMB reports, arguing that the estimates did not cover all regulations. Crain and Crain selectively used the highest cost estimates from OMB reports, believing government agencies underestimate regulatory costs. OMB disputes this, stating little evidence supports it, and older cost estimates are of questionable relevance. OMB's annual reports to Congress since 2003 focus on major rules' costs and benefits. OMB's annual \"Regulatory Right-to-Know Act\" reports to Congress since 2003 focus on major rules' costs and benefits, with older cost estimates considered unreliable. Incremental costs of regulations tend to decrease over time as business practices and consumer expectations evolve. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has increased automobile safety, but if regulations were eliminated, companies are unlikely to stop safety features due to consumer demand and product liability concerns. Environmentally responsible behavior has also become financially beneficial over time. The rising baseline phenomenon reduces the true costs and benefits of health, safety, and environmental regulations. Estimates including unadjusted estimates from aging studies may overestimate current costs and benefits. OMB suggests that compliance costs for regulations over ten years old may only save half if magically disappeared. Crain and Crain estimated compliance cost savings for old regulations may only be half if magically disappeared overnight. Their cost estimate for tax paperwork may be higher than actual data suggests, with assumptions on hourly costs potentially inflated. The cost of completing paperwork may be too high, especially if human resources professionals are paid at nearly $50 per hour. There is a question of whether tax paperwork should be considered in the same category as regulatory costs. OMB does not include tax paperwork in its reports on regulatory costs and benefits. Crain and Crain's report on federal regulations did not discuss the benefits of those regulations, even though the information was available in OMB reports. The authors of a report on federal regulations did not address the benefits of regulation, stating they were not asked to look at benefits as per the Office of Advocacy's requirements. The authors of a report on federal regulations confirmed that they were not asked to look at benefits, as the task was to update the previous study which focused on costs and disproportionality between small and large businesses. Executive Order 12866 requires agencies to assess both costs and benefits of regulations and select approaches that maximize net benefits. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) reports to Congress that federal regulations should maximize net benefits. In the 2010 report, aggregate costs of major rules were estimated at $43-55 billion, while benefits were estimated at $128-616 billion. Of the 16 major rules in FY2009, costs were estimated at $3.7 billion. In FY2009, major rules had costs estimated at $3.7 billion and benefits estimated at $8.6 billion to $28.9 billion. In FY2010, costs were estimated at $6.5 billion, with benefits ranging from $44 billion to $651 billion. In FY2010, major rules had costs estimated at $6.5 billion to $12.5 billion, and benefits estimated at $23.3 billion to $82.3 billion. Some rules only quantified costs or benefits, not both. Crain and Crain's 2008 estimate of $1.75 trillion in federal regulations costs has been used to argue for regulatory reform legislation. The $1.75 trillion in federal regulations costs in 2008 has been cited as evidence for regulatory reform legislation. However, Crain and Crain stated that their report was not intended for decision-making by lawmakers or regulatory agencies. They emphasized that information on regulatory costs alone provides only one piece of information for policymakers to consider. Costs alone, whether for individual rules or all rules in the aggregate, provide limited information for policymakers. If the monetized benefits of federal regulations exceed the costs, policymakers may consider them justified. Conversely, if benefits are less than costs, policymakers may reach a different conclusion or examine non-monetized costs. After considering both costs and benefits, policymakers may reach a different conclusion or examine non-monetized costs. To assess the sensitivity of Crain and Crain's results, CRS ran a linear regression using similar data for 30 OECD countries over the period 2002-2008. The study replicated Crain and Crain's analysis from 2002-2008 using GDP per capita and four independent variables. Data was sourced from the OECD website. Another variable, primary school enrollment, had an unexpected negative coefficient. The analysis found a negative coefficient for primary school enrollment in relation to GDP per capita. This unexpected result may be due to \"aging pyramid\" demographic effects, which were accounted for by adding variables for the proportion of the population under 14 and over 65. These demographic measures may more directly capture the effects of an aging population. The analysis used demographic measures to account for \"aging pyramid\" effects in relation to GDP per capita. The estimation results were obtained using a cross-country fixed effects panel estimator with year indicator variables. The estimation output is available in Table A-1. The estimation output in Table A-1 shows that the coefficient on the World Governance Indicators regulatory quality index is very small and not significantly different from zero. The coefficient on population is also statistically insignificant, while other coefficients have expected signs and are statistically significant. The point estimate of the coefficient for regulatory quality index can be used to estimate the economic effect of shifting the United States from its 2008 regulatory quality index value to the level of Ireland in 2008. The economic effect of shifting the United States from its 2008 regulatory quality index value to the level of Ireland in 2008 is estimated to result in a $2.14 increase in per capita GDP. However, due to the imprecise nature of the point estimate, the calculated effect is also imprecise. The Irish level is imprecise, with 99.9% of the variance in the model results from differences among countries. Estimating the effects of variables that change slowly over time, such as the regulatory environment in economically advanced countries, may be challenging using panel estimation methods. Other econometric approaches focusing on specific changes in the regulatory environment may provide a better understanding of the effects of regulation on economic activity."
