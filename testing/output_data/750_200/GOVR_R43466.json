These medications are used to treat various mental health conditions, but there is limited evidence on their safety and efficacy in children. Congress is closely monitoring how states regulate the use of psychotropic medications for foster children. The report discusses the oversight of psychotropic medication use in children in foster care by Congress and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Federal law requires states to monitor and regulate the use of these medications among foster children. Child welfare agencies investigate abuse or neglect of children by parents or guardians. Some children remain at home, while others are placed in foster care for round-the-clock care. Children in foster care are placed in settings like foster family homes or group homes due to neglect or abuse by parents. Placement in foster care is determined by a judge for the child's welfare, with the state child welfare agency responsible for their care. During FY2015, approximately 671,000 children spent time in foster care due to neglect, abuse, or behavioral issues. Foster care is meant to be temporary until reunification with parents or permanent placement with relatives, an adopted family, or legal guardian. States must ensure the safety and well-being of children in foster care, addressing their physical and mental health needs. During FY2015, 671,000 children were in foster care, with 243,000 exiting the system. Approximately 428,000 children remained in care by the end of the fiscal year. The national foster care caseload has been declining for over a decade, with about 77,000 fewer children in care compared to FY2006. Children in foster care have higher mental health service needs than the general population. Children in foster care during FY2015 had higher mental health service needs compared to the general population. The abuse or neglect they experience before entering foster care can lead to serious mental health outcomes, affecting their socialization and behavior. In a national survey, 43%-46% of children in foster care exhibited problem behaviors. In a national survey conducted in 2008 and 2009, a high percentage of children in foster care were found to be at risk of behavioral or emotional problems, with rates much higher than those in the general population. Children in foster care are at a high risk of behavioral and emotional problems, with rates much higher than the general population. Medicaid-eligible foster care children are increasingly diagnosed with mental health issues such as attention disorders, anxiety, autism, bipolar disorders, conduct disorders, depression, and schizophrenia. Children in foster care, eligible for Medicaid, are increasingly diagnosed with mental health disorders such as attention disorders, anxiety, autism, bipolar disorders, conduct disorders, depression, and schizophrenia. Diagnoses vary by age, with older children more likely to be diagnosed. In 2007, children in foster care with Medicaid eligibility were diagnosed with various mental health disorders based on their age. Older children were more likely to be diagnosed with conduct disorders and depression. Rates of major mental health diagnoses by age group are shown in Figure 1. Rates of major mental health diagnoses increased for children in foster care across all diagnoses for both age groups (6 to 11 years and 12 to 18 years), except for depression in the younger age group and schizophrenia in both age groups. National standards recommend mental health screenings and assessments for all children placed in foster care. A comprehensive mental health assessment by a professional is recommended for children in foster care, with services available through Medicaid. Each state designs its own plan for medical assistance under Medicaid, meeting federal requirements for reimbursement. Children in foster care are eligible for Medicaid, receiving the same services as other children in the state's program, including health screenings and necessary treatments through the EPSDT program. The EPSDT program under federal statute covers health screenings, assessments, laboratory tests, immunizations, health education, and vision, dental, and hearing services for children. States must provide treatment for children's identified health needs, including mental health needs, using Medicaid financing. Medicaid financing can be used to provide services for children's behavioral health needs, including case management and services from mental health professionals like psychiatrists, psychologists, and clinical social workers. This may also cover prescription drugs. Children with mental health challenges may benefit from psychosocial treatment such as counseling and case management. There is evidence supporting the use of psychosocial treatment interventions for mental disorders in children. There is evidence supporting the use of psychosocial treatment interventions for mental disorders in children, including behavioral and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), family-focused and group-based treatment, and treatments with multiple interventions. CBT, such as anger management and social skills training, has been effective for children experiencing trauma. Psychotropic medications may be prescribed to children in foster care when psychosocial treatment alone is not effective for trauma. However, psychotropics may be given without accompanying therapies due to limited resources for addressing complex mental health needs. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have noted that over-reliance on medication for children in care may indicate a lack of access to effective behavioral health care and evidence-based psychosocial therapies. Children in foster care are more likely to receive mental health supports compared to those who remain in their own homes following an investigation of alleged abuse or neglect. Medicaid claims data for children also show disparities in access to effective behavioral health care and evidence-based therapies. Children in foster care have a higher utilization of psychosocial mental health interventions compared to non-foster children on Medicaid. Research shows an increase in the use of these interventions among foster children taking antipsychotic medication. However, studies indicate that not all children in foster care who need mental health services receive them. A national survey from 2008 to 2010 revealed that 3 out of 10 foster children with clinical mental health needs did not receive specialty services or psychotropics, while 9% received psychotropics without services. Between 16% and 33% of children in out-of-home care may use psychotropic medication daily, with varying rates based on factors like age and placement setting. Rates of psychotropic medication use among children in foster care far exceed the rates among children generally, with children in foster care receiving psychotropic medication at three to nine times the rate of all other children served by Medicaid. Children in foster care receive psychotropic medication at higher rates compared to other children served by Medicaid, including those with diagnosed mental or neurodevelopmental disorders. Research shows that children in non-relative foster family homes are not more likely than child-welfare involved children living in their own homes to be prescribed psychotropic medication. This study excludes children in foster care group settings or residential treatment facilities, where rates of psychotropic medication use tend to be higher. Rates of psychotropic medication use among children in the child welfare system, including those in foster care, vary by state and over time. Research from the early 2000s found significant variation in prescription practices, with state practices playing a key role in prescribing psychotropic medication. A study of Medicaid claims data from 2002 to 2007 showed variation in psychotropic medication use among children in foster care. There was an initial increase followed by a decline in most states, but an increase in the use of antipsychotic medications during the same time frame. A study analyzed Medicaid claims data from 2002 to 2007 on psychotropic medication use among children in foster care. It found varying trends in medication use across states, with most experiencing an initial increase followed by a decline, except for antipsychotic medications which showed an increase in usage during the same period. A recent review analyzed trends in Medicaid claims data for children in foster care across 20 states. It showed an increase in antipsychotic use from 2005 to 2008, followed by a slight decrease by 2010. Non-foster care children and privately insured children had lower levels of antipsychotic use, with a slight increase in usage among privately insured children from 2005 to 2009. Data primarily came from the second National Survey on Child and Adolescent Well-Being (NSCAW II). The use of psychotropic medication among children in foster care increased from 2005 to 2009 and remained steady through 2013, based on data from the second National Survey on Child and Adolescent Well-Being (NSCAW II) funded by HHS. The survey examined outcomes of children who had contact with the child welfare system due to abuse or neglect, including the prescription rates of psychotropic medications. The NSCAW II survey captured the experiences of children prescribed psychotropic medications, including those who remained in their homes or were placed in foster care. The children's ages ranged from 2 months to 17.5 years at the time of the initial survey in 2008-2009. Children in the NSCAW II survey were of various ages at different follow-up points, ranging from 2 months to 20 years old. They may have been in foster care intermittently and were less likely to be using psychotropic medications if living with their own parents post-investigation. The NSCAW II data shows that children living with their own parents after an investigation of child abuse or neglect were less likely to be using psychotropic medication compared to those in foster care. Children in foster care, especially those in congregate care and school age, had a higher likelihood of using psychotropic medications. There was no significant difference in medication use between children placed in foster care and those who remained at home at four to six months post-investigation. At four to six months post-investigation, children in foster care (15.9%) and those at home (11.6%) had similar medication usage rates. However, at 18 months, children in foster care (23.1%) were more likely to be on psychotropic medications compared to those at home (10.9%). By 36 months, 32.8% of children in care were on psychotropics, higher than the 12.9% of children at home. Children in foster group homes or residential treatment programs had higher medication use than others in foster care. Among children in foster care, those in foster group homes or residential treatment programs had significantly higher psychotropic medication use compared to those in foster family homes and formal kin care. The prevalence of medication use was close to 48.2% for children in group foster care settings within six months of initial investigation of abuse or neglect, compared to 11.8% to 19.5% in other foster care settings. Figure 3 illustrates the rate of medication use for children living out of home or in foster care placements approximately 18 months post-investigation. Children in group settings had the highest rate of psychotropic medication use at 67.4%, compared to 15.9% to 23.8% in other foster care settings, 10.9% in their own homes, and 11.9% in informal kin care. This pattern persisted 36 months post-investigation, with over half of children in group settings still on psychotropics (52%). Children in group settings had the highest rate of psychotropic medication use at 67.4%, compared to 15.9% to 23.8% in other foster care settings, 10.9% in their own homes, and 11.9% in informal kin care. Approximately 18 months after the initial investigation, just over half of children in group settings were still taking psychotropics (52%). The rate of use ranged from 16.5% to 36.1% among children in other foster care settings, 12.5% for children in their own homes, and 16.5% for those in informal kin care. Children in foster care group homes or residential settings were most likely to be taking more than one psychotropic medication. At 18 months after the initial investigation, children in foster care group homes or residential settings had the highest rate of taking multiple psychotropic medications, with about half of them prescribed two or more drugs. The rate of children in other child welfare settings taking two or more drugs was significantly lower, ranging from 5.7% to 14.6%. At 36 months following the initial investigation, children in group settings still had a high rate of taking two or more psychotropic medications, followed by children in foster care, formal kin care, and informal kin care. Children in group settings had the highest rate of taking multiple psychotropic medications, with those in foster care also showing high usage. Youth ages 11 to 17 were most likely to be using psychotropics at each follow-up wave. At each follow-up wave, youth ages 11 to 17 had the highest likelihood of using psychotropic medications, followed by younger age groups. Older youth, ages 18 and above, were less likely to be prescribed psychotropics. Research literature describes the prescribing patterns for foster children as \"too many, too much, and too young,\" with concerns about polypharmacy. An analysis of national Medicaid claims data from 2002 through 2007 found that polypharmacy, defined as concurrent use of three or more psychotropic medication classes for at least 30 days during a one-year period, was consistent at about 5.2% to 5.9% annually among children in foster care. In 2011, Medicaid claims data for 20 states showed that polypharmacy with three or more antipsychotic drugs for at least 90 days was comparable for children in foster care (2.8%) and those not in foster care (3.1%). In 2011, data from the NSCAW II study showed that children in foster care prescribed psychotropics had an average of 1.9 medications per child. The percentage of children in group or residential settings prescribed three or more psychotropics was significantly higher compared to other groups. Concerns have been raised about the use of certain classes of medications. The use of multiple psychotropics in foster children, especially in group or residential settings, has raised concerns. Antipsychotic polypharmacy has shown greater adverse effects with minimal benefits. There are worries about exceeding recommended dosages and the limited research on the safety and efficacy of these medications for children, particularly very young ones. Studies on the safety and efficacy of psychotropic medications for children, especially very young ones, are limited. Concerns have been raised about the high prescription rates of psychotropics for children under the age of 6 in out-of-home care, with rates ranging from 0.3% to 2.1%. The use of multiple psychotropics in foster children, particularly in group or residential settings, has also raised concerns about adverse effects and limited research on the medications. Studies have shown high prescription rates of psychotropic medications for children under 6 in foster care, ranging from 0.3% to 2.1%. Concerns have been raised about the lack of established mental health indications for psychotropic drug use in infants and young children, as well as the potential for serious health effects. Children in foster care may benefit from psychotropic medications due to greater mental health service needs. However, these medications may not always be effective in treating their mental health needs. The lack of psychosocial services available could lead to increased use of psychotropics in this population. The use of antipsychotic medication among children in foster care has steadily increased, despite a decrease in overall psychotropic prescribing rates. This trend is attributed to a shortage of mental health providers with expertise in treating complex trauma and behavioral conditions in this population. The share of children in foster care prescribed antipsychotic medication increased from 2005 to 2008, with a slight decrease in 2010 among children in Medicaid with \"foster care\" status. This trend is influenced by limited research on medication efficacy in children and marketing strategies by pharmaceutical companies. Policymakers and stakeholders are increasingly scrutinizing the use of psychotropic medications by children in foster care. The use of psychotropics by children in foster care has raised concerns among policymakers and stakeholders in the child welfare field. Research on the safety and effectiveness of these medications for this population is limited, particularly for antipsychotics. Studies have shown insufficient evidence to support the use of antipsychotics in addressing mental health disorders in children, including those in foster care. Little to no evidence is available for certain conditions such as disruptive behavior disorders. The analysis found limited evidence supporting the use of antipsychotics for child mental health disorders, with insufficient data for conditions like disruptive behavior disorders, obsessive compulsive disorders, and eating disorders. Studies had a high risk of bias due to improper handling of missing data, lack of random assignment to treatment groups, and funding from pharmaceutical companies. Some children in foster care may benefit from psychotropic medication for managing symptoms and issues related to mental health and behavior concerns stemming from exposure to complex trauma, especially when combined with psychosocial services. Antipsychotics have been linked to harmful health outcomes in children, such as high cholesterol levels, weight gain, and type-2 diabetes. Stimulants are effective in treating ADHD symptoms, especially when combined with psychosocial services. Children in foster care have a higher likelihood of mental health diagnoses. Children in foster care have a higher likelihood of mental health diagnoses, leading to higher levels of psychotropic drug use. Multiple foster care placements and inconsistent state oversight practices may contribute to the use of psychotropics to address their mental health needs. Congress has shown interest in overseeing prescription medications for children in foster care. Congress has taken an interest in oversight of prescription medications used by children in foster care, particularly concerning their enrollment in clinical drug trials. This was highlighted in a 2005 hearing by the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources. As part of the Child and Family Services Improvement Act of 2006, state child welfare agencies were required to describe their oversight of prescription drug use by children in foster care to receive certain funding. In 2006, the Child and Family Services Improvement Act (P.L. 109-288) mandated state child welfare agencies to consult with medical professionals for assessing and treating children in foster care. Congressional hearings in 2007 and 2008 focused on oversight of psychotropic medication use for foster care children. In 2008, Congress expanded requirements for states to consult with medical professionals on the health and well-being of children in foster care. States must develop a coordinated strategy and oversight plan to ensure access to health care, including mental health services, for each child in foster care. The 2008 law mandated states to work with medical professionals to create a coordinated strategy for healthcare, including mental health services, for children in foster care. In 2011, the law was amended to include protocols for the use of psychotropic medication for these children. In December 2011, the Senate Subcommittee held an oversight hearing on state policies for prescribing psychotropic medications to foster children based on a study by the Government Accountability Office. The study compared state policies to best practice guidelines developed by AACAP. The Government Accountability Office found that six state programs for prescribing psychotropics to foster children fell short of comprehensive oversight as defined by AACAP. Only Texas fully implemented consent procedures consistent with AACAP's guidelines, raising concerns about caregivers' awareness of risks and benefits. The GAO report highlighted the importance of incorporating consent procedures similar to AACAP's guidelines for monitoring psychotropic medications in foster care. Recommendations were made for HHS to endorse guidance to state agencies on best practices. Witnesses discussed the need for increased cooperation and communication between HHS and state Medicaid programs. At a hearing, discussions focused on increasing cooperation and communication between HHS and state Medicaid programs. A 12-year-old former foster youth shared his experience with multiple mental health diagnoses and side effects from psychotropic medications in foster care. He also mentioned the therapist who was most helpful to him. In April 2013, the Senate Finance Committee held a roundtable discussion with child welfare stakeholders to address issues related to psychotropic medications for children in foster care. Current and former foster youth shared their experiences, noting that therapy helped them transition from medications. Some emphasized the importance of having an invested caregiver or knowledgeable professional. The discussion with child welfare stakeholders in May 2014 focused on the prevalence of psychotropic medication use among youth, the federal government's role in promoting alternatives, tools for determining medication necessity, and the involvement of schools, mental health system, and foster parents in decision-making. In May 2014, the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources held a hearing on the use of psychotropic medications among children in foster care. Witnesses included officials from HHS, GAO, a researcher, and Dr. Phil McGraw. The discussion focused on the roles of schools, the mental health system, and foster parents in decision-making regarding psychotropic medication use among youth. In May 2014, the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources held a hearing on psychotropic medication use among children in foster care. GAO examined prescribing rates among children in foster care in five states from 2011 to 2014, focusing on documentation supporting the use of psychotropics among a sample of 24 children in care. Two child psychiatrists contracted by GAO found varying quality in the documentation. Experts conducting mental health research and focusing on foster care cases found varying quality in documentation supporting the use of psychotropics. Documentation was mostly supported for medical pediatric exams, but only partially supported for dosage amounts and concurrent use of multiple medications in about half of the cases examined. GAO recommended that HHS issue guidance to states regarding oversight of medication to third-party managed care organizations administering Medicaid benefits. The GAO recommended that HHS issue guidance to states on oversight of medication to third-party managed care organizations administering Medicaid benefits for children in foster care. However, the guidance issued by HHS did not address the role of these organizations in monitoring psychotropic medication use among foster children. The GAO issued a report in January 2017 on how child welfare and Medicaid agencies in seven states monitor psychotropic use among children in care. State officials developed practices to support mental health diagnoses and treatment for foster children, including guidelines on prescribing medications and promoting psychosocial services. State officials in all seven states reported that factors such as collaboration among child welfare, Medicaid, and other agencies, outreach to physicians, and gradual implementation of new practices were crucial in overseeing the prescribing of psychotropic medications and promoting psychosocial services. The effectiveness of state practices, compliance with policies, and enforcement of required practices were not examined by the GAO. State officials in seven states use various measures to monitor physician prescribing practices, state oversight practices, and child outcomes related to psychotropic medication use. However, HHS has not convened meetings with stakeholders engaged in state oversight of psychotropic medication use for children in care since 2014. HHS has supported states in their oversight work since 2014, recommending cost-effective ways to convene state stakeholders for collaboration on psychotropic medication oversight. Federal agencies have implemented requirements for monitoring psychotropic medication use among children, especially those in foster care. Several federal agencies have collaborated to understand psychotropic medication use among children, including those in foster care. The Obama Administration proposed increased funding for oversight of psychotropic medications in its annual budgets, such as for FY2017. The Obama Administration proposed increased funding for oversight of psychotropic medications in its annual budgets, including for FY2017. States must develop a coordinated strategy and oversight plan to ensure access to health care, including mental health services, for children in foster care. This plan must involve collaboration between the state child welfare agency, the state Medicaid agency, and health care experts. The coordinated strategy for children in foster care must include initial and follow-up health screenings, monitoring and treatment of health needs, updating and sharing medical information, and ensuring continuity of care. The strategy for children in foster care includes updating medical information, ensuring continuity of health care services, oversight of prescription medicines, consulting with medical professionals, and ensuring appropriate medical treatment. Federal child welfare law requires state child welfare agencies to have a written plan for each child in foster care, including health-related records such as names and addresses of health providers, immunization records, medication information, and other relevant health details. This ensures proper assessment of children's health and well-being, appropriate medical treatment, and transition planning for children aging out of foster care. The child's health records, including immunizations, medication information, and other relevant health details, must be reviewed, updated, and provided to foster care parents or providers at each placement. States report their policies on oversight of psychotropic medications through the Child and Family Services Plan and Annual Progress and Services Reports. The Child and Family Services Plan (CFSP) and Annual Progress and Services Reports (APSRs) are required annually for jurisdictions seeking federal funds for child welfare programs. The APSR instructions mandate state oversight protocols to address screening, evaluation, and consent for psychotropic medications. The APSR instructions mandate state oversight protocols to address screening, evaluation, consent for psychotropic medications, medication monitoring, mental health expertise availability, and information sharing mechanisms. Subsequent program instructions have been less detailed. The most recent CFSP is for FY2015-FY2019, requiring jurisdictions to report on oversight of prescription medicines, including protocols for appropriate use and monitoring of psychotropic medications. In 2011, HHS formed a working group to address the use of psychotropic medication in foster care children. The group aims to enhance screening, diagnosis, and interventions, improve oversight of medications, and expand research on treatments. Led by ACF, the group supports state efforts to implement requirements on psychotropics. The Administration for Children and Families (ACF) leads a working group with representatives from HHS agencies to enhance research on medications and psychosocial treatments for children in foster care. This includes Medicaid financing for services like therapy and prescription drugs, as well as block grant funding from SAMHSA. SAMHSA provides block grant funding to support non-Medicaid covered treatment services for children with complex trauma needs. In November 2011, ACF, SAMHSA, and CMS released a letter addressing effective management of prescription medication use for children in foster care. The letter addressed actions taken by federal agencies to support effective management of prescription medication use for children in foster care, emphasizing the collaboration between State child welfare, Medicaid, and mental health authorities. It also discussed raising awareness about psychotropic use. The federal agencies collaborated to provide guidance on oversight of psychotropic medication use among children in foster care through webinars and information memoranda. Awareness was raised about psychotropic use among children in foster care. The federal agencies collaborated to provide guidance on oversight of psychotropic medication use among children in foster care. They presented data, research, and practices for monitoring and oversight. Question and answer sessions were held for state child welfare and mental health leaders. In August 2012, a summit called \"Because Minds Matter\" was convened to address the use of psychotropic medications for children in foster care and the mental health needs of children who have experienced trauma. The summit \"Because Minds Matter\" aimed to enhance collaboration among state leaders on the appropriate use of psychotropic medications for children in foster care. States were tasked with identifying areas for improvement in oversight and outlining steps for implementation, including activities, challenges, partners, and timelines. Multiple presentations were given on psychotropic oversight and related topics by HHS staff, researchers, and state teams. In April 2012, ACF provided guidance to state child welfare agencies on monitoring the use of psychotropic medication, synthesizing information based on guidelines from child welfare and medical professionals. This included coordinated planning and shared decision-making. ACF issued guidance in April 2012 to state child welfare agencies on improving outcomes for children who have experienced abuse and neglect, based on guidelines from child welfare and medical professionals. This includes coordinated planning, shared decision-making, medication monitoring, mental health expertise, and mechanisms for sharing information. States are required to report on the implementation of these elements in their monitoring of psychotropic drug use for children in foster care. ACF issued guidance in April 2012 to state child welfare agencies on improving behavioral and social-emotional outcomes for children who have experienced abuse and neglect. The guidance focused on the impact of maltreatment on brain development and social-emotional development. ACF also published guides on tools for youth in foster care to ask questions about medications and on mental health issues for child welfare staff and foster parents. Additionally, ACF awarded FY2012 funds to nine entities for child welfare agencies. ACF awarded funds to entities for projects supporting youth in child welfare with mental and behavioral health needs. SAMHSA provided partial funding for developing guidelines on prescribing medications. SAMHSA provided partial funding to AACAP for developing guidelines on prescribing medications for children and youth. The guidelines focus on clinical practice, medication monitoring, and research. SAMHSA also funds a medical director position at the University of Maryland's School of Social Work to work with child and adolescent psychiatrists on issues related to psychotropic medications. The network of child and adolescent psychiatrists works with state and county governments on issues related to psychotropic medications. They use a community listerv and webinars to share best practices, especially for children on Medicaid. States are required to have Drug Utilization Review programs in place for overseeing medication prescribing for Medicaid beneficiaries. States are required to have Drug Utilization Review programs in place to oversee the prescribing of drugs for Medicaid beneficiaries. Examples include automated system \"edit checks\" and multidisciplinary teams to ensure appropriate prescription of psychotropic medications. In 2015, CMS assisted state Medicaid agencies and partners to improve the appropriate use of antipsychotic medications for children on Medicaid. A new measure was added to core measures for states to voluntarily use in improving healthcare delivery to children on Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program. The State Children's Health Insurance Program provides coverage for children and pregnant women with income above Medicaid eligibility. In July 2013, CMS, ACF, and SAMHSA issued guidance on providing psychosocial interventions for children who have experienced complex trauma. The guidance highlighted the use of existing federal funding to support these interventions, especially for children in foster care who may be more likely to receive psychotropic medication. The guidance emphasized using federal funding for psychosocial interventions for children in foster care, promoting functional assessments, trauma screening, mental health assessment, and outcome monitoring. President Obama's FY2017 budget proposed a five-year joint initiative between CMS and ACF to reduce reliance on psychotropic medications for children in foster care and improve their well-being through performance-based incentive payments to state Medicaid agencies. The FY2017 budget proposed a joint initiative to reduce reliance on psychotropic medications for children in foster care. This initiative includes performance-based incentive payments to state Medicaid agencies and competitive grant funding under the Title IV-E Foster Care program. The FY2017 budget proposed a joint initiative to reduce reliance on psychotropic medications for children in foster care by applying for competitive grant funding under the Title IV-E Foster Care program to implement alternative psychosocial interventions. This funding aims to build state capacity and infrastructure for evidence-based interventions and ensure fidelity to these models while evaluating the effectiveness of these interventions. Research has focused on states overseeing the use of psychotropic medication for children in foster care, including obtaining consent and monitoring procedures. Surveys have been conducted to understand state policies, but none address how states have responded to the federal provision on oversight of psychotropic medications. In 2009 and 2010, researchers surveyed states to assess policies and challenges related to overseeing psychotropic medication use in foster care. Over half of the states rated this issue as a high concern. (58.7%) of states rated psychotropic medication use as a high concern, with a quarter rating it as a moderate concern and 13% as low concern. 26 states had a policy in place, 13 were developing one, and 9 had no policy. Over half of states used a \"red flag\" marker to identify issues with psychotropic drug use. Researchers found red flags in states' approaches to psychotropic drug use, including medication use in young children, multiple medications before a single one, simultaneous use of multiple psychotropic medications, prolonged use of multiple medications within the same class, and exceeding recommended dosages. States had varied approaches with little systematic implementation or study to improve outcomes for children in foster care. Researchers raised concerns about the lack of systematic implementation and study of approaches to improve outcomes for children in foster care, particularly regarding the oversight of psychotropic medication use. A 2014 study found that policies in 16 states were underdeveloped and did not include important criteria for monitoring psychotropic drug use among children in care. States have taken steps to address oversight of psychotropic medication use among children in foster care, with policies being underdeveloped and lacking key criteria. Working groups have been convened by state representatives from child welfare, Medicaid, and mental health agencies to address this issue. Some states are collaborating to improve oversight of psychotropic medication use among foster youth. The Center for Health Care Strategies worked with six states from 2012 to 2015 to define common terms and measures on data about psychotropic medication utilization. Best practices were developed in this collaborative effort. The Center for Health Care Strategies collaborated with six states to define common terms and measures on psychotropic medication use among foster youth. Best practices were developed for oversight and monitoring, with states implementing protocols in four key areas. SAMSHA is providing technical assistance to states on oversight of psychotropic medications. The Center for Health Care Strategies, with support from SAMSHA, is providing technical assistance to states on oversight of psychotropic medications. A study by the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Wellbeing looked at psychotropic medication use among children investigated for abuse or neglect. Data collected in 2008-2009 showed rates of medication use among children in contact with child welfare agencies. Data was collected in 2008-2009, four to six months after an investigation of abuse or neglect. The study focused on psychotropic medication use among children aged 18 months to 17 years old. Follow-up surveys were conducted at 18 and 36 months post-investigation. Some children had turned 18 by the second or third data collection. Table A-1 displays medication use by age and foster care status. Table A-1 displays psychotropic medication use by age and foster care status for children in the initial survey and follow-ups at 18 and 36 months. Foster care settings include non-relative foster homes, kin placements, and group/residential settings, while \"in home\" category includes biological/adoptive parents or informal kinship care. The initial survey did not show statistically significant differences in psychotropic medication use between children in foster care and those not in foster care. However, at the 18-month and 36-month follow-ups, children in foster care were more likely to be using psychotropic medications. No statistical significance was found for children under age 6 in foster care compared to those living at home. For children under age 6, no significant difference in psychotropic medication use was found between those in foster care and those living at home in any of the surveys. Among children ages 6 to 10, a significant difference was seen at the 18-month follow-up but not at the initial survey or 36-month follow-up. For children ages 11 to 17, no significant difference was found at the initial survey, but differences were significant at the 18-month and 36-month follow-ups."
