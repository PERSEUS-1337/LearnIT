    "content": "This report analyzes annual appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for FY2020, comparing enacted FY2019 appropriations, the Trump Administration's FY2020 budget request, and the enacted appropriations measures. It also provides additional informational resources on DHS appropriations and a list of CRS policy experts for consultation. The CRS Report R42638 provides information on homeland security appropriations, focusing on discretionary funding amounts and legislative action related to DHS appropriations. The reports do not cover mandatory funding issues or other legislation related to DHS programs. Specialized budgetary concepts are explained in the report's appendix. The curr_chunk discusses specialized budgetary concepts related to appropriations legislation, including budget authority, obligations, outlays, discretionary and mandatory spending, and adjustments to spending caps under the Budget Control Act. Additional resources for understanding the appropriations process are also mentioned. The curr_chunk provides details on budget authority in CRS reports on homeland security appropriations for FY2019, using unrounded data for precision. Data is derived from the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019. The FY2019 annual appropriations data used in this report are from the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019. FY2019 supplemental appropriations data are from two enacted measures: the Additional Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2019, and the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations for Humanitarian Assistance and Security at the Southern Border Act, 2019. The FY2020 appropriations data for security and humanitarian needs at the U.S.-Mexico border are drawn from various legislative reports and acts, including H.R. 3931, S. 2582, and P.L. 116-93. The scoring methodology remains consistent throughout the report. The FY2020 Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, as outlined in P.L. 116-93, utilizes a scoring methodology based on data provided by the Appropriations Committees and developed with Congressional Budget Office (CBO) methodology. CRS does not compare this data with OMB data due to technical scoring differences. The FY2020 Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, outlined in P.L. 116-93, no longer includes OMB data on mandatory spending for consistency. The legislative process for appropriations for FY2020 started with the Trump Administration's budget request on March 18, 2019, after a lapse in FY2019 appropriations. The Trump Administration released its detailed budget request for FY2020 on March 18, 2019, requesting $51.68 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority for DHS, a 4.6% increase from the previous year. The overall budget was estimated to be $92.08 billion. The Trump Administration's FY2020 budget request for the Department of Homeland Security included a $2.27 billion increase in discretionary budget authority, totaling $51.68 billion. Additionally, $14.08 billion was requested for FEMA in disaster relief funding. The Administration requested an additional $14.08 billion for FEMA in disaster relief funding and $190 million in Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terror designated funding for the Coast Guard. The House Appropriations Committee marked up H.R. 3931, the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2020, with $52.80 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority. H.R. 3931, filed on July 24, 2019, included $52.80 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority, exceeding the Administration's request by $1.12 billion (2.2%) and the enacted level by $3.39 billion (6.9%). The House committee bill also allocated $14.08 billion for disaster relief and included OCO funding for the Coast Guard. Amendments in the full committee markup led to a CBO scoring that exceeded the subcommittee allocation by over $3 billion. The Senate Appropriations Committee marked up S. 2582, the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2020, with $53.18 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority, exceeding the Administration's request by $1.50 billion (2.9%) and the FY2019 enacted level by $3.77 billion (7.6%). Amendments in the full committee markup led to a CBO scoring that initially exceeded the subcommittee allocation by more than $3 billion, later revised to $1.9 billion. The Senate Appropriations Committee marked up the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2020 with $53.18 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority, exceeding the Administration's request by $1.50 billion (2.9%) and the FY2019 enacted level by $3.77 billion (7.6%). The increase in funding was mainly due to $5 billion allocated for border barrier construction, compared to $1.38 billion in the previous year. Both the House and Senate committees allocated more discretionary funding for various agencies, including the Coast Guard, Transportation Security Administration, and FEMA. The Senate committee also included additional funding for disaster relief and OCO-designated funding. The Senate Appropriations Committee marked up the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2020 with $53.18 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority, exceeding the Administration's request by $1.50 billion (2.9%) and the FY2019 enacted level by $3.77 billion (7.6%). The bill also included $17.35 billion of disaster relief-designated funding, $3.28 billion more than the Administration's request, and $190 million in OCO-designated funding for the Coast Guard. Congress passed a continuing resolution (CR) to extend funding at the FY2019 rate through December 20, including provisions addressing DHS needs under a CR. P.L. 116-59 includes provisions for DHS under a CR: special apportionment for Secret Service expenses, accelerated DRF funding, National Flood Insurance Program extension, and DHS management restructuring. Immigration provisions are also extended. On December 16, 2019, the House Rules Committee released text and explanatory statements for two consolidated appropriations bills, including the FY2020 DHS annual appropriations measure with $50.47 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority. This was $1.22 billion (2.4%) below the previous amount. The FY2020 DHS annual appropriations measure, included in Division D, had $50.47 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority. This was $1.22 billion below the Administration's request and $1.06 billion above the FY2019 enacted level. The bill also allocated $17.35 billion for FEMA in disaster relief funding and $190 million in Overseas Contingency Operations designated funding for the Coast Guard. It was passed by the House with a vote of 280-138 and by the Senate with a vote of 81-11 before being signed into law. The FY2020 DHS annual appropriations bill, signed into law as P.L. 116-93, allocated resources to every departmental component of DHS. Discretionary appropriations provide the majority of funding for DHS operations, with the remainder coming from fee revenues, trust funds, and mandatory spending. The FY2020 DHS annual appropriations bill, signed into law as P.L. 116-93, allocated resources to every departmental component of DHS. Discretionary appropriations provide the majority of funding for DHS operations, with the remainder coming from fee revenues, trust funds, and mandatory spending. Annual appropriations measures for DHS typically have been organized into five titles, with the first four grouping components thematically and the fifth providing general direction to the department. When DHS was established in 2003, resources were provided through existing account structures rather than developing a new structure of appropriations for the entire department. In 2014, DHS began working on a new Common Appropriations Structure (CAS) to standardize appropriations format across components. Operating with over 70 different appropriations and 100 Programs, Projects, and Activities hindered transparency and decision-making. DHS implemented a new budget request system, the Common Appropriations Structure (CAS), in FY2017 to improve transparency and decision-making. The CAS converted legacy appropriations structures into four categories: Operations and Support, Procurement, Construction, and Improvements, Research and Development. The Common Appropriations Structure (CAS) implemented by DHS in FY2017 converted legacy appropriations structures into four categories: Operations and Support, Procurement, Construction, and Improvements, Research and Development. These categories fund planning, operational development, engineering, purchase, and deployment of assets to support component missions, provide resources for new technologies and capabilities, and support grant funding managed by DHS components. The Federal Protective Service within DHS does not have a specific appropriation amount but can use funds credited to its account for its mission, resulting in a net-zero impact on total net appropriations. The appropriations measure allows the Federal Protective Service to use funds for its mission without impacting total discretionary spending. The Coast Guard's Retired Pay appropriation covers retired personnel entitlements, including pensions and medical care, categorized as appropriated mandatory spending. The U.S. government has a legal obligation to make payments, but there is no permanent statutory mechanism in place to provide the funds. The Retired Pay appropriation does not count against discretionary allocation. FEMA receives a separate appropriation for disaster relief activities, allowing for consistent tracking of spending and transparency into fund availability. The National Flood Insurance Program is funded through a mix of mandatory and discretionary appropriations, with certain program costs covered by government fees. FEMA's disaster assistance spending is tracked separately from other grant activities, providing transparency into fund availability. The National Flood Insurance Program is funded through a mix of mandatory and discretionary appropriations, with certain program costs covered by government fees. Appropriations language is required for resources to be spent on operating expenses, salaries, flood insurance operations, commissions, taxes, interest on borrowings, and flood mitigation actions. Provisos in appropriations prior to FY2017 included directions on budget authority usage, while general provisions provided directions or conditions to components. In the FY2017 act, these provisions were included within appropriations and component-specific general provisions. In the FY2017 act, provisions within appropriations and component-specific general provisions were grouped as \"administrative provisions.\" This report tracks changes in administrative and general provisions compared to the prior year's enacted measure, noting dropped, added, and modified provisions. These changes may occur due to various reasons such as the passage of time or enactment of permanent legislation. The report tracks changes in administrative and general provisions compared to the prior year's enacted measure, noting dropped, added, and modified provisions for a variety of reasons. The appropriations provided for the department by type of component are discussed, grouping the 15 components of DHS into Law Enforcement Operational Components funded in Title II, including U.S. Customs and Border Protection Immigration.

The federal government spending process involves budget authority enactment by Congress, fund obligation by agencies, and outlays for activities. The federal government spending process starts with budget authority enactment by Congress, followed by fund obligation by agencies, and outlays for activities. Budget authority determines the available funds for federal agencies and is established through appropriations acts or direct spending legislation. The Antideficiency Act prohibits agencies from obligating more funds than authorized by Congress. Budget authority enacted by Congress determines available funds for federal agencies. It may be indefinite or for one-year, multiyear, or no-year basis. Obligations are incurred when agencies employ personnel or enter into agreements. Budget authority enacted by Congress determines available funds for federal agencies, which may be indefinite or for one-year, multiyear, or no-year basis. Obligations are incurred when agencies employ personnel or enter into agreements, creating a legal requirement for the government to pay. Outlays represent the funds actually spent during the fiscal year, which may not always match the budget authority enacted. Budget authority can be obligated in one fiscal year but spent in a future fiscal year, especially with certain contracts. Budget authority allows federal agencies to incur obligations and authorize payments from the Treasury. Discretionary and mandatory spending make up gross budget authority, with discretionary spending appropriated yearly by Congress through appropriations acts. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 distinguishes between discretionary and mandatory spending. Discretionary spending is appropriated annually by Congress, while mandatory spending, also known as direct spending, is provided in laws other than appropriations acts. Some mandatory entitlement programs within DHS must be appropriated each year. Within DHS, Coast Guard retirement pay is an example of appropriated mandatory spending. Offsetting Collections are funds collected by the federal government as part of business-type transactions, not considered federal revenue but counted as negative outlays. DHS net discretionary budget authority is composed of discretionary spending minus any fee or fund collections that offset discretionary. The DHS net discretionary budget authority is made up of discretionary spending minus fee or fund collections that offset spending. Mandatory entitlement programs within the DHS budget include the Secret Service and Coast Guard retired pay accounts. The DHS budget includes mandatory entitlement programs like the Secret Service and Coast Guard retired pay accounts. Secret Service retirement pay is a permanent appropriation, while Coast Guard retirement pay is annually appropriated. Additionally, the budget contains offsetting Trust and Public Enterprise Funds that are not appropriated by Congress but are included in the President's budget for calculating gross budget authority. Enterprise Funds are not appropriated by Congress but are included in the President's budget to calculate gross budget authority. The maximum budget authority for annual appropriations, including DHS, is determined through a two-stage congressional budget process involving 302(a) and 302(b) allocations. Congress sets overall spending totals in the annual concurrent resolution on the budget, which are then allocated among congressional committees through 302(a) allocations. The 302(a) allocations are discretionary totals available to the Committees on Appropriations for annual appropriations bills. In the second stage, the appropriations committees allocate the 302(a) funds among subcommittees for each bill, known as 302(b) allocations. These allocations enforce budget discipline by ensuring they do not exceed the 302(a) discretionary allocation. The 302(b) allocations enforce budget discipline by ensuring they do not exceed the 302(a) discretionary allocation. The allocations may be adjusted during the year by the appropriations committee issuing a report delineating the revised suballocations as the appropriations bills progress toward final enactment. Table A-1 shows comparable figures for the 302(b) allocation for FY2020. The House full committee markup of the FY2020 DHS appropriations bill included amendments that put the bill over its discretionary allocation by $3.066 billion, later revised to $1.9 billion. These provisions were not included in the final FY2020 DHS annual appropriations act. The Budget Control Act established enforceable discretionary limits for defense spending. The Budget Control Act set discretionary spending caps for defense and nondefense spending from FY2012 to FY2021. Amendments through Bipartisan Budget Acts adjusted the caps. DHS budget mostly falls under nondefense spending. The Act allows adjustments for overseas contingency operations, emergency spending, disaster relief, and health care control. The Budget Control Act allows adjustments for overseas contingency operations, emergency spending, and disaster relief in DHS's appropriations process. Disaster relief has a limited adjustment under the Act. The Budget Control Act allows adjustments for disaster relief, with the allowable adjustment determined by the Office of Management and Budget using a specific formula. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 amended the formula to increase the allowable adjustment by adding 5% of emergency-designated funding for major disasters under the Stafford Act. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 increased the allowable adjustment for disaster relief by adding 5% of emergency-designated funding for major disasters under the Stafford Act. In August 2019, OMB estimated the allowable adjustment for FY2020 to be $17.5 billion, the second-largest in history, calculated based on specific criteria. The allowable adjustment for FY2020 is estimated to be $17.5 billion, calculated based on specific criteria. This estimate includes the 10-year average, 5% of emergency-designated Stafford Act spending since 2012, and carryover from the previous year. The final adjustment for FY2020 may still vary from this estimate."
