Chapter 154 of Title 28, United States Code, introduces special habeas corpus procedures in capital cases, including appointment of counsel, mandatory stay of execution, filing of habeas corpus petition, evidentiary hearings, and district court adjudication. Chapter 154 of Title 28, United States Code, introduces special habeas corpus procedures in capital cases, including appointment of counsel, mandatory stay of execution, filing of habeas corpus petition, evidentiary hearings, and district court adjudication. This chapter applies to cases under section 2254 brought by prisoners in State custody subject to a capital sentence, if certain conditions are met. The court of last resort or statute must provide a mechanism for appointing competent counsel in State post-conviction proceedings for indigent prisoners with upheld capital convictions. The mechanism must offer counsel to all State prisoners under a capital sentence. The court of last resort or statute must provide a mechanism for appointing competent counsel in State post-conviction proceedings for indigent prisoners with upheld capital convictions. This mechanism must offer counsel to all State prisoners under a capital sentence and provide for the appointment of counsel upon finding that the prisoner is indigent or unable to competently decide on accepting or rejecting the offer. The court must appoint competent counsel for indigent prisoners with upheld capital convictions in State post-conviction proceedings. Counsel cannot have previously represented the prisoner at trial or on direct appeal unless requested. Ineffectiveness or incompetence of counsel during post-conviction proceedings in a capital case is addressed. The court must appoint competent counsel for indigent prisoners with upheld capital convictions in State post-conviction proceedings. Ineffectiveness or incompetence of counsel during post-conviction proceedings in a capital case shall not be a ground for relief in subsequent proceedings. Different counsel can be appointed at any phase of State or Federal post-conviction proceedings. A stay of execution for a State prisoner can be granted if they apply to a court with jurisdiction over habeas corpus proceedings. The stay will expire if the prisoner fails to file a petition within the required time. A stay of execution for a State prisoner can be granted if they apply to a court with jurisdiction over habeas corpus proceedings. The stay will expire if the prisoner fails to file a petition within the required time or if the petition for relief is denied after district court and court of appeals review. The Supreme Court can deny a petition, dispose of a case leaving the capital sentence undisturbed, or a State prisoner can waive habeas corpus review in the presence of counsel. If any of these conditions occur, a stay of execution can be granted for a State prisoner. If one of the conditions in subsection (b) has occurred, no Federal court can enter a stay of execution or grant relief in a capital case unless the claim was not previously presented in courts and the failure to raise the claim was due to State action violating the Constitution or laws of the United States. The conditions for granting relief in a capital case include if the claim is based on new Federal rights, could not have been discovered earlier, and if the facts could undermine the jury's determination of guilt. The habeas corpus petition must be filed within 180 days after the order is issued in compliance with section 2256(c) of this title. The time requirements can be tolled when a petition for certiorari is filed. The time requirements for filing a habeas corpus petition can be tolled in certain circumstances, such as when a petition for certiorari is filed in the Supreme Court or when a State prisoner has a request for post-conviction review pending before a State court. A State prisoner under capital sentence can have the time requirements for filing a habeas corpus petition extended if there is a pending request for post-conviction review before a State court. An additional 60-day extension can be granted if the State prisoner's counsel shows good cause for not being able to file the petition on time in the Federal district court. The time requirement for filing a habeas corpus petition can be extended for a State prisoner under a capital sentence if there is a pending request for post-conviction review. The time can be continuously tolled from the initial filing for post-conviction review until the final disposition by the highest State court, as long as all State filing rules are met. Tolling does not occur during the pendency of a petition for certiorari before the Supreme Court. When a State prisoner under a capital sentence files a petition for habeas corpus relief, the district court will determine the sufficiency of the evidentiary record based on the claims presented in State courts. Tolling does not occur during a petition for certiorari before the Supreme Court. When a State prisoner files a habeas corpus petition, the district court will review claims presented in State courts. The failure to raise a claim in State courts must be due to specific reasons outlined in the law. The district court will conduct any necessary evidentiary hearings to complete the record for habeas corpus review. Upon the development of a complete evidentiary record, the court will rule on the merits of the claims. The requirement of a certificate of probable cause is not applicable in this process. The requirement of a certificate of probable cause does not apply to habeas corpus cases under this chapter, except for second or successive petitions."
