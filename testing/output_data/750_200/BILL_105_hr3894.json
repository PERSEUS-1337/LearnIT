    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Air Force Science and Technology Reinvigoration Act\" and includes findings. Congress finds that the Air Force's founders expected scientific research and technology development to be a priority for America's aeronautical defenses. Scientific investigation is crucial for air, space, and information superiority, requiring a strong research base both within and outside the Air Force. Investment in Air Force research and development has benefited American industry, especially aerospace, and contributed significantly to the economy, aligning with the vision of Air Force founder General Henry H. Arnold to build the Air Force around science. The text chunk discusses the importance of science and technology functions within the Department of the Air Force, aligning with the vision of Air Force founder General Henry H. Arnold. Congress emphasizes the need for dedicated funding for emerging technologies within the Air Force, with a minimum of 2.5 percent of funds allocated to science and technology. It is also recommended that management and funding for science and technology be separate from acquisition. Additionally, at least 15 percent of science and technology funds should be invested in new technology areas, including critical information technology. The Air Force should invest a minimum of 15 percent of science and technology funds in new technology areas for the next 5 years. To meet future technological challenges, they should increase the number of officers and civilian employees with doctorate degrees in technical fields and expand the variety of technical degrees at the master's level granted to Air Force personnel. To prevent stagnation in Air Force science and technology, a concentrated effort should be made to eliminate 5 percent of programs each year, reallocating funds to new programs. This includes increasing the number and variety of technical degrees at the master's level for Air Force officers and civilian employees. AMENDMENTS RELATING TO SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY FUNCTIONS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE. The text amends the separation of research and development functions from the equipping function of the Secretary of the Air Force and establishes a specific research and development function within the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force. The text amends Section 8014 of the title by removing subsection (d) and redesignating subsections (e) and (f). It also establishes the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Science and Technology within Section 8016 by increasing the number of Assistant Secretaries to five and specifying one as the Assistant Secretary for Science and Technology. The Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Science and Technology is responsible for supervising science and technology functions within the Department of the Air Force. Section 5315 of title 5, United States Code, is amended to reflect this change. Additionally, a Deputy Chief of Staff for Science and Technology is established under Section 8035 of title 10, United States Code. The establishment of a Deputy Chief of Staff for Science and Technology is added under Section 8035 of title 10, United States Code. SEC. 5. STUDY. The Secretary of the Air Force must contract the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences to study the Air Force's technology base. The study will recommend minimum requirements to maintain a technology base for superiority in air and space weapons systems and information technology, addressing the effects on national defense and civilian aerospace industries. The Secretary of the Air Force must contract the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences to study the Air Force's technology base and recommend minimum requirements to maintain superiority in air and space weapons systems and information technology. The study will also recommend the appropriate level of staff with baccalaureate, masters, and doctorate degrees, as well as the optimal ratio of civilian and military staff with such degrees to ensure the vitality of the Air Force's science and technology functions. A report on the study results must be submitted to Congress within 120 days."
