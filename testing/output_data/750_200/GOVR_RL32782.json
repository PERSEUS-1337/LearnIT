    "content": "In February 2002, the Bush Administration proposed \"Clear Skies\" to amend the Clean Air Act by placing emission caps on electric utility emissions of SO2, NOx, and Hg. The caps would be imposed in two phases: 2010 and 2018. A modified version of Clear Skies was introduced in the 109th Congress as S. 131. The Clear Skies proposal introduced in the 108th Congress aimed to amend the Clean Air Act by implementing emission caps on electric utility emissions of SO2, NOx, and Hg. A modified version of Clear Skies (S. 131) was introduced in the 109th Congress, focusing on cap-and-trade provisions and guaranteed emissions reductions. The Clear Skies proposal aimed to amend the Clean Air Act by implementing emission caps on electric utility emissions of SO2, NOx, and Hg. The cap-and-trade provisions are significant in terms of the proposal's interaction with the Clean Air Act, with EPA already using regional cap-and-trade programs to control emissions. EPA has proposed cap-and-trade regulations to achieve Clear Skies' level of reductions over 28 eastern states and the District of Columbia for both SO2 and NOx. The Clear Skies proposal aims to reduce emissions of SO2, NOx, and Hg through cap-and-trade regulations. The Administration believes certain provisions of the Clean Air Act are no longer necessary under Clear Skies. EPA has proposed regulations to achieve reductions over 28 states and the District of Columbia. The Administration's Clear Skies program aims to simplify regulations by eliminating certain provisions of the Clean Air Act, such as New Source Review, regional haze, BART, MACT standards, NOx SIP Call, 126 Rule, and acid rain, combining them into one regulatory process. EPA Administrator Whitman stated that these provisions may no longer be necessary under Clear Skies legislation. The Clear Skies program aims to simplify regulations by combining various provisions of the Clean Air Act into one regulatory process. The potential impact of Clear Skies legislation on electric generating units and industrial sources opting into the program is examined in a report. The Clear Skies program aims to simplify regulations by combining provisions of the Clean Air Act for electric generating units and industrial sources opting in. Changes in the Clean Air Act proposed by Clear Skies would mainly affect Title I, with distinctions based on location, facility type, and fuel. Regulations apply to SO2, NOx, and particulate matter, with specific requirements differing. Despite changes in the 1990 Amendments, including a cap-and-trade program. The Clean Air Act established regulations for SO2, NOx, and particulate matter. The addition of Title IV in 1990 did not change the Act's basic requirements. National Ambient Air Quality Standards and New Source Performance Standards were enacted in 1970 to protect air quality. The Clean Air Act of 1970 established National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) to protect air quality by setting limits on specified pollutants. NAAQS cover six criteria pollutants, including SO2, NOx, and PM, with primary standards set by the EPA to protect public health. EPA periodically reviews NAAQS based on the latest health data. The Clean Air Act of 1970 established NAAQS to protect public health by setting limits on pollutants. EPA periodically reviews NAAQS based on health data. States are responsible for implementing NAAQS through SIPs, focusing on reducing emissions to meet standards. Areas not in compliance must require new sources to install LAER. The 1970 Clean Air Act mandates new sources in non-attainment areas to install Lowest Achievable Emissions Rate (LAER) technology to ensure overall emissions do not increase. Existing sources in non-attainment areas must install Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT). New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) were also established to regulate emissions. The 1970 Clean Air Act established stringent emission standards for new sources and existing sources in non-attainment areas. New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) set emission limitations for major stationary sources, including fossil fuel-fired electric generating facilities. NSPS for SO2, NOx, and PM10 are reviewed every eight years by the EPA. The Act also addresses interstate pollution concerns. The Clean Air Act established emission standards for new and existing sources, including NSPS for major stationary sources like electric generating facilities. Interstate pollution is addressed through mechanisms like regional commissions and the NOx SIP Call, which controls NOx emissions in multiple states. Under the NOx SIP Call, affected states are given emission budgets to achieve in any way they choose. EPA encouraged states to implement the rule through a cap-and-trade program. Existing sources in nonattainment areas are subject to state controls to meet NAAQS, while sources in attainment areas are mostly free from controls. Major new sources, including fossil fuel-fired electric generating facilities, must meet NSPS requirements. The 1977 Clean Air Act introduced the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) program, focusing on reducing ambient concentrations of pollutants in clean air areas. It allows for some increase in pollution levels depending on the area's classification. Major new sources, like fossil fuel-fired electric generating facilities, must comply with NSPS requirements. The PSD program under the Clean Air Act allows for some increase in pollution levels based on area classification. Class I areas like national parks have strict limits on degradation, while Class II areas allow moderate degradation. States can reclassify Class II areas to Class III, permitting degradation up to NAAQS. New sources in PSD areas must undergo preconstruction review and install Best Available Control Technology determined on a case-by-case basis. The PSD program under the Clean Air Act requires New Source Review (NSR) and installation of Best Available Control Technology (BACT) as the minimum level of control. State permitting agencies determine BACT on a case-by-case basis, considering energy, environmental, and economic impacts. BACT must be at least as stringent as federal NSPS, but can be more so. Regional haze program complements PSD for existing sources, focusing on preventing and remedying visibility impairment from manmade air pollution in national parks. The program focuses on preventing and remedying impairment of visibility in national parks and wilderness areas due to manmade air pollution. Pollutants like sulfates, organic matter, and nitrates are identified. Facilities built between 1962 and 1977 must install Best Available Retrofit Technology. The EPA implemented a regional haze program in 1999 for stricter controls on NOx and SO2. Table 1 outlines air quality control requirements for fossil fuel-fired electric generating facilities. The federal regulatory program under Section 112 of the Act establishes MACT standards for hazardous air pollutants, including mercury. MACT standards must be as stringent as the best controlled similar source for new sources or the average of the best performing 12% for existing sources. The federal regulatory program under Section 112 of the Act establishes MACT standards for hazardous air pollutants, including mercury. MACT standards must be as stringent as the best controlled similar source for new sources or the average of the best performing 12% for existing sources. Additional regulations may be promulgated to address any \"residual risks\" from HAPs after the implementation of MACT, with special treatment given to electric utilities. EPA must make an affirmative finding that regulation under Section 112 is \"appropriate and necessary\" for electric generating units before issuing MACT standards. EPA made this finding in December 2000. EPA found regulation under Section 112 \"appropriate and necessary\" for electric generating units before issuing MACT standards. In January 2004, EPA proposed a cap-and-trade program as its preferred approach, rescinding the conclusion that MACT standards were necessary. States can currently implement these regulations. Under current law, states can impose more stringent standards for hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) than federal regulations. Some states like Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Jersey, and Wisconsin have already done so. Clear Skies would make changes to current law, including establishing national cap-and-trade programs for utility emissions of NOx and mercury. The proposed changes under Clear Skies include establishing national cap-and-trade programs for utility emissions of NOx and mercury, extending and revising the Title IV cap-and-trade program for SO2, and modifying certain provisions such as BART and conformity for several years. Additional authorities would include cap-and-trade programs for SO2, NOx, and Hg, as well as statutory national emission standards for new and reconstructed electric generating units (EGUs). The proposed changes under Clear Skies include establishing national cap-and-trade programs for utility emissions of NOx and mercury, extending and revising the Title IV cap-and-trade program for SO2, and modifying certain provisions such as BART and conformity for several years. Additional authorities would include cap-and-trade programs for SO2, NOx, and Hg, statutory national emission standards for new and reconstructed electric generating units (EGUs), and the establishment of an optional \"transitional area\" category. Authorities removed or limited would involve provisions for major sources and changes to hazardous air pollutant provisions. The proposed changes under Clear Skies include national cap-and-trade programs for utility emissions of NOx and mercury, modifications to hazardous air pollutant provisions, a moratorium on petitions to control interstate air pollution, reduced noncompliance penalties under the new SO2 cap-and-trade program, preemption of state requirements for NOx and mercury, and elimination of New Source Review requirements. The proposed changes under Clear Skies include reducing noncompliance penalties in the new SO2 cap-and-trade program, preempting state requirements for NOx and mercury, eliminating New Source Review requirements, and establishing a 50 km zone for Prevention of Significant Deterioration requirements around Class I areas. Clear Skies proposes a cap-and-trade program for SO2, NOx, and Mercury, replacing Title IV of the Clean Air Act. It includes exemptions for units in PSD Class II areas, extensions for meeting ozone and PM 2.5 NAAQS deadlines, and moratoriums on certain provisions in nonattainment areas. The proposal under S. 131 aims to replace Title IV of the Clean Air Act with a multi-pollutant cap-and-trade program, setting caps on emissions of SO2, NOx, and Hg in two phases with trading programs for flexibility. Phase 1 caps for EGUs are set at 2.19 million tons of NOx in 2008, 4.5 million tons of SO2 in 2010, and 34 tons of mercury in 2010. Phase 2 caps, effective in 2018, are 1.79 million tons of NOx, 3.0 million tons of SO2, and 15 tons of mercury. Allowance trading program provisions are similar to existing ones. The new allowance trading program provisions, effective in 2018, set caps on emissions of 1.79 million tons of NOx, 3.0 million tons of SO2, and 15 tons of mercury. Allowances would be allocated free to EGUs based on historic fuel usage, with adjustments for factors specified in the bill. A small pool of allowances would be set aside for new units. The Clear Skies program would establish stricter emission standards for SO2, NOx, and Hg from new and reconstructed EGUs, with a small pool of allowances reserved for new units. The standards are more stringent than current NSPS, with the Hg standard being particularly strict. The proposed National Emission Standards would have lower emissions limits than the current NSPS, especially for Hg. The standards would apply to fewer units and be reviewed every eight years. Additionally, non-utility sources could opt into the Cap-and-Trade Program. The proposed S. 131 allows non-utility units to opt into the cap-and-trade program, with alternative methods for determining allowances based on emissions and output. Units would receive allocations for SO2 and NOx emissions starting at 70% in 2010 and 50% in 2018, and for mercury starting in 2010. In S. 131, units can opt into a cap-and-trade program with allocations for SO2, NOx, and mercury emissions based on federal or state standards. Units would be exempt from compliance deadlines for hazardous air pollutants in various categories upon acceptance into the program. Units can opt into a cap-and-trade program with exemptions from compliance deadlines for hazardous air pollutants in various categories. Opt-in units would be permanently exempt from regulations if accepted by the EPA, and not considered major sources for 20 years. Establishment of an Optional \"Transitional Area\" Category in Place of Nonattainment Designations under ClearSkies would allow areas to be designated \"transitional\" instead of \"nonattainment\" for new ozone and PM 2.5 standards if they are projected to meet the standards by December 31, 2015. EPA modeling shows that most nonattainment counties would qualify for this designation. The EPA modeling shows that 88% of ozone and two-thirds of PM 2.5 nonattainment counties could qualify for transitional status by December 31, 2015. Other areas may qualify by implementing additional local controls, extending deadlines for attainment and removing statutory requirements for nonattainment areas until after 2017 under Clear Skies. Clear Skies exempts affected units from major source requirements under Parts C and D of the Clean Air Act for 20 years after enactment, including NSR, BART, and BACT, unless located near designated national parks. Clear Skies exempts affected units from major source requirements under Parts C and D of the Clean Air Act for 20 years after enactment, including NSR, BART, and BACT. Units located within 50 km of Class I areas are subject to PSD requirements. Nonattainment areas are exempt from nonattainment NSR, LAER, and offset requirements under Clear Skies. Clear Skies would limit nonattainment areas from imposing additional controls on existing EGUs and opt-in facilities under their State Implementation Plans. Existing affected units must show they limit emissions and use good combustion practices to qualify for exemptions. Changes to the Hazardous Air Pollutant Provisions of Section 112 would preclude regulation of hazardous air pollutants emitted by electric utility steam generating units. Clear Skies proposes revisions to Section 112 of the Clean Air Act, excluding regulation of hazardous air pollutants from electric utility steam generating units, except for non-mercury pollutants based on public health concerns and emission control measures. Any decision to impose controls must be supported by a peer-reviewed study with public input. Clear Skies proposes revisions to Section 112 of the Clean Air Act, excluding regulation of hazardous air pollutants from electric utility steam generating units. A determination to impose controls would need to be based on a peer-reviewed study with public input, to be completed before January 2015. Compliance deadlines under hazardous air pollutant regulations would be exempted for units opting into the cap-and-trade program. EPA acceptance of their application would permanently exempt them from compliance with MACT standards. Clear Skies proposes changes to Section 126 petitions under the Clean Air Act, establishing a moratorium on interstate air pollution control petitions and stricter requirements for acceptance after the moratorium. If EPA accepts their application, affected units would be permanently exempt from MACT standards. The amendment to Section 126 petitions under the Clean Air Act would require upwind sources emitting significant air pollutants to either shut down or implement mandated controls within three years. The Administrator cannot mandate SIPs with an effective date before December 31, 2014. Factors considered include emissions reductions needed to meet attainment dates. The Administrator, when reviewing a petition under Section 126 of the Clean Air Act, must consider emissions reductions required by attainment dates in nonattainment areas. The required emission reductions from affected units must be cost-effective and improve air quality in nonattainment areas. Clear Skies would replace the Clean Air Act's existing Section 411 in 2008, reducing penalties for noncompliance with the sulfur dioxide cap-and-trade program. Noncompliance penalties were set at $2,000 per ton of excess emissions in 1990, adjusted for inflation to $2,890.59 in 2004. The penalties for noncompliance with the sulfur dioxide cap-and-trade program under Clear Skies would be set at $2,000 per ton, without inflation adjustments, cutting the penalty by about one-third initially. The bill does not preempt states from adopting more stringent limits. Under the cap-and-trade programs, states and political subdivisions would be prohibited from interfering with the transfer, sale, or purchase of allowances. This could allow increased emissions in another jurisdiction equal to any reduction achieved in a more stringent state for covered pollutants. The bill limits the ability to control out-of-state pollution, potentially burdening a state's economy with additional control costs. The Clear Skies bill exempts EGUs and opt-in facilities from NSR for 20 years, establishing National Emission Standards for new EGUs. Reconstruction of units is defined as replacing components exceeding 50% of the fixed capital cost for a new unit. Reconstruction involves replacing components in units where the fixed capital cost of the new components exceeds 50% of the fixed capital cost to construct a comparable new unit. There is no specific cost criterion for modifications requiring an affected source to undergo NSR, but it is considered to be well below a 50% threshold. EPA's attempt to establish a 20% threshold in 2003 was criticized and stayed by the U.S. Court of Appeals. The EPA's attempt in October 2003 to establish a 20% threshold for plant modifications was criticized and stayed by the U.S. Court of Appeals. The Clear Skies initiative would exempt EGUs and opt-in facilities from BART requirements for 20 years after enactment. The Clear Skies initiative would exempt EGUs and opt-in facilities from BART requirements for 20 years after enactment. It also specifies that affected units within 50 km of a Class I area would remain subject to PSD requirements, ensuring no adverse impact on air quality and visibility in the area. The regulations require permit applicants to identify Class I areas within 100 km of the unit's location. Clear Skies would exempt affected units in Class II areas from further controlling their emissions to maintain air quality within specified limits. Extension of Deadlines for the Ozone and PM2.5 NAAQS under Clear Skies would create a new \"transitional\" area classification for areas that can demonstrate attainment of standards by December 2015, exempting them from penalties until then. Extension of deadlines for ozone and PM2.5 NAAQS under Clear Skies would establish a transitional area classification for regions meeting standards by December 2015. Nonattainment areas post-2015 would need to implement controls to achieve compliance by 2022. Ozone transitional areas would be exempt from certain statutory requirements until 2017. Subpart 2 provisions for ozone nonattainment would be eliminated. The Clean Air Act's Subpart 2 outlines specific requirements for ozone nonattainment areas, including LAER standards, offset requirements for new sources, RACT for existing sources, vehicle inspection programs, vapor recovery at gas stations, and penalties for non-compliance. EPA proposes to maintain these requirements for areas that fail to meet the ozone standard. The EPA proposes penalties for areas failing to meet ozone standards, with potential for transitional status under Clear Skies to roll back requirements by 2015. The Clear Skies legislation aims to eliminate conformity requirements for ozone and PM 2.5 nonattainment areas until 2018, potentially impacting federally funded projects in those areas. The Clear Skies legislation proposes significant changes to Title I, including the elimination of location as a variable for controlling electric generating units (EGUs) unless within 50 km of a PSD Class I area. Emission limitations under Clear Skies are not based on whether an EGU is in an attainment or nonattainment area. The Clear Skies legislation proposes changes to Title I, removing location as a factor for controlling EGUs, regardless of their proximity to a PSD Class I area. Emission limitations and allowance trading would not be affected by an EGU's location or state restrictions. States' ability to impose strict rules on EGUs in nonattainment areas would be eliminated if Clear Skies is enacted. If Clear Skies is enacted, states' ability to impose strict rules on EGUs in nonattainment areas would be eliminated. The legislation would also prevent states from restricting allowance trading, limiting their influence on EGU emissions. Additionally, the state enforcement mechanism NSR would be eliminated for EGUs covered by Clear Skies. By preventing states from restricting allowance trading, any additional reductions achieved by state legislation to help achieve attainment or protect local habitat would create extra allowances for sale to upwind utilities. States would be unable to prevent the sale or seek relief through a Section 126 petition until after 2014. Clear Skies aims to reduce the need for stronger state and local standards for ozone and PM 2.5 NAAQS by introducing a transitional designation for areas. Clear Skies introduces a \"transitional\" designation for areas not meeting air quality standards, aiming to avoid the need for stronger state and local regulations. Transitional areas would not require additional controls if they are projected to meet standards by December 2015. The plan also includes provisions to protect Class I areas under the PSD program. Clear Skies aims to protect Class I areas by providing Part C requirements for facilities within 50 km, but the sufficiency of this measure is debatable. States and localities face constraints in meeting requirements for areas not meeting Class I standards due to limitations on imposing additional controls on EGUs and opt-ins. The controversy over EGU age remains unresolved under Clear Skies. Clear Skies aims to reduce the controversy over EGU age by setting up allowance reserves for new sources, with more generous allocation formulas for existing sources. Allowances for new sources are on a first-come, first-serve basis, with no further allowances available once the reserve is exhausted. The allowances for new sources under Clear Skies are more generous than for existing sources, which have a first-come, first-serve basis. Once the reserve is depleted, no further allowances are available, giving existing units an advantage over new facilities. Table 4 outlines the regulation of mercury and other hazardous air pollutants under Clear Skies. Table 4 provides an overview of the regulation of mercury and other hazardous air pollutants under Clear Skies. Maximum Achievable Control Technology standards and residual risk standards would no longer apply to new or existing EGUs or other industrial sources in the cap-and-trade program, making it challenging to address \"hot spots\" with high mercury concentrations. States setting more stringent standards under their own Clean Air Act would not have complete control. The Clean Air Act allows states to set more stringent standards, but these standards would not have complete control. States cannot restrict allowance trading, which could result in extra reductions in mercury emissions. The Administrator retains authority to address non-mercury hazardous air pollutants from Electric Generating Units under strict conditions. Former Administrator Whitman has identified the central issue in Clear Skies' interaction with the Clean Air Act: Are the targets stringent enough to permit the relaxing or removal of some provisions designed to achieve the same thing with respect to electric utilities? Clear Skies will not achieve the NAAQS within the current CAA compliance deadlines. Clear Skies, as currently drafted, will not achieve the NAAQS for 8-hour ozone or fine particulate matter within the current Clean Air Act compliance deadlines. Some nonattainment areas will require additional controls and time to reach attainment. The opt-in provision in Clear Skies makes its reach unclear and removes electric utility control options for states. Clear Skies' opt-in provision creates uncertainty in achieving NAAQS and limits control options for states. Mercury contamination concerns persist with modest controls proposed for electric utilities. Clear Skies proposes modest controls on mercury from electric utilities, limiting state options for further reducing emissions. The Administration argues that Clear Skies will achieve reductions sooner and at a lower cost compared to the Clean Air Act, despite extending compliance deadlines. The Clear Skies proposal aims to achieve reductions sooner and at a lower cost compared to the Clean Air Act, despite extending compliance deadlines for states. The early reductions in a market-based cap-and-trade program may lead to overcontrol initially, but can be used to offset emissions in the future. This additional flexibility may benefit state and local authorities. Achieving reductions early in a cap-and-trade program may not result in more reductions in the long term. The flexibility of using banked allowances can complicate compliance strategies for state and local authorities."
