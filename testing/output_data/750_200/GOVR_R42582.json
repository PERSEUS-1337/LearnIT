    "content": "Foreign assistance in Latin America and the Caribbean is used by the United States to advance its interests, with aid programs tailored to the diverse needs of countries in the region. Some countries still face challenges and receive a full range of assistance, while others have progressed and receive support for new security issues like citizen security and combating organized crime. Foreign assistance in Latin America and the Caribbean is evolving, with some countries largely outgrown U.S. assistance but still receiving support for new security challenges. U.S. relations in the region are less defined by aid provision, but foreign aid continues to play a role in advancing U.S. policy. Congress oversees aid programs and agencies managing them, especially amidst efforts to reduce budget deficits post-global financial crisis and U.S. recession. Efforts to reduce budget deficits post-global financial crisis have led to closer scrutiny of U.S. aid programs. Congress is considering cuts to foreign assistance, which could impact the aid budget for Latin America and the Caribbean. This report provides an overview of historical and recent trends in U.S. assistance to the region. The report provides an overview of U.S. assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean, including historical and recent trends, the Obama Administration's FY2013 request for aid, support from other U.S. agencies, funding provisions in foreign aid appropriations bills, and potential congressional issues. The United States has been a major contributor of foreign assistance to countries in Latin America and the Caribbean since the 1960s. U.S. assistance spiked with President Kennedy's Alliance for Progress and increased again in the 1980s due to leftist movements in Nicaragua. Assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean increased in the 1980s to support the Contras in Nicaragua and governments fighting leftist insurgencies. Aid declined in the mid-1990s but rose again in the late 1990s and continued to increase in the following decade. Assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean increased in the late 1990s and continued to rise in the following decade, driven by higher spending on humanitarian and development aid. The United States provided extensive aid after Hurricane Mitch in 1998, and initiatives like PEPFAR and MCC offered new sources of assistance to the region. The Obama Administration also emphasized fostering relationships in the region. The MCC provided new U.S. assistance to countries in the region in 2004. The Obama Administration focused on economic growth and requested higher aid levels. Aid to Haiti post-2010 earthquake was significant. Most U.S. aid through 2010 was for counternarcotics and security programs. Since FY2000, successive Administrations and Congresses have provided substantial foreign aid to Colombia and its Andean neighbors for counternarcotics and security programs, including support for \"Plan Colombia.\" President Bush also initiated the M\u00e9rida Initiative in FY2008 for Mexico and Central America. In FY2010, the Obama Administration split the Central America portion of M\u00e9rida assistance. The M\u00e9rida Initiative, a U.S. counterdrug and anticrime assistance package for Mexico and Central America, was split into separate programs for Central America (CARSI) and the Caribbean (CBSI) in FY2010. U.S. aid to Latin America and the Caribbean has been decreasing since FY2010, including under the Obama Administration's FY2013 request. U.S. assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean has been decreasing since FY2010, with a 10% decrease in aid from FY2008 to FY2012. Aid to other regions also declined, except for South and Central Asia, the Middle East, and Africa which saw increases during the same period. U.S. aid to Latin America and the Caribbean decreased by 10% from FY2008 to FY2012, while aid to South and Central Asia, the Middle East, and Africa increased during the same period. This shift in aid reflects changes in U.S. foreign policy priorities towards development efforts in Africa and strategic regions for anti-terrorism operations. U.S. assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean decreased from 10% in FY2008 to under 8% in FY2012. The Obama Administration focused more on development and humanitarian aid in the region through programs like Development Assistance and Global Health Programs. The Global Health Programs (GHP) funding aims to promote economic progress and social stability in developing nations through long-term projects in economic reform, democracy promotion, basic education, human health, and environmental protection. Humanitarian assistance focuses on immediate relief for emergencies, including food aid and support for refugees and internally displaced persons. USAID manages most development and humanitarian programs, while the State Department administers the Migration and Refugee Assistance (MRA) account. The State Department administers the Migration and Refugee Assistance (MRA) account, which is funded through the Economic Support Fund (ESF) account. ESF aims to promote U.S. economic, political, and security interests by funding programs for political and economic stability. The Economic Support Fund (ESF) funds programs for political, economic, and security stability, managed by USAID in conjunction with the State Department. Additionally, the United States supports security assistance programs in the region, including counternarcotics and civilian law enforcement efforts funded through the International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement (INCLE) account. The INCLE account supports counternarcotics and law enforcement efforts, while the NADR account focuses on global threats like terrorism and weapons proliferation. The US also aids Latin American and Caribbean militaries through FMF and IMET accounts managed by the State Department.

Haiti received high levels of aid due to development challenges and post-earthquake relief in 2010, with a focus on long-term development since then. Since the earthquake in Haiti in January 2010, the United States has provided extensive humanitarian relief and focused on long-term development in key sectors such as energy, infrastructure, basic services, and governance. Aid to Colombia has decreased as the country has improved its security situation and taken on more financial responsibility, leading the U.S. to shift its assistance towards economic and social development efforts. The United States has shifted its assistance focus from costly military equipment to economic and social development efforts in countries like Mexico and Colombia. Aid levels have declined as the emphasis moved towards rule of law programs. In FY2012, the US provided $357 million for Haiti, $379 million for Colombia, and $330 million for Mexico, with these countries receiving over 56% of all aid to the region. The Obama Administration's FY2013 foreign aid budget request for Latin America and the Caribbean is approximately $1.7 billion, which represents a decrease in assistance compared to previous years.

DA supports initiatives for conservation in the Andean Amazon and combating deforestation. The regional program focuses on conserving biodiversity and combating deforestation in the Amazon basin. It also supports the Andean Trade Capacity Building Program to improve compliance with international trade agreements and increase private sector competitiveness. GHP funding under the program assists in preventing and controlling malaria in seven South American countries in the Amazon Basin. The State Department provides assistance to countries in the Amazon Basin to prevent and control malaria. Funding for Western Hemisphere countries amounted to $57 million in FY2011 and $54 million in FY2012, with a requested decrease to $47.2 million in FY2013. MRA assistance for Latin America in FY2011 and FY2012 totaled $57 million and $54 million respectively, with a requested decrease to $47.2 million in FY2013. The funding supports protection and assistance for internally displaced persons in Colombia and refugees in neighboring countries. The violence in Colombia has led to an estimated 4 million IDPs, refugees, and other persons of concern in the region. MRA funding in Latin America supports programs for internally displaced persons and refugees in Colombia and neighboring countries, as well as regional initiatives by UNHCR, ICRC, and IOM. This includes assistance in Haiti for healthcare, water systems, and prison conditions. The State Department's Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs administers centrally managed programs providing INCLE assistance worldwide. The State Department's Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs administers programs in Latin America, including aviation support for counternarcotics efforts in Colombia, Bolivia, Guatemala, and Peru. INCLE funds also support law enforcement academies in El Salvador and Peru, as well as a Central American Anti-Gang program. The U.S. government agencies, including the Department of Defense and the Inter-American Foundation, provide foreign assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean separately from programs administered by the State Department and USAID. This includes support for an International Law Enforcement Academy in El Salvador, a Regional Training Center in Lima, Peru, and a Central American Anti-Gang program focusing on investigative, legal, and intelligence capacity, community policing, prevention, and prison management in Central America.

DOD provides unique foreign assistance in Latin America and the Caribbean, including humanitarian, counterdrug, counterterrorism, and stabilization aid. In Latin America and the Caribbean, the Department of Defense (DOD) provides unique foreign assistance, including humanitarian, counterdrug, counterterrorism, and stabilization aid. DOD assistance is primarily focused on supporting institutional needs and training opportunities for the U.S. Armed Forces in the region. The two regional combatant commands responsible for DOD operations in the hemisphere are U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM) and U.S. Southern Command (SOUTHCOM). In Latin America and the Caribbean, DOD provides humanitarian assistance funded through annual appropriations legislation. Congress authorizes DOD to engage in various humanitarian activities, transport goods, and provide disaster relief. In FY2010, DOD provided $84 million in humanitarian assistance through nearly 200 projects in 28 countries. In FY2010, DOD provided $84 million in humanitarian assistance through nearly 200 projects in at least 28 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. Assistance included alert warning systems, insecticide-treated nets, and health center renovations. Haiti received the largest amount of assistance after the 2010 earthquake. DOD also helps partner countries prepare for and respond to natural disasters and humanitarian emergencies. DOD provides critical support during humanitarian emergencies, deploying resources quickly. For example, after the earthquake in Haiti, SOUTHCOM sent an assessment team within 24 hours to restore operations, deliver supplies, and provide security. While USAID leads disaster response, DOD is often the first to act. DOD provides humanitarian assistance, security, and counterdrug support to Latin American and Caribbean nations. While USAID is the lead authority for disaster response, DOD is often the first to respond due to its capabilities. Congress has granted independent counterdrug authorities to DOD under the National Defense Authorization Act. DOD has been granted independent counterdrug authorities under the National Defense Authorization Act, allowing support for foreign counterdrug efforts through various means. In FY2010, DOD provided the region with nearly $435 million in counterdrug assistance. In FY2010, DOD provided the region with $435 million in counterdrug assistance, with Colombia and Mexico being the largest recipients. Some countries have also received DOD assistance for counterterrorism and stabilization activities under Section 1206 of the FY2006 NDAA. Between FY2006 and FY2010, DOD provided $72.1 million in assistance to 10 countries in the region for training and equipping foreign military and maritime security forces under Section 1206 of the FY2006 NDAA. Additionally, DOD provided $67.5 million in funding for small-scale security and stabilization activities under Section 1207 of the same NDAA. No Latin American or Caribbean nations received Section 1206 funding in FY2010. The DOD funded small-scale security and stabilization activities abroad through the State Department and USAID from FY2006 to FY2010. Section 1207 authority expired in FY2010. The Inter-American Foundation (IAF) provides grants for grassroots development in Latin America and the Caribbean, totaling $695 million from FY1972 to FY2011. The Inter-American Foundation (IAF) has provided almost 5,000 grants worth $695 million from FY1972 to FY2011 to support development projects for local and community-based groups. The grants address basic needs like nutrition, water, and health care, as well as help start businesses, create jobs, and develop skills. Recipients are expected to contribute their own resources or mobilize resources from other sources, totaling about $1 billion since the agency's establishment. Since its establishment, the Inter-American Foundation (IAF) has provided over $1 billion in additional resources, surpassing IAF contributions.

The Inter-American Foundation (IAF) awarded grants totaling $14.9 million in FY2011, with allocations in various sectors. Funding for the IAF amounted to $22.45 million in FY2011 and an estimated $22.5 million in FY2012. The Administration's FY2013 request is for $18.1 million, a nearly 20% decline from FY2012 appropriations. Despite the cuts, the agency plans to maintain its program level by partnering with other agencies and reducing overhead costs. The Inter-American Foundation (IAF) received $22.5 million in FY2011 and $22.5 million in FY2012. Congress appropriated $22.5 million for the IAF in FY2013, with additional funding from the Social Progress Trust Fund (SPTF) decreasing in future years. The Social Progress Trust Fund (SPTF) received almost $4.7 million in FY2011, $7.5 million in FY2012, and will get $4.2 million in FY2013. SPTF funding will decrease significantly in the future, with funding reduced to about $3 million in FY2017 and declining further to about $0.5 million or less starting in FY2019. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) was established in 2004 to provide economic assistance to developing nations meeting certain indicators. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) provides aid through a competitive selection process, focusing on measurable impact. It awards compacts up to five years in length and smaller threshold programs to assist countries in weak areas. Three Latin American and Caribbean countries have been awarded compacts: El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua. El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua have been awarded compacts by the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), receiving $886.7 million in assistance. El Salvador signed a $461 million compact in 2006 to develop its northern border region, focusing on improving physical infrastructure and human development projects. El Salvador's compact with the Millennium Challenge Corporation focused on improving physical infrastructure, human development, supporting small farmers and businesses, and transportation projects. The compact was completed in September 2012, and El Salvador became eligible for a second compact in December 2011. El Salvador is eligible for a second compact proposal to be finalized in 2013. In June 2005, Honduras signed a $215 million economic growth compact with two components: a rural development project and a transportation project. MCC terminated $10 million in funding for Honduras after President Manuel Zelaya's ouster in June 2009, reducing the total funding to $205 million. Honduras completed the compact in September 2010. Honduras had a $215 million economic growth compact with MCC, but $10 million was terminated after President Manuel Zelaya's ouster in June 2009. The compact was completed in September 2010, but MCC decided not to renew it due to corruption issues. However, Honduras remains eligible for a $20 million threshold program to address corruption and economic growth barriers. Nicaragua signed a $175 million compact in July 2005 focusing on the western region for economic growth. In 2005, Nicaragua signed a $175 million compact with MCC focusing on the western region for economic growth. The compact had three components: transportation project, rural development project, and property regularization project. $61.5 million in funding was suspended and terminated after the country's disputed November 2008 elections, reducing total funding to $113.5 million. The compact ended in May 2011. The MCC compact with Nicaragua focused on economic growth in the western region, with funding suspended after disputed elections in 2008. Other countries in the hemisphere, like Guyana and Paraguay, also received threshold programs from MCC to improve fiscal policy and reduce corruption. Paraguay and Peru received MCC funding to reduce corruption and improve oversight of budget. Paraguay received $30.3 million for a second program focusing on law enforcement, customs, healthcare, and judiciary sectors. Peru signed a $35.6 million program to increase immunization rates and combat corruption. Peace Corps has had almost 65,000 volunteers in Latin America and the Caribbean since 1961, with 2,600 volunteers serving by FY2011. Since its founding in 1961, the Peace Corps has had nearly 65,000 volunteers in Latin America and the Caribbean. In FY2011, around 2,600 volunteers were working on development projects in various sectors. Program funding for the region was approximately $65 million in FY2011 and an estimated $61 million in FY2012, with a budget request of about $60 million for FY2013. Due to budget cuts, the total number of volunteers in the region has been affected. In FY2012, the Peace Corps had a budget of around $65 million for programs in Latin America and the Caribbean, which decreased to about $60 million for FY2013. The total number of volunteers in the region is expected to decline to 2,250 by the end of FY2012 and 1,800 by the end of FY2013. Most countries in the region will see reductions in volunteers, except for Colombia. The Peace Corps plans to close programs in Antigua and Barbuda, St. Kitts and Nevis in FY2012, and in Suriname in FY2013. The Peace Corps closed programs in Antigua and Barbuda, St. Kitts and Nevis in FY2012, and in Suriname in FY2013 due to security concerns in upper-middle-income countries. In the past, the agency has suspended operations in Latin American and Caribbean countries like Haiti and Bolivia. In 2008, the Peace Corps withdrew from Bolivia due to instability and strained relations with the United States. In January 2012, volunteers were evacuated from Honduras due to high levels of violence. The program in Honduras was suspended in September 2012. Volunteer training classes were canceled in El Salvador and Guatemala in December 2011 due to security concerns. The Peace Corps plans to send new volunteers to El Salvador and Guatemala in 2013 despite security concerns. The Obama Administration's priorities for U.S. policy in Latin America include promoting economic opportunity, citizen security, democratic governance, and clean energy. State Department officials emphasize the importance of improving citizen security. The U.S. foreign aid budget request for Latin America prioritizes citizen security programs in Mexico, Colombia, Central America, and the Caribbean, accounting for 45% of the total. These programs aim to strengthen institutions, address crime root causes, and ensure long-term public security through an integrated and multilateral partnership. The FY2013 U.S. foreign aid budget request for Latin America prioritizes citizen security programs in Mexico, Colombia, Central America, and the Caribbean to build and sustain the rule of law, address crime root causes, and ensure long-term public security. Haiti would receive 20% of aid to support earthquake recovery, development efforts, sanitation, and health services. The budget also includes assistance for counternarcotics under \"Peace and Security\" programs. The FY2013 U.S. foreign aid budget for Latin America focuses on citizen security programs in Mexico, Colombia, Central America, and the Caribbean. \"Peace and Security\" assistance, including counternarcotics and counterterrorism, makes up 30% of aid. \"Governing Justly and Democratically\" accounts for 24% and supports rule of law and human rights. \"Investing in People\" makes up 23% and includes health and education aid. \"Economic Growth\" assistance is also provided. The \"Investing in People\" program area accounts for 23% of assistance and includes health, education, and aid for vulnerable populations. The \"Economic Growth\" program area includes assistance for projects on environment, agriculture, private sector competitiveness, infrastructure, and trade and investment, making up about 20% of aid to the region. The Administration's request for FY2013 is about 10% less than the amount provided in FY2012, taking advantage of favorable development trends in the region. USAID plans to close its mission in Panama, manage programs for Guyana from Barbados, reduce aid to Colombia and Peru, and withdraw from sectors where progress has been made or other donors are filling gaps. Some Members have concerns about the proposed 10% decrease in funding for Latin America and the Caribbean, questioning if it is enough to address U.S. interests in the region. There is agreement on the importance of maintaining assistance for citizen security and counter-narcotics efforts in Mexico, Colombia, Central America, and the Caribbean, but some Members are worried about declines in funding for these programs. Some Members have concerns about declines in assistance for citizen security and counter-narcotics efforts in Latin America and the Caribbean. There are also calls for adequate monitoring to ensure transparency and accountability in Haiti's recovery assistance program. Opposition exists towards portions of the Administration's proposed FY2013 funding for the region, including the President's Global Climate Change Initiative. Opposition to the President's Global Climate Change Initiative, including funding for Latin American and Caribbean countries, as well as objections to increases in funding for Bolivia, Ecuador, and Nicaragua due to concerns about their governments undermining U.S. interests. Some committee members also opposed cuts in democracy funding for Cuba and Venezuela, arguing it is essential to support democracy advocates. House and Senate Appropriations Committees have marked up their versions of the FY2013 State Department, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs appropriations measure, with potential cuts to worldwide foreign aid funding. Assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean could see significant reductions, particularly in funding for democracy advocates in Cuba and Venezuela. The House and Senate versions of the FY2013 foreign aid appropriations bill may result in significant cuts to assistance for Latin America and the Caribbean. Questions for Congress include whether the funding reflects U.S. interests and if there are metrics to evaluate program effectiveness in the region. The House and Senate versions of the FY2013 foreign aid appropriations bill may lead to cuts in assistance for Latin America and the Caribbean. Congress needs to consider specific metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of aid programs in the region and the potential impact of proposed aid cuts on U.S. policy and bilateral relations. Identifying areas for reduction with the least harm to U.S. interests is crucial as Congress seeks to maximize the impact of foreign assistance funds. As Congress considers cuts to foreign aid for Latin America and the Caribbean, it is important to identify areas for reduction with minimal harm to U.S. interests. Resource coordination among U.S. government agencies and international donors is crucial for maximizing the impact of assistance funds. The State Department, USAID, and DOD manage aid programs in the region, but lack awareness of each other's efforts according to a 2012 GAO report. The 2012 GAO report highlighted the lack of coordination among the State Department, USAID, and DOD in their aid programs, leading to potential overlap. Improved information sharing and coordination could enhance the impact of assistance programs. Congress should consider the benefits of closer collaboration among these agencies. According to the OECD, Latin America and the Caribbean received $10.7 billion in development assistance in 2010, with the United States contributing $2.7 billion. Closer coordination with other international donors could increase the impact of aid programs. Some studies have found a lack of coordination among major bilateral and multilateral donors providing foreign assistance in Latin America and the Caribbean. Closer coordination could ensure complementary efforts, focus on specific countries or sectors, and use limited funds more efficiently. However, challenges exist in determining leadership and division of labor among donors. Coordination challenges exist in determining leadership and division of labor among donors for foreign assistance in Latin America and the Caribbean. The United States has started trilateral cooperation agreements with successful countries in the region to provide aid to third countries. The United States has signed trilateral cooperation agreements with Brazil, Chile, and Colombia to provide assistance to third countries, aiming to combine expertise and financial resources for greater impact. Assistance requested for Brazil in FY2013 would strengthen their development agency and support joint agriculture, food security, and school feeding programs in third countries. The United States has signed trilateral cooperation agreements with Brazil, Chile, and Colombia to provide assistance to third countries, aiming to combine expertise and financial resources for greater impact. The House FY2013 foreign aid appropriations bill recommends $18.6 million to support Colombian government efforts in counternarcotics and law enforcement challenges. Critics argue that providing assistance through foreign governments has potential benefits and drawbacks. Critics raise oversight concerns about providing assistance through foreign governments, as it may lead to misuse of U.S. funds. Questions for Congress include identifying agencies with comparative advantages in aid provision and clarifying roles of U.S. agencies in foreign assistance. Coordination mechanisms and specific types of assistance programs may need further consideration. Critics raise oversight concerns about providing foreign assistance through governments, questioning the need for clarification, inter-agency coordination, and identifying comparative advantages. Considerations include the impact on strategic interests, controls to ensure funds are used lawfully, and the effect on regional partners' capacities. The State Department's QDDR emphasizes assessing host nations' political will to effectively use U.S. assistance in Latin American and Caribbean nations. Partner nations must implement reforms and sustain programs for aid to have the most impact. The State Department's QDDR emphasizes assessing host nations' political will to effectively use U.S. assistance in Latin American and Caribbean nations. Assistance is targeted where it can have the most impact, but unless partner nations implement reforms and sustain programs, the results may be limited and short-lived. Colombia, a recipient of high levels of U.S. assistance, has demonstrated political will by undertaking reforms and raising revenue, allowing for a managed transition of aid programs in the country. Colombia has shown political will by implementing reforms and raising revenue, enabling a managed transition of aid programs. However, political will has been lacking in the region, hindering efforts to sustain programs initiated with U.S. support. Political will has often been lacking in the region, especially in raising sufficient government revenue to sustain efforts initiated with U.S. support. Studies have shown cases where U.S.-funded programs and equipment were left unused due to lack of resources after U.S. support ended. Lack of funding for fuel and maintenance has also hindered the use of U.S.-provided boats for patrol or interdiction operations in counternarcotics programs. Even MCC-funded projects have faced challenges due to partner nation actions. As Members of Congress consider foreign aid appropriations for Latin American and Caribbean countries, they should assess the recipient country's capacity to maintain equipment provided, including roads built with MCC funding in Honduras. The study found that municipalities lack the resources for road maintenance, raising concerns about program sustainability. When considering foreign aid for Latin American and Caribbean countries, it is important to assess their capacity to maintain provided equipment and infrastructure. Questions to consider include the host country's ability to take on financial and operational responsibility, the amount of assistance needed to build technical and financial capacity, and the political will for necessary reforms. Additionally, it is important to determine if U.S. assistance will be complemented by host nation resources or public-private partnerships, and if it should be contingent upon reforms or financing. The House Committee on Appropriations marked up its FY2013 appropriations bill for the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs in May 2012. The total funding levels would have been 9.6% lower than the FY2012 estimate if enacted. The House Committee on Appropriations marked up its FY2013 appropriations bill for the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs in May 2012, with total funding levels 9.6% lower than the FY2012 estimate if enacted. The Senate Committee on Appropriations marked up its bill (S. 3241) with a total of $52.3 billion, including $50 billion for the core State Department and Foreign Operations budget and $2.3 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations, resulting in funding levels 2.3% lower than the FY2012 estimate if enacted. The Obama Administration criticized the House bill for proposing funding levels in FY2013 that were 2.3% lower than the FY2012 estimate and 4.7% lower than the Administration's request. They argued that these cuts would harm national security and lead to higher long-term costs from various threats. The specific allocation of foreign assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean under the bills was uncertain due to lack of detailed appropriations for individual countries and programs. The House report expressed concerns over conditions in Latin America and the Caribbean and intended to provide assistance levels above the Administration's request to some nations in the region. The Committee recommendation aimed to address immediate security needs by restoring proposed reductions for key countries in Latin America. The Committee recommendation restores proposed reductions for key countries in Latin America to address immediate security needs, including counternarcotics efforts and assistance for rule of law activities. The Senate report also called for additional U.S. aid to address the daunting challenges in the region. The Senate report (S.Rept. 112-172) expressed concerns about the challenges in Central and South America and called for additional U.S. aid to strengthen democratic institutions, police forces, and address poverty in the region. Additional funds were recommended under various headings. The Senate report called for additional U.S. aid to strengthen democratic institutions, police forces, and address poverty in Central and South America. Specific funding levels were recommended for Colombia and Mexico, with the House report suggesting increased funding for training and technical assistance in Colombia. The House and Senate reports recommended increased funding for training and technical assistance in Colombia and Mexico to support anti-crime, counternarcotics efforts, and economic development activities. The Senate report recommended funding for economic development activities along the U.S.-Mexican border, while the House report prioritized democracy programs in Venezuela. The Senate supported the Administration's request for democracy programs but recommended administration by the National Endowment for Democracy. The House report recommended funding for regional security programs in CARSI and CBSI, with additional funds above the request. The Senate report supported the requested levels for both programs. The House bill proposed extra funding for democracy programs in Cuba, while the Senate bill capped funding at the requested level. The Senate report also recommended additional funds for conservation programs in Brazil. The Senate bill recommended additional funding for conservation programs in the Brazilian Amazon and the Inter-American Foundation, while the House bill funded them at the requested level. Congress did not take action on the appropriations bills, opting for a six-month continuing resolution instead. In FY2013, Congress passed a six-month continuing resolution (P.L. 112-175) before enacting new legislation (P.L. 113-6) in March 2013 to fund federal programs through the end of the fiscal year. State Department and Foreign Operations accounts were funded at the same level as FY2012, subject to budget sequestration cuts. Sequestration cuts from the Budget Control Act of 2011 and the American Taxpayers Relief Act reduced State Department-Foreign Operations funding by about 5% in FY2013, with reductions applied at the account level. Country-level allocations for FY2013 are not yet available."
