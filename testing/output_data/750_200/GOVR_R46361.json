    "content": "The report provides an overview of the FY2020 Defense Appropriations Act (P.L. 116-93) and serves as a gateway to other CRS products offering additional context and analysis related to the legislation. It tracks the legislative history, budgetary context, and treatment of major components of the Trump Administration's budget request, including weapons acquisition programs. The Administration requested $750.0 billion in discretionary budget authority for FY2020. The Trump Administration requested $750.0 billion for national defense in FY2020, with $718.3 billion allocated for Department of Defense activities. $689.5 billion of the DOD budget fell within the defense appropriations bill. The FY2020 defense appropriations bill allocated $1.1 billion for intelligence community expenses. It does not include funding for military construction, family housing, or TRICARE for Life program. Funding for these activities is provided by separate appropriations bills. The FY2020 Defense Appropriations Act, part of H.R. 1158, provides $687.8 billion for DOD, $2.86 billion less than requested by President Trump. Since 2001, DOD has structured its budget to allocate funds for post-9/11 activities and base budget costs. The DOD's \"base budget\" covers regular costs for U.S. armed forces, while non-base budget funds are designated for Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO). The Budget Control Act of 2011 set annual spending caps, but OCO funds are exempt from these caps. The FY2020 defense budget included OCO funding to avoid exceeding spending caps. Committees treated OCO funds as part of the base budget request. The FY2020 defense budget included OCO funding to avoid exceeding spending caps. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 raised the defense spending cap to $666.5 billion for FY2020, rendering the issue of \"OCO for base\" funds moot. Separate versions of the FY2020 defense appropriations bill were reported by the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. The House passed H.R. 2740 incorporating the text of H.R. 2968, while the Senate reported S. 2474. The House passed H.R. 2740 on June 19, 2019, incorporating the text of H.R. 2968. The Senate reported S. 2474 on September 12, 2019, but took no action. A compromise version of the defense bill was included in H.R. 1158, which was passed by both chambers. Committee Chairman Nita Lowey included an Explanatory Statement in the Congressional Record for H.R. 1158, reflecting a shift in strategic emphasis in the President's FY2020 budget request for DOD. The focus is now on countering evolving threats from China and Russia, marking a change from the previous U.S. national security policy. After the Cold War, U.S. national security policy shifted towards dealing with regional aggressors like Iraq, Iran, and North Korea, and adjusting relations with China and Russia. Following the 9/11 attacks, the focus turned towards countering evolving threats from China and Russia in the President's FY2020 budget request for DOD. After the Cold War, U.S. national security policy shifted towards dealing with regional aggressors like Iraq, Iran, and North Korea, and adjusting relations with China and Russia. Following the 9/11 attacks, the focus turned towards countering terrorism and insurgencies in the Middle East while containing North Korean and Iranian nuclear weapons programs. The 2014 Russian invasion of Crimea and proxy war in eastern Ukraine renewed concerns in the United States. The 2014 Russian invasion of Crimea and proxy war in eastern Ukraine renewed concerns in the United States and Europe about aggressive regimes in Moscow and China's militarization of islands in the South China Sea to assert sovereignty and control shipping lanes. This highlighted the importance of competing with great powers in the U.S. national security agenda. The challenges of competing with great powers in the national security agenda include states using military force unilaterally, fragile states, genocide, terrorism, and nuclear proliferation. Adversaries collaborate to achieve shared objectives, using social and economic tools, and working with non-state proxies to blur the lines between conventional and irregular conflict. The Trump Administration's National Security Strategy and National Defense Strategy focus on great power competition with China and Russia, blurring the lines between conventional and irregular conflict through non-state proxies. The National Defense Strategy (NDS) shifts U.S. national security strategy towards great power competition with China and Russia, emphasizing the need to bolster the competitive advantage of U.S. forces. It acknowledges the erosion of this advantage vis-\u00e0-vis Chinese and Russian threats and highlights the increased contestation of military objectives. The Trump Administration's strategic orientation, outlined in the National Security Strategy (NSS) and National Defense Strategy (NDS), identifies China, Russia, North Korea, Iran, and global terrorist groups as significant threats to U.S. interests. The NDS prioritizes maintaining a strategic competitive edge over China and Russia over countering violent extremist organizations. The new U.S. strategy, known as the \"2+3\" strategy, prioritizes countering China and Russia as the main challenges, along with North Korea, Iran, and terrorist groups. Federal spending has increased significantly over the past four decades, with mandatory spending for entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid growing the fastest. Federal spending has grown significantly over the past four decades, with mandatory spending for entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid increasing. The Budget Control Act of 2011 aimed to control federal spending through sequestration if discretionary spending budgets did not meet separate caps on defense and nondefense discretionary budget authority. The Budget Control Act of 2011 established annual limits to reduce discretionary federal spending by $1.0 trillion through FY2021. Sequestration automatically cancels previous appropriations to meet the spending caps, with exceptions for emergency or OCO funding. Congress has passed legislation to raise the spending caps. The Budget Control Act of 2011 set annual limits to reduce federal spending, with exceptions for emergency or OCO funding. Congress has raised the spending caps through legislation. The Administration's FY2020 budget request adhered to the defense cap but included $165 billion in OCO funding, $98 billion of which was for the base budget. The Administration's FY2020 budget request included $165 billion in OCO funding, with $98 billion intended for base budget purposes. P.L. 116-93 funded a modest increase in active-duty military personnel but also included a reduction of 7,500 in the Army's end-strength due to not meeting higher goals. The FY2020 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 116-93) funded a 3.1% increase in military basic pay and appropriated $61.7 million for DOD's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office. It also included a reduction of 7,500 in the Army's end-strength and in the Selected Reserve. The FY2020 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 116-93) funded a 3.1% increase in military basic pay and allocated $61.7 million for DOD's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office. Additionally, it provided $35.0 million for the Special Victims' Counsel program and $3.0 million for a pilot program for treating military personnel with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder related to sexual trauma. The FY2020 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 116-93) allocated $110 million for DOD's childcare program, the largest in the US, serving 200,000 children. Congress required a detailed report on increasing capacity and a top 50 priority list. The Committee report on S. 2474 requires the Secretary of Defense to provide Congress with a detailed report on DOD's childcare system, including plans to increase capacity and a prioritized list of the top 50 childcare center construction requirements. P.L. 116-93 supports the Administration's FY2020 budget request for modernizing nuclear and long-range strike weapons, with a focus on the nuclear triad. The text discusses the development of hypersonic weapons as part of the nuclear triad, which includes submarines, bombers, and ICBMs. The Department of Defense has been funding the development of these weapons since the early 2000s. The Department of Defense has been funding the development of hypersonic weapons since the early 2000s. Due to reports of China and Russia developing similar weapons, hypersonic weapons were identified as an R&D priority in the FY2019 budget request. Congress has been providing funding to accelerate the U.S. hypersonic program, with the FY2020 budget request continuing this trend. Congress also supported the development of defenses against hypersonic missiles in the enacted FY2020 defense appropriations bill. The FY2020 defense appropriations bill provided significant funding for the development of defenses against hypersonic missiles, including the creation of a Joint Hypersonics Transition Office. Concerns were raised about potential duplication of effort and increased costs due to the rapid growth in funding for hypersonic weapons development. House and Senate negotiators are concerned about the rapid growth in funding for hypersonic weapons development leading to duplication of effort and increased costs. P.L. 116-93 supports strengthening defenses against ballistic missile attacks, including ICBMs and shorter-range missiles. The missile defense budget request aligns with the Administration's Missile Defense Review. P.L. 116-93 shifted funding among various components compared to the Administration's budget request. The Administration's budget request for missile defense was adjusted in P.L. 116-93 due to the cancellation of the Replacement Kill Vehicle program. $515.0 million was allocated for developing an improved interceptor missile. The act provides $515.0 million for developing an improved interceptor missile to replace the Ground-Based Interceptors (GBIs). Additionally, $285 million is allocated for more GBI missiles and support equipment, and $180 million for R&D to enhance GBI reliability. Congress also approved funding for military space satellites and satellite launches, including $40.0 million for the operation of the newly created Space Force. Congress approved $40.0 million for the operation of the newly created Space Force, which was 44% less than the requested amount. The Secretary of the Air Force was directed to provide a monthly spending plan for Space Force funding in FY2020. Additionally, the act supported the Army's plan to upgrade its fleet of ground-combat vehicles. The FY2020 Space Force O&M funding plan was approved by Congress, with a focus on upgrading the Army's ground-combat vehicles. One notable change was the provision of 30% more funding than requested to enhance the firepower of the Stryker troop-carrier by replacing its .50 caliber machine gun with a 30 mm cannon. This decision reflects mixed congressional support for the Army's strategy in developing new combat capabilities. The Army's strategy for developing new combat capabilities receives mixed congressional support. Future budgets will fund new programs by cutting back on upgrades for existing systems like Bradley fighting vehicles and CH-47 Chinook helicopters. Planned upgrades to legacy systems will be delayed to prioritize investments in new systems. The Army's proposed budget cuts for upgrades to Bradley fighting vehicles and CH-47 Chinook helicopters have received mixed congressional support. The enacted appropriations bill provides less funding than requested for Bradley upgrades, while nearly tripling the amount requested for the Chinook upgrade. The cut in Bradley funding was deemed \"excess to need\" by the Explanatory Statement. The enacted appropriations bill provided $46.2 million for Chinook upgrades, exceeding the $18.2 million requested. The bill also allocated $205.6 million for the Optionally-Manned Fighting Vehicle program, out of the $378.4 million requested, challenging the Army's plan to forego upgrades to the existing CH-47 fleet. The enacted appropriations bill provided $205.6 million for the Optionally-Manned Fighting Vehicle program, out of the $378.4 million requested. The Army cancelled the OMFV contracting plan and restarted it with new design parameters. The FY2020 budget request included a planned upgrade for the Army's CH-47 Chinook helicopter, which the Army wanted to curtail to free up funds for modernization. The Army had projected a $46.4 million request for procurement of improved \"Block II\" CH-47s. The Army initially planned to request $46.4 million for the procurement of improved \"Block II\" CH-47s in late 2019. However, the amended FY2020 request was reduced to $18.2 million, leading to a shortfall in funding. The enacted FY2020 defense bill provided $46.2 million for the program, while also allocating $985.5 million for eight F-15s to address gaps in Air Force fighter strength due to delays in the F-35A Joint Strike Fighter program. The FY2020 defense bill allocated $1.05 billion for eight F-15s to address Air Force fighter strength gaps caused by delays in the F-35A program. Some funds were shifted to R&D for testing purposes. The Secretary of the Air Force was directed to review options for reducing the fighter shortfall. P.L. 116-93 also supported major elements of the Navy's shipbuilding budget request. The FY2020 defense bill allocated funds for addressing Air Force fighter strength gaps and directed the Secretary of the Air Force to review options for reducing the shortfall. P.L. 116-93 supports major elements of the Navy's shipbuilding budget request, including funds for unmanned surface and subsurface ships to increase the fleet size to 355 ships. The act departed from the budget request on two issues involving over $1 billion each. The FY2020 defense bill allocated funds for addressing Air Force fighter strength gaps and supported major elements of the Navy's shipbuilding budget request. The act departed from the budget request by reallocating funds for Virginia-class submarines to incorporate the Virginia Payload Module. Additionally, it provided funds for specialized ships and a landing craft. The FY2020 defense bill allocated funds for addressing Air Force fighter strength gaps and supported major elements of the Navy's shipbuilding budget request. It provided $1.2 billion for specialized ships and a landing craft to support amphibious landings by Marine Corps units. The bill also included vertical launch tubes for storing and launching additional Tomahawk missiles or other payloads.
