    "content": "The \"Farmers Tax Deferral Act\" allows for the nontaxable exchange of qualified agricultural property for real property under section 1046 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. No gain or loss recognized for qualified person receiving US real property in exchange for qualified agricultural property. Qualified person defined as individual age 55+, corporation owned by individuals 55+, or partnership/trust/estate with all beneficial interests owned by individuals 55+. In paragraph (1), any partnership, trust, or estate with all beneficial interests owned by individuals described in paragraph (1) is included in the definition of qualified agricultural property. This includes single purpose agricultural or horticultural structures placed in service by the taxpayer more than 20 years before the transfer date, as well as real property, equipment, or fixtures. The exchange described in subsection (a) involves transferring structures and related real property, equipment, or fixtures. United States real property refers to property located in the United States. Any property received by the taxpayer must be identified and the exchange completed within 180 days. The taxpayer must identify exchanged property within 45 days and complete the exchange within 180 days to be treated as non-real property. The taxpayer must identify exchanged property within 45 days and complete the exchange within 180 days to be treated as non-real property. Rules similar to section 1031 apply for basis, exchanges not solely in kind, and related parties. Transactions described in this section are treated similarly to section 1031 exchanges for tax purposes. Transactions involving qualified agricultural property are subject to special rules for like-kind exchanges. This includes deferring ordinary income recapture until the disposition of the real property acquired in the exchange. Qualified agricultural property must be defined as per section 1046(c) for these rules to apply. If a property defined in section 1046(c) is sold without recognizing gain under section 1046, the transferor's gain under subsection (a)(1) is limited to the sum of recognized gain on the sale and the fair market value of property acquired. The fair market value of property acquired in an exchange under section 1046 is not taken into account unless it is United States real property or section 1245 property. If the transferee disposes of United States real property acquired in the exchange, the ordinary income recapture is limited to the excess of the recognized gain on the sale and the fair market value of the property acquired. When property acquired in an exchange under section 1046 is disposed of by the transferee, the recapture is limited to the excess of the amount realized over the adjusted basis of the property. When qualified agricultural property is sold, the gain treated as ordinary income is the excess over the amount of gain if the property were sold at fair market value. When qualified agricultural property is sold, the excess gain over fair market value is treated as ordinary income, regardless of other provisions in the tax code. The effective date for these amendments is specified in subsection (a). The amendments made by this Act apply to transfers and dispositions after its enactment date. SEC. 3. SPECIAL RULES FOR INSTALLMENT SALES OF QUALIFIED AGRICULTURAL PROPERTY. Special rule for qualified agricultural property in installment sales under section 453 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Income from installment sales of qualified agricultural property under section 453 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is recognized under the installment method. Income recognized in a taxable year is treated as recapture income in proportion to the total recapture income from the sale. The amendments made by this section apply to sales after the enactment of this Act, with changes to the recapture income calculation for installment sales of qualified agricultural property under section 453 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986."
