    "content": "Both chambers of Congress passed legislation reauthorizing FDA programs and expanding its authority. The bills are S. 1082 and H.R. 2900, the most comprehensive FDA legislation since 1997. The primary focus is renewing FDA's authority for key user fee programs. The legislation renews FDA's authority for key user fee programs, PDUFA and MDUFMA, set to expire in FY2007. FDA urged Congress to reauthorize before August 1, 2007, to avoid layoffs. FDA is using reserve funds to prevent layoffs, resulting in a hiring freeze. The FDA is using reserve funds to prevent layoffs and a hiring freeze due to funding uncertainty. The bills also reauthorize key authorities related to pediatric pharmaceuticals. The FDA Commissioner has expressed concerns about the impact on employee morale. The FDA regulates the safety of human foods, animal feeds, cosmetics, drugs, biologics, medical devices, and animal drugs. Products must be reviewed and approved by the FDA before they can be sold, with postmarket surveillance also conducted. The FDA regulates the safety of various products and conducts premarket approval before they can be sold. Postmarket surveillance is also carried out. FDA has the authority to withdraw unsafe products from commerce. Congressional attention has been drawn to FDA's performance and funding due to media coverage of safety issues related to food, drugs, and medical devices. The FDA's regulation of products like food, drugs, and medical devices has raised concerns in Congress about its performance and funding. The key issue for Congress is balancing the agency's role in speeding safe products to market while ensuring they are effective and removing unsafe products. The FDA's ability to ensure product safety and protect public health is a key issue, with Congress authorizing the collection of user fees from manufacturers to speed up product approval. Efforts to reauthorize user fee authorities (PDUFA and MDUFMA) are underway, despite some questioning the agency's reliance on fees from regulated companies. Efforts are underway to reauthorize user fee authorities (PDUFA and MDUFMA) for the FDA, which generate a significant portion of the agency's revenue. PDUFA is expected to generate $339,195,000, and MDUFMA $47,500,000 in FY2008, accounting for 87% of FDA's user fee revenue and 19% of its total budget. PDUFA and MDUFMA are user fee authorities that provide a significant portion of the FDA's revenue. PDUFA, enacted in 1992, allows the FDA to collect fees from drug companies for new product applications. MDUFMA, established in 2002, does the same for medical device applications. MDUFMA, enacted in 2002, set user fees for FDA's medical device application reviews and included performance goals. It allowed third-parties for inspections and added regulations for reprocessed single-use devices. Expiring authorities include user fees and performance goals. Researchers often avoided testing drugs on children in clinical trials for safety reasons. In 1997, Congress passed BPCA to encourage pediatric drug research by offering extended marketing exclusivity in exchange for trials investigating a drug's effect on children. This aimed to address the lack of information on appropriate dosage levels and potential side effects of \"adult\" medications in pediatric populations. FDA's attempts to require assessments of new drugs on children were initially halted by the courts. BPCA and PREA provide incentives and requirements for studying pediatric use of drugs, including marketing exclusivity. Developing medical devices for children is less profitable due to fewer patients and unique physical attributes. Developing pediatric medical devices is more challenging than for adults due to fewer patients and unique physical attributes. There is a critical need for pediatric medical devices to diagnose and treat children's diseases. Legislation offers incentives for manufacturers to create pediatric devices and gives FDA authority to require postmarket studies for safety and efficacy. The FDA has the authority to require postmarket studies for approved pediatric devices to ensure their safety and efficacy. Adverse effects of medical products may not be apparent until a product is on the market, either due to long-term effects or rarity of the adverse effects. This can require a large population to use a drug before certain adverse effects are recognized. The FDA has the authority to require postmarket studies for approved pediatric devices to ensure their safety and efficacy. A large proportion of people may need to use a drug before certain adverse effects are recognized. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to strengthen the FDA's data collection system and provide new authorities for FDA to take action on identified issues. Medical journals tend to publish positive clinical trial results, while manufacturers may be hesitant to disclose unsuccessful outcomes. In 2004, questions were raised about the safety and effectiveness of FDA-approved biomedical products due to undisclosed negative trial results. This led to a push for public access to negative trial results, reflected in provisions in S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 for the public registration and posting of clinical trials. The push for public access to negative trial results gained traction with provisions in S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 for public registration and posting of clinical trials. FDA utilizes advisory committees for independent advice on drugs, devices, and food, with recommendations that may or may not be followed. Committees are suggested to be free from conflicts of interest for credibility and usefulness. In 2006 and 2007, reports surfaced about FDA advisory committees being biased towards drug approval and having members with conflicts of interest. Legislation such as S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aims to address conflicts of interest among advisory committee members. The year 2000 saw a decline in new drug submissions globally, prompting questions despite advancements in biomedical sciences. The year 2000 marked a slowdown in new drug submissions globally. FDA investigated the decline in innovative medical products and called for modernizing scientific tools to evaluate candidate medical products. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 propose addressing conflicts of interest among advisory committee members. The creation of a Reagan-Udall Foundation is proposed to support the FDA in evaluating and predicting the safety, effectiveness, and manufacturability of medical products. The high cost of prescription drugs in the US has led some consumers to seek medications from foreign sources, but current regulations only permit importation by the manufacturer. The law prohibits drug importation from foreign sources not subject to FDA regulations. Some lawmakers aim to allow access to lower-priced medications by regulating importation. S. 1082 includes a title to permit and oversee prescription drug importation, with an amendment requiring the Secretary of HHS to certify the program's safety and cost-effectiveness. The FDA has regulated food safety since 1906, evolving its authority over time to address food-related issues. Recent outbreaks of foodborne illnesses have prompted congressional focus on food safety. Several recent outbreaks of foodborne illness have raised concerns about food safety, leading to congressional attention on the issue. The FDA reauthorization and reform bills address key issues in food safety, with some differences in approach. (See Table 1 for comparison). The report includes descriptions of FDA programs covered in the bills, as well as programs considered but not included, and links to relevant CRS reports. The report contains descriptions of key FDA programs addressed in the bills, including prescription drug user fees, medical device user fees, pediatric drugs and devices, drug safety, clinical trials databases, conflicts of interest, importation of prescription drugs, and more. FDA's authority to collect user fees under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act will expire on October 1, 2007, unless Congress reauthorizes it. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) will expire on October 1, 2007, unless Congress reauthorizes it. PDUFA provides FDA with fees from pharmaceutical manufacturers to speed up the review process for new products. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) established a mechanism for agency-industry collaboration to set performance goals for review times. Application review times decreased, and fee revenue raised the level of premarket review activities. Congress gave FDA limited authority to use fees for postmarket drug safety activities in reauthorizations. Discussions for a 2007 reauthorization (PDUFA IV) focused on postmarket drug safety due to recent safety problems with marketed drugs. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900, as part of the 2007 PDUFA IV reauthorization discussions, focus on postmarket drug safety. They propose reauthorizing fees for application, establishment, and product fees for both prescription and nonprescription drugs. The bills expand the use of fees for postmarket safety activities, including adverse event data. The Senate and House bills, part of the 2007 PDUFA IV reauthorization discussions, aim to enhance postmarket drug safety by expanding fee usage for activities like adverse event data collection. Both bills would increase adverse event reporting requirements to the HHS Secretary and the public, with fee revenues set at $393 million annually. Adjustments for inflation and workload would also be made. The House and Senate bills for the 2007 PDUFA IV reauthorization aim to enhance postmarket drug safety by expanding fee usage for activities like adverse event data collection. The bills propose adjustments for inflation, workload, and rent costs, as well as exempting certain orphan drugs from fees. Additionally, a new section would authorize fees for advisory review of drug advertisements, with voluntary pre-release review for manufacturers. The Senate bill for the 2007 PDUFA IV reauthorization would codify core elements of the prescription drug user fee program, including voluntary pre-release review of drug advertisements by manufacturers. Manufacturers requesting reviews would be subject to new fees, such as an advisory review fee and an operating reserve fee. The bill would also require the Secretary to submit annual reports to Congress and consult for the next PDUFA reauthorization. The Senate bill for the 2007 PDUFA IV reauthorization would require the Secretary to submit annual performance and fiscal reports to Congress. It would also mandate consultations with various stakeholders to develop recommendations for PDUFA V, including goals and plans. Additionally, the bill would necessitate a public hearing and review of the Secretary's recommendations for setting performance goals. The Senate bill for the 2007 PDUFA IV reauthorization would require the Secretary to submit annual performance and fiscal reports to Congress. It would also mandate consultations with stakeholders to develop recommendations for PDUFA V, including goals and plans. The House bill would have similar reauthorization and reporting requirements but would not amend the FFDCA. It would also require the Secretary to make negotiation minutes publicly available before presenting recommendations to Congress. The Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002 introduced user fees for premarket device reviews, allowed third-party inspections, and imposed new regulations for reprocessed single-use devices. FDA's authority to collect user fees will expire in 2007 unless reauthorized by Congress. The FDA's authority to collect user fees for medical device approvals will expire in 2007 unless reauthorized by Congress under new regulatory requirements. This is proposed in S. 1082 (Title III) and H.R. 2900 (Title II), which also include provisions related to medical device regulation. The FDA's authority to collect user fees for medical devices is set to expire in 2007 unless reauthorized by Congress. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 propose reauthorization through FY2012, with provisions for fee amounts, fee increases, and new types of fees. Government entities would be exempt from certain fees, with the possibility of fee increases in FY2010. H.R. 2900 proposes extending the waiver of establishment fees to Indian tribes and allowing the Secretary to increase the fee amount by up to 8.5% in FY2010. Both bills would require a certain amount of medical device-related direct appropriations for the Secretary to assess fees and meet performance goals. Fees collected exceeding the authorized appropriation would be subtracted from future fees authorized. The bills would amend provisions regarding fees collected for medical devices, allowing for aggregation of fees between FY2008 and FY2011. A reduction in fees would only occur if the amount collected in a four-year period exceeded the authorized amount. H.R. 2900 would also authorize specific appropriations for postmarket safety information review on medical devices. The bills would amend provisions for postmarket safety information on medical devices, including changes to fee amounts and qualifications for small businesses. Both bills would reduce fees for small businesses, remove asset considerations for small business qualification, and allow foreign firms to qualify as small businesses. Additionally, a new refund policy for withdrawn modular applications would be implemented. The bills aim to amend postmarket safety information on medical devices, including fee changes and small business qualifications. They would reduce fees for small businesses, remove asset considerations for qualification, and allow foreign firms to qualify. A new refund policy for withdrawn modular applications would be established, with the Secretary having sole authority for refund decisions. Annual reports would be required through FY2012, with H.R. 2900 including postmarket safety activity information and S. 1082 requiring public reports on previous cohorts of medical device applications. S. 1082 would require public reports on previous cohorts of medical device applications and consultation with various groups in developing performance goal recommendations. The recommendations would be revised based on public comments, transmitted to Congress, and consultation requirements would be written into the FFDCA. H.R. 2900 and S. 1082 would amend medical device regulation, with user fee provisions taking effect on different dates. H.R. 2900 requires a study on nosocomial infections, while both bills contain parallel provisions for consultation and recommendations. H.R. 2900 and S. 1082 would extend the authority for third-party review of premarket notifications until FY2012. They also include provisions to streamline requirements for inspections by accredited third parties and allow device companies to submit reports assessing conformance with international quality standards voluntarily. The bills H.R. 2900 and S. 1082 would allow device companies to voluntarily submit reports by third parties assessing conformance with international quality standards. They would also restrict the registration period for device producers to between October 1 and December 31 of each year. The bills H.R. 2900 and S. 1082 aim to reduce the registration period for device producers to once per year between October 1 and December 31. They also propose electronic filing as the default option, with S. 1082 requiring feasibility of electronic information receipt. FDA-approved products for adults are often prescribed off-label for children based on assumptions of safety and effectiveness. Off-label prescribing of FDA-approved products for adults to children can lead to ineffective treatment or improper dosing due to differences in metabolism and development. The Better Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) aims to address this issue by providing drug manufacturers with guidelines for pediatric drug development. The Better Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) incentivizes drug manufacturers to conduct pediatric studies by extending market exclusivity. It also identifies off-patent products needing pediatric studies for safety and effectiveness, with NIH funding available for these studies. The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) incentivizes pediatric studies for off-patent products and reauthorizes exclusivity provisions for on-patent drugs. FDA mandates pediatric testing data submission for new drug applications. The Pediatric Rule required pediatric testing data submission for new drug applications, but was declared invalid in 2002. The Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003 (PREA) gave FDA authority for pediatric assessments without a specific sunset date. The Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003 (PREA) gave FDA authority for pediatric assessments without a specific sunset date. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 would reauthorize BPCA for another five years, encourage research on off-patent products, strengthen labeling requirements based on pediatric studies, and report adverse events. A key difference is the period of exclusivity, with H.R. 2900 keeping it at six months and S. 1082 reducing it to three months for drugs with over $1 billion in annual gross U.S. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to expand FDA's authority under PREA by strengthening standards for pediatric assessments of new drugs and biologics. H.R. 2900 eliminates the tie between PREA's authorities and BPCA authorization, while S. 1082 maintains this connection. Additionally, S. 1082 would reduce the period of exclusivity for drugs with over $1 billion in annual gross U.S. sales to three months. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to expand FDA's authority under PREA by strengthening standards for pediatric assessments of new drugs and biologics. H.R. 2900 eliminates the tie between PREA's authorities and BPCA authorization, while S. 1082 maintains this connection. Both bills also incorporate legislation to encourage medical device manufacturers to develop pediatric products, including amending the humanitarian device exemption (HDE) under FFDCA. The legislation aims to exempt manufacturers of pediatric devices for small populations from proving effectiveness, encouraging the development of medical devices for rare diseases. This exemption allows marketing without demonstrating effectiveness, only safety, and waives certain application fees. The bills S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to extend the exemption for selling pediatric medical devices beyond costs of research and development. They also require the NIH Director to designate a contact point for funding pediatric medical device research. Both bills, S. 1082 and H.R. 2900, aim to expand pediatric medical device research and development funding. They require collaboration between the FDA Commissioner and other agency heads to submit a plan to relevant congressional committees. The bills also mandate the establishment of a demonstration project to promote pediatric device development, focusing on connecting innovators with manufacturers, managing the device development process, and providing business assistance. Coordination with NIH and FDA is required, with S. 1082 also mandating grantees to report. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to expand pediatric medical device research and development funding. They require collaboration between the FDA Commissioner and other agency heads to submit a plan to relevant congressional committees. The bills mandate the establishment of a demonstration project to promote pediatric device development, focusing on connecting innovators with manufacturers, managing the device development process, and providing business assistance. Coordination with NIH and FDA is required, with S. 1082 also mandating grantees to report their effectiveness, impact, and device development status annually. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to expand pediatric medical device research and development funding. They require collaboration between the FDA Commissioner and other agency heads to submit a plan to relevant congressional committees. The bills also amend the FFDCA to incorporate postmarket surveillance measures for pediatric medical devices. H.R. 2900 includes provisions for pediatric populations, allowing for extended studies beyond the general 36-month limit to assess device impact on growth and development. It also includes a dispute resolution provision for manufacturers. Since the 1938 passage of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, FDA requires drug manufacturers to demonstrate safety and effectiveness before approval for marketing in the US. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act of 1992 maintains focus on premarket review, but FDA acknowledges that no drug can be completely safe due to rare adverse effects or unrecognized associations with common conditions. FDA evaluates if a drug is safe enough based on available information. The FDA cannot guarantee the complete safety of any drug, but evaluates if it is safe enough based on available information. Recent research has shown that some widely used drugs may be more dangerous than previously known. Concerns have been raised about the industry's transparency regarding potential risks and the FDA's authority and resources in regulating drug safety. The FDA faced challenges with industry transparency and its own authority in regulating drug safety. In response, the Institute of Medicine conducted a 2006 report on the agency's organizational culture, science, regulation, communication, and resources. Efforts were made by consumers, health experts, and Congress to enhance FDA's actions for public protection through bills like S. 1082 and H.R. 2900. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to enhance FDA's ability to identify and address postmarket drug safety issues through new authorities and partnerships. Both bills require the Secretary to establish public-private partnerships for a risk identification system using electronic databases. The Senate and House bills propose a strengthened authority and set of procedures to support FDA's postmarket safety activities, including the implementation of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) to require postmarket studies for drugs on the market. The House and Senate bills propose a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) to support FDA's postmarket safety activities. The bills differ on the criteria for requiring a REMS, with the House bill calling for pre-approval to ensure benefits outweigh risks, and the Secretary could require a REMS after approval based on new safety information. The Senate bill requires the Secretary to determine if a REMS is necessary based on a serious risk signal with the drug. This authority covers new indications for approved products and generic product marketing. All REMS must include core elements and timeframes as required by the Secretary. The Senate bill requires REMS for generic product marketing, with core elements and timeframes mandated by the Secretary. It allows waivers for certain medical countermeasures during public health emergencies and creates a mechanism for off-label use of drugs for serious conditions. Most REMS elements align with current FDA practices. The proposed REMS process in S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 would add structured follow-through, dispute resolution, and enforcement authority. Both bills require reviews of approved REMS at specified times and establish a Drug Safety Oversight Board. The Senate and House bills propose establishing a Drug Safety Oversight Board to resolve disputes between the Secretary and a product's sponsor. They require evaluation of REMS elements for safe drug use and potential burdens on the healthcare system. The bills also authorize postapproval studies or trials, with differing criteria for necessity. Both Senate and House bills propose establishing a Drug Safety Oversight Board to resolve disputes between the Secretary and a product's sponsor. They differ on the criteria for determining the necessity of postapproval studies or clinical trials. The Senate bill requires assessment of serious risks with drug use or unexpected serious risks in a population, while the House bill authorizes postapproval studies based on scientific information to assess known risks or signals of serious risk. The Senate bill proposes authorizing the Secretary to require postapproval studies to assess known risks, signals of serious risk, or identify serious risks. It also includes a process for sponsors and the Secretary to notify each other of new safety information for drug labeling changes. If there is disagreement, a multi-level process involving meetings, dispute review, and recommendations by the Drug Safety Oversight Board is set up, with the Secretary having the authority to order safety labeling changes if necessary. The House bill and the Senate bill both propose authorizing the Secretary to order safety labeling changes based on new information. Both bills include time limits, a dispute resolution procedure, and the requirement for certain advertisements to be submitted for review before dissemination. Both the House and Senate bills propose giving the Secretary the authority to order safety labeling changes based on new information. They also require certain advertisements to be submitted for review before dissemination, with the House bill specifying television ads and the Senate bill referring to all advertisements without media distinction. Both bills mandate a clear presentation of side effects and contraindications, and allow the Secretary to impose civil monetary penalties for violations, including fines of up to $250,000 per violation. Both bills propose new enforcement tools for the FDA, including fines of up to $250,000 per violation. The House bill also includes additional civil penalties of up to $10 million per violation if non-compliance continues after notice. The Secretary could fine sponsors up to $1 million per day for violations posing a substantial threat to public health. The House and Senate bills propose new enforcement tools for the FDA, including fines for non-compliance with REMS and false DTC ads. The House bill sets fines up to $250,000 for first violations and up to $500,000 for subsequent violations. The Senate bill authorizes fines up to $150,000 for violations. Both the House and Senate bills propose fines for violations, with the House bill setting fines up to $250,000 for first violations and up to $500,000 for subsequent violations, while the Senate bill authorizes fines up to $150,000 for violations. Both bills also authorize increased appropriations for drug safety provisions, with the Senate bill increasing revenue allowed under PDUFA by $225 million over FYs 2008 through 2012 for drug safety activities. The Senate bill proposes increasing revenue under PDUFA by $225 million over FYs 2008-2012 for drug safety activities, while the House bill authorizes $125 million for the same period. Additionally, the House bill requires guidance for clinical trials of antibiotic drugs, a public meeting on orphan antibiotic products, and $30 million annually for orphan drug development grants. The Senate bill considers antibiotics as orphan products and authorizes $35 million for this purpose. The Senate bill proposes $35 million annually for orphan drug development grants, considers antibiotics as orphan products, and includes provisions for antibiotic access and innovation. It also requires standardized packaging for prescription drugs. The House bill focuses on developing standards and evaluating technologies to secure the distribution system. The House bill focuses on developing standards and evaluating technologies to secure the distribution system against counterfeit, diverted, or substandard prescription drugs. It also includes provisions for drug safety, such as requiring DTC ads to include information on reporting adverse effects to the FDA. The Senate bill on drug safety includes provisions for establishing an Advisory Committee on Risk Communication and requiring state-legalized medical marijuana to adhere to FDA regulations. Reporting adverse effects of prescription drugs to the FDA is encouraged. The Senate bill includes provisions for FDA regulation of state-legalized medical marijuana and the creation of a priority review voucher for neglected or tropical disease products. The FDA Commissioner would also be required to publish a list of authorized generic drugs and establish a procedure to prevent delays from certain citizen petitions. The FDA Commissioner would create a list of authorized generic drugs and establish a procedure to prevent delays from certain citizen petitions. Clinical trial registration requirements were established by the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 for drugs treating serious or life-threatening diseases, available online at clinicaltrials.gov. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 propose expanding clinical trial registration to include all trials for drugs, devices, and biologics, not just those for life-threatening conditions, and require publication of trial results. This would also cover international trials seeking FDA approval. H.R. 2900 and S. 1082 aim to broaden clinical trial registration to encompass all trials involving drugs, devices, and biologics, including international trials seeking FDA approval. H.R. 2900 delays the public release of medical device information until FDA approval, while S. 1082 exempts pediatric postmarket surveillance trials from registry requirements and allows voluntary registration for certain trials. Both bills tie specific requirements to the trial's completion date. Both H.R. 2900 and S. 1082 aim to broaden clinical trial registration to include all drug, device, and biologic trials, with specific requirements linked to the trial's completion date. H.R. 2900 requires the principal investigator to have control over data and publication rights to serve as the responsible party, while both bills expand the information to be included in the registry and made public online. Both H.R. 2900 and S. 1082 aim to expand clinical trial registration to include all drug, device, and biologic trials. H.R. 2900 requires the principal investigator to have control over data and publication rights to serve as the responsible party. Both bills would mandate specific information to be included in the registry, made public online, and searchable in specific ways. H.R. 2900 includes additional requirements such as disclosing agreements restricting non-employees from discussing or publishing trial results. Both H.R. 2900 and S. 1082 aim to expand clinical trial registration to include all drug, device, and biologic trials. H.R. 2900 requires updates to be submitted to the registry every six months until trial results are submitted. S. 1082 specifies additional criteria for the registry, including the age group studied, and a timeline for making registry information public. Both H.R. 2900 and S. 1082 aim to expand clinical trial registration to include all drug, device, and biologic trials. H.R. 2900 provides specific instructions for the creation of a public database containing the results of clinical trials, including searchable categories, timing of submissions, and the requirement for truthful and regularly updated information. In contrast, S. 1082 would require the Secretary to create a database through rulemaking based on NIH Director recommendations. H.R. 2900 specifies searchable categories, timing of submissions, and truthfulness for a public database of clinical trial results. The requirement for non-promotional summaries was removed, replaced by a study on promotional content. Results must be made public within 30 days of certain events. The bill H.R. 2900 mandates that clinical trial results be made public within 30 days of specific events, such as the issuance of a not substantially equivalent (NSE) letter by the Secretary regarding a medical device. This requirement could lead to the disclosure of clinical trial information even if FDA action on the device is still pending. Additionally, a provision for studies on new uses of drugs or devices allows for a posting delay of up to two years by the manufacturer. The provision in H.R. 2900 allows for a posting delay of up to two years for studies on new uses of drugs or devices already on the market. Compliance, enforcement, and coordination provisions are included in both H.R. 2900 and S. 1082, with H.R. 2900 also addressing enforcement of results database requirements and coordination between registry and results database. S. 1082 would enforce registry requirements for FDA applications and prohibit noncompliant trials. It dropped a controversial provision from H.R. 2900 regarding legal effects on state law causes of action. Penalties and enforcement mechanisms for registry requirements are not specified in current law. Both H.R. 2900 and S. 1082 propose penalties for noncompliance with FDA registry requirements. H.R. 2900 allows penalties of $10,000 per day, capping at $15,000 for individuals and nonprofits, while S. 1082 allows $10,000 for a first violation and up to $20,000 for subsequent violations. Enforcement provisions differ between the two bills. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 propose penalties for noncompliance with FDA registry requirements, with penalties of $10,000 for a first violation and up to $20,000 for subsequent violations. The bills also address conflicts of interest in FDA advisory committees, requiring committee members to disclose conflicts and refrain from voting or participating in certain circumstances. The law governing conflicts of interest in FDA advisory committees requires members to disclose conflicts and refrain from voting or participating in certain circumstances. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 propose changes to the recruitment process for committee members and conflict-of-interest waiver processes. The proposed changes in S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to alter the recruitment process for FDA advisory committee members and the granting of conflict-of-interest waivers. These changes would expand the scope of requirements to all advisory committees, not just drug and biologic ones. Financial interests are defined as employment, trusteeship, or directorship under 18 U.S.C. 208(a). The definition of financial interest under 18 U.S.C. 208(a) covers employment, trusteeship, or directorship activities. It does not apply to stock ownership or receipt of grants. An alternative definition in 21 U.S.C. 355(n) requires disclosure for drug and biologics committees, not medical device committees. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 would expand disclosure requirements for all advisory committees. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 would require advisory committee members to disclose full financial interests before meetings, with provisions to discourage financial conflict waivers. Both bills aim to recruit experts from academia, medical research institutions, and public interest groups, with H.R. 2900 allowing non-voting guest experts with financial interests if deemed necessary by the Secretary. The bills S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 mandate full financial disclosure for advisory committee members before meetings to prevent conflicts of interest. Voting by conflicted members is restricted unless exempted by the Office of Government Ethics, with a waiver allowed for essential expertise. Public disclosures for conflict-of-interest determinations, certifications, and waivers are required, along with annual reports on advisory committee membership and conflicts of interest. The bills S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 require full financial disclosure for advisory committee members to prevent conflicts of interest. They also mandate public disclosures for conflict-of-interest determinations, certifications, and waivers, along with annual reports on advisory committee membership and conflicts of interest. Additionally, both bills establish a nonprofit corporation to advance FDA's mission on product development, innovation, and safety, with the initial Board of Directors selecting appointed members from a National Academy of Sciences-provided candidate list. The bills S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 require full financial disclosure for advisory committee members to prevent conflicts of interest. They establish a nonprofit corporation to advance FDA's mission on product development, innovation, and safety. The Foundation would coordinate with federal programs, award grants, contracts, and other agreements to advance goals related to unmet needs. The Commissioner would transfer between $500,000 and $1,250,000 to the Foundation. The House and Senate bills aim to advance FDA's mission by establishing a nonprofit corporation and an Office of the Chief Scientist. S. 1082 includes provisions not found in H.R. 2900, such as allowing importation of prescription drugs by entities other than manufacturers. S. 1082 (Title VIII) in H.R. 2900 allows importation of prescription drugs by entities other than manufacturers, with detailed procedures for safety, cost savings, and program administration. The Senate added a provision that would only be effective if the HHS Secretary certified its implementation.
