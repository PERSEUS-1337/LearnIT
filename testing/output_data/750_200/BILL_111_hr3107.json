    "content": "The Act titled \"Stop Nuclear Assistance to State Sponsors of Terrorism Act of 2009\" is referred to as such. It includes findings related to the act. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was established in 1957 with the objectives of promoting atomic energy for peaceful purposes and preventing its use for military purposes. The United States is the largest financial contributor to the IAEA's regular budget. The United States is the largest financial contributor to the IAEA's Technical Cooperation Fund, which provides nuclear technical cooperation for peaceful purposes worldwide. The GAO found that the Department of State and IAEA do not limit technical cooperation assistance to countries designated as state sponsors of terrorism. Cuba, Iran, Sudan, and Syria received over $55 million in assistance from 1997 to 2007, with over $4.4 million in 2008. Proliferation concerns about the Technical Cooperation Program have persisted. The GAO report found that over $4.4 million in technical cooperation assistance was provided to Cuba, Iran, Sudan, and Syria in 2008. Proliferation concerns persist due to the dual-use nature of nuclear equipment and technology. Additionally, three projects in Iran were directly related to the nuclear power plant at Bushehr. The GAO report in 2007 highlighted proliferation concerns related to the Technical Cooperation Program, specifically in Iran's nuclear power plant at Bushehr. The United States faces challenges in identifying and resolving these concerns due to limited information and policy shortcomings. The GAO report in 2007 highlighted proliferation concerns related to the Technical Cooperation Program, specifically in Iran's nuclear power plant at Bushehr. The report noted that IAEA does not exclude countries based on political considerations, and there are no good or bad countries in the program. The GAO report raised concerns about the Technical Cooperation Program, stating that the State Department cannot confidently assert that assistance has not supported weapons of mass destruction programs in U.S.-designated state sponsors of terrorism. The GAO report raised concerns about the Technical Cooperation Program, questioning the State Department's confidence in IAEA's safeguards to prevent assistance from contributing to weapons development in state sponsors of terrorism. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 prohibited funds for programs in Libya, Iran, Cuba, or the Palestine Liberation Organization. The Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1998 prohibited funds for IAEA programs in Cuba. The Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 required the US to withhold funding for IAEA projects in Cuba related to the Juragua Nuclear Power Plant. The GAO report recommended withholding funding to the IAEA for projects in Cuba related to the Juragua Nuclear Power Plant and the Pedro Pi Nuclear Research Center. Congress was urged to consider withholding future contributions to the Technical Cooperation Fund for countries of concern, aligning with a consistent U.S. policy towards such nations. The IAEA has reported Iran's violations of UN Security Council Resolutions by continuing heavy water projects and uranium enrichment. UN Resolution 1737 limits technical cooperation with Iran to food only. The IAEA has restricted technical cooperation with Iran to humanitarian purposes only, prohibiting support for proliferation-sensitive nuclear activities. Iran has approximately 7,000 centrifuges for uranium enrichment, with nearly 5,000 in operation and an increased stockpile of low-enriched uranium. Iran has around 7,000 centrifuges for enriching uranium, with almost 5,000 in operation and a stockpile of over 1,300 kilograms of low-enriched uranium. The IAEA Director General has raised concerns about possible military dimensions to Iran's nuclear program. The IAEA Director General has repeatedly reported that Iran has not implemented the Additional Protocol, which is necessary for credible assurance about undeclared nuclear material and activities. Iran has also not agreed to provide access to additional locations related to centrifuge manufacturing and research and development. The IAEA Director General reported Iran's lack of cooperation in providing access to locations related to centrifuge manufacturing, uranium enrichment research, and uranium mining, hindering progress on concerns about possible military dimensions of Iran's nuclear program. Iran has repeatedly refused to comply with IAEA resolutions regarding its nuclear program, blocking inspections of its facilities and violating its NPT Safeguards Agreement. Iran continues to block IAEA inspections of its nuclear facilities, denying access to the enrichment site at Natanz and refusing to place additional surveillance cameras. Additionally, in April 2008, it was revealed that Syria, with North Korea's assistance, was building a secret nuclear reactor at the Dair Alzour site. Syria, with North Korea's help, was constructing a secret nuclear reactor at Dair Alzour capable of producing plutonium for weapons. The reactor was destroyed in 2007 before becoming operational. General Hayden stated it could have produced enough plutonium for 1 or 2 bombs within a year. The Syrian reactor at Dair Alzour, with North Korea's assistance, could have produced enough plutonium for 1 or 2 bombs within a year of becoming operational. The IAEA Director General reported that the facility bore features of an undeclared nuclear reactor, and Syria had not provided requested documentation or agreed to visits to other locations. The IAEA Director General stated that limited information and access from Syria have hindered determining the nature of the destroyed facility at Dair Alzour. Uranium particles were found at the Miniature Neutron Source Reactor facility in Damascus, with particles of a unique type. The IAEA Director General mentioned limited information and access from Syria hindering the identification of the destroyed facility at Dair Alzour. Uranium particles were discovered at the Neutron Source Reactor facility in Damascus, which were not part of Syria's declared nuclear material inventory. SEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON THE USE OF FUNDS. No US funds to IAEA can support assistance to countries like North Korea that are state sponsors of terrorism or in breach of nuclear agreements or UN resolutions. The Secretary of State must withhold US voluntary contributions to the IAEA proportional to the amount spent by the IAEA on assistance to countries under investigation for breaching nuclear agreements or UN resolutions. The Secretary of State must withhold US voluntary contributions to the IAEA proportional to the amount spent by the IAEA on assistance to countries under investigation for breaching nuclear agreements or UN resolutions. If the specified amount is not withheld within 30 days, the US assessed contribution to the IAEA will be reduced by the same amount. SEC. 4. WAIVER. The provisions in subsections (b) and (c) of section 3 may be waived if the IAEA suspends assistance to countries in section 3(a) or if the President certifies these countries no longer pose a threat to US national security. SEC. 5. The President directs the US Representative to the IAEA to block funds for assistance to countries in section 3(a). SEC. 6. The President must report on the Act's implementation within six months. SEC. 7. Definitions. In this Act, \"appropriate congressional committees\" refer to specific committees in the House of Representatives and the Senate. \"State sponsor of terrorism\" is defined as a country determined by the Secretary of State for specific purposes. The term \"state sponsor of terrorism\" refers to a government identified by the Secretary of State for supporting acts of international terrorism."
