    "content": "The \"HIV Partner Protection Act\" is cited as the short title. It amends the Public Health Service Act to include a section on partner notification for HIV health care services. The \"HIV Partner Protection Act\" requires States to have laws or regulations in place for partner notification of individuals with HIV disease. This includes informing partners who may have been exposed to the disease. The \"HIV Partner Protection Act\" mandates health entities to confidentially report positive HIV test results to the State public health officer, including the individual's name. Partners are given the opportunity to learn if they have been exposed to HIV disease. The \"HIV Partner Protection Act\" allows partners to be informed about potential exposure to HIV without revealing the infected individuals' identities. Counseling and testing for HIV, including information on transmission and prevention, are provided to both partners and infected individuals. The \"HIV Partner Protection Act\" provides counseling, testing, and referrals for preventing transmission of HIV. Counseling includes information on therapeutic measures and prevention, referrals are given to partners and infected individuals, and notifications are provided in person. Notifications under subparagraph (A) are provided in person, unless it is an unreasonable burden on the State. There are no penalties for infected individuals who choose not to identify their partners or cooperate with the program. Similarly, there are no penalties for individuals who make errors in reporting or disclosing information in good faith. The State is not liable for failing to notify partners under the program. Health entities reporting the identity of infected individuals are not civilly liable. The State can provide notifications without the infected individual's consent. State insurance laws must prohibit insurers from taking action against individuals who undergo testing for HIV disease without their consent in order for a State to receive a grant under this part. State insurance laws prohibit insurers from taking action against individuals solely based on HIV testing. Definitions include 'infected individual' as someone with the disease. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 defines 'infected individual' as someone with HIV disease and 'partner' as individuals at risk of HIV disease through various means of exposure. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 defines 'infected individual' as someone with HIV disease and 'partner' as individuals at risk of HIV disease through exposure. The requirements for receiving a grant under this part apply for fiscal year 2001 and subsequent years for states with delayed legislative sessions in 1999 and 2000. The Secretary of Health and Human Services may provide grants to States to assist with the costs of implementing partner notification programs for HIV. $10,000,000 is authorized to be appropriated annually from 2000 to 2004 for this purpose."
