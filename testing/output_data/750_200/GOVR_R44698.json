    "content": "Poverty rates have been rising since 2000, with only three significant declines between 2000 and 2015. Policymakers are reexamining the causes of poverty and the effectiveness of policy responses. Discussions on poverty and public policy prompt questions about the demographics of poverty in the United States. The report provides a snapshot of who was poor in 2015 by selected demographic, economic, and social characteristics, showing that people in poverty are a diverse group of families and individuals at different stages of life. Special attention is given to the role of work in the lives of people who are poor. The role of work in the lives of people in poverty is crucial, as income from work impacts economic fortunes for working-age individuals, children, and the elderly. Living arrangements and family dynamics also play a significant role in economic well-being. The composition of people in poverty and their influence on economic well-being is examined in this report, focusing on different population groups rather than poverty rates. Family dynamics and living arrangements also impact economic well-being. A large population group like non-Hispanic whites may have low poverty rates, but due to their size in the overall population, they represent a significant share of the poverty population. Conversely, a smaller population like American Indians may have higher poverty rates, but they represent a smaller share of the poverty population. Both perspectives are relevant to public policy. For more information on poverty rates for different demographic groups and trends over time, refer to CRS Report R44644, Poverty in the United States in 2015: In Brief by [author name scrubbed]. Poverty is a lack of resources to meet basic needs, determined by the U.S. Census Bureau's official measure based on family income. Individual poverty status is influenced by the income of family members, whether related by birth, marriage, or adoption. If living alone or with non-relatives, individual poverty status is assessed based on personal income. The poverty status of an individual is determined by their income compared to a dollar threshold based on family composition. For example, in 2015, the poverty threshold for a single person was $12,331, and for a family of two adults and two children, it was $24,036. If income falls below these thresholds, the individual or family is considered poor. The poverty threshold for a family of two adults and two children was $24,036. The official poverty measure has limitations as it only considers pre-tax income and does not account for government taxes, non-cash benefits, or assets. The official poverty measure does not consider asset values, living cost differences, or modern family arrangements. The Census Bureau has a supplemental poverty measure that includes taxes, transfers, housing costs, and an expanded family definition. In 2015, an estimated 43.1 million people had pre-tax income below the poverty threshold, accounting for 13.5% of the total population. There is a focus on the very poor, known as \"deep poverty.\" In 2015, an estimated 19.4 million people, close to half of all in poverty, lived in deep poverty with income below 50% of the poverty threshold. The population in poverty included individuals of all ages, genders, and racial/ethnic groups. In 2015, the population living in poverty was divided into three age groups: children, working-age adults, and the aged. Children made up one-third of all people in poverty, with 14.5 million individuals. Working-age adults had the largest share of the poor population, but were under-represented compared to the overall population. In 2015, the poverty population was divided into three age groups: children, working-age adults, and the aged. Children comprised one-third of those in poverty. Working-age adults had the largest share of the poor population but were under-represented compared to the overall population. Non-Hispanic whites were the largest racial/ethnic group in both the total population and the poverty population. Non-Hispanic whites were the largest racial/ethnic group overall (61.4% of the total population) and represented the largest group within the poverty population (41.2%). Hispanics were the second largest group (17.8% of the total population) and represented 28.1% of those in poverty. Non-Hispanic African-Americans were the third largest group in both populations, with 12.3% in the total population and 22.0% in poverty. Minority groups were over-represented in the poverty population, including Hispanics, non-Hispanic African-Americans, non-Hispanic American Indians, and Alaska Natives. The poverty population is disproportionately represented by certain racial/ethnic groups, with Hispanics, non-Hispanic African-Americans, non-Hispanic American Indians, and Alaska Natives being over-represented. Children are more racially and ethnically diverse than adults, with minorities being over-represented in the poverty population across all age groups in 2015. In 2015, Hispanic children accounted for 36.3% of poor children, while non-Hispanic white children made up 51.4% of children overall. Women represented 55.9% of the population in poverty, possibly due to heading more single-parent households than men. Women are over-represented in the population in poverty, possibly due to heading more single-parent households. Men earn more than women on average, even with full-time year-round employment. Poverty has different policy implications for children, working-age adults, and aged adults. Children are dependents and policies affecting their family income generally apply to their parents or adult caretakers. Policies affecting family income and poverty status generally apply to parents or adult caretakers. Working-age adults are expected to work and support themselves and their children. Aged adults may retire and draw income from benefits based on past work. The report separately explores poverty among children, working-age adults, and aged adults, with work playing a central role in economic support. The central role of work in providing economic support for individuals and families is highlighted, with work being one's own, parents', or past work for retirement income. Living arrangements and the disproportionate poverty rate among children in America are also explored. Children in America are disproportionately poor, with a poverty rate of 19.7% in 2015. They rely on their parents or adult caretakers for support, often from their earnings. The number of adult workers in the family can exceed two, impacting the composition of poor children. In 2015, the majority of children in the total population lived in families with at least one adult earner, while two-thirds of poor children lived in families with one or more earners. Among poor families, 57.5% had one earner, and only 10.5% had two or more earners. In 2015, a majority of poor children lived in families with one earner (57.5%), while only 10.5% lived in families with two or more earners. Children in female-headed families accounted for a majority (54.1%) of all poor children. In 2015, children in female-headed families made up the majority (54.1%) of all poor children, while children in married couple families accounted for one-third (33%) of poor children. Despite a low poverty rate for children in married couple families, the large population size meant a significant number of poor children lived in this family type. Married-couple families were underrepresented among the population of poor children. Children in poverty are more likely to live in larger families, which require more income to meet needs. This results in larger families being more likely to be poor, despite most children living in families with earnings. Married-couple families are underrepresented among the population of poor children. In 2015, 27% of poor children were in families with four or more children, higher than the overall population. However, 45.4% of poor children were in families with one or two children. Working-age adults make up the majority of people in poverty in America. In 2015, the majority of people in poverty in America were working-age adults (18-64 years old), representing 56.6% of all individuals in poverty. Among this age group, 61.3% did not have earnings from work, despite the overall population showing that 76.2% had earnings from work. Among working-age adults in poverty in 2015, 38.8% were working in some capacity, with 10.4% working full-time all year. Reasons for not working included illness, caregiving, schooling, retirement, and other factors. Among non-working poor adults, reasons for not working included illness, caregiving, schooling, retirement, and inability to find a job. Educational attainment is linked to success in the workforce, with higher levels of education leading to higher earnings and more stable employment. Among working-age adults, those with a high school diploma but no post-secondary credential made up the largest group of poor individuals in 2015. This group accounted for 55.5% of poor working-age adults, while those without a high school diploma represented 25.1%. Education level is closely tied to employment success and income levels. Among working-age adults, those with only a high school diploma continue to represent the largest share of the poor population, even when excluding young adults. Family living arrangements were more prevalent in the overall population compared to the poor. A majority of both groups lived in families, with family living arrangements more common in the overall population (77.9%) than among the poor (58.8%). Working-age adults not living in families were disproportionately poor in 2015, with 41% of all working-age adults in poverty living outside of a family. This group included those living alone (18.1%), with cohabiting partners (11.7%), or other unrelated adults/roommates (11.4%). Determining the poverty status of individuals living outside of families but with others is complex. In 2015, aged adults were the least likely to live below the poverty line, accounting for 14.9% of the total population but only 9.7% in poverty. The poverty rate among aged adults was 8.8%. In 2015, aged adults accounted for 14.9% of the total population but only 9.7% in poverty. Work-related income, including Social Security, plays a key role in their economic well-being. In 2015, aged persons received work-related income such as Social Security and pensions, with Social Security benefiting a majority of aged persons in poverty. In 2015, retirement, disability, or survivor pensions were received by 48.5% of all aged persons, but only 7.7% of families of aged persons in poverty. Earnings from work were received by 40.7% of aged persons' families, with only 11.0% of families of aged persons in poverty receiving work earnings. Most aged adults in the total population lived in families with income derived from work, either past work with Social Security or pension income, or current work of the aged adult or a family member. Even among aged persons in poverty, almost three in four lived in families with work-derived income. Figure 14 illustrates aged adults living in poverty by living arrangement, an important consideration due to potential implications. In 2015, half of aged adults in poverty lived alone, significantly higher than the overall aged population. Aged adults in poverty were less likely to be living in families compared to the overall aged population. This report provides basic information on the 43 million Americans below the poverty line in 2015, showing they are not a homogenous group. In 2015, there were 43 million Americans living below the poverty line, showing they are a diverse group including children, working-age adults, and aged adults. Certain groups like women, minorities, and those living alone are over-represented among those in poverty. The report highlights the importance of income from work in determining poverty levels. The report emphasizes the significant role of income from work in determining poverty levels for various groups, including women, minorities, children, and individuals living alone. While for children, it is based on their parents' or family members' work, working-age adults' poverty status is generally determined by their own work. Aged adults, often retired, rely on past work or the work of those they live with to determine their poverty status. However, sometimes earnings from work are insufficient to prevent poverty, with two-thirds of children in poverty in 2015 coming from families with at least one working adult. In 2015, over 70% of elderly individuals in poverty had some form of work-based income. Federal policy interventions should consider the complex circumstances leading to poverty, including the role of work earnings."
