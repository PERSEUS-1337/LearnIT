    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"FERS Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Buyback Act of 2000\". It addresses the creditability of service. The \"FERS Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Buyback Act of 2000\" amends Section 8411(b) of title 5, United States Code to include service as a temporary or intermittent employee for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation between December 31, 1988, and June 30, 2000, of at least 1 year's duration for credit purposes. The amendment to Section 8411 of title 5, United States Code allows employees or Members to deposit service performed as a temporary or intermittent employee for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation between December 31, 1988, and June 30, 2000, of at least 1 year's duration for credit purposes. An employee or Member must deposit 1.3 percent of basic pay for service described in subsection (b)(6). Deposits made more than 5 years later must include interest. The deposit for temporary or intermittent service must include interest, compounded annually after the 5-year period. Failure to make the deposit in full will result in a reduction of the annuity based on the service. SEC. 3. PROVISIONS RELATING TO PERSONS WHO HAVE SEPARATED. The Office of Personnel Management will prescribe regulations for obtaining credit for service performed by individuals who have separated from Government service. Credit will only be given if a written application is submitted by December 31, 2001, as required by the regulations. Any annuity or survivor annuity payable at the time of application submission may be recomputed. Recomputation of annuity or survivor annuity is required when an application is submitted, taking into account any service performed by the individual. If the full deposit required is not made timely, the annuity will be affected. If the full deposit required under section 8411(j) of title 5 is not timely made, a reduction will be made in the recomputed annuity. Interest is not included in the deposit under this subsection. SEC. 4. NOTIFICATION AND OTHER DUTIES OF THE OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT. The Office of Personnel Management will inform individuals of their rights under the Act and assist in obtaining necessary information from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation will provide information on an individual's service performance to the Office upon request."
