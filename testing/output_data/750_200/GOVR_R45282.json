    "content": "FIFRA requires EPA to review and register pesticide products, establish maximum limits for pesticide residues in food, and assess fees on pesticide manufacturers for registrations and applications. These fees fund EPA's pesticide regulatory activities. The EPA's pesticide regulatory activities are funded through designated funds in the U.S. Treasury, combined with discretionary appropriations. Congress has authorized the collection of fees since 1954 to partially cover costs. The Pesticide Registration Improvement Act of 2003 established the current pesticide fee framework. The Pesticide Registration Improvement Act of 2003 (PRIA 1) modified provisions to enhance EPA's review of pesticide registrations issued before November 1, 1984. It authorized the collection of fees for registration service to cover costs associated with various review activities. PRIA 1 and PRIA 2 amended pesticide regulations, fees, and timeframes for EPA review of applications. PRIA 2 expanded fee categories, revised decision timeframes, and adjusted fee amounts for maintenance and registration. The pesticide fee framework was revised with PRIA 3 in 2012, setting annual maximum maintenance fees per registrant. The authority to collect pesticide maintenance fees expires on September 30, 2018, as per the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018. The authority to collect pesticide maintenance fees expires on September 30, 2018. FIFRA Section 4, as amended by PRIA 3, sets annual maximum maintenance fees per registrant based on the number of registrations held. EPA may cancel pesticide registrations if maintenance fees are not paid. Small businesses receive fee reductions, and certain public health pesticides are exempt from maintenance fees. The EPA collects maintenance fees from pesticide registrants, with small businesses receiving fee reductions and certain public health pesticides exempt from fees. Collected fees are deposited into the \"Reregistration and Expedited Processing Fund\" to offset costs associated with evaluating inert ingredients, expedited processing of applications, and reevaluating registered pesticides. EPA is required to use up to $800,000 per year from FY2013 through FY2018 to enhance information systems capabilities. EPA is required to use up to $800,000 per year from FY2013 through FY2018 to enhance information systems capabilities for tracking pesticide registration decisions. The authority to collect registration service fees begins to phase out starting at the end of FY2018, with a 70% reduction in fees for FY2019 if not extended or reauthorized. The authority to collect registration service fees would be reduced by 70% for FY2019 and expire at the end of FY2019. FIFRA Section 33, as amended by PRIA 3, sets fee amounts for 189 different actions requested by applicants. EPA must complete actions within specified timeframes, subject to adjustments, and provides fee reductions for small businesses. EPA may exempt or waive a portion of the fees. Section 33 of FIFRA, as amended by PRIA 3, sets fee amounts for various actions requested by applicants, with certain adjustments by EPA and specified timeframes for completion. It provides fee reductions for small businesses and exemptions for applications involving \"minor uses\" of pesticides, tolerance setting in the \"public interest,\" and federal and state governmental entities. The authority to collect registration service fees under Section 33 must be provided by annual discretionary appropriations, and EPA is prohibited from assessing fees if appropriations for salaries and expenses are not provided. Section 33 of FIFRA, as amended by PRIA 3, sets fee amounts for various actions requested by applicants, with adjustments by EPA and timeframes for completion. It provides fee reductions for small businesses and exemptions for applications involving \"minor uses\" of pesticides, tolerance setting in the \"public interest,\" and federal and state governmental entities. EPA is required to confirm minimum appropriations to assess registration service fees, except for FY2013 through FY2018 when fees could be assessed regardless of appropriations. Annual appropriations for FY2013 through FY2018 authorized EPA to collect pesticide registration service fees without minimum appropriations. Collected fees are deposited in the \"Pesticide Registration Fund\" and are subject to annual appropriations. Once appropriated, EPA can use the fees without fiscal year limitation for reviewing and deciding on registration applications. The EPA is authorized to use collected pesticide registration service fees without fiscal year limitation for various purposes, including reviewing applications, enhancing worker protection activities, awarding grants, and conducting a pesticide safety education program. The Inspector General of EPA is required to annually audit the funds in accordance with FIFRA and the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990. The Inspector General must audit the Reregistration and Expedited Processing Fund and Pesticide Registration Fund as required by FIFRA and the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990. The findings and recommendations of the audit must be submitted to EPA and certain congressional committees. EPA is also mandated to report annually on its pesticide program activities. Congress allocated $8.89 billion for EPA in FY2018 for specified functions of the EPA Office. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 authorizes EPA to assess registration service fees for the Office of Pesticide Programs. Collected maintenance fees ranged from $21.4 million to $28.7 million per fiscal year from FY2004 through FY2018, while registration service fees ranged from $10.6 million to $18.6 million per fiscal year in the same period. In the same time period, collected maintenance and registration service fees ranged from $10.6 million to $28.7 million per fiscal year. Congress initiated legislative efforts to reauthorize the collection of fees in 2017, extending the authority through FY2018 appropriations. The House and Senate have passed separate versions of reauthorization legislation awaiting resolution. The House and Senate have passed separate versions of reauthorization legislation for the Pesticide Registration Enhancement Act. Both versions would reauthorize the collection of maintenance and registration service fees through FY2023 and FY2025, respectively, with increased caps on annual maintenance fees. The reauthorization legislation for the Pesticide Registration Enhancement Act includes increasing caps on annual maintenance fees and registration service fees through FY2023 and FY2025, respectively. It also directs the EPA to set aside funds for expedited rulemaking and guidance development related to pesticide efficacy evaluation and enhancing good laboratory practices standards compliance monitoring. The Senate amendment to H.R. 1029 would direct EPA to allocate funds for enhancing good laboratory practices standards compliance monitoring and revise registration service fee amounts. EPA is required to carry out two final rules by October 1, 2021, with one exception. The EPA is required to implement two final rules by October 1, 2021, one of which addresses revisions to the agricultural worker protection standard, including application exclusion zones. The other rule focuses on standards for certified pesticide applicators to enhance safety measures. The rule revises standards for certified pesticide applicators to protect them, the public, and the environment from risks associated with restricted use pesticides. The Senate amendment to H.R. 1029 directs the U.S. Government Accountability Office to publish a report by October 1, 2021, on the use of designated representatives and their impact on pesticide application information, worker health, and safety. Recommendations to prevent pesticide misuse will also be included in the report. The House and Senate versions of H.R. 2 are being reconciled in a conference to address differences. The legislation focuses on pesticide application information, worker health, and safety, with recommendations to prevent misuse. The House requested a conference with the Senate to resolve differences on PRIA reauthorization for pesticide fees. Previous reauthorizations had bipartisan support, but disagreements between the House and Senate have stalled the current iteration. The current PRIA reauthorization has not been finalized due to disagreements between the House and Senate on EPA administration and enforcement of certain FIFRA regulations."
