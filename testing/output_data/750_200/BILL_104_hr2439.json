    "content": "The \"State Infrastructure Banks Act of 1995\" allows states to use State infrastructure banks for financing transportation projects, providing more freedom in developing low-cost support for public-private transportation partnerships. The \"State Infrastructure Banks Act of 1995\" defines key terms such as Secretary, State, and State infrastructure bank. State infrastructure banks are created at the State or multi-State level to finance transportation projects. Congress grants consent to States to establish State infrastructure banks and enter into interstate compacts to promote regional investment in transportation infrastructure. State infrastructure banks can provide loans, issue debt, and offer assistance to entities constructing transportation projects. State infrastructure banks can provide assistance to public or private entities for transportation projects eligible for financial aid under title 23, United States Code. This assistance can include loans or other forms of financial support for the construction or capital costs of qualifying projects. The Act allows loans or assistance for transportation projects to be subordinated to other debt financing. \"Other assistance\" includes various forms of financial support for qualifying projects approved by the Secretary. State infrastructure banks must maintain an investment grade rating on debt issuances or have sufficient insurance. Investment income generated by deposited funds must be credited to the bank. State infrastructure banks must ensure that investment income generated by funds deposited into the bank will be credited to the bank, available for use in providing loans for transportation projects, and invested in Treasury securities or other financing instruments to enhance project leveraging. Repayment of loans is also a key aspect. The State infrastructure bank must ensure that loans for transportation projects bear appropriate interest and repayment starts within 5 years of the facility opening. The State infrastructure bank must ensure that loans for transportation projects bear appropriate interest, with repayment starting within 5 years of the facility opening. Repayment term should not exceed 30 years, limit loan amounts, and require annual status reports to the Secretary. The State infrastructure bank must make annual reports to the Secretary on its status by September 30 each year. The Secretary must ensure that Federal disbursements for capital reserves are consistent with historic rates for the Federal-aid highway program and specify procedures for operating a State infrastructure bank. Contributions from Title 23 apportionments are required. A State may transfer up to 15 percent of Federal funds apportioned under Title 23 to a State infrastructure bank, along with corresponding obligational authority. The transferred funds must be disbursed at a rate consistent with the traditional rate of disbursement for the Federal-aid highway program. The deposit of Federal apportionments into a State infrastructure bank does not create any obligation on the part of the United States, and any financing instrument issued by the bank must explicitly state that it is not a commitment or guarantee by the United States. State infrastructure bank must clarify that the security or instrument is not a commitment, guarantee, or obligation of the United States. Sections 3335 and 6503 of title 31, United States Code, do not apply to funds used as a capital reserve. A State can contribute up to 2 percent of Federal funds deposited into the bank for administering the bank."
