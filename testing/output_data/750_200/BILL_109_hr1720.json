Congress finds that there are millions of cases of waterborne diseases in the United States each year due to inadequately treated sewage, leading to various illnesses such as gastroenteritis, hepatitis, and respiratory diseases. Millions of Americans become sick as a result. Between 1,800,000 and 3,500,000 Americans get sick annually from swimming in contaminated waters, leading to economic losses estimated at $28 billion. Sewer systems often fail to monitor or report overflows, causing widespread pathogen contamination and beach closures valued at $1-2 billion in the US. Many sewer systems do not monitor or report overflows, leading to public health risks. Improved monitoring and reporting could prevent millions of illnesses annually. Public health authorities are often not informed of sewer overflows that pose a threat. The curr_chunk is a section header \"SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\" The term 'sanitary sewer overflow' is defined as an overflow, spill, release, or diversion of wastewater from a sanitary sewer system, excluding combined sewer overflows and wastewater backups into buildings caused by blockages. The term 'sanitary sewer overflow' includes overflows or releases of wastewater from a privately owned building lateral, whether reaching waters of the United States or not, and wastewater backups into buildings caused by blockages in a sanitary sewer. SEC. 4. MONITORING, REPORTING, AND PUBLIC NOTIFICATION OF SEWER OVERFLOWS. Section 402 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to include requirements for publicly owned treatment works to implement a system to detect sanitary sewer overflows promptly. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act now requires publicly owned treatment works to have a system in place for timely detection and notification of sanitary sewer overflows to protect public health. Publicly owned treatment works must immediately notify public health authorities and other affected entities of any sanitary sewer overflow that may endanger human health, providing a report within 24 hours of becoming aware of the overflow. The owner or operator of a facility must report any overflow within 24 hours and provide a written report within 5 days detailing the overflow's magnitude, duration, suspected cause, and steps taken to prevent recurrence. The owner or operator of a facility must report any overflow within 24 hours and provide a written report within 5 days detailing the overflow's magnitude, duration, suspected cause, steps taken to prevent recurrence, steps to mitigate impact, and total number of overflows to waters of the United States on monthly discharge monitoring report. The owner or operator of a facility must report any overflow within 24 hours and provide a written report within 5 days detailing the overflow's magnitude, duration, suspected cause, steps taken to prevent recurrence, steps to mitigate impact, and total number of overflows to waters of the United States on monthly discharge monitoring report. Additionally, they must report the total number of overflows in a calendar year, including details of each overflow such as wastewater released, duration, location, potentially affected receiving waters, clean-up responses, and actions taken to prevent further sanitary sewer overflows. The State must report annually to the EPA on sanitary sewer overflows that occurred, as required by the regulations. SEC. 5. ELIGIBILITY FOR ASSISTANCE. Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to include requirements for monitoring, reporting, and notifying the public of sanitary sewer overflows. SEC. 6. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Increases funding to $2.2 billion for fiscal years 2006 through 2012."
