The Cherry Valley area in northeastern Pennsylvania is home to over 80 special-concern animal and plant species, including 6 endangered or threatened species such as the bog turtle, dwarf wedge mussel, northeastern bulrush, and small whorled pogonia. Cherry Valley provides habitat for 79 species of national or regional concern, including neotropical migratory birds. Efforts are being made to reestablish favorable conditions for the Indiana bat. Cherry Valley is a critical habitat for various species, including neotropical migratory birds like the Cerulean Warbler and the Wood Thrush, waterfowl like the American Black Duck, rare plants like the spreading globeflower, and anadromous fish species. The Cherry Valley watershed on the Kittatinny Ridge serves as an important migration route for birds of prey in the northeastern United States. The Kittatinny Ridge is a crucial migration route for birds of prey in the northeastern United States, including species like the bald eagle, golden eagle, and broad-winged hawk. It also features a segment of the Appalachian Trail and significant wildlife habitats in Cherry Valley, such as rare calcareous wetlands. The Cherry Valley area is home to significant wildlife habitats, including rare calcareous wetlands. Ongoing studies have shown high water quality in Cherry Creek. Two federally-owned parcels of land, including the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area and a 700-acre segment of the Appalachian Trail, are adjacent to the area and could potentially be included in a Cherry Valley National Wildlife Refuge. Public meetings over several years have shown strong local support for a Cherry Valley National Wildlife Refuge, with landowners, business leaders, and elected officials expressing enthusiasm for the project. Leaders, media, and elected officials have shown enthusiasm for a Cherry Valley National Wildlife Refuge, with various local communities and conservation entities actively working to protect the area's wildlife habitat and farmland. These local entities, along with State land management agencies and the National Park Service, could be strong partners for the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. Several local landowners have already placed their land into conservation easements or other arrangements. Additionally, a voter-approved Monroe County, Pennsylvania, open space fund and a voter-approved Stroud Township support conservation efforts in the area. The voter-approved funds in Monroe County and Stroud Township have supported conservation efforts in the area. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines key terms such as \"map,\" \"Secretary,\" and \"Study Area.\" SEC. 4. STUDY OF REFUGE POTENTIAL AND FUTURE REFUGE LAND ACQUISITION. The Secretary will conduct a study to evaluate the Study Area for potential acquisition by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and inclusion in a Cherry Valley National Wildlife Refuge, consulting with various stakeholders. The Secretary will conduct a study to identify eligible land and interests for acquisition for a national wildlife refuge in the Study Area, determining suitable boundaries and management policies in consultation with stakeholders. The Secretary will assess the conservation benefits of establishing Cherry Valley National Wildlife Refuge, including preserving diverse populations of fish, wildlife, and plants, including threatened or endangered species. The establishment of Cherry Valley National Wildlife Refuge aims to protect diverse populations of fish, wildlife, and plants, including threatened or endangered species, while also focusing on habitat protection, wildlife-dependent recreation, research, education, and fulfilling international obligations. Public participation is encouraged in the conservation efforts. The Secretary of the United States will acquire up to 30,000 acres of land, water, and interests in the Study Area for refuge purposes, with public participation and special consideration for local views. A report on the study completion is due within one year of the Act's enactment. The Secretary will complete a study within a year of the Act's enactment and submit a report to the Senate and House committees, including a map identifying and prioritizing specific land, water, and interests in the Study Area. The Secretary will provide a map prioritizing land, water, and interests for future acquisition in the Study Area, along with cost estimates and funds available for acquiring refuge status. The Secretary will prioritize land, water, and interests for future acquisition in the Study Area and estimate funds available for refuge status. $200,000 is authorized for carrying out this section."
