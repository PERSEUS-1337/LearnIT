    "content": "Recent legislation has extended certain expiring provisions in the Internal Revenue Code, making some temporary provisions permanent. The American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA) reduced tax policy uncertainty by permanently extending most tax cuts enacted in 2001 and 2003. ATRA also temporarily extended provisions that had expired at the end of 2011 or 2012 through 2013. The tax code uncertainty was addressed by recent legislation, with provisions extended through 2014 in the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 made some provisions permanent or temporarily extended them. These temporary provisions, known as \"tax extenders,\" are regularly extended by Congress. Tax extenders are temporary tax provisions regularly extended by Congress. The research tax credit, for example, was extended 16 times before being made permanent in P.L. 114-113. In the 114th Congress, the debate focused on whether expired tax provisions should be made permanent or temporarily extended. All expired tax provisions were extended in P.L. 114-113. In P.L. 114-113, expired tax provisions were either temporarily extended or made permanent, reducing uncertainty in the tax code. However, not all provisions were made permanent, leading to some extenders set to expire at the end of 2016. Debate in the 114th Congress may address whether these provisions should be extended. This report provides an overview of tax extenders set to expire at the end of 2016. Specific extender provisions can be found in other CRS reports. The Consolidated Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2016 (P.L. 114-113) contained the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 (PATH Act), which extended or made permanent all tax provisions that had expired at the end of 2014. The PATH Act of 2015 extended or made permanent tax provisions that expired in 2014, including enhanced child tax credit, American Opportunity Tax Credit, and earned income tax credit. It also included a two-year moratorium on the medical device excise tax. The Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 extended expiring tax provisions for one year, including a moratorium on the high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage excise tax and annual fee on health insurance providers. Other legislation proposed longer extensions and permanent provisions. In the 113th and 114th Congress, various legislation was considered to extend or make permanent certain expiring tax provisions, including the research and experimentation tax credit and increased expensing allowances for businesses. In the 114th Congress, legislation was passed to extend certain expired tax provisions under the Internal Revenue Code Section 179. The Tax Relief Extension Act of 2015 would have extended temporary provisions that expired in 2014 for two years, making them available for the 2015 and 2016 tax year. The Tax Relief Extension Act of 2015 aimed to extend temporary tax provisions that expired in 2014 for two years, including dozens of temporary tax provisions in the tax code. These provisions are often referred to as the \"tax extender\" package and are regularly extended by Congress. The term \"tax extender\" refers to expiring tax provisions temporarily extended by Congress, often for short periods. These provisions are enacted temporarily to evaluate their effectiveness before further extension. Enacting tax provisions on a temporary basis allows Congress to evaluate their effectiveness before deciding on further extension. Temporary provisions can also provide relief during economic weakness or after a natural disaster, and may be enacted for budgetary reasons. Examining why a provision is temporary can help in determining whether it should be extended. Enacting tax provisions on a temporary basis allows for evaluation of effectiveness before extension. However, the rationale for temporary provisions is undermined if they are regularly extended without review. An expiration date can force policymakers to consider costs and benefits, but this has not been effective in practice. The special tax treatment provisions are traditionally passed without systematic review, leading to ineffective policy implementation. Some tax incentives, like those for alcohol fuels, have not been extended beyond certain years despite most provisions being extended in recent years. Tax incentives for alcohol fuels, like ethanol, were not extended beyond 2011 due to duplicative benefits found by the Government Accountability Office. Congress evaluates provisions based on cost-benefit analysis. Tax policy can address temporary situations like economic stimulus or disaster relief through measures such as bonus depreciation. Tax incentives for alcohol fuels, like ethanol, were not extended beyond 2011 due to duplicative benefits found by the Government Accountability Office. Congress evaluates provisions based on cost-benefit analysis. Temporary tax measures for economic stimulus or disaster relief include bonus depreciation, casualty loss deductions, net operating loss carrybacks, mortgage forgiveness exclusion, payroll tax cuts, and Section 1603 grants. The Section 1603 grants were provided as grants in lieu of tax credits to address weak tax-equity markets during the economic downturn. It is argued that temporary provisions should expire once the situation is resolved, and temporary tax policies are easier to offset for budgetary reasons. The Congressional Budget Office assumes that temporary tax cuts expire as scheduled under the current law baseline. The Congressional Budget Office assumes that temporary tax cuts expire as scheduled under the current law baseline, potentially overstating projected revenues if extensions are common. Temporary tax benefits act as federal subsidies favoring certain activities, impacting the long-term fiscal outlook. Temporary tax benefits, known as extenders, influence economic behavior and resource allocation. Evaluating their impact on efficiency, equity, and simplicity is crucial for policymakers. Extenders can be efficient but not equitable, or vice versa, prompting a choice of economic objectives. They often provide subsidies to incentivize specific activities. Extenders may be equitable but not efficient, providing subsidies to incentivize activities. Economic theory suggests that markets should allocate resources without tax distortions, but market failures may justify tax distortions for improved efficiency. The impact of extenders on economic welfare depends on whether they address market failures. The effectiveness of tax extenders in improving economic welfare depends on addressing market failures and stimulating desired activities. Direct spending programs may be more successful at targeting resources than indirect subsidies like tax extenders. Fair taxation contributes to a socially desirable distribution of the tax burden. Tax benefits like extenders can lead to unequal tax payments for individuals with similar incomes and expenses, deviating from the principle of horizontal equity. Vertical equity in taxation requires fair distribution of tax burdens based on ability to pay. Extenders are often seen as unfair as they mainly benefit those with higher income levels. Tax extenders are seen as inequitable as they mainly benefit individuals with higher incomes, reducing the progressivity of the tax system. This can lead to unequal tax payments for individuals with similar incomes and expenses, deviating from the principle of horizontal equity. The impact of tax extenders on vertical equity is demonstrated by two teachers with $250 in classroom expenses. The tax benefit varies based on income tax brackets, with higher-income taxpayers receiving a greater deduction. Extenders complicate the tax code and increase administrative costs. Tax extenders complicate the tax code, increase administrative costs, and benefit higher-income taxpayers more than lower-income taxpayers. The costs of administering the tax system are rarely included in cost-benefit analyses of temporary tax provisions. Complexity also leads to higher costs for individual taxpayers, who spend more time on tax preparation and may hire paid preparers. Many temporary tax provisions expired in 2014 but were extended in P.L. 114-113. Many temporary tax provisions expired in 2014 but were extended in P.L. 114-113, including individual, business, charitable, and energy categories. The extension cost is detailed in Table 1. Individual tax extender provisions that expired in 2014 had previously been extended as part of tax extender legislation. The above-the-line deduction for classroom expenses and other individual tax extender provisions that expired in 2014 were extended in P.L. 114-113. The deduction for state and local sales taxes, tuition expenses, mortgage insurance premiums, and employer-provided mass transit and parking benefits were made permanent in P.L. 114-113. Business provisions like the research tax credit and Work Opportunity Tax Credit expired at the end of 2014. The research tax credit, rum excise tax cover-over, Work Opportunity Tax Credit, Qualified Zone Academy Bond allocation limitation, active financing exception under Subpart F, New Markets Tax Credit, bonus depreciation, and enhanced expensing allowances expired at the end of 2014. Some business-related extender provisions were made permanent in P.L. 114-113. Several business-related extender provisions expired at the end of 2014, but some were made permanent in P.L. 114-113, including the research tax credit, enhanced expensing under Section 179, and the active financing exception under Subpart F. Other provisions like the New Markets Tax Credit and bonus depreciation were extended through 2019. Additionally, four charitable provisions that expired in 2014 were also made permanent in P.L. 114-113. The renewable energy production tax credit (PTC) and charitable provisions that expired in 2014 were extended through P.L. 114-113. The PTC for wind was extended through 2019 with a phase-down starting in 2017. The PTC was extended through 2016 by P.L. 114-113, with wind PTC extended through 2019 and a phase-down from 2017. Various energy-related tax provisions from EPACT05 were also extended. Certain tax incentives for alternative technology vehicles and alternative fuel vehicle refueling property were extended through 2016 in P.L. 114-113. The alternative motor vehicle credit for qualified fuel cell vehicles expired at the end of 2014. Other EPACT05 incentives for alternative motor vehicles expired at earlier dates. The tax credit for two-wheeled plug-in electric vehicles expired in 2013 but was extended in 2015. It was first enacted as part of the ARRA and extended once previously by the ATRA. The credit for qualified fuel cell vehicles and two-wheeled plug-in electric vehicles were extended through 2016 in P.L. 114-113. The tax credits for qualified fuel cell vehicles and two-wheeled plug-in electric vehicles were extended through 2016 in P.L. 114-113, which also made certain provisions permanent. The total cost of these tax extenders is estimated to reduce federal revenues by $628.8 billion between 2016 and 2025. The tax extenders in P.L. 114-113 are estimated to reduce federal revenues by $628.8 billion between 2016 and 2025. Nearly one-third of this cost is due to extensions of provisions scheduled to expire in 2017, including the child tax credit, American Opportunity Tax Credit, earned income tax credit, and the medical device excise tax moratorium. The total cost of extending these provisions is estimated at $426.8 billion. The estimated cost of tax extender provisions in P.L. 114-113 is $426.8 billion between 2016 and 2025. 89% of the total cost is associated with permanent extensions, totaling $361.4 billion. Only $17.7 billion was for a two-year extension of provisions that had expired in 2014 through 2016. Legislation in the House prior to P.L. 114-113 aimed to make certain temporary tax provisions permanent. Before P.L. 114-113 was passed, legislation in the House aimed to make certain temporary tax provisions permanent. The Senate Finance Committee reported legislation in 2015 to retroactively extend expired tax provisions for two years through 2016, with an estimated revenue reduction of $97.1 billion. The JCT estimated that extending tax extenders, as proposed in S. 1946, would reduce revenue by $97.1 billion between 2016 and 2025. S. 1946 included revenue raising provisions, bringing the cost to $96.9 billion. The cost with macroeconomic effects included was $86.6 billion over 10 years. Extending certain expired provisions, like the provision allowing businesses to expense 50% of investments, is expected to boost economic growth in the near term. The provision allowing businesses to expense 50% of investments in S. 1946 is expected to increase economic growth in the near term. The cost estimate with macroeconomic effects included is lower than without, despite the projected increase in federal debt. The JCT's macroeconomic analysis shows increased economic growth within the budget window, leading to a lower cost estimate for S. 1946. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that extending all expiring tax provisions before 2025 would reduce revenues by $897.9 billion over the 2016 to 2025 budget window. Extending bonus depreciation would cost $223.6 billion and extending Section 179 expensing would cost $60.8 billion. Extending tax provisions before 2025 would reduce revenues by $897.9 billion. Extending bonus depreciation would cost $223.6 billion, Section 179 expensing $60.8 billion, and other credits $202.8 billion. Most provisions set to expire had already expired by 2014. The cost of extending tax provisions before 2025 is significant, with bonus depreciation, Section 179 expensing, and other credits adding up to billions of dollars. The current law revenue baseline does not account for the extension of tax extender provisions, leading to higher revenue projections and smaller budget deficits than what is likely to occur. Short-term extensions are cheaper than extending expiring provisions through the budget window. The cost of extending tax provisions before 2025, such as bonus depreciation and Section 179 expensing, is significant. Short-term extensions are cheaper than extending expiring provisions through the budget window. CBO scores provide a more accurate measure of the long-term budget impact of temporary tax provisions compared to JCT scores. The cost of extending tax provisions like bonus depreciation and Section 179 expensing before 2025 is significant. Short-term extensions are cheaper than extending expiring provisions through the budget window. Bonus depreciation was extended through 2019 at a cost of $11.3 billion over the 10-year budget window, with the one-year revenue loss in 2015 being $45.3 billion. The cost of bonus depreciation extension through 2019 was $11.3 billion over 10 years, with revenue loss in 2015 at $45.3 billion. Making bonus depreciation permanent would cost $223.6 billion over 10 years. Making bonus depreciation permanent would cost $223.6 billion over 10 years, as part of the tax extenders legislation passed in December 2015. Legislation in previous Congresses had considered making certain expired tax provisions permanent. During the 114th Congress, there were actions on extenders, including the Senate Finance Committee reporting the Tax Relief Extension Act of 2015 (S. 1946) to extend expired tax provisions for two years. The House passed legislation to make eight temporary tax provisions permanent, including enhanced expensing allowances under Section 179. The America's Small Business Tax Relief Act of 2015 aimed to make permanent enhanced expensing allowances under Section 179 and extend expired S corporation provisions. The America Gives More Act of 2015 included three expired charitable provisions. The American Research and Competitiveness Act of 2015 aimed to make permanent the research tax credit, while legislation also proposed making permanent the option to deduct state and local sales taxes instead of income taxes. These measures would have cost $317.5 billion over a 10-year period. During the 113th and 114th Congress, various bills were considered to extend or make permanent certain tax extender provisions. A one-year \"tax extenders\" bill was ultimately passed and enacted late in the year. A one-year \"tax extenders\" bill was passed and enacted late in the year, with the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 signed into law on December 19, 2014. The Senate Finance Committee had earlier reported a two-year extenders package, the EXPIRE Act, proposing to extend most expiring provisions through 2015. The House also considered legislation to make certain expiring tax provisions permanent during the 113th Congress, passing legislation to make nine provisions permanent. The House passed legislation in the 113th Congress to make nine tax provisions permanent, reducing revenues by $511.4 billion over 10 years. Six provisions were part of the Jobs for America Act (H.R. 4) and three were in the America Gives More Act of 2014 (H.R. 4719). Ways and Means Committee reported legislation to make two international-related provisions permanent. The Ways and Means Committee reported legislation during the 113th Congress to make two international-related extender provisions permanent. However, these provisions were not included in the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014. The health coverage tax credit and the credit for electric-drive motorcycles and three-wheeled vehicles were not extended in the EXPIRE Act but have been extended in subsequent legislation. The health coverage tax credit and the credit for electric-drive motorcycles and three-wheeled vehicles have been extended in subsequent legislation. The health coverage tax credit was first enacted as part of the Trade Act of 2002 and has been modified and retroactively extended through December 31, 2019. The Trade Preferences Extension Act of 2015 (P.L. 114-27) extended the health coverage tax credit through December 31, 2019. The credit for electric-drive motorcycles and three-wheeled vehicles was not extended in P.L. 113-295. Incentives for plug-in electric vehicles are currently available, while most other alternative technology vehicle incentives have expired. The credit for two-wheeled electric plug-in vehicles was extended through 2016 in P.L. 114-113. The credit for two-wheeled electric plug-in vehicles was extended through 2016 in P.L. 114-113, but other energy-related provisions like partial expensing of refinery property and credit for energy efficient appliances were not extended. Disaster-related provisions for New York Liberty Zone facilities and nonrecognition of gain for areas damaged by 2008 Midwestern storms also expired in P.L. 113-295. The disaster-related provisions for New York Liberty Zone facilities and nonrecognition of gain for areas damaged by the 2008 Midwestern storms were not extended in P.L. 113-295 or the EXPIRE Act."
