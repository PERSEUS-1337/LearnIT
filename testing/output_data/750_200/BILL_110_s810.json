There is consensus in the scientific community that hands-on laboratory experience is essential for learning science. The National Research Council concluded that the quality of laboratory experiences in high school science programs is poor for most students. Disagreements among educators and researchers on defining high school science laboratories and their purpose hinder research on improving labs, especially in schools with higher concentrations of non-Asian minorities and poor students. Schools with higher concentrations of non-Asian minorities and poor students are less likely to have adequate laboratory facilities. The Government Accountability Office found that nearly half of schools with a minority student population over 50.5% did not meet functional requirements for laboratory science. 40% of college students who left science fields cited problems with high school science preparation, including lack of laboratory experience. The Federal Government should invest in research and projects to improve the teaching of laboratory science in high schools, especially in schools with higher concentrations of non-Asian minorities and poor students lacking adequate facilities. The grant program is established to improve the teaching of laboratory science in high schools, particularly in schools with higher concentrations of non-Asian minorities and poor students lacking adequate facilities. Section 8(8) of the National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 is amended to redesignate subparagraphs, move language, and make adjustments to a program initiative, including the addition of a pilot program. The National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 is amended to include a pilot program called `Partnerships for Access to Laboratory Science' to enhance mathematics, science, and engineering education through grants for laboratory improvements and instrumentation. The National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 includes a pilot program called `Partnerships for Access to Laboratory Science' to improve mathematics, science, and engineering education through grants for laboratory enhancements and equipment. Grants can be used for purchasing equipment, maintaining facilities, and professional development. The National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 includes a pilot program called `Partnerships for Access to Laboratory Science' to improve mathematics, science, and engineering education through grants for laboratory enhancements, equipment, professional development, instructional programs, and safety training for school personnel. The National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 includes a pilot program called `Partnerships for Access to Laboratory Science' to improve mathematics, science, and engineering education through grants for laboratory enhancements, equipment, professional development, instructional programs, and safety training for school personnel. The program also focuses on designing and implementing hands-on laboratory experiences to encourage interest in mathematics, science, engineering, and technology for underrepresented individuals. The National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 includes a pilot program called `Partnerships for Access to Laboratory Science' to improve education in mathematics, science, engineering, and technology through grants for laboratory enhancements, equipment, professional development, instructional programs, and safety training for school personnel. Grants are awarded to partnerships that prepare individuals for postsecondary studies in these fields and assess the funded activities. The pilot program 'Partnerships for Access to Laboratory Science' under the National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 awards grants to partnerships that include an institution of higher education, a high-need local educational agency, a business or eligible nonprofit organization, and may also include a State educational agency or other public agency. The Federal share of the cost of activities from a grant under the pilot program shall not exceed 50 percent and may involve various organizations such as a State educational agency, public agency, National Laboratory, or community-based organization. SEC. 3. REPORT. The Director of the National Science Foundation will evaluate pilot projects funded by the grant program to improve student performance in math, science, engineering, and technology. A report on the evaluation results will be submitted to specific Senate and House committees within 5 years of the Act's enactment, identifying best practices. The report on best practices and materials developed by grant awardees will be submitted to the House of Representatives within 5 years of the Act's enactment. SEC. 4. Authorization of appropriations: $5,000,000 for fiscal year 2008 and necessary sums for the following 3 years for the National Science Foundation to implement the Act and its amendments."
