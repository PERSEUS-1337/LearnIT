Congress recognizes the importance of sharing research results to advance science and benefit society. The Act emphasizes the role of the Internet in providing easy access to this information for scientists, educators, and citizens. The term \"Federal agency\" in this Act refers to an Executive agency defined under section 105 of title 5, United States Code. Each Federal agency with extramural research expenditures over $100,000,000 must develop a Federal research public access policy within 1 year of this Act. The policy requires submission of the author's final manuscript of research papers funded by the Federal Government to the agency. The Federal research public access policy mandates that research papers funded by the Federal Government must be submitted to the agency for publication in peer-reviewed journals. The policy also requires incorporating changes from peer review, replacing the final manuscript with the published version with publisher consent, and ensuring free online public access to the final peer-reviewed papers.
