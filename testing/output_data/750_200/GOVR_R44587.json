    "content": "The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) was established in 1967 under the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) to investigate civil aviation accidents and other transportation incidents. In 1974, the Independent Safety Board Act made NTSB independent of DOT, allowing unbiased investigations and safety recommendations. The NTSB's main role is determining accident causes. The NTSB investigates accidents and makes safety recommendations, providing assistance to victims' families. It does not have the authority to enforce its recommendations or regulate safety practices in transportation, which falls under the jurisdiction of the DOT. The NTSB does not have authority to enforce its safety recommendations or regulate transportation safety practices, which are under the jurisdiction of the DOT. The NTSB consists of a five-member board and approximately 420 staff, with headquarters in Washington, DC, and regional offices in Ashburn, VA; Denver, CO; Federal Way, WA; and Anchorage, AK. The NTSB, with headquarters in Washington, DC, has regional offices in Ashburn, VA; Denver, CO; Federal Way, WA; and Anchorage, AK. The NTSB Reauthorization Act of 2006 requires the NTSB to have at least one full-time employee in states over 1,000 miles from a regional office. This impacts Hawaii, where the NTSB has one aviation safety investigator. NTSB regional staff are now located in 25 states. The NTSB has regional offices in various states, with five Safety Board members serving five-year terms. Not more than three members can be from the same political party, and at least three must have technical qualifications in transportation safety. Investigative and support staff are organized by transportation mode. The NTSB has regional offices in various states with five Safety Board members serving five-year terms. Investigative and support staff are organized by transportation mode. The NTSB also serves as a court of appeals for airmen and mariners subject to administrative actions by the FAA or Coast Guard, adjudicated by the Office of Administrative Law Judges. Additionally, the NTSB has an Office of Safety Recommendations and Communications to track responses to safety recommendations. The NTSB's Office of Safety Recommendations and Communications coordinates communication with various stakeholders, tracks responses to safety recommendations, and investigates transportation accidents involving civil aircraft, public aircraft, highway and railroad grade crossing accidents, and railroad accidents with passenger trains or significant property damage. The NTSB investigates transportation accidents within the United States and its territories, including highway and railroad grade crossing accidents, railroad accidents with passenger trains or significant property damage, pipeline accidents with significant property or environmental damage, major marine casualties on U.S. waters, and other catastrophic accidents or recurring safety issues. The NTSB investigates transportation accidents within the United States and its territories, including catastrophic accidents or recurring problems involving transportation safety. The NTSB relies on the expertise of manufacturers, transportation providers, and regulatory agencies through the \"party process\" to assist with investigations, with safeguards in place to prevent external influence on findings and conclusions. The NTSB assigns technical personnel to assist in investigations, with safeguards in place to prevent external influence on findings. Interested parties can provide expertise and analyses, but NTSB bases conclusions strictly on its staff's analysis. Formal procedures allow parties to petition for reconsideration of investigative findings. No party, except the FAA in aviation cases, has a specific right to hold party status. The NTSB assigns technical personnel to assist in investigations, with safeguards in place to prevent external influence on findings. Parties can be sanctioned or lose their party status if they do not fulfill assigned duties and comply with rules of conduct. The Safety Board must meet in public on most matters pertaining to accident investigations under the Government in the Sunshine Act. Financial disclosures are required for board members and senior investigative staff. Despite safeguards in place, there is still potential for outside influence on the NTSB process. Maintaining impartiality is crucial to preserve credibility, especially during complex investigations. Balancing the need for unique data from involved parties with preventing interference poses a significant challenge. The NTSB faces challenges in maintaining impartiality and preventing outside influence during complex accident investigations. They adhere to international standards and may assist in foreign aviation accident investigations involving U.S.-manufactured or -registered aircraft. The NTSB collaborates with foreign investigations involving U.S.-manufactured aircraft, even when the U.S. has no direct interest. They may receive reimbursement for costs incurred from outside entities. The NTSB collaborates with foreign investigations involving U.S.-manufactured aircraft and may receive reimbursement for costs from outside entities. P.L. 109-443 designated receipts as offsetting collections available until expended, expanding the types of reimbursements credited. The NTSB has recovered costs for international investigations through DOT's Safe Skies for Africa program, with annual costs ranging from under $1 million to almost $2.4 million between FY2012 and FY2015. The NTSB's costs for participating in international investigations through the Safe Skies for Africa program ranged from just under $1 million to almost $2.4 million annually between FY2012 and FY2015. The NTSB issues safety recommendations to effect change in transportation safety regulations and practices, as it has no direct authority to change them. Recommendations are issued throughout investigations of complex accidents to identify needed safety improvements. Since 1967, the NTSB has issued over 14,300 safety recommendations to more than 2,300 recipients across all modes of transportation. About 82% of NTSB recommendations have led to the implementation of safety improvements. DOT agencies must respond to each recommendation within 90 days, detailing how they plan to implement it. The NTSB issues safety recommendations to transportation recipients, who must respond within 90 days on their implementation plans. While not required by law, most recommendations are eventually implemented despite concerns about feasibility, costs, and benefits. The NTSB focuses on advocating for safety improvements and does not consider benefit/cost in its recommendations. The NTSB issues safety recommendations to transportation recipients, who must respond within 90 days on their implementation plans. Recommendations may be prolonged due to rulemaking processes and concerns about feasibility, costs, and benefits. The NTSB does not consider benefit/cost in its recommendations and highlights key safety improvements on a \"Most Wanted\" list. Currently seeking actions to reduce fatigue-related accidents, improve rail transit safety oversight, promote collision avoidance technologies, and strengthen occupant protection in highway vehicles. The NTSB issues safety recommendations to transportation recipients, who must respond within 90 days on their implementation plans. Recommendations may be prolonged due to rulemaking processes and concerns about feasibility, costs, and benefits. The NTSB highlights key safety improvements on a \"Most Wanted\" list, including reducing fatigue-related accidents, improving rail transit safety oversight, promoting collision avoidance technologies, and strengthening occupant protection in highway vehicles, passenger trains, and aircraft. This list also aims to minimize operator distractions, prevent loss of control in flight, promote completion of rail safety initiatives, end substance impairment in transportation, and require operators to be medically fit for duty. The NTSB's safety recommendations and advocacy programs have influenced transportation agencies and congressional decision-making. This influence has led to legislation and regulations for positive train control systems, reducing pilot fatigue, addressing distracted driving, setting safety standards for helicopter air ambulances, and more. Legislation and regulations influenced by NTSB recommendations include train control systems, airline pilot fatigue reduction, distracted driving laws, helicopter air ambulance safety standards, and pipeline safety improvements. For instance, the FAA Extension, Safety, and Security Act of 2016 incorporates NTSB suggestions such as implementing an airline pilot records database and enhancing pilot training on automated systems monitoring. Section 2102 of the FAA Extension, Safety, and Security Act requires FAA to modify airline pilot training to include verifying pilots' skills in monitoring automated systems and controlling the aircraft without autopilot. This was prompted by concerns raised by the NTSB after the 2013 Asiana Airlines crash. Section 2103 directs FAA to assess recommendations on mental health screening for pilots. The Pilot Fitness Aviation Rulemaking Committee made recommendations on mental health screening for pilots, following international aviation safety concerns after incidents like the Germanwings crash in 2015. Section 2105 of the FAA Extension Act mandates the FAA to evaluate and update standards for crash-resistant helicopter fuel systems. This addresses a 2015 NTSB safety recommendation for all newly manufactured helicopters. The FAA Extension Act mandates the FAA to address a 2015 NTSB safety recommendation for crash-resistant helicopter fuel systems in all newly manufactured helicopters. The Pipeline Safety Act of 2011 included provisions to enhance pipeline safety, such as increasing federal pipeline safety inspectors and requiring automatic shutoff valves for transmission pipelines. The Pipeline Safety Act of 2011 included provisions to increase federal pipeline safety inspectors, require automatic shutoff valves for transmission pipelines, verify maximum allowable operating pressure for gas transmission pipelines, increase civil penalties for safety violations, and review diluted bitumen pipeline regulation. The Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 mandates positive train control on railroads carrying passengers or high-volume freight with hazardous materials. Positive train control is a communication and signaling system mandated by the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 for railroads carrying passengers or high-volume freight with hazardous materials. It aims to prevent incidents caused by operator or dispatcher errors, such as excessive speed, conflicting train movements, and failure to obey signals. The NTSB considers it a key technology to improve rail safety. The NTSB has listed minimizing operator distractions as a key safety improvement, including actions to prohibit texting and cell-phone use for drivers under 18. A distracted driving incentive grant program was established by Congress in 2012 to encourage states to enforce these regulations, but only one state qualified for a grant in FY2014 and FY2015. The Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act removed the requirement for increased fines for repeat traffic offenders, allowing more states to qualify for grants. This change may impact NTSB reauthorization proceedings. Funding for the NTSB has historically been based on a set amount. During NTSB reauthorization proceedings, actions to address transportation safety mandates are crucial. NTSB funding includes a base amount, an emergency fund for unforeseen accident costs, and supplemental appropriations for complex investigations like the TWA flight 800 incident. The existing statute maintains a $2 million emergency fund balance and allows for additional funding. The existing statute allows for the maintenance of a $2 million emergency fund for the NTSB, with authorization for additional funding up to $4 million. The NTSB has not needed to use the emergency fund or request extra appropriations in over a decade. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) is responsible for evaluating the NTSB's operations in various areas. The NTSB has been responsive to GAO evaluations and audits, implementing recommendations effectively. From 2006 to 2008, GAO made 21 recommendations, all of which were successfully implemented by 2012. In 2013, GAO noted improvements but highlighted the need for further enhancements in training center utilization. In 2013, GAO found that the NTSB had improved but needed to enhance training center utilization, safety recommendation close-out processes, interagency communications, financial management, and workforce diversity. GAO recommended developing a strategy for maximizing the cost accounting system. Current issues include staffing resources and NTSB Academy management. Legislation reauthorizing the NTSB and congressional oversight focus on staffing resources, NTSB Academy management, vehicle recorder recoverability, data privacy, and potential recorder data use. Railroad safety legislation in the 114th Congress addresses NTSB funding for accident investigations. In 2008, the NTSB requested a staff increase. The NTSB requested a 22% staff increase in 2008 to enhance its mission. Staffing has since increased by 12%, with a focus on addressing competency gaps and workforce diversity. Limited resources remain a challenge for the NTSB. The NTSB has cited limited resources as a factor in the extended duration of accident investigations and its failure to investigate some pipeline and railroad accidents, especially fatal grade crossing and trespasser accidents. Congress may debate whether additional staffing is needed to meet statutory requirements for investigating all fatal railroad accidents. The NTSB has concerns about staffing shortages and skill gaps in critical fields for accident investigation. Congress may debate the need for additional staffing to meet statutory requirements for investigating fatal railroad accidents. The NTSB faces staffing challenges in critical fields for accident investigation, particularly in the Office of Railroad, Pipeline, and Hazardous Materials. The NTSB Training Center was established at George Washington University in 2000 under the National Transportation Safety Board Amendments Act of 2000. The NTSB awarded a 20-year contract to George Washington University for a training site in Ashburn, VA. The NTSB Training Center was completed in August 2003 but has struggled to achieve financial self-sufficiency. Its main purpose is to train NTSB staff and transportation industry personnel for accident investigation and victim response. The NTSB Training Center in Ashburn, VA trains NTSB staff and transportation industry personnel for accident investigation and victim response. Despite hosting forums and meetings on transportation safety topics, revenues from fees are insufficient to cover costs. The NTSB relies on leases and rentals of its space for non-transportation safety purposes but still struggles to fully recover training center costs. The NTSB Training Center in Ashburn, VA relies on leases and rentals of its space for non-transportation safety purposes but struggles to fully recover training center costs. A 2006 GAO study concluded that the NTSB may have difficulty offsetting the training center's costs. The NTSB has been in violation of the Anti-Deficiency Act due to negotiating the lease as an operating lease instead of a capital lease. Language to remedy this situation was not included. The NTSB Training Center in Ashburn, VA faces challenges in recovering costs, with potential remedies including renegotiating the lease or vacating the space. GAO suggests obtaining a deficiency appropriation or authorizing annual lease payments. Vacating the space may be cost-effective, but the facility's benefits were not fully considered in the analysis. The NTSB Training Center in Ashburn, VA faces challenges in cost recovery, with potential solutions including renegotiating the lease or vacating the space. Past legislation did not address NTSB Academy management practices, making it a specific issue for congressional oversight. GAO found improved utilization of the training center, resulting in increased classroom usage and lease revenue, leading to improved cost recovery. The NTSB Training Center in Ashburn, VA has increased utilization and lease revenue, improving cost recovery. The annual operating deficit decreased from $6.3 million in FY2004 to $2 million-$2.5 million in FY2013-FY2015. However, the facility still does not recoup all operating costs. Congressional ability to make significant changes before the lease agreement expires may be limited. Data and voice recorders are crucial investigative tools in aviation. Data and voice recorders are important investigative tools in aviation. Two main issues exist regarding data recorders: recovery after accidents, especially in submerged aircraft and ship recorders, and privacy concerns about public disclosures and non-accident related uses of recorder data. Challenges in recovering recorders were highlighted in the Air France flight 447 crash in 2009. Several recent accidents have proven challenging in recovering flight data recorders: Air France flight 447 crashed in 2009, EgyptAir flight 804 crashed in 2016, and Malaysia Airlines flight 370 remains missing since 2014. The NTSB issued aviation safety recommendations in 2015. The NTSB issued aviation safety recommendations in 2015 after several challenging accidents in recovering flight data recorders, including Malaysia Airlines flight 370 in 2014. The recommendations urged for aircraft to be capable of transmitting data on impact location and underwater location without the need for underwater retrieval. The NTSB issued safety recommendations in 2015 for location broadcasts and flight data transmissions from accident aircraft. The Safe Aviation and Flight Emergency Tracking Act of 2015 (H.R. 753) would require large passenger aircraft to have continuous tracking technology and deployable flight recorders for timely data recovery. The Safe Aviation and Flight Emergency Tracking Act of 2015 aims to improve the timely recovery of flight data and cockpit voice recorders, following NTSB safety recommendations. The sinking of the U.S.-flag cargo vessel El Faro in 2015 highlighted concerns over locating and recovering maritime voyage data recorders, which are required for certain passenger and cargo vessels under SOLAS regulations. Under SOLAS regulations, certain passenger and cargo vessels must carry voyage data recorders, which can be fixed-mount or float-free units. New regulations require new ships to have both types of recorders with enhanced capabilities, but existing ships are not mandated to upgrade. The NTSB is involved in ensuring compliance with these regulations. New regulations require ships to have enhanced voyage data recorders, but existing vessels are not required to upgrade. Concerns over data recovery in deep water may lead to congressional interest in assisting investigators. Event recorders are aiding accident investigations in various transportation modes. The Driver Privacy Act of 2015 (S. 766) aims to restrict access to data from event data recorders in passenger vehicles to only the owner or lessee, unless authorized by a court or with consent for specific purposes. This raises concerns about privacy and the potential misuse of collected data. The bill aims to restrict access to data from event data recorders in passenger vehicles to only the owner or lessee, unless authorized by a court or with consent for specific purposes such as vehicle diagnostics, service, repair, or emergency medical response to a motor vehicle crash. The bill aims to restrict access to data from event data recorders in passenger vehicles to only the owner or lessee, unless authorized by a court or with consent for specific purposes such as vehicle diagnostics, service, repair, or emergency medical response to a motor vehicle crash. Additionally, the bill would require the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to complete a study, provide a report to Congress, and promulgate regulations concerning the appropriate amount of time event data recorders should capture and record vehicle-related data needed to investigate the causes of motor vehicle crashes. Increased interest in railroad accident investigations and safety recommendations due to derailments of freight trains carrying flammable fuels. NTSB lacks resources for required investigations, but legislation proposes funding of $6.3-$6.6 million for railroad accident investigations in FY2016-FY2018. The bill specifies authorization of appropriations to the NTSB for railroad accident investigations, with funding of $6.3-$6.6 million in FY2016-FY2019. It addresses NTSB safety recommendations, requiring plans for positive train control systems and grants for implementation. DOT will conduct a study on the effectiveness of these systems in reducing highway-rail grade crossing accidents."
