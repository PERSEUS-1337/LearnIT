Other programs like the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program and Special Milk Program offer support for healthy snacks and milk in schools. Additionally, the Child and Adult Care Food Program provides meals and snacks in child care settings. The child nutrition programs, including the National School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Program, offer support for milk in schools. Other programs like the Child and Adult Care Food Program and Summer Food Service Program provide meals and snacks in various settings. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 reauthorized these programs, with minimal impact from expirations in 2015. Lawmakers in the 114th Congress began but did not complete further actions. In the 114th Congress, lawmakers started but did not finish reauthorizing child nutrition programs, including the National School Lunch Program. Legislation (S. 3136 and H.R. 5003) was reported by the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry and the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, but ultimately died. Funding for the programs has continued through annual appropriations acts. In the 114th Congress, reauthorization legislation for child nutrition programs (S. 3136 and H.R. 5003) was reported but ultimately died. There were no significant child nutrition reauthorization efforts in the 115th Congress, but the 2018 farm bill included some provisions related to child nutrition programs. The HHFKA and child nutrition reauthorization efforts in the 114th Congress, along with topics raised during 2018 farm bill negotiations, have highlighted issues relevant for future policymaking. These issues revolve around the nutritional quality and sourcing of foods in schools, as well as access to meals through alternative options like summer meal programs and the Community Eligibility Provision. Stakeholders involved include school food authorities. The curr_chunk discusses the implementation of the Community Eligibility Provision, which provides free meals to students in certain schools. It involves stakeholders such as school food authorities, advocacy organizations, and food industry organizations. The report provides an overview of current issues in child nutrition programs, drawing examples from legislative proposals in the 114th and 115th Congresses. The curr_chunk provides a review of recent issues raised by Congress and program stakeholders, referencing legislative proposals in the 114th and 115th Congresses. CRS reports offer detailed information on child nutrition programs and reauthorization proposals. School meals must meet specific nutritional requirements for federal reimbursement, including standards for competitive foods like those sold in vending machines. These standards were last updated under the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act, which mandated USDA to update school meal standards and create new standards for competitive foods. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act mandated USDA to update school meal standards and create new standards for competitive foods, such as those sold in vending machines. The law required proposed regulations for nutrition standards within specific timeframes and provided increased federal subsidies for schools meeting the new requirements. Various organizations and stakeholders supported the nutrition standards in the HHFKA. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act mandated USDA to update school meal standards and create new standards for competitive foods. The nutrition standards were supported by various stakeholders, and the final rules were published by USDA-FNS in 2012 and 2016, based on Dietary Guidelines and Institute of Medicine recommendations. The updated standards increased fruits, vegetables, and whole grains in school meals. The updated standards for school meals increased fruits, vegetables, and whole grains while limiting calories, sodium, whole grains, and proteins. They also restricted milk to low-fat and fat-free varieties. Additionally, nutrition standards for competitive foods limited calories, sodium, and fat in non-meal foods. The nutrition standards for competitive foods limited calories, sodium, and fat in foods sold outside of meals during the school day, with exceptions for fundraisers. Implementation challenges included difficulty obtaining whole grain and low-sodium products. Some schools faced challenges implementing nutrition standards, including difficulty obtaining whole grain and low-sodium products, student acceptance issues, reduced participation, increased costs, and food waste. These issues were confirmed by studies in the first two years of implementation. The School Nutrition Association advocated for changes to the standards. In SY2012-2013 and SY2013-2014, issues with nutrition standards were identified. SNA pushed for changes while others argued for maintaining the standards for children's health. USDA made adjustments to grain, protein, milk, whole grain, and sodium requirements from SY2015-2016 through SY2018-2019. USDA implemented changes to nutrition standards for school meals from SY2015-2016 through SY2018-2019. In December 2018, a final rule was published indefinitely changing aspects of the standards for SY2019-2020, allowing flavored, low-fat milk and a 50% whole grain-rich requirement. The regulations for school meals have been modified over time, allowing exemptions for nonwhole grain-rich products and adjusting sodium limits. The nutrition standards for school meals have remained largely intact, with changes also affecting milk requirements and other beverages sold in schools. The nutrition standards for school meals have remained largely intact despite some changes, including adjustments to milk requirements and other beverages sold in schools. Legislative proposals in the 115th Congress aimed to review and revise these standards, particularly related to milk, based on research for school-age children and without adding costs. The bill aimed to revise nutrition standards for school meals, focusing on milk requirements for school-age children without adding costs. Child nutrition reauthorization proposals in the 114th Congress also sought to alter these standards, with the House committee's proposal requiring USDA to review and revise standards every three years. The bill (H.R. 5003) aimed to revise school meal standards, requiring USDA to review and update them every three years. Student fundraisers would no longer need to meet competitive food standards, and federally reimbursable meal items could be sold a la carte. The Senate committee's proposal (S. 3136) focused on revising whole grain and sodium requirements within 90 days. Negotiations resulted in revisions to school meal standards, reducing whole grain requirement to 80% and delaying sodium requirement. Fresh fruit and vegetable snacks in FFVP must be in natural state without additives, with debate on including frozen, dried, and canned options. The 2014 farm bill funded a pilot project that included canned, dried, and frozen fruits and vegetables in the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program (FFVP) in select states. 56% of pilot schools chose to incorporate these options due to difficulty obtaining, storing, and preparing fresh produce. According to the final evaluation in 2017, 56% of pilot schools incorporated canned, dried, and frozen fruits and vegetables in the FFVP. This led to decreased vegetable offerings and increased fruit offerings, but did not significantly impact vegetable consumption. However, fruit consumption declined on snack days, likely due to students eating smaller quantities of dried or canned fruit. Student participation and satisfaction with the FFVP slightly decreased during the pilot. During the pilot, student satisfaction with FFVP slightly decreased, parents' responses were mixed, and school administrators generally favored the changes. Legislative proposals to modify FFVP offerings have been considered, such as allowing CDF and pur\u00e9ed forms of fruits and vegetables and removing \"fresh\" from the program name in previous Congresses. The 114th Congress considered proposals to modify the FFVP program by allowing schools to serve \"all forms\" of fruits and vegetables, including tree nuts. The Senate committee's proposal included temporary exemptions for schools with limited resources to serve CDF fruits and vegetables, transitioning to fresh products over time. Schools participating in the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and/or School Breakfast Program (SBP) must comply with federal requirements to purchase domestic commodities or products to the maximum extent practicable, as outlined in USDA guidance. Domestic commodities or products are defined as those produced and processed substantially in the United States. USDA guidance requires schools in the National School Lunch Program to purchase domestic commodities or products, defined as those produced and processed substantially in the United States. USDA has issued regulations and guidance on implementing Buy American requirements. The USDA guidance requires schools in the National School Lunch Program to follow Buy American requirements when purchasing food with funds from the nonprofit school food service account. SFAs are encouraged to integrate Buy American into their procurement processes by monitoring the USDA catalog for appropriate products and including Buy American language in solicitations and contracts. The USDA guidance encourages schools in the National School Lunch Program to follow Buy American requirements when purchasing food. SFAs can make exceptions on a limited basis if U.S. products are not available or significantly more expensive. State agencies must review and approve any exceptions made. The 2018 farm bill requires USDA to enforce Buy American requirements for school food authorities, ensuring compliance and understanding of responsibilities within 180 days of enactment. USDA must also report to Congress on actions taken and plans for compliance. The 2018 farm bill mandates USDA to enforce Buy American requirements for school food authorities, ensuring compliance and understanding of responsibilities within 180 days of enactment. It also clarifies the definition of domestic products for USDA's enforcement purposes. The 2018 farm bill mandates USDA to enforce Buy American requirements for school food authorities, ensuring compliance and understanding of responsibilities within 180 days of enactment. Proponents of stricter requirements have cited economic and food safety reasons for domestic sourcing, expressing concern over sourcing from China. Others argue for maintaining schools' discretion in food procurement, citing availability and cost-effectiveness challenges. Summer meals are typically provided in group settings where children eat under supervision. Under current law, summer meals are usually provided in group settings through programs like SFSP and SSO. Policymakers have explored alternatives to congregate meals, especially in rural areas where onsite consumption is challenging. Reaching children in rural areas for summer meals has been reported as very difficult. The 2010 Agriculture Appropriations Act provided $85 million for demonstration projects to improve access to summer meals for children in urban and rural areas. One project, the Summer Electronic Benefit Transfer for Children (SEBTC), started in 2011 and continues in limited states and Indian Tribal Organizations. Reaching children in rural areas for summer meals is a significant challenge. The Summer EBT project, initiated in 2011, provides electronic food benefits to households with children eligible for free or reduced-price school meals. Participants receive either $30 or $60 per month on an EBT card for WIC or SNAP. Benefits can be redeemed for SNAP-eligible foods at authorized retailers. The Summer EBT project provides electronic food benefits to households with children eligible for free or reduced-price school meals through SNAP or WIC. An evaluation from FY2011 to FY2013 showed a decrease in very low food security and improved consumption of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains among participants. The Summer EBT project has shown improvements in food security and children's consumption of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Funding has been provided for Summer EBT projects, with recent grants awarded to various states and tribal nations. In summer 2018, USDA awarded grants for Summer EBT projects to various states and tribal nations, including Missouri, Nevada, Oregon, Virginia, and the Chickasaw and Cherokee nations. In FY2019, USDA-FNS announced a new strategy for grant recipients, prioritizing new states, statewide projects, and projects operating from 2019 to 2021. Proposals in the 114th and 115th Congresses aimed to expand Summer EBT. In the 114th and 115th Congresses, proposals were made to expand Summer EBT, with funding recommendations from the Obama Administration and the use of funds from the 2010 Agriculture Appropriations Act for demonstration projects like the Enhanced Summer Food Service Program (eSFSP). The Enhanced Summer Food Service Program (eSFSP) was a demonstration project funded by Act (Section 749(g) of P.L. 111-80) that took place from 2010 to 2012 in eight states. It included initiatives such as lengthening operations, adding recreational or educational activities, meal delivery for children in rural areas, and providing food backpacks for weekends and holidays. Evaluations showed increased summer meal participation rates for all initiatives. During the demonstration project funded by Act (Section 749(g) of P.L. 111-80) from 2011 to 2014, summer meal participation rates increased for all initiatives. Children in the meal delivery and backpack demonstrations had consistent food insecurity rates from summer to fall. However, caution is advised in interpreting the results due to small sample size, lack of comparison group, and potential confounding factors. Another project, authorized by the 2010 Agriculture Appropriations Act, granted exemptions from congregate feeding requirements to outdoor meal sites facing excessive heat since 2015. The 2010 Agriculture Appropriations Act granted exemptions from congregate feeding requirements to SFSP and SSO outdoor meal sites facing excessive heat each summer since 2015. Exempted sites must serve children in congregate settings on non-excessive heat days and provide meals in alternative forms on excessively hot days. USDA also offers exemptions for extreme weather conditions on a case-by-case basis. This demonstration has not been evaluated, and there have been other proposals and hearings related to congregate feeding in SFSP in recent years. In recent years, there have been proposals and hearings related to congregate feeding in SFSP. For example, in the 114th Congress, child nutrition reauthorization proposals would have allowed some rural meal sites to provide SFSP meals for offsite consumption, particularly in rural areas and nonrural areas with high eligibility for free or reduced-price meals. These proposals would have also permitted congregate feeding sites to provide meals for offsite consumption episodically. The HHFKA created the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) to provide free meals to students in schools with high proportions of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunches. Participation in CEP has increased since SY2014-2015, with over 20,700 schools participating as of SY2016-2017. As of SY2016-2017, over 20,700 schools participated in the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP), which is roughly 22% of NSLP schools. CEP has received support for improving meal access, reducing stigma, and cutting administrative costs. Some have tried to restrict schools' eligibility for CEP, as seen in the 114th Congress. In the 114th Congress, the House's child nutrition bill aimed to restrict schools' eligibility for the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) to target resources better. CEP has caused data issues for other federal and state programs, like the Title I-A program, which uses lunch data for eligibility and funding. The Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) has caused data issues for federal and state programs like Title I-A, which use free and reduced-price lunch data for funding allocations. Students may qualify for free, reduced-price, or full-price meals, leading to concerns about unpaid meal costs and schools' responses. The issue of students not paying their meal costs has led to schools implementing \"lunch shaming\" practices, such as taking away hot meals or imposing restrictions on students until debts are repaid. Many schools resort to lunch shaming practices like restricting students from school events or using visual indicators of meal debt. Limited national data is available on the prevalence of these practices, but school districts report financial burdens due to unpaid meal costs. Student payments for meals are crucial revenue sources for school food programs. Reduced-price meals are a key revenue source for school food programs, and schools must collect unpaid meal funds to cover costs. Congress and USDA have taken steps since 2010 to address the issue of unpaid meal charges, including examining state and school district policies. The USDA reviewed policies on unpaid meal charges and prepared a report on national standards feasibility. The report recommended updating policy guidance and distributing best practices to support decision-making by states. USDA-FNS required SFAs to establish a written meal charge policy by July 1, 2017, including guidelines for handling unpaid meals. They also provided clarification through webinars and a best practice guide based on a study and Request for Information on \"Unpaid Meal Charges.\" The USDA recommended that meal charge policies be determined at the school and district levels based on findings from a study and Request for Information on \"Unpaid Meal Charges.\" Responses indicated varying levels of formality and enforcement, with a preference for local control expressed by school officials. In the 115th Congress, lunch shaming and unpaid meal costs were discussed, with a provision in the FY2018 appropriations law prohibiting discrimination against children eligible for free or reduced-price meals. Local control of meal charge policies was preferred by school and district officials, while national advocacy groups favored national standards. In the 115th Congress, legislative proposals like the Anti-Lunch Shaming Act of 2017 aimed to address lunch shaming and unpaid meal costs in schools. States have also enacted laws to tackle these issues, such as Illinois requiring schools to serve regular meals to students unable to pay. In 2018, Illinois passed legislation requiring schools to provide regular meals to students who cannot pay and allowing districts to seek state assistance for debts over $500. The HHFKA imposed new rules on pricing of paid lunches for NSLP-participating SFAs, mandating price reviews and potential increases, with the option to use nonfederal funds to meet requirements. The HHFKA imposed new rules on pricing of paid lunches for NSLP-participating SFAs, requiring gradual price increases based on a formula or using nonfederal funds to meet the requirements. This was intended to ensure that children receiving free and reduced-price lunches receive the full value of federal funds, as federal subsidies were previously cross-subsidizing other aspects of the meals programs. Some schools may need to raise prices for paid lunches to match federal reimbursements, which are mixed into the same account as free and reduced-price lunches. This could potentially reduce participation in paid lunches. The paid lunch equity formula requires prices to eventually exceed the difference between federal reimbursements for free and paid lunches. If not, schools must increase prices over time to make up the difference. For example, in SY2018-2019, federal reimbursement was $3.37 for free lunches and $0.37 for paid lunches for some schools. The federal reimbursement for free lunches was $3.37 and $0.37 for paid lunches in SY2018-2019. Schools must gradually increase the price of paid lunches if it is below $3.00 to match federal reimbursements. Additionally, revenue from competitive foods must accrue to the School Food Authority-run National School Food Service Account. The law requires revenue from competitive foods to go to the School Food Authority-run National School Food Service Account, preventing it from being used for other school purposes. USDA implemented this rule in SY2011-2012 with some flexibility, and provided exemptions for financially stable SFAs from SY2013-2014 to SY2017-2018. The USDA provided exemptions for financially stable SFAs from SY2013-2014 to SY2017-2018. Legislation in the 114th Congress proposed eliminating paid lunch equity requirements. In the 114th Congress, proposals were made to eliminate paid lunch equity requirements in child nutrition programs. The House committee suggested removing the requirements, while the Senate committee proposed replacing them with a broader \"non-federal revenue target.\" In the 114th Congress, proposals were made to eliminate paid lunch equity requirements in child nutrition programs, with the House committee suggesting removal and the Senate committee proposing a broader \"non-federal revenue target.\" Various programs like FFVP, HHFKA, NSFSA, NSLP, SBP, SFA, SFSP, SMP, SSO, Summer EBT, SY, and USDA-FNS are involved in school nutrition."
