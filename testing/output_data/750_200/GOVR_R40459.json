    "content": "The Department of Defense (DOD) fuel consumption fluctuates annually based on mission changes. DOD may use up to 1% of US refined petroleum products, with foreign purchases potentially doubling consumption. The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) procures fuel for all DOD services and agencies, both in the US and overseas, dating back to World War II. The Defense Fuel Supply Center (DFSC) was established in 1964 to manage DOD's petroleum products and coal. In 1998, it became the Defense Energy Support Center with an expanded mission to manage energy products. DESC awards fuel contracts based on the lowest cost to delivery point. The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) manages a comprehensive portfolio of energy products, including bulk petroleum products, ships' bunker fuel, refueling at commercial airports, and post-camp-and-station fuel procurement. DOD is the largest consumer of petroleum products, primarily JP-8, JP-5, and diesel fuel. This report summarizes DOD's fuel purchases from FY2000 to FY2008. The report summarizes DOD's fuel purchases from FY2000 to FY2008, comparing spending to overall DOD spending, prices to commercial equivalents, and quantities to U.S. refined petroleum production. It discusses refining, refineries supplying jet fuel, DESC's procurement practices, and recent legislation affecting fuel procurement. The report discusses DOD's fuel procurement practices and recent legislation directing the consideration of alternative fuels. High fuel prices have stimulated interest in producing alternative fuels, but no commercial projects have been established yet. Legislation aims to prevent federal agencies from spending taxpayer dollars on new fuel sources. Legislation aims to prevent federal agencies from spending taxpayer dollars on new fuel sources that exacerbate global warming. Proposed rules for greenhouse gas emission reporting may minimally impact refineries. Recently introduced legislation to cap greenhouse gas emissions could affect refinery operations and the industry's responsiveness to DOD's fuel requirements. DOD's fuel consumption varies based on mission changes. DESC's bulk fuel purchases mainly consist of JP-8 jet fuel. DESC's fuel consumption varies annually in response to mission changes. Bulk fuel purchases consist mainly of JP-8 jet fuel, with the Air Force and Army as primary consumers. Total fuel purchases peaked in FY2003 at 145.1 million barrels during the Iraq invasion. JP-8 purchases peaked in FY2004 and have been declining since. DESC's fuel purchases peaked during the Iraq invasion, with JP-8 representing a significant portion. Overall DESC fuel expenditures increased by nearly 500% from FY2000 to FY2008, despite only a 30% increase in actual volumes purchased. DESC's purchases may not align with DOD's actual consumption, as fuel may be drawn from storage or replenished with purchases. The Department of Defense (DOD) may draw fuel from storage to supplement demand and replenish fuel stores with purchases. DOD maintains a fuel \"war reserve\" for contingencies. Fuel costs continued to rise due to increasing crude oil prices and refining margins, with the average cost of petroleum products purchased increasing by nearly 370% from FY2000 to FY2008. The cost of petroleum products purchased by the Department of Defense rose significantly from $34.62 per barrel in FY2000 to over $133 per barrel in FY2008, an increase of nearly 370%. This increase was influenced by rising crude oil prices and refining margins. Jet and diesel fuel prices also increased during this period, leading to a higher margin between refiners' crude oil cost and refined product prices. The Department of Defense responded to increasing petroleum product costs by purchasing commercial jet fuel at lower prices than military specification fuel. They also increased purchases of alternate jet fuels and diesel fuel. Outlays represent cash payments made to fulfill government obligations in a fiscal year, which may be incurred over several years due to budgeting and contracting processes. From FY2000 through FY2007, total defense outlays increased 200%, with Operation and Maintenance spending increasing by 231%. Fuel costs also rose by 497% during the same period, mainly due to escalating crude oil prices. Fuel costs increased by 497% from FY2000 to FY2008, representing 1.2% of DOD's spending in FY2000 and doubling to 3% by FY2008. The U.S. produces one-third of its crude oil, with the rest supplied by other countries like Canada, Saudi Arabia, and Mexico. Refineries used to rely on steady supplies of light sweet crude oil when U.S. production was higher. Refineries used to rely on steady supplies of light sweet crude oil like West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for pricing. With diminishing supply, refineries now turn to heavier sour crudes. Crude oil contains components for gasoline, kerosene, and diesel fuel, separating in a refinery's distillation tower. Many refineries process straight-run product streams from this initial refining process. Refineries process crude oil into various products like gasoline, kerosene, and diesel fuel using distillation towers. The residuum left after distillation is further processed into products like gasoline and middle distillates using heat, pressure, hydrogen, and catalysts. Refineries can also produce jet fuel and diesel fuel, with jet fuel having more stringent specifications. Refineries are designed to process specific grades of crude oil, such as light sweet or heavy sour. Refineries are set up to process specific grades of crude oil, such as light sweet or heavy sour. Light sweet crude is preferred for gasoline refining due to its easier refining process. Different types of refineries, like topping and hydroskimming, separate crude oil into various petroleum products through distillation. Different types of refineries process specific grades of crude oil through distillation. Topping refineries produce naphtha, while hydroskimming refineries run light sweet crude to produce gasoline. Cracking refineries add vacuum distillation and catalytic cracking to produce light and middle distillates from light sour crude. Coking refineries, on the other hand, use coking/resid destruction to process medium/sour crude oil. Atmospheric distillation capacity determines a refinery's crude oil processing limit. The Nelson Complexity Index rates the proportion of secondary processes to primary distillation capacity in refineries, measuring their complexity. It ranges from 2 for hydroskimming refineries to 5 for cracking refineries. Refineries use coking for medium/sour crude oil processing, with atmospheric distillation capacity setting the processing limit. The Nelson Complexity Index rates the proportion of secondary processes to primary distillation capacity in refineries, with varying values for different types of refineries. U.S. refineries have an average index of 10, with only 59 having coking capacity. Gulf Coast refineries with a complexity of 12 to 13 can yield up to 8% jet fuel and over 30% diesel fuel. Refineries are upgrading their processes to handle heavier sour crude oils. Changes in crude oil supplies have led refineries to upgrade their processes to handle heavier sour crude oils. The EPA has mandated a reduction in sulfur content of diesel fuel, limiting it to 15 ppm by the end of 2010, creating \"ultra-low sulfur diesel\" (ULSD). Regulations require measuring sulfur content at retail outlets, not refineries. Petroleum product pipelines transport various fuels in sequence. In the late 1980s, DOD adopted the \"single battlefield fuel\" concept, aiming to use the same fuel for aircraft and ground equipment within a theater. This led to the steady substitution of JP-8 for diesel fuel in land-based operations. Refiners are challenged to produce lower sulfur diesel fuel to prevent additional sulfur pickup during pipeline transit, or to reprocess contaminated \"transmix\" between different fuel slugs. The DOD adopted the \"single battlefield fuel\" concept in the late 1980s, transitioning to JP-8 for land-based operations to streamline fuel supply chains. The U.S Army follows ASTM standard MIL-DTL-83133E for JP-8 to ensure quality. The U.S. Army follows ASTM standard MIL-DTL-83133E for JP-8 fuel, limiting sulfur content to 3,000 ppm. EPA guidelines recognize the need for tactical vehicles to operate on JP-8 or JP-5 fuel. EPA has not indicated plans to reduce sulfur content in jet fuel. The EPA has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from automobiles under the Clean Air Act. In 2009, they found that greenhouse gases contribute to air pollution that may endanger public health. Recently, the EPA proposed a rule for Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases, including petroleum refineries. The EPA proposed a rule for Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases, including petroleum refineries emitting 205 million metric tons of CO2 annually, representing 3% of U.S. GHG emissions. Compliance costs could be minimal, but the rule sets the stage for future regulations capping emissions from refineries and other industrial sources. The rule sets the basis for future legislation and regulations to cap GHG emissions from refineries and other industrial sources. Bills like H.R. 2454 aim to establish a cap-and-trade system to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, allowing trading of emissions permits. This would force industries to reduce emissions by 83% over time or purchase allowances from others. The rule sets the basis for future legislation and regulations to cap GHG emissions from refineries and other industrial sources. Currently, 142 refineries operate in the United States, with the Energy Information Administration reporting their aggregate kerosene and jet fuel production. DESC awards contracts under its fuel solicitations to top domestic suppliers like Shell, Valero Marketing and Supply Company, ExxonMobil, and BP Corporation. Between FY2003 and FY2008, DESC reported its top 4 domestic suppliers as Shell, Valero Marketing and Supply Company, ExxonMobil, and BP Corporation. These companies operate 31 refineries in the United States with a total crude capacity of nearly 6 million barrels per day. The refineries have an average Nelson Complexity Index rating of 10 and two-thirds have coking capacity for medium sour crude. The number of US refineries decreased from 155 to 141 between 2000 and 2009, but atmospheric crude oil distillation capacity increased from 17.8 million to 18.6 million barrels. In 2009, the number of US refineries decreased from 155 to 141, but atmospheric crude oil distillation capacity increased to 18.6 million barrels per day. Diesel fuel capacity also increased to 3.5 million bpd. Refineries above the median capacity make up 85% of overall US refining capacity, with Gulf Coast refineries yielding jet and diesel fuel based on the processed crude oil type. The majority of U.S. refining capacity is held by refineries above the median capacity, with Gulf Coast refineries producing jet and diesel fuel based on the type of crude oil processed. U.S. refineries produce significantly more commercial jet fuel than military jet fuel, with military jet fuel making up a small percentage of overall U.S. refined petroleum products. DESC's jet fuel purchases exceed U.S. refining industry output, with U.S. refineries sometimes supplying less than 50% of DESC's jet fuel. To meet demand, DESC buys commercial jet fuels like Jet A, which is upgraded to military specification, reducing spending due to lower prices. DESC purchases jet fuels, such as Jet A, which is upgraded to military specification, reducing spending due to lower prices. The lack of U.S. refining capacity does not compromise DOD's fuel supply, with DESC sourcing fuel from closer refineries and foreign suppliers to support U.S. forces outside the continental United States. The Department of Defense (DOD) purchases fuel through contracts with foreign refineries and suppliers to support U.S. forces outside the continental United States. DOD's authority to procure fuel stems from the Navy's power, allowing the Secretary of the Navy to buy fuel best suited for its intended purpose under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 7229. This section replaced 34 U.S.C. 580, enabling the Armed Services Petroleum Purchasing Agency to negotiate fuel contracts for the Navy and consolidated fuel requirements. The Department of Defense (DOD) purchases fuel through contracts with foreign refineries and suppliers to support U.S. forces outside the continental United States. DESC now relies on general procurement authority to buy fuel for the armed forces, awarding contracts and purchasing fuel in a one-step process under the Defense Working Capital Fund (DWCF). This allows DOD to take advantage of price breaks for large quantity purchases. The Department of Defense (DOD) purchases fuel through contracts with foreign refineries and suppliers to support U.S. forces outside the continental United States. DESC relies on general procurement authority to buy fuel for the armed forces, taking advantage of price breaks for large quantity purchases. Acquisition is defined as the process of acquiring property or services with appropriated funds, while procurement includes all stages from determining a need to contract completion and closeout. The acquisition process for property or services begins with determining a need and ends with contract completion and closeout. Title 10 U.S.C. Chapter 137 \u2013 Procurement governs the military acquisition process, with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) in Title 48 CFR as the primary document for federal agency acquisition regulations. The Defense Acquisition Regulation System (DFARS) in 48 CFR Parts 201 through 299 is used by the Department of Defense (DOD). DESC typically awards one-year bulk-fuel contracts and multi-year direct delivery fuel contracts using fixed-price contracts with economic price adjustment clauses. These provisions are used when future costs are unpredictable due to general economic factors. DESC uses economic price adjustment provisions in contracts for supplies, such as refined petroleum products. They are eligible for multi-year contracting provisions, and DESC has adopted instructions for entering into multiyear contracts for various types of petroleum products. DOD and military departments can enter initial five-year contracts for liquid fuels or natural gas storage, handling, or distribution. DOD and military departments can enter initial five-year contracts for storage, handling, or distribution of liquid fuels or natural gas under 10 U.S.C \u00a72922, with options for up to three five-year renewals. Multiyear contracts for supplies or services can span one to five program years, contingent on fund appropriations. Multiyear contracts allow for purchasing multiple years' worth of products or services without needing to exercise an option each year, contingent on fund appropriations. This differs from multiple year contracts, which have a term of more than one year regardless of fiscal year funding. Multiyear contract authority for supplies under 10 U.S.C. 2306b allows DOD agencies to enter into contracts promoting national security and resulting in cost savings. If Congress does not appropriate funds for succeeding years, the contract must be canceled. Multiyear contracting under 48 CFR 17.105-Uses allows agencies to enter into contracts for supplies promoting national security and cost savings. Contracts must be canceled if funds are not appropriated by Congress for succeeding years. The contract cannot exceed $500 million until approved by the Secretary of Defense. The Secretary of Defense can authorize multiyear contracts for supplies, including fuel derived from coal, oil shale, and tar sands under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2922d. The contract cannot exceed $500 million until approved by the Secretary of Defense, who also has waiver authority over acquisition of alternative fuels. The Secretary of Defense has broad waiver authority over acquisition of alternative fuels, including petroleum, natural gas, coal, and coke. The Secretary can waive provisions of law related to contract formation, terms, and performance if market conditions will impact DOD's fuel acquisition. The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) has not determined whether it could waive the five-year limit on multi-year contracts for fuel procurement. DESC is cautious about jeopardizing its delegation or losing sales authority granted under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2922e by exercising the waiver authority. Delivery prices are based on the \"lowest laid down cost\" to the government. DESC determines contract delivery price based on \"lowest laid down cost\" to the government, including a surcharge for operating costs. Fuel is redistributed to bases from Defense Fuel Supply Points. Additional costs may be incurred for tactical fuel delivery methods. DOD had not previously factored these hidden costs into fuel pricing. The Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for FY2009 requires analyses and force planning processes to consider fuel logistics costs in acquisition processes. It also appoints a director responsible for overseeing energy requirements for military forces and weapons. The Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for FY2009 mandates considering fuel logistics costs in acquisition processes and appoints a director for overseeing military energy requirements. DOD faced a 500% increase in fuel costs over the past decade due to rising crude oil prices, impacting training and operations. The Air Force had to reduce funding for training due to high fuel costs, representing a significant portion of DOD's spending. Unlike the airline industry, DOD cannot pass on costs and relies on supplemental appropriations to cover increased expenses. DOD relies on supplemental appropriations to cover increased fuel costs, exploring options like fuel hedging and using commercial Jet A fuel to reduce expenses and expand supplies. The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) has implemented a business model using fixed-price contracts with economic price adjustment clauses to manage fuel costs effectively. This approach allows DESC to benefit from fluctuations in fuel prices, reducing risk and ensuring flexibility to meet changing operational requirements. DESC uses fixed-price contracts with economic price adjustment clauses to manage fuel costs effectively. This approach limits risk by adjusting prices based on market rates, but does not control costs during rapid price increases. Airlines like Southwest use hedging strategies, such as buying futures contracts, to minimize the risk of future fuel price increases. Southwest Airlines hedged fuel prices at $51/barrel during peak oil prices in 2008. The Defense Business Board considered hedging DOD fuel purchases in commercial markets but favored \"no-market\" hedging through the Interior Department. Interior Department oil revenues could offset increasing DOD fuel costs during oil price spikes. The Defense Business Board considered using Interior Department oil revenues to offset increasing DOD fuel costs during crude oil price spikes. DOD could request legislative authority to transfer funds between Interior and Defense depending on which department benefits from price changes. However, most of Interior's revenues come from Outer Continental Shelf leases, with royalties-in-kind paid by OCS lessees. The Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) lessees pay royalties-in-kind, delivering oil to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) created by Congress in response to the 1970s Arab oil embargo. The SPR, when filled to capacity, represents roughly 70 days of imported supply and can be drawn down through sales or exchanges. During the 1991 Persian Gulf War, the SPR played a crucial role. During the 1991 Persian Gulf War, President George H.W. Bush's drawdown authorization led to a rapid decline in crude oil prices. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported in 2006 that 40% of crude oil refined in U.S. refineries was heavier than that stored in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). Refineries processing heavy oil cannot operate at full capacity with lighter oils, and the types of oil in the SPR are not fully compatible with many vulnerable refineries. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) may not be fully effective in mitigating oil supply disruptions for vulnerable refineries. Refineries processing heavy oil, which is not compatible with SPR oil, could see a 5% decrease in refining throughput. The SPR does not have a defined role in addressing Department of Defense fuel supply disruptions. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) may not fully support Department of Defense (DOD) fuel supply disruptions due to operational limitations in producing jet fuel. DOD may consider alternatives for crude oil procurement as per the 2005 Energy Policy Act, but federal agencies are restricted from procuring alternative fuels by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-140) prohibits federal agencies from procuring alternative fuels unless life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions are equivalent to conventional petroleum sources. This provision aims to prevent taxpayer dollars from funding new fuel sources that worsen global warming. The Air Force abandoned plans for a coal-to-liquid fuel plant in Montana, but DESC is interested in a pilot program. The Air Force has abandoned plans for a CTL fuel plant in Montana, but DESC is interested in a pilot program for synthetic fuels to support DOD JP-8 fuel requirements in Alaska. Despite declining crude oil prices, the possibility of supply shortages and price spikes remains. Policy and economics currently hinder the use of fossil-based alternatives. DOD is focusing on efficiency and may report on the fully burdened cost of fuel for military operations to Congress. DOD is shifting towards efficiency and may report on the fully burdened cost of fuel for military operations to Congress. Congress may also be concerned about the refining sector's lack of responsiveness to DOD's procurement announcements during periods of high petroleum prices. Refinery operators may question the value of emission credits in response to proposed greenhouse gas emission caps. Congress may worry about potential refinery shutdowns impacting defense fuel supply. In the long term, Congress may be concerned about potential refinery shutdowns impacting defense fuel supply. Background information on alternative fuel sources and greenhouse gas legislation is available in CRS reports. Gas Legislation: Summary and Analysis of H.R. 2454 as Passed by the House of Representatives. Avgas is high octane fuel for light aircraft, DFM is used in ship propulsion plants, DF2 is primary fuel for ground vehicles. FSII is Fuel Systems Icing Inhibitor, FOB is a trade term for delivery of goods on board a vessel. The curr_chunk discusses trade terms related to the delivery of goods on board a vessel designated by the buyer. It also mentions Jet A-1 as a civilian-aviation fuel. Jet A-1 (JA1) is a civilian-aviation kerosene-based turbine fuel with ASTM specification D1655 (Jet A-1) and NATO designation F-35. Jet A is a similar type of jet fuel with a higher freeze point, while Jet B is a distillate covering naphtha and kerosene fractions. Jet B is a distillate fuel with a higher freeze point maximum (-40\u00b0C) compared to Jet A-1. It is more difficult to handle due to its higher flammability and is mainly used in very cold climates for better cold weather performance. JP-4 is the military equivalent of Jet B with additional corrosion inhibitor and anti-icing additives, meeting U.S. Military Specification MIL-DTL-5624U Grade JP-4. JP-5 is a kerosene-based fuel developed for military aircraft stationed aboard aircraft carriers, with a higher flash-point of 140\u00b0F. It meets the U.S. Military Specification MIL-DTL-5624 U and NATO code F-44. JP-8 is the military equivalent of Jet A-1 with corrosion and icing inhibitors. The Air Force switched to JP-8 in 1996 for safety and combat survivability. It is less flammable and hazardous than JP-4, containing less benzene and n-hexane. JP-8 has a stronger smell and is oily to the touch, while JP-4 is more. JP-8 is a military fuel similar to Jet A-1, with less benzene and n-hexane than JP-4. It has a stronger smell, is oily to the touch, and has an ASTM specification of MIL-DTL-83133. JP-8+100 includes an additive for increased thermal stability and is used in diesel-powered tactical ground vehicles. Multiyear contracting is a special method to acquire known requirements in quantities and total cost not over planned requirements for up to five years unless otherwise authorized by statute. It may be used in sealed bidding for non-tactical ground vehicles. Naphtha is a petroleum distillate used in gasoline production, catalytically reformed for higher octane. Multiyear contracts must adhere to OMB Circulars for agency funding."
