    "title": "AB 2362",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Existing law requires landlords to provide written notification to tenants before applying pesticides in certain ways without a licensed pest control operator. The bill aims to ensure that owners and tenants in common interest developments are notified in writing before pesticides are applied by the homeowner association or its agents, similar to the notification required when pesticides are applied by a licensed pest control operator. Section 4777 of the Civil Code defines terms related to pesticide application in common interest developments, including \"adjacent separate interest,\" \"authorized agent,\" \"broadcast application,\" and \"electronic delivery.\" In common interest developments, terms related to pesticide application are defined, including \"electronic delivery\" for sending documents electronically, \"licensed pest control operator\" for those authorized to apply pesticides, \"pest\" as a living organism causing damage, and \"pesticide\" as a substance used to control pests. An association or its agent must provide written notice to owners and tenants before applying pesticides, including information on the pests to be controlled and the pesticide product to be used. State law requires that you be given information on the pest to be controlled and the pesticide product to be used. CAUTION \u2013 PESTICIDES ARE TOXIC CHEMICALS. Certain pesticides can be used without a license if used properly. Risks depend on exposure, so minimize exposure. If experiencing symptoms after pesticide application, contact a healthcare provider or Poison Control. For Health Questions, contact the County Health Department. For Regulatory Information, contact the Department of Pesticide Regulation at 916-324-4100. The association must provide notice at least 48 hours before applying pesticides, including the approximate date, time, and frequency of application. The notification should state that these details are subject to change. At least 48 hours before pesticide application in a common area, the association must post written notice or provide individual notice to adjacent owners and tenants. If the pest poses an immediate threat to health and safety, the association must post written notice within one hour after pesticide application. Notice to tenants can be provided through mail, personal delivery, or electronic delivery if an email address is available. Upon receipt of written notification, the owner or tenant may agree to immediate pesticide application through mail, personal delivery, or electronic delivery. Prior to receiving written notification, the association or authorized agent can orally agree to immediate pesticide application if requested by the owner or tenant. A written notice must be left at the separate interest before the pesticide application. The association or authorized agent can orally agree to immediate pesticide application if requested by the owner or tenant. A written notice must be provided to any owner or tenant affected by the pesticide application, and a copy of the notice must be attached to the board meeting minutes following the application."
