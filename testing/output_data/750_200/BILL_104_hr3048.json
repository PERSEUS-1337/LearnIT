    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Regulatory Flexibility Amendments Act of 1996\". Judicial review is addressed in the Act. The \"Regulatory Flexibility Amendments Act of 1996\" addresses judicial review in Section 611 of title 5, United States Code, allowing affected small entities to petition for review of final rules that do not have a significant economic impact on them within one year of the rule's effective date. Affected small entities can petition for judicial review of certification or analysis under section 604 within one year of the analysis being made public, even if an agency delays issuing a final regulatory flexibility analysis under section 608(b). Affected small entities can petition for judicial review within one year of the analysis being made public. The term 'affected small entity' refers to a small entity adversely affected by the final rule. This subsection does not affect the court's authority to stay the effective date of a rule. If the agency certifies that a rule will not have a significant economic impact on small entities, the court may order the agency to prepare a final rule. The court may order the agency to prepare a final regulatory flexibility analysis if it determines that the certification was not in accordance with the law. If the agency's final regulatory flexibility analysis was found to be prepared without following the requirements, corrective action may be ordered by the court. The court may order the agency to prepare a final regulatory flexibility analysis if it determines that the analysis was not prepared in accordance with the law. If the agency fails to prepare the required analysis or take corrective action within the specified period, the court may stay the rule or grant appropriate relief. The court may stay a rule or grant relief as deemed appropriate under section 604 requirements. Prejudicial error must be considered in any determination or relief granted. A regulatory flexibility analysis for a rule is part of the record for judicial review. Judicial review of other impact statements required by law is not barred. The amendment allows judicial review of impact statements required by law. It applies to final agency rules issued after the enactment of the Act. SEC. 3. RULES COMMENTED ON BY SBA CHIEF COUNSEL FOR ADVOCACY. The SBA Chief Counsel for Advocacy must be provided with proposed rules and initial regulatory flexibility analysis by agencies before publication of general notice of proposed rulemaking. The Small Business Administration requires agencies to provide the Chief Counsel for Advocacy with proposed rules and initial regulatory flexibility analysis before publication. The Chief Counsel for Advocacy may provide a written statement on the effect of a proposed rule on small entities. The agency must publish this statement and its response in the Federal Register when issuing a general notice of proposed rulemaking. Any proposed rules issued by Federal banking agencies, the National Credit Union Administration, or the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight are subject to a special rule to ensure the safety and soundness of federally insured depository institutions, credit unions, and government sponsored housing enterprises. The safety and soundness of federally insured depository institutions, credit unions, and government sponsored housing enterprises are exempt from certain requirements. Section 603(a) of title 5, United States Code, is amended accordingly. Congress believes that the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration should have the ability to appear as amicus curiae in court cases reviewing rules."
