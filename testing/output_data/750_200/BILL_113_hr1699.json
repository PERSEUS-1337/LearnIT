    "content": "The \"Genetically Engineered Food Right-to-Know Act\" is the short title of this legislation. Its purpose and findings are outlined in the following sections. The \"Genetically Engineered Food Right-to-Know Act\" aims to establish a standard for labeling foods produced using genetic engineering, including fish, to inform consumers about the production process. Congress recognizes the material changes in genetically engineered food and the right of individuals to know if their food was produced using genetic engineering. Individuals in the United States have the right to know if their food was genetically engineered for health, economic, environmental, religious, and ethical reasons. Over 60 countries, including the United Kingdom, European Union, South Korea, Japan, Brazil, Australia, India, and China, require labeling of genetically engineered food. Codex Alimentarius, the food standards organization of the United Nations, adopted a text in 2011 regarding genetically engineered food disclosure. In 2011, Codex Alimentarius adopted a text allowing governments to decide on labeling genetically engineered foods. Mandatory identification can preserve economic value in exports and sensitive markets. SEC. 3. AMENDMENTS TO THE FEDERAL FOOD, DRUG, AND COSMETIC ACT. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to require clear disclosure of genetically engineered ingredients in food, with exceptions for restaurant food, medical food, and certain other foods. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to require clear disclosure of genetically engineered ingredients in food, with exceptions for restaurant food, medical food, and certain other foods. Genetic engineering involves in vitro nucleic acid techniques for food production. The term 'genetic engineering' involves in vitro nucleic acid techniques, including recombinant DNA and fusion of cells beyond taxonomic families to overcome natural barriers. The term 'genetically engineered' is used with respect to food labeling requirements. The term 'genetically engineered' refers to organisms produced through intentional genetic engineering for human consumption. 'Genetically engineered ingredient' is a material derived from genetically engineered organisms used as an ingredient in food. The term 'genetically engineered ingredient' refers to a material derived from organisms that have been genetically engineered, regardless of detectable molecular changes or the organism's suitability for human consumption. This definition is included in an amendment to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to include a provision regarding guaranty for misbranded food violations. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to include a provision regarding guaranty for misbranded food violations, specifically focusing on the requirements for a recipient to establish a guaranty or undertaking related to non-genetically engineered food received from a person residing in the United States. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to include a provision regarding guaranty for misbranded food violations. Recipients establishing a guaranty related to non-genetically engineered food are exempt from penalties regardless of how they use the food. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to include a provision regarding guaranty for misbranded food violations. No person can avoid responsibility for misbranded food violations by transferring liability to another party through a contract, except for requiring a guaranty. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act prohibits transferring liability for misbranded food violations to another party through a contract, except for requiring a guaranty. The Act also defines 'genetically engineered' and 'genetically engineered ingredient' and includes provisions for false guaranty. No person shall be penalized for a misbranded food violation involving genetically engineered material if they are an agricultural producer and the violation occurred due to food grown, raised, or produced by them that does not contain genetically engineered material. The agricultural producer will not be penalized for a misbranded food violation if their food, not containing genetically engineered material, is contaminated unintentionally with genetically engineered material, except in cases of negligence. The Secretary must establish labeling regulations within 1 year of the Act's enactment, excluding agricultural producers from penalties for unintentional contamination with genetically engineered material, except in cases of negligence."
