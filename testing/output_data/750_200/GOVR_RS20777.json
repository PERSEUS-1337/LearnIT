The new law caused a sharp drop in filings in 2006, but numbers rose steadily until 2010, exceeding 1.5 million. The long-term impact of BAPCPA on reducing filings remains uncertain. Bankruptcy filings rose steadily from 2006 to 2010, exceeding 1.5 million. The impact of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act (BAPCPA) on reducing filings is still unclear. Household debt is mainly comprised of mortgage debt and consumer credit, with consumer credit including revolving credit (credit card debt) and non-revolving debt (auto and college loans). Consumer credit includes revolving credit (credit card debt) and non-revolving debt (auto and college loans). Mortgage debt is borrowing secured by real estate, with a subcategory of home equity lending. Federal Reserve estimates show the burden of debt service, which rose steadily over the past decade until the 2007 recession and financial crisis. The debt burden figures in Table 2 fluctuate within a narrow range from 10.80% to 13.93%, gradually increasing since the 1980s. Despite a decline in debt service ratio since 2007, there has not been a significant reduction in bankruptcy rates. Interest rates, especially mortgage rates, have decreased in recent years. The debt burden has been gradually increasing since the 1980s, with a slight decline in the debt service ratio since 2007. Despite historically low interest rates, the ratio of debt outstanding to income has been rising, indicating a potential increase in bankruptcy filings. The debt burden has been increasing since the 1980s, with a slight decline in the debt service ratio since 2007. Further increases in bankruptcy filings may occur if interest rates rise suddenly. Household debt has risen without a proportional increase in interest payments, leading to varying financial situations among families. The data from Table 3 based on the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances shows the high distress rate among lower-income families struggling with debt repayment, leading to increased bankruptcy filings. There is no clear trend explaining the rise in personal bankruptcy despite the varying financial situations among families. The data from Table 2 shows no clear trend explaining the rise in personal bankruptcy filings, with little change in distress levels among all families from 1998 to 2007. However, there was a notable increase in bankruptcy filings among families in the upper income percentiles, possibly due to increased mortgage debt taken on during the housing boom. The question remains why families at or below the national median income take on high levels of debt leading to bankruptcy. Some explanations point to vulnerable populations such as the sick, uninsured, divorced, or residents of states without mandatory insurance. The rise in consumer bankruptcy filings lacks a consensus explanation, with some attributing it to debtor-friendly bankruptcy codes incentivizing excessive borrowing, while others blame marketing strategies of credit card issuers. The 2005 bankruptcy reform aimed to address these issues, but controversy remains. In December 2007, the U.S. economy entered a recession amidst global financial panic. Household debt levels fell in three out of four categories, with a decline in debt balances continuing for 11 quarters. Home equity and credit card debt saw the biggest percentage decline, while mortgage debt accounted for most of the drop in dollar terms. In December 2007, the U.S. economy entered a recession with household debt levels falling in three out of four categories. Home equity and credit card debt led the decline on a percentage basis, while mortgage debt accounted for most of the drop in dollar terms. Factors contributing to the fall in debt balances include households paying down debt, borrowing less, increased uncollectible debt write-offs by lenders, and tightened credit standards for new loans. Mortgage balances have decreased due to modifications, negotiations reducing principal outstanding, and foreclosed homes being sold for less than the old mortgage amount. Causes and implications of deleveraging are significant.
