FINDINGS.\" Congress finds that United States workers at marine facilities and onboard vessels must carry a Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC) under the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002. Nearly two million transportation workers have obtained TWICs to date. Nearly two million transportation workers have obtained a TWIC, which grants access to secure areas of MTSA-regulated vessels and facilities. The TWIC costs $132.50 and is valid for five years, requiring renewal with an additional payment and trips to an enrollment center. The TWIC enrollment process requires workers to make multiple trips to an enrollment center and pay $132.50 for a new card. This process is not mandated by law but is driven by a DHS policy decision. The TWIC enrollment process aligns with the FIPS-201 standard, but DHS may deviate from it when necessary. Unlike other government credentials, TWIC may follow alternative approaches. The TWIC program may deviate from the FIPS-201 standard, as it serves as a work permit for a mobile private sector workforce. Possession of a TWIC does not automatically grant access to secure areas without Coast Guard authorization. DHS has the authority to develop alternative processes for TWIC. DHS has the authority to develop an alternative process for TWIC enrollment and issuance, allowing for mail distribution of secure identity documents. Congress mandated a final rule for TWIC biometric readers by August 2010, which has not been issued yet. SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS. Congress believes urgent reform is needed for the TWIC application process by the end of 2012 to avoid burdens on US workers and businesses. The Secretary of Homeland Security should mandate TWIC reader deployment for security purposes. The TWIC program must be implemented promptly for security reasons. Funds from the Port Security Grant Program for TWIC projects should not expire before the final TWIC reader rule is issued. SEC. 3. TWIC APPLICATION REFORM. The Secretary of Homeland Security must reform the TWIC enrollment process to require no more than one in-person visit, except in special circumstances. Passed the House of Representatives on June 28, 2012."
