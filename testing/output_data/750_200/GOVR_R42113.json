In contrast, overall federal tax revenues have remained stable at around 17.7% of GDP since 1946. Since 1946, federal tax revenues have been relatively stable at around 17.7% of GDP, with individual tax revenues averaging 8.1% of economic output. Payroll tax revenue has increased from 1.4% to 6.0% of GDP, while excise tax revenue has decreased from 3.1% to 0.5% of GDP. Corporate tax revenue has decreased in importance, generating about 1.3% of GDP currently. The corporate tax revenue has declined significantly over the years, accounting for only 8.9% of federal tax revenue today compared to 32.1% in 1952. This decrease can be attributed to factors such as tax rate reductions affecting revenue collection. The decline in corporate tax revenue is influenced by the tax rate and the tax base, with factors like the number of firms and profitability impacting the base. Both a lower tax rate and a reduced tax base have contributed to the decrease in revenue. The decline in corporate tax revenue is influenced by both the tax rate and the tax base. The average effective corporate tax rate has decreased from 55.8% in 1951 to 28.4% in 2010, leading to lower revenue. This decrease in the effective rate, along with a reduction in the tax base, has contributed to the decline in corporate tax revenue. The fall in the average effective tax rate is driven by a reduction in the top statutory rate from around 50% in the 1950s to 35% currently. This reduction in the statutory rate naturally decreases the effective rate corporations face. Additionally, corporations were allowed to claim an investment tax credit, further impacting the tax base. Since 2004, corporations have been able to claim the Section 199 deduction for certain activities, reducing the effective tax rate on corporate income. This deduction, similar to the investment tax credit, has helped lower the effective corporate tax rate below the statutory rate. The Section 199 deduction, like the investment tax credit, reduces the effective tax rate on corporate income. Changes to depreciation rules also contributed to lower effective tax rates, with bonus depreciation temporarily enhancing depreciation in 2002 and 2009 to stimulate the economy. The effective corporate tax rate has decreased over time due to factors such as bonus depreciation in 2002 and 2009. Other factors like inflation and tax credits have had small effects on the effective tax rate. The effective corporate tax rate has generally fallen over time, with spikes in 2000 and 2007 during recessions when businesses were experiencing losses. Businesses can offset losses by carrying them back to previous years, reducing their average effective tax rate.

Businesses can offset losses by carrying them back to previous years, reducing their average effective tax rate. Congress temporarily extended the carryback period from two years to five years in 2002 and 2008 to stimulate the economy. In 2002 and 2008, Congress extended the carryback period from two years to five years to stimulate the economy. The decline in corporate tax revenue is not solely due to lower effective tax rates. The nonfinancial corporate tax base has shrunk as more business income is generated by partnerships and S corporations, which are not subject to the corporate income tax system. Instead, income is distributed to individual owners and taxed under the individual income tax system. The distribution of business income has shifted from C corporations to partnerships and S corporations, known as \"pass-throughs.\" This has led to a smaller corporate tax base and a decrease in corporate tax revenues. The shift in business income from C corporations to S corporations has reduced the corporate tax base and led to a drop in corporate tax revenues. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 incentivized businesses to organize as S corporations due to lower tax rates. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 set the highest individual tax rate at 28% and the highest corporate tax rate at 34%, leading businesses to organize as S corporations. The S corporation shareholder limit was increased from 35 to 100, making it more attractive. By 2007, S corporations represented 12% of businesses, up from 4% in 1980. The reduction in profitability of corporate firms has affected the tax base. Profitability is often measured by the ratio of profit to net assets. Corporate profitability can be measured by the ratio of profit to net assets, indicating how well resources are utilized to generate profits. Since 1966, profitability has decreased significantly. Nonfinancial corporate profitability has fallen significantly since 1966, with economists attributing this decline to be more important than changes in tax rates. Possible reasons for this decline include a shift towards more volatile industries, leading to a higher number of corporations experiencing losses. There has been a shift in the corporate sector towards more volatile industries, potentially increasing the number of firms experiencing losses and lowering overall profits. Additionally, there is a trend towards younger corporations, which are less profitable initially, further impacting overall profits. Moreover, American corporations may be moving profits to lower-tax countries, reducing domestic reported profits. Research shows evidence of profit-shifting among multinational corporations. An increasing collection of research has documented evidence of profit-shifting among multinational corporations, with firms incentivized to reduce income for tax purposes. This behavior has led to declining corporate tax revenues over the last six decades. Economists have observed growing differences in income reported to the IRS compared to shareholders. Corporate tax revenues have been declining for the last six decades due to three primary factors: decreasing effective corporate tax rate, increasing business activity in pass-through structures, and falling corporate sector profitability. The erosion of the corporate tax base has been caused by factors such as decreasing profitability and the rise of pass-through business structures. The discussion on corporate tax reform has focused on lowering statutory rates and broadening the tax base to achieve revenue neutrality. Effective tax rates are typically lower than statutory rates, indicating the need for reform in the corporate tax system. The effective tax rate is usually below the statutory tax rate, suggesting a revenue-neutral reduction of the top corporate tax rate may be possible by broadening the tax base. Research shows reducing the top corporate rate from 35% to 25% would require repealing all corporate tax expenditures and making changes to tax preferences for noncorporate businesses. As the corporate rate is lowered, reforms to the noncorporate sector are needed to maintain business activity. The text discusses reducing the corporate tax rate and implementing reforms for noncorporate businesses to broaden the tax base. It also mentions potential changes to the taxation of American multinationals operating overseas. Additionally, it provides an overview of the calculation of average effective tax rates.
