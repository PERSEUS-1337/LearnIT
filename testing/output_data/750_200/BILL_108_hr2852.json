    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Cord Blood Stem Cell Act of 2003\". The findings of the Act are also outlined. The Congress finds that research has shown the feasibility of using cord blood for clinical applications, including bone marrow reconstitution for certain diseases. Stem cells from cord blood can be used for transplantation in patients with malignancies, genetic disorders, and acquired diseases. Cord blood, a source of stem cells, can be collected after childbirth and preserved for transplantation in various medical situations or for scientific research. Advantages of cord blood stem cell transplants include reduced risks to donors, quicker availability of donor cells, and lower transplant complications compared to bone marrow transplants. In bone marrow transplantation, finding a fully matched unrelated donor is crucial for success. Patients of ethnic minorities often struggle to find fully matched donors, leading to partially matched transplants as their only option. Minorities face challenges in finding fully matched donors for bone marrow transplantation, resulting in higher rates of complications and mortality with partially matched transplants. Cord blood stem cell banks can increase genetic diversity in donor supply, offering more options for fully and partially matched transplants, reducing risks for patients. Cord blood stem cell transplants using partially matched units reduce the risk of graft versus host disease compared to conventional bone marrow transplantation. An inventory of 150,000 cord blood stem cell units, considering ethnic diversity, would provide appropriate matches for at least 90 percent of candidates. An inventory of 150,000 cord blood stem cell units, taking into account ethnic diversity, could provide suitable matches for 90% of those seeking transplants within days of a formal request. Matched donors are more likely within the same ethnic group as the patient, with certain genetic conditions being more prevalent in specific ethnic groups, such as Sickle Cell Anemia in African-Americans. Patients with Sickle Cell Anemia are at high risk of severe bacterial blood infections and frequent painful crises. Those with recurrent crises, chest syndrome, or strokes have a high risk of premature death. The median lifespan for Sickle Cell Disease patients is 42 years, but those with severe disease in childhood rarely live past 20 years. Cord blood stem cell transplantation has successfully cured Sickle Cell Anemia in children, with 80% success rate using related cord blood. In a recent study, 80 percent of children with Sickle Cell Anemia or thalassemia were cured through related cord blood transplants. Transplants done earlier in the course of severe disease yield better outcomes. Unrelated cord blood transplants are particularly beneficial for African American and other ethnic minority patients due to less stringent matching requirements compared to bone marrow transplants. This increases the likelihood of finding a suitable donor for African American patients. An American patient has a higher chance of finding a suitable unrelated cord blood donor compared to a matched bone marrow donor. With an ethnically balanced national cord blood bank of at least 150,000 units, 90 percent of African American patients with conditions like Sickle Cell Anemia could find appropriately matched cord blood stem cells for successful treatment. The National Marrow Donor Program has facilitated 17,000 bone marrow transplants since 1987. Cord blood transplantation complements bone marrow transplantation by providing matched units to patients, especially non-caucasoid ethnicity. Cord blood is a source of stem cells for transplantation, but its collection and storage require specific expertise. Radiation exposure could cause bone marrow failure in some individuals. Radiation exposure can lead to bone marrow failure, requiring treatment such as bone marrow reconstitution. Cryopreserved cord blood stem cell units may be crucial in these cases. There is an increased risk of leukemia or lymphoma years later for those exposed, potentially necessitating stem cell transplantation. Research on cord blood stem cells may provide insights into chronic diseases. Research on cord blood stem cells may lead to a greater understanding of chronic diseases like Parkinson's disease, diabetes, heart disease, and cancer, potentially improving therapies and reducing healthcare costs in the United States. The Public Health Service Act is amended to establish a National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network under section 376A. This network aims to advance research on cord blood stem cells for potential therapeutic benefits in chronic diseases like Parkinson's, diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. The National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network is defined in the Public Health Service Act as a network aimed at advancing research on cord blood stem cells for therapeutic benefits in chronic diseases. Definitions in the section include terms like Administrator, cord blood unit, donor, and donor bank. The National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network is a network of qualified cord blood stem cell banks established under the Public Health Service Act. Donor bank refers to a qualified cord blood stem cell bank that contracts with the Secretary, while human cord blood stem cells include hematopoietic stem cells and other stem cells from neonatal blood collected after birth. The National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network is established under the Public Health Service Act and consists of qualified cord blood stem cell banks. The network aims to contain at least 150,000 units of human cord blood stem cells. The purpose of donor banks in the network is to assist in the establishment, provision, and maintenance of the network. The donor banks in the National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network acquire, test, store, and make cord blood units available for transplantation. They also allocate up to 10 percent of the cord blood units. A cord blood stem cell bank must have all necessary licenses and authorizations to operate and maintain the bank. Up to 10 percent of the cord blood inventory is allocated for research purposes each year. The cord blood stem cell bank must have necessary licenses, authorizations, and donor screening practices to protect donors and recipients. Strict confidentiality measures are in place to safeguard patient and donor identities. The cord blood stem cell bank ensures confidentiality to protect patient and donor identities, encourages donation from diverse donors, and maintains communication with other stem cell banks. The cord blood stem cell bank has developed systems for communication with other banks, transplant centers, and physicians, as well as tracking recipients' outcomes for distributed units. They also have a system for educating. The National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network, established under the Act of 1996, tracks recipients' clinical outcomes for distributed units and educates the public about the benefits of donating and utilizing cord blood stem cells. The administration is overseen by a Board of Directors. The Board of Directors, appointed by the Secretary, administers the National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network, including establishing a national cord blood stem cell registry and coordinating donor banks. Members serve 3-year terms and include representatives from cord blood stem cell transplant centers. The Board of Directors for the National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network includes representatives from cord blood stem cell transplant centers, physicians from birthing hospitals, the research community, transplant recipients, and family members of patients. The Board of Directors for the National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network includes representatives from various backgrounds such as family members of patients, individuals with expertise in social sciences, members of the general public, and the Division of Stem Cell Transplantation of the Health Resources and Services Administration. The Board of Directors for the National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network includes representatives from various backgrounds, including family members of patients, experts in social sciences, members of the general public, and the Division of Stem Cell Transplantation of the Health Resources and Services Administration. Members appointed may serve up to 2 consecutive 3-year terms, except for specific appointments. The Board of Directors ensures continuity by having approximately 1/3 of members' terms expire each year. Members can continue serving until a successor is appointed. The Secretary will establish a National Cord Blood Stem Cell Registry as part of the Network. The Administrator will establish a National Cord Blood Stem Cell Registry within the Network to identify, acquire, and distribute donated cord blood units matched to patients. The Registry will provide a website for healthcare professionals to search for suitable donor matches. The National Cord Blood Stem Cell Registry within the Network enables searching for suitable donor matches and maintains a database documenting the collection, storage, distribution, and transplantation of cord blood units. The database maintained under the Network shall operate according to standards of consent, disclosure, and confidentiality. The Administrator will report to the Secretary periodically on the safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of the Network's activities. The Board of Directors ensures that donor banks meet requirements and the Network is geographically distributed. The Network and their birthing hospital collection sites are geographically distributed throughout the United States. Authorization of appropriations is set at $15,000,000 for fiscal year 2004, $30,000,000 for fiscal year 2005, and necessary sums for fiscal years 2006 through 2008 or until the 150,000 unit inventory is acquired."
