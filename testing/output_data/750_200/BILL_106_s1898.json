The use of private prisoner transport companies for violent prisoners is increasing, leading to escapes and the need for oversight by the Attorney General. Government entities may opt to use these companies due to fiscal or logistical concerns, but it is not mandated by this Act. Private prisoner transport companies used for moving violent prisoners should be regulated to enhance public safety. The text chunk \"SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\" is a section that likely provides definitions for terms used in the context of regulating private prisoner transport companies for public safety. In this Act, definitions are provided for terms such as \"crime of violence,\" \"private prisoner transport company,\" and \"violent prisoner.\" These definitions are crucial for regulating private prisoner transport companies for public safety. The term \"violent prisoner\" refers to an individual in state custody who has been convicted of or charged with a violent crime. SEC. 4. FEDERAL REGULATION OF PRISONER TRANSPORT COMPANIES. The Attorney General, in consultation with relevant organizations, will establish regulations for transporting violent prisoners across state lines, including background checks and drug testing for employees. Minimum standards for employee training in transporting prisoners include 100 hours of preservice training covering restraints, searches, use of force, CPR, map reading, and defensive driving.

The transportation entity must adhere to minimum standards for employee uniforms, identification, and restraints when transporting violent prisoners. This includes wearing a uniform with a badge, categorizing prisoners with brightly colored clothing, and using leg shackles during transport. Minimum requirements for transporting violent prisoners include leg shackles and double-locked handcuffs. Private prisoner transport companies must notify local law enforcement 24 hours in advance of scheduled stops.

Federal standards for these companies must not be stricter than those applied to federal law enforcement agencies.

Any person violating the regulations established by this Act may face a civil penalty up to $10,000 per violation, along with prosecution costs. They must also reimburse any entity that incurred expenses in apprehending a violent prisoner who escaped due to a violation of these regulations.
