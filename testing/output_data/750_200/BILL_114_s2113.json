The America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 has allowed Federal agencies to use incentive prizes and challenges, resulting in benefits such as paying only for success, setting ambitious goals without predicting the winning team, involving a broader group of people to tackle problems, and bringing diverse perspectives. The America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 has enabled Federal agencies to use crowdsourcing and citizen science to increase the number of minds tackling problems, bring out-of-discipline perspectives, and maximize cost-effectiveness. Granting agencies direct authority to use these techniques will remove ambiguity, encourage their appropriate use, and stimulate broader public involvement. Crowdsourcing projects offer unique benefits such as improving government service delivery with lower resource investments and connecting citizens to Federal agency missions through open government promotion. Citizen science promotes open government, volunteerism, and data acquisition in areas not easily accessible. It also allows citizens to address community concerns by gathering and sharing data. Citizen science accelerates research, enhances science literacy, and promotes global scientific collaboration. Federal agencies should consider providing meaningful incentives for participants in crowdsourcing and citizen science projects, such as receiving attribution for their contributions. Participants in crowdsourcing and citizen science projects are motivated by receiving attribution, learning new skills, connecting with others, and contributing to solving meaningful problems for society. SEC. 3. CROWDSOURCING AND CITIZEN SCIENCE. In this section, \"citizen science\" is defined as a form of open collaboration where individuals or organizations participate in various scientific activities such as formulating research questions, conducting experiments, collecting data, and solving problems. In this section, \"citizen science\" is defined as a form of open collaboration where individuals or organizations participate in various scientific activities such as developing technologies, making discoveries, and solving problems through crowdsourcing. The term \"crowdsourcing\" refers to obtaining services, ideas, or content by soliciting voluntary contributions from a group, especially online. The Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy is referred to as the \"Director,\" and a \"Federal agency\" is defined as an agency except as provided in specific cases. The Office of Science and Technology Policy defines \"Federal agency\" as any Executive agency or military department, excluding legislative branch agencies. A \"participant\" is an individual or entity that volunteers in activities. The term \"participant\" refers to individuals or entities volunteering in crowdsourcing or citizen science projects. A \"related entity\" includes Federal Government contractors, subcontractors, suppliers, customers, and others associated with a Federal agency. Federal agencies are authorized to engage in crowdsourcing and citizen science projects. Federal agencies can utilize crowdsourcing and citizen science approaches to advance their missions. The head of a Federal agency may accept voluntary services from participants. Federal agencies can accept voluntary services from participants for crowdsourcing or citizen science projects, subject to regulations. Services must not be financially compensated and should not displace any Federal Government employee. Federal agencies running crowdsourcing or citizen science projects must promote them for broad participation. Agencies can determine the level of consent, registration, or terms of use required from participants on a project-by-project basis. Federal agencies running crowdsourcing or citizen science projects must disclose privacy, intellectual property, data ownership, compensation, and other terms of use to participants in a clear manner when seeking consent. Consent can be obtained in various ways by the agencies. Federal agencies can obtain consent electronically or in written form from participants for crowdsourcing or citizen science projects. Projects involving human subjects must adhere to regulations, and agencies should strive to make data available while ensuring security and privacy. Federal agencies must make data collected from crowdsourcing or citizen science projects open to the public in machine-readable formats, while ensuring security and privacy. Participants should be informed about the expected uses of the data, ownership retention by the agency, and how the data and results will be shared. Federal agencies must make data collected from crowdsourcing or citizen science projects open to the public in machine-readable formats, while ensuring security and privacy. They should also clarify ownership retention, data sharing, and publication authorization for participants. Participants in crowdsourcing or citizen science projects must agree to assume all risks and waive claims against the Federal Government, except for willful misconduct, for any injury, death, damage, or loss of property. Participants in citizen science projects must adhere to scientific integrity policies, and Federal agencies involved may form partnerships for crowdsourcing initiatives. Federal agencies engaged in crowdsourcing or citizen science activities can enter into agreements with private sector entities, government agencies, or institutions of higher education to share administrative duties. Funding for these activities can come from appropriated funds by Congress. Federal agencies can use funds from Congress or accept funds from other federal agencies, private sector entities, or government agencies for activities under this section. No special consideration should be given to any entity. Federal agencies, including public institutions of higher education, are not allowed to give special consideration to any entity in return for funds or support. The General Services Administration, in coordination with the Director, will develop products and services to facilitate crowdsourcing and citizen science activities within 180 days of the enactment of this Act. The Director, in coordination with the General Services Administration, will develop products and services to facilitate crowdsourcing and citizen science activities for Federal agencies. Federal agency heads are encouraged to consult OSTP guidance for these activities. The Director, in coordination with the General Services Administration, will develop products and services to facilitate crowdsourcing and citizen science activities for Federal agencies. Agencies engaged in crowdsourcing or citizen science are encouraged to consult guidance provided by the Director. The Director will report on these activities every 2 years after the enactment of this Act. Each report required under this provision shall include a summary of crowdsourcing and citizen science projects conducted by Federal agencies in the past 2 fiscal years, detailing project goals and participation statistics. The report must include a summary of crowdsourcing and citizen science projects conducted by Federal agencies in the past 2 fiscal years, detailing project goals, participation statistics, resources used, activities, obligations, and expenditures. The report must include a summary of crowdsourcing and citizen science projects conducted by Federal agencies in the past 2 fiscal years, detailing project goals, participation statistics, resources used, activities, obligations, expenditures, and how the project advanced the mission of the Federal agency. The report should summarize crowdsourcing and citizen science projects conducted by Federal agencies in the past 2 fiscal years, including project results, methods used for data quality, and any savings or costs incurred by the Federal Government. The report should summarize challenges faced by Federal agencies in conducting crowdsourcing and citizen science projects, along with steps taken to address these challenges and recommendations for future action. The report should include a summary of challenges, steps taken to address them, recommendations for future action, use of crowdsourcing and citizen science methods by Federal agencies, and any other relevant information. The provision aims to prevent interference with the authority for crowdsourcing and citizen science, as well as to avoid displacing resources allocated to Federal agencies for projects in this area."
