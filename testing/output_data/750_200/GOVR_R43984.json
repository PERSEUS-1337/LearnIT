    "content": "Songwriters and recording artists are entitled to payment for reproductions and performances of their music. However, they do not have complete control over their music, as demonstrated by Taylor Swift's music being available on Spotify through a cover version despite her withdrawal. Taylor Swift withdrew her music from Spotify in 2014, but a cover version of her album 1989 by Ryan Adams was still available on the service. Copyright law allows Adams to perform and distribute Swift's musical works under certain conditions. Swift can withdraw her own recorded music, but she cannot control how the service uses other versions of her songs. Payment for her works depends on market forces and contracts. The amount Taylor Swift is paid for her music depends on market forces, contracts, and copyright laws. Congress updated some laws in the 1990s to address music distribution on the internet. Swift can withdraw her own recorded music, but she cannot control how the service uses other versions of her songs. Since the 1990s, Congress updated copyright laws to address music distribution on the internet, aiming to balance combating piracy and protecting revenue sources in the music industry. Different copyright provisions were applied to digital services resembling radio broadcasts and physical media. Music distribution has since evolved to include webcasting, album downloads, and on-demand song streaming for consumers. The evolution of music distribution includes streaming radio broadcasts, downloading albums or songs, and on-demand song streaming services. The U.S. Copyright Office notes a blurring of traditional exploitation lines. In 1999, recording industry revenues peaked at $21.3 billion, coinciding with the introduction of Napster. Apple's iTunes Music Store launched in 2003 after licensing agreements with major record labels. In 2003, Apple launched the iTunes Music Store after negotiating licensing agreements with major record labels. By 2012, digital downloads surpassed physical media in revenue, with Apple holding a 65% market share. However, sales declined as streaming services like Spotify gained popularity, posing a threat to iTunes. Sales from digital downloads declined as streaming services like Spotify became more popular. Apple launched Apple Music in 2015 to compete with the trend. Subscription music services have changed music consumption patterns significantly, with a shift towards streaming services accounting for about 67% of total U.S. recording industry retail spending in 2017. Consumer spending on music has shifted towards streaming services, increasing from 9% in 2011 to 67% in 2017. Despite this growth, annual spending on music by U.S. consumers is still below its 1999 peak. These changes impact how performers and music creators are compensated under copyright law. Under copyright law, creators of musical works and artists who record music have legal rights that affect their compensation. They license these rights to third parties who can exercise them on their behalf. Owners of musical works and certain sound recordings have exclusive rights under the Copyright Act, including the right to reproduce and distribute copies of the work to the public. The Copyright Act grants creators of musical works and artists rights such as reproduction and distribution. In music publishing, these rights are known as mechanical rights, dating back to the 1909 Copyright Act. Music publishers issue mechanical licenses and collect royalties for the reproduction of musical compositions. The term \"mechanical rights\" in music publishing dates back to the 1909 Copyright Act, where music publishers issue mechanical licenses and collect royalties for the reproduction of musical compositions. Federal copyright protection for sound recordings applies only to recordings fixed after February 15, 1972, while works fixed before that date are protected by state laws and court cases until February 15, 2067. The Copyright Act protects sound recordings fixed after February 15, 1972, while works fixed before that date are covered by state laws and court cases until February 15, 2067. Owners of musical works and sound recordings have the right to perform works publicly, but for sound recordings, this right only applies to digital audio transmissions. Digital audio transmission services like webcasting, SiriusXM, Music Choice, Pandora, and Spotify are examples of services that transmit sound recordings. Public performance rights for sound recordings fixed after February 15, 1972, are granted under federal copyright laws. Consumers who purchase compact discs have the right to listen to the songs privately, while rights owners of sound recordings can sue for copyright infringement. Consumers purchase rights to listen to songs on compact discs in a private setting. Record labels pay music publishers for the right to distribute musical works in physical formats. Retail outlets pay distribution subsidiaries of major record labels for sound recordings. Radio listeners have less control over song listening compared to purchasing the song outright. Broadcast radio stations are not required to pay public performance royalties. The Copyright Act does not require broadcast radio stations to pay public performance royalties to record labels and artists, but they must pay royalties to music publishers and songwriters for broadcast music. Congress determined in 1995 that the promotional value of radio airplay outweighs revenue lost by record labels and artists. Digital services must pay record labels and music publishers for public performance rights. Digital services must pay record labels and music publishers for public performance rights, including the rights to make temporary copies of songs known as \"ephemeral recordings.\" Interactive music streaming services allow users to listen to songs on demand, similar to playing a CD. Users of an \"on demand\" music streaming service can listen to songs upon request, similar to playing a CD or listening to a radio broadcast. The service downloads digital files to consumers' devices for multiple listeners to select songs, known as \"conditional downloads.\" Royalties are paid to music publishers/songwriters and record labels/artists for the right to reproduce and distribute musical works and sound recordings. The music industry involves songwriters, music publishers, recording artists, record labels, and music licensees who obtain rights to reproduce, distribute, or perform music. Songwriters work with music publishers to promote songs to record labels. Music publishers are responsible for licensing intellectual property. Music publishers work with songwriters to promote songs to record labels and others who use music. They license intellectual property, collect royalties, and may provide advances to songwriters. Publishers monitor, promote, and generate revenue from music use that requires mechanical licensing rights. The publisher's role is to monitor, promote, and generate revenue from music in various formats that require mechanical licensing rights. They often contract with performing rights organizations to license and collect payment for public performances on behalf of songwriters and publishers. Royalty income is shared with subpublishers and coauthors in standardized contract terms. Music publishers share income with subpublishers and coauthors, typically in a 50-50 division with songwriters. Major publishers like Sony/ATV, Universal Music Publishing Group, and Warner Music Group dominate the industry, accounting for over half of U.S. music publishing revenue. Independent publishing companies, known as major affiliates, handle the creative aspects of songwriting. Independent publishers administer their own music catalogs and are not affiliated with major publishers. Some songwriters control their own publishing rights, especially well-established ones who do not need help marketing their songs. Record labels are responsible for finding musical talent, recording their work, and promoting the artists and their work. The parent companies of the three largest record labels reproduce and distribute physical and electronic copies of sound recordings. Major labels have large distribution networks for moving physical recordings. The distribution role of record labels is evolving from physical to digital formats like MP3 files. They add data to identify royalties, negotiate with streaming services, and monitor sales. Recording artists, like songwriters, may contract with a record label or retain their copyrights to distribute their own sound recordings. They transfer copyrights to the label for defined periods and regions, receiving royalties in return. Record companies finance recordings, advance funds to cover expenses, and negotiate with streaming services for rights to use sound recordings. Record companies finance recordings, advance funds to artists, and guide their careers. Major stars may negotiate full ownership of future sound recording copyrights. The three major record labels in the U.S. are Sony Corporation, Universal Music Group, and Warner Music Group, earning about 65% of the industry's revenue. Each label shares a parent company with major music publishers. The curr_chunk discusses how record labels, including smaller independent ones, often rely on major record labels for distribution. For example, Taylor Swift is signed to Big Machine Records, an independent label with a distribution agreement with Universal Music Group. Chance the Rapper, an artist who retains his copyrights, distributes his music independently without signing with a record label. He gives away his music for free, earns from tours and merchandise. Apple Music paid him $500,000 for exclusive streaming rights to his album, Coloring Book, making it the first streaming-only album to rank in the top 10 U.S. albums. A record producer is responsible for bringing the creative product into tangible form, involving creative tasks like selecting songs and administrative tasks like booking studios. In the past, record labels hired producers for entire albums, but now artists enter into contracts with multiple producers for a single album. With the shift towards artists working with multiple producers on a single album, artists now control the terms of the producer's compensation. Producers with negotiating power may demand royalties. Sound engineers oversee recording sessions, while mixers piece together the final product. Mixers typically receive one-time payments per track, but those in high demand may negotiate for a share of the artist's royalties. The 1909 Copyright Act recognized the exclusive right of the copyright owner to make mechanical reproductions of music, applying to musical works published after the law's enactment. A mechanical license allows audio-only reproduction of music and distribution to the public for private use through mechanical devices like player pianos, phonograph records, and CD players. The 1909 Copyright Act established the exclusive right of copyright owners to make mechanical reproductions of music and distribute them through devices like player pianos, phonograph records, and CD players. Concerns were raised about a potential monopoly by the Aeolian Company, which led to the creation of the first compulsory license by Congress. In response to concerns about a potential monopoly, Congress established the first compulsory license in U.S. copyright law. This allows music publishers/songwriters to withhold the right to reproduce a musical work, but once a sound recording is distributed to the public, others can make similar use of it by paying a specified royalty. For example, in 2015, Ryan Adams recorded a cover version of Taylor Swift's album 1989 without needing her permission, instead paying the government-set rate. The 1909 Copyright Act set a royalty rate of $0.02 per \"part manufactured\" for mechanical licenses. Technological changes in the 20th century led to record labels paying mechanical royalties on a \"per song\" basis rather than per \"part manufactured.\" Congress revisited the mechanical license system. The Copyright Act of 1976 increased the number of songs per record and changed mechanical royalty rates to be paid on a \"per song\" basis. Congress codified the compulsory license as 17 U.S.C. Section 115, specifying that rates are payable for each record made and distributed. The act defines \"phonorecord\" as audio-only recordings and has been amended multiple times since its enactment. The 1976 Copyright Act changed statutory rate-setting processes and established procedures for obtaining mechanical licenses for music. Licensees must serve a notice of intention to license the music on the copyright owner or the Copyright Office if the owner's address is unknown. If copyright owners cannot be located, licensees set aside money owed until owners can be paid. This Act made it easier for copyright owners to sue. The 1976 Copyright Act simplified the process for copyright owners to sue by removing limitations on liability and requiring potential licensees to provide a notice of intention to license. Failure to do so makes them ineligible for a compulsory license. Additionally, copyright holders no longer need to file a \"notice of use\" to recover against infringement. The 1976 Copyright Act simplified the process for copyright owners to sue by removing limitations on liability and requiring potential licensees to provide a notice of intention to license. Failure to do so makes them ineligible for a compulsory license. Section 501 provides remedies for copyright infringement, while Sections 502-506 outline further remedies. The Act removed the need for copyright holders to file a \"notice of use\" to recover against infringement, with failure to identify themselves to the Copyright Office only affecting their ability to receive royalties under a compulsory license. NOI requirements for reproduction and distribution licenses are not issued on a blanket basis, leading to controversy between rights holders and licensees. Adjusting the statutory mechanical royalty rate periodically was suggested in 1967, with adjustments reflecting accepted standards of statutory ratemaking. In 1967, adjustments to the statutory mechanical royalty rate were suggested to reflect accepted standards of statutory ratemaking. In 1975, a separate royalty tribunal was proposed to simplify administering compulsory licenses alongside the mechanical license. This tribunal, established by Congress in the 1976 Copyright Act, consists of five commissioners appointed by the President and considers four policy objectives when setting royalty rates. The 1976 Copyright Act established a royalty tribunal with five commissioners appointed by the President. The tribunal considers four policy objectives when determining rates for mechanical licenses, including maximizing public access to works, ensuring fair returns for copyright owners and users, reflecting contributions of both parties, and minimizing industry disruptions. The Copyright Royalty Board (CRB) was established in 2004 to set licensing rates every five years, acting as a ceiling for what copyright owners may charge. The CRB replaced the tribunal with an arbitration panel in 1993. The Copyright Royalty Board (CRB) sets licensing rates every five years, acting as a ceiling for what copyright owners may charge. In 1995, Congress passed the Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act (DPRA) amending 17 U.S.C. Section 115 to cover reproduction and distribution of musical works by digital transmission. The Copyright Office debated the definition of \"incidental DPD\" for years, proposing new rules in 2008 to resolve the issue and ensure the survival of the music industry in the digital age. In September 2008, after years of debate and legal battles, music industry groups reached a landmark agreement on mechanical licenses for streaming services. This agreement aimed to address concerns about declining revenues for music publishers as consumers shifted to streaming music. The Copyright Office believes this resolution is crucial for the survival of the music industry in the digital age. The agreement on mechanical licenses for streaming services in 2008 aimed to address declining revenues for music publishers. Music streaming services would pay publishers a percentage of their revenues for interactive streams and limited downloads. Noninteractive, audio-only streaming services would not need mechanical licenses. The CRB adopted a modified version of this agreement in 2009, and in 2012, a new agreement set mechanical royalty rates and standards for additional music categories. The industry, songwriters, and online music services reached a new agreement on mechanical royalty rates for music streaming services, covering rates from 2013 through 2017. The CRB issued initial determination of rates for 2018-2022, with flat rates for physical deliveries and downloads, and streaming rates based on usage. For mechanical royalty payments in music streaming services, a flat rate is applied based on either 9.1 cents per song or 1.75 cents per minute of playing time. Rates for interactive streaming are determined by formulas considering the music service's revenues. The amount each publisher receives is calculated using another set of formulas, with minimum per-subscriber payments set for different service categories. Free trial periods are also accounted for in the payment structure. The mechanical royalty rates for music streaming services are determined by formulas based on the service's revenues. Minimum per-subscriber payments are set for different service categories, with zero rates during free trial periods. Public performance royalties are overseen by the U.S. District Court or negotiated between publishers and licensees. Songwriters were granted exclusive rights to publicly perform their works in 1897. In 1897, Congress granted songwriters the exclusive right to publicly perform their works. Establishments featuring orchestras, bands, operas, concerts, and musical comedies needed permission to perform these works. However, the sheer number of performances made it impossible for copyright owners to negotiate individually with each user or detect every infringement. To address this issue, composers formed a solution for licensing and collecting payment for public performances. ASCAP, a performance rights organization, was formed in 1914 to address the logistical issue of licensing and collecting payment for public performances. Songwriters and publishers assign public performance rights to PROs, who issue licenses on their behalf. Licensees typically obtain a blanket license to publicly perform musical works in a PRO's catalog for a flat fee or percentage of revenues. In 1930, SESAC was founded as a competing PRO to help European publishers and writers collect royalties from U.S. licensees. SESAC expanded its representation to include U.S. composers as broadcast radio grew in popularity. In 1932, ASCAP negotiated a public performance license with radio broadcasters based on a percentage of advertising revenues. To counter ASCAP's dominance, broadcasters founded BMI in 1939 to attract new composers and secure copyrights of new songs. BMI also convinced publishers to switch from ASCAP. BMI was established in 1939 with the goal of attracting new composers as members and securing copyrights of new songs. They successfully convinced publishers previously affiliated with ASCAP to switch. ASCAP and BMI originally had the exclusive right to negotiate on behalf of their members and offered blanket licenses covering all songs in their catalogs. The five-year licensing agreement between ASCAP and radio stations affiliated with CBS and NBC networks expired in December 1940, leading to a dispute over royalty rates. This disagreement resulted in a policy by three-quarters of radio stations to prohibit songs by ASCAP composers. The U.S. Department of Justice investigated the PROs for potential antitrust violations. To avoid lawsuits, BMI and ASCAP both entered consent decrees in 1941. Although not identical, these decrees resolved the antitrust issues. After an antitrust lawsuit, ASCAP entered a consent decree in 1941, similar to BMI's decree. Both decrees include requirements for nonexclusive licensing rights, non-discriminatory licensing terms, and acceptance of new members meeting certain standards. ASCAP and BMI must also offer alternative licenses to the blanket license. The ASCAP and BMI consent decrees require nonexclusive licensing rights, non-discriminatory terms, and acceptance of new members meeting standards. ASCAP and BMI must offer alternative licenses to the blanket license. SESAC and GMR rates are based on marketplace, not subject to federal court oversight like ASCAP and BMI. The rates charged by ASCAP and BMI are overseen by federal district court judges under consent decrees, while SESAC and GMR rates are based on marketplace negotiations. The court must ensure that ASCAP and BMI rates are \"reasonable\" and consider their market power. Judges cannot consider rates paid by digital services to record labels and artists for public performances of sound recordings. The current law prohibits judges from considering rates paid by digital services to record labels and artists when setting public performance rates for music publishers and songwriters. This provision was created in 1995 to address concerns about how license fees for sound recordings could impact music performance royalties. The House Judiciary Committee in Congress addressed concerns about license fees for sound recordings potentially affecting music performance royalties. DOJ periodically reviews the ASCAP and BMI consent decrees, last amended in 2001 and 1994 respectively. The ASCAP and BMI consent decrees were last amended in 2001 and 1994 respectively. In 2016, the DOJ completed a review of the consent decrees. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals upheld BMI's challenge to the DOJ's interpretation in 2017. Congress enacted the 1971 Sound Recording Act to address copyright laws for sound recordings. The House Judiciary Committee report suggested amending laws to combat unauthorized duplications of sound recordings facilitated by audiotapes in the 1960s. The 1971 Sound Recording Act aimed to address copyright laws for sound recordings, particularly focusing on combating unauthorized duplications facilitated by audiotapes in the 1960s. The Act applied to sound recordings fixed on or after February 15, 1972, and led to the recommendation to exclude pre-1972 sound recordings from federal copyright laws. The 1976 Copyright Act excluded pre-1972 sound recordings from federal protection to preserve antipiracy laws and prevent works from automatically entering the public domain. States can still protect these works under their own laws. The 1976 Copyright Revision Act preempted state laws for pre-1972 works, exempting them from federal protection. States can protect these works until 2067, after which federal law will preempt state protection. In 1998, Congress established a license for noninteractive digital services to create temporary reproductions of sound recordings under Section 112 of the Copyright Act. In 1998, Congress established a Section 112 license under the Copyright Act for temporary reproductions of sound recordings. The CRB sets the rates and terms for this license, with SoundExchange handling fees for copyright owners (usually record labels). Recording artists without copyrights do not receive Section 112 fees. Public performance rights were not granted until the 1990s. The Copyright Act established a Section 112 license in 1998 for temporary sound recording reproductions. Record labels receive Section 112 fees, but artists without copyrights do not. Amendments in the 1990s addressed public performance rights and concerns over music piracy with the rise of the internet. The Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act (DPRA) in 1995 and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) in 1998 addressed concerns over music piracy. The DPRA granted record labels and artists an exclusive public performance right for sound recordings, limited to certain digital audio services. It also created a compulsory license for licensing sound recordings for specific subscription services. The DPRA in 1995 granted record labels and artists exclusive public performance rights for sound recordings on digital audio services. It also established a compulsory license for specific subscription services, leading to debates between music publishers, writers, and record labels over the application of the license to nonsubscription streaming services. After debates over the compulsory license for nonsubscription streaming services, the RIAA and Digital Music Association compromised, leading to the adoption of the DMCA by Congress. The DMCA expanded licensing provisions for online music services and established rate-setting standards for the CRB. Services existing before July 31, 1998, like SiriusXM, were included in the new system. The CRB has a bifurcated system of rate-setting standards. Services existing before July 31, 1998, are subject to one standard, while webcasters and newer music streaming services are subject to a different standard based on marketplace negotiations. The CRB has a bifurcated system of rate-setting standards. Services existing before July 31, 1998, are subject to one standard, while webcasters and newer music streaming services are subject to a different standard based on marketplace negotiations. The Section 801(b)(1) standard aims to minimize disruptive impacts on industries and prevailing practices, leading to lower copyright royalty rates in some cases. The DPRA allowed owners of sound recording rights to negotiate directly with interactive music streaming services for public performance rights at marketplace-determined rates. Interactive services enable individuals to arrange for specific recording transmissions. Certain subscription and interactive audio services could potentially impact sound recording sales. The Senate Judiciary Committee in 1995 warned that certain subscription and interactive audio services could harm sound recording sales and undermine copyright owners' control and compensation. Interactive services pose the greatest threat to traditional record sales and livelihoods dependent on them. Congress does not mandate public performance licenses for broadcast radio stations. The Senate Judiciary Committee in 1995 discussed the impact of subscription and interactive audio services on record sales and copyright owners' control. Congress does not require broadcast radio stations to obtain public performance licenses for sound recordings. The committee emphasized the beneficial relationship between the radio industry and the music industry, stating that legislation should not jeopardize this relationship. The Senate Judiciary Committee in 1995 emphasized the beneficial relationship between broadcast radio and the music industry, stating that legislation should not jeopardize this. The Copyright Royalty Board (CRB) sets statutory rates through rate determination proceedings involving copyright users, holders, and trade groups. The Copyright Royalty Board (CRB) sets statutory rates through rate determination proceedings involving copyright users, holders, and trade groups. The proceedings include negotiations, written statements, discovery, and attempts to reach a settlement. Participants may reach agreements on rates and submit them to the CRB for review and publication. The Copyright Royalty Board (CRB) sets statutory rates through rate determination proceedings involving copyright users, holders, and trade groups. They submit proposed rates to the CRB for review and publication. The CRB may adopt the rates or hold an evidentiary hearing if parties do not reach an agreement. Participants can request a rehearing or challenge CRB determinations through an appeal. Participants can challenge CRB determinations through an appeal filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. RIAA established SoundExchange as a common agent for record labels to receive royalties, later spinning it off as an independent entity. SoundExchange deducts costs before distributing royalty payments, and the CRB sets \"per\u2010performance\" rates for online music services using the \"willing buyer-willing seller\" standard. The CRB sets different royalty rates for public performances of sound recordings based on different standards. Congress has passed legislation allowing SoundExchange to negotiate alternative royalty schemes in response to complaints about excessive rates. The \"Webcaster Settlement Acts\" allowed SoundExchange to negotiate alternative royalty schemes for music streaming services, replacing CRB-set rates with revenue-based royalties. The most recent agreements expired in 2015, leading to CRB hearings for royalty rates from 2016-2020. The CRB was in the phase of setting royalty rates for noninteractive music streaming services for 2016-2020. Questions arose about the interpretation of a provision barring consideration of agreements negotiated under the Webcaster Settlement Acts. Pandora Media, Inc., Clear Channel (now iHeartMedia, Inc.), and SoundExchange disagreed on whether direct agreements based on the Pureplay settlement could be used as evidence in the CRB rate proceeding. SoundExchange argued for a broad exclusion rule by Congress. The CRB rate proceeding for setting royalty rates for noninteractive music streaming services for 2016-2020 involved a dispute over the use of agreements negotiated under the Webcaster Settlement Acts as evidence. SoundExchange argued for a broad exclusion rule, while Pandora Media and Clear Channel disagreed, leading to novel material questions of substantive law being referred to the CRB. The CRB referred novel material questions of substantive law to the Register of Copyrights for resolution regarding the 2009 Webcaster Settlement Act agreement. In December 2015, the CRB issued its decision on rates for the 2016-2020 period, setting a rate of $0.17 per 100 streams for nonsubscription services. This decision marked a departure from the CRB's previous practice of setting rate increases in advance. The CRB tied annual rate increases from 2017-2020 to the Consumer Price Index for streaming services. Ephemeral recording fees are now included with Section 114 royalties. Ephemeral royalties fees are set at 5% of total Section 114 royalties for 2016-2020. The CRB issued rate decisions for digital subscription and satellite radio services for 2018-2022. Public performance rates are described in Table 1. The CRB issued rate decisions for preexisting digital subscription services and satellite digital audio radio services for the 2018-2022 period. Public performance rates vary based on the type of music service, rate-setting standard, and distribution of royalties under Section 114 of the Copyright Act. The CRB issued rate decisions for preexisting digital subscription services and satellite digital audio radio services for the 2018-2022 period. 2.5% of royalties goes to agents representing nonfeatured musicians and vocalists. Record producers are not included in the statutory split of royalties for public performances by noninteractive digital services. Producers can be compensated via SoundExchange if the artist provides a letter of direction. The distinction between interactive and noninteractive services is debated in proposed legislation addressing compensation for producers. Interactive services allow for personalized transmissions of sound recordings to recipients. The CRB does not differentiate between interactive and noninteractive services when it comes to obtaining mechanical rights for digital transmissions of sound recordings. In 2009, the Second Circuit Court ruled on a music streaming service that uses user feedback to play personalized song selections within a specific genre. The Second Circuit Court ruled that a music streaming service using user feedback to play personalized song selections within a genre is not considered an \"interactive\" service. This distinction aims to protect sound recording copyright holders from losing sales. The court's decision is based on the idea that if a user can predict the songs they will hear, they may not need to purchase the music. The court ruled that an interactive music streaming service, like LAUNCHcast, creating unique playlists for users, may lead to a decrease in record sales as users can predict the songs they will hear without purchasing the music. Launch Media, Inc., owned by Yahoo!, created unique playlists for users. The court determined LAUNCHcast was noninteractive to be eligible for compulsory licensing. Noninteractive services must limit features, like announcing specific songs in advance. The Launch Media decision affirmed that personalized music streaming services like Pandora and iHeartRadio can obtain statutory licenses for public performances of sound recordings. The CRB-established rates do not currently differentiate between customized services and other radio-style internet services. Spotify's services offer users access to music. Spotify offers personalized music streaming services that allow users to access specific albums, songs, and artists on demand. Users can listen to music without advertisements by paying a monthly fee of about $10, and can use Spotify on both mobile devices and personal computers. Congress provided antitrust exemptions to statutory licensees and copyright owners of sound recordings in 1995. In 1995, Congress provided antitrust exemptions to copyright owners of sound recordings to negotiate collectively with SiriusXM and subscription services over royalty rates for public performance rights. The exemption requires nonexclusive common agents to preserve the ability to negotiate directly with copyright owners. The DPRA allows copyright owners to negotiate directly for statutory licenses and prevents them from demanding high rates through common agents. For interactive services, the DPRA does not provide an antitrust exemption for rate negotiations. However, common agents can be used for clearinghouse functions, not rate-setting. Congress added Section 112 to the DMCA in 1998 to address ephemeral server reproductions by webcasters and online services. In 1998, Congress added Section 112 to the DMCA to address ephemeral server reproductions by webcasters and online services. It also provided an antitrust exemption for copyright owners and licensees to designate common agents for royalty payments, but unlike Section 114(e)(1), Section 112(e)(2) does not specify exclusivity. The CRB, established in 2004, allows for the designation of entities to receive royalties, marking the first time Congress specified this. In 2006, the CRB designated SoundExchange as the sole \"collective\" to receive royalties on an interim basis, allowing parties to continue making payments while appealing CRB decisions. In 2006, the CRB designated SoundExchange as the sole \"collective\" to receive royalties on an interim basis. Royalty Logic, a for-profit subsidiary of Music Reports, Inc., requested recognition as a collective to compete with SoundExchange for the benefit of sound recording copyright owners. Royalty Logic requested recognition as a designated agent to compete with SoundExchange for the benefit of sound recording copyright owners. The CRB argued that copyright owners and performers are already designated agents according to the Copyright Act, and Royalty Logic's involvement in royalty distribution does not require formal recognition. The CRB also disputed Royalty Logic's argument that multiple collectives promote competition on pricing, stating that it only makes sense in direct licensing contexts, not where rates and terms are set by agreement. The CRB found that selecting a single collective is the most efficient way to collect royalties under statutory licenses, as it aligns with the \"willing buyer/willing seller\" standard. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit upheld this decision in 2009, rejecting Royalty Logic's argument for recognition as a designated agent to compete with SoundExchange. In 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit agreed with the CRB's decision regarding the exclusive ability to receive payments under statutory licenses. Royalty Logic argued that the CRB should not give a single entity exclusive rights, but the court disagreed, stating that the CRB has the authority to set terms for royalty payments. The CRB designated SoundExchange as the sole entity to receive royalty payments under statutory licenses, fulfilling Congress's expectation for a single entity to receive payments. This decision was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in 2009. SoundExchange was designated as the sole collective by the CRB for the period 2011-2014. The CRB stated that a sole collective was the most efficient system for collecting royalties. In 2015, agreements were reached with public and college radio stations for webcast sound recording rates, which were approved by the CRB and made binding on all copyright owners and performers. The CRB approved agreements with public and college radio stations for webcast sound recording rates, designating SoundExchange as the sole collective for collecting royalties from 2016-2020. SoundExchange's role was uncontested, with Congress granting an antitrust exemption for owners and licensees. In the United States, music publishers collect mechanical royalties from recorded music companies and streaming services via third-party administrators. Congress granted an antitrust exemption for owners and licensees to designate common agents for negotiating and distributing mechanical licenses. In the United States, music publishers collect mechanical royalties from recorded music companies and streaming services through third-party administrators like the Harry Fox Agency, who then distribute the royalties to publishers and songwriters. SESAC acquired the Harry Fox Agency in 2015. Music publishers may issue and administer mechanical licenses themselves. The Copyright Royalty Board (CRB) has not specified an agent for administering mechanical licenses. In 2006, Royalty Logic, Inc. raised concerns about competition among agents for licensing musical works and distributing mechanical royalties. Royalty Logic agreed not to participate unless the issue of competition among collectives was addressed by other parties in the rate proceeding. Noncash considerations may influence the price interactive services pay for music access, such as major labels acquiring equity in Spotify. Sony sold part of its stake when Spotify went public in 2018, promising to share proceeds with artists and independents. Sony began trading its shares on the New York Stock Exchange in April 2018 and sold a portion of its stake. They announced that they would share proceeds with artists and independent labels. The rates that interactive services pay music publishers are tied to the rates paid to record labels for performance rights, which are negotiated in the free market. Record labels with equity stakes in digital music services or guaranteed advertising revenues have these items valued when estimating total costs. Music publishers can participate in deals for mechanical royalties by assigning value to equity stakes or advertising revenues in digital music services. Concerns have been raised about fair sharing of payments from direct deals with digital music services, potentially leading to lower payments for songwriters and recording artists. Music publishers and record labels are concerned about unfair sharing of payments from direct deals with digital music services, potentially resulting in lower payments than under statutory licensing schemes. ASCAP and BMI represent about 90% of songs available for licensing in the US, while SESAC and Global Music Rights handle a smaller share. Publishers allege they have not received a fair share of performance royalties. Music publishers have alleged they did not receive a fair share of performance royalty revenues from streaming services due to ASCAP and BMI consent decrees. Publishers pressured ASCAP and BMI to allow them to negotiate directly with digital services for their public performance rights. In response to publishers' pressure, ASCAP and BMI amended their rules in 2011 and 2013 to allow music publishers to license their public performance rights for digital streaming services directly. Pandora Media, Inc. challenged this withdrawal of rights in court, but the courts ruled that publishers could not withdraw under the consent decrees. The courts ruled that music publishers cannot selectively withdraw rights under consent decrees, leading major publishers and PROs to propose modifications to allow partial grants of rights and expedited arbitration. The DOJ is evaluating consent decrees to potentially allow expedited arbitration and bundled licenses for multiple rights. There is a debate between \"100% licensing\" and \"fractional licensing\" for musical works with multiple writers. The DOJ completed its review of consent decrees, requiring PROs to issue 100% licenses for all songs in their catalogs. DOJ argued this promotes competition and called on Congress to reconsider copyright law in the music industry. The DOJ called on Congress to reconsider copyright law in the music industry, suggesting a more comprehensive legislative solution. BMI filed a lawsuit in New York, where a judge ruled in favor of fractional licensing contrary to the DOJ's interpretation. The U.S. Court of Appeals upheld this decision. The U.S. Court of Appeals upheld Judge Stanton's decision on licensing in December 2017. Licensees must serve a Notice of Intention (NOI) to the copyright holder before distributing phonorecords and pay royalties. The Copyright Office allows bulk electronic filing of NOIs for reproducing and distributing musical works under Section 115. The Copyright Office announced new procedures for licensees to file Notices of Intention (NOIs) in bulk electronic form, reducing filing costs to $0.10 per song. Spotify, Amazon, and Google began filing NOIs in bulk one week after the change. According to Billboard, digital music service companies contacted the U.S. Copyright Office in late 2015 to argue for digitizing the compulsory licensing process to ensure proper compensation for songwriters and publishers. Songwriters and publishers had previously filed lawsuits against Spotify and other online music services for illegally streaming copyrighted works. The Music Modernization Act, H.R. 5447, was passed by the House of Representatives in April 2018 with a 415-0 vote. This bill creates a new nonprofit \"mechanical licensing collective\" funded by online music services to offer broad blanket mechanical licenses for online music services. Several lawsuits were filed by songwriters and publishers against Spotify and other online music services for illegally streaming copyrighted works. The Music Modernization Act, H.R. 5447, passed by the House of Representatives, creates a nonprofit \"mechanical licensing collective\" funded by online music services to offer broad blanket mechanical licenses. It also changes the process of suing for infringement of mechanical licenses and sets new standards for royalty rates. Additionally, it extends federal copyright protection to sound recordings made before February 15, 1972. The bill extends federal copyright protection to sound recordings made before February 15, 1972 and creates procedures for royalty payments to producers, mixers, and sound engineers. Online music services can obtain a broad blanket mechanical license under the bill. The Register of Copyrights must designate a new nonprofit entity as a \"Mechanical Licensing Collective\" and another representing digital music services. The bill extends federal copyright protection to sound recordings made before February 15, 1972 and creates procedures for royalty payments. A new nonprofit entity, the Mechanical Licensing Collective (MLC), and a digital licensee coordinator will be designated. The MLC will have a 17-member board of directors and will be funded by online music services through assessments established by the CRB. The MLC's duties include maintaining musical works. The MLC, funded by online music services through CRB assessments, will maintain a musical works database, administer blanket licenses, identify copyright owners, and provide administrative services for voluntary licenses. The Mechanical Licensing Collective (MLC) would administer voluntary licenses for public performance rights in musical works, collect and distribute royalties from online music services to rights holders, and ensure songwriters receive at least 50% of royalties for unmatched works. The MLC is prohibited from negotiating royalty rates, granting licenses for public performances, or engaging in government lobbying activities. The Mechanical Licensing Collective (MLC) administers voluntary licenses for public performance rights in musical works, collects and distributes royalties from online music services to rights holders, and ensures songwriters receive at least 50% of royalties for unmatched works. The MLC is prohibited from negotiating royalty rates, granting licenses for public performances, or engaging in government lobbying activities. The digital licensing coordinator's duties include establishing governance structure, membership criteria, enforcing notice and payment obligations, and participating in proceedings before the CRB and Copyright Office. The CRB sets administrative assessment rates for the digital licensing collective, which cannot lobby the government. Failure to report usage or pay royalties may lead to default of the blanket license. Online music services can seek review in federal court if the collective improperly terminates a license. Claims not resolved by the MLC's board can be brought to federal court. Copyright owners of musical works can bring a claim in federal court if not resolved by the MLC's board. Online music services complying with a valid blanket license are protected from lawsuits for infringement. Lawsuits filed after January 1, 2018, for unauthorized reproduction or distribution prior to the \"license availability date\" are subject to specific provisions. The Music Modernization Act allows copyright owners to recover royalties for unauthorized reproduction or distribution of musical works before the \"license availability date.\" Online music services must comply with specified requirements to avoid damages for infringement. The Music Modernization Act requires the CRB to use the \"willing buyer/willing seller\" standard for setting royalty rates for music services like Music Choice and SiriusXM. Judges in the Southern District of New York can consider rates for public performances of musical works by online and digital subscription services. The Music Modernization Act requires the CRB to use the \"willing buyer/willing seller\" standard for setting royalty rates for music services like Music Choice and SiriusXM. Judges in the Southern District of New York can consider rates for public performances of musical works by online services, satellite digital audio services, and other digital subscription services. The current system of assigning judges in the Southern District of New York to oversee cases related to the ASCAP and BMI consent decrees would change. The district court in the Southern District of New York would use a random process to assign judges for rate setting cases, separate from those overseeing consent decrees. This change aims to ensure rate decisions are made by judges not involved in the underlying decrees. The committee believes rate decisions should be randomly assigned to judges not involved in consent decrees. Sound recording creators from before Feb 15, 1972, but after Jan 1, 1923, can receive payments from digital music services. This entitlement is in addition to legal remedies like damages and attorney's fees under federal law. Owners must file to receive statutory damages or attorney's fees for pre-1972 recordings. The bill proposes maintaining legal protections for pre-1972 sound recordings. Rights owners must provide specific information to the Copyright Office to be eligible for statutory damages or attorney's fees. The Copyright Office will establish regulations for filing sound recording identification and contact information. Federal protection for pre-1972 sound recordings will be in place until February 15, 2067. The bill proposes federal protection for pre-1972 sound recordings until February 15, 2067. Producers, mixers, and sound engineers can seek royalties through a nonprofit collective designated by the CRB with a letter of direction from a featured artist. The collective must adopt a policy for distributions. The bill modifies 17 U.S.C. \u00a7114(g) by replacing \"agent\" with \"nonprofit collective designated by the CRB.\" The CRB stated in 2007 that a collective does not need formal recognition to be involved in royalty distribution. Copyright owners and performers can designate collectives for royalty receipt. Legislators introduced measures in 2017 supporting the music industry, such as S.Con.Res. 6 and H.Con.Res. 13, known as the Local Radio Freedom Act. In January 2017, Senator John Barrasso and Representative Michael Conaway introduced resolutions supporting the Local Radio Freedom Act, which opposes new fees on radio stations for playing sound recordings. In April 2017, Representative Issa introduced the PROMOTE Act of 2017, giving copyright owners the right to withdraw their music from broadcast radio. The PROMOTE Act of 2017, H.R. 1914, would grant copyright owners of sound recordings the exclusive right to remove their music from radio stations. Stations can still play music without permission if they pay royalties or fall under certain exemptions. In July 2017, Representative Jim Sensenbrenner introduced the Transparency in Music Licensing and Ownership Act, H.R. 3350, which aims to create a searchable database for musical works and sound recordings. In October 2017, Representative Hakeem Jeffries introduced the Copyright Alternative in Small-Claims Enforcement (CASE) Act of 2017, H.R. 3945, which would establish a Copyright Claims Board.

Senator Ron Wyden introduced the ACCESS to Recordings Act, S. 2933, in May 2018 to provide federal copyright protection for sound recordings made before February 15, 1972. The ACCESS to Recordings Act, S. 2933, aims to provide federal copyright protection for sound recordings made before February 15, 1972. It allows rights holders to receive payments from digital services for publicly performing their works and preempts state copyright protection. Owners of pre-1972 sound recording copyrights must give timely notice of federal copyright registration to claim statutory damages or attorney's fees for infringement within a limited three-year window. Owners must provide timely notice to alleged infringers of federal copyright registration and infringement. If infringement has ceased, owners cannot receive statutory damages or attorney's fees. Sound recordings made before February 15, 1972, enter the public domain 95 years after release or 120 years after recording. Works recorded between 1923 and 1930 are protected until December 31, 2025, if the copyright owner engages in normal commercial activities. Sound recordings made before February 15, 1972, enter the public domain 95 years after release or 120 years after recording. Works recorded between 1923 and 1930 would be protected until December 31, 2025, only if the copyright owner engages in normal commercial exploitation and complies with regulations set by the Register of Copyrights. If requirements are not met, recordings enter the public domain."
