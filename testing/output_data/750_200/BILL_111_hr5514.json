    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Activity Based Total Accountability Act of 2010\" and its purpose is outlined in Section 2 as findings and purpose. The Congress finds that the Federal Government sends billions of dollars to the States annually, including funds for health care, transportation, housing, education, and agriculture through various means such as grants, loans, and direct appropriations. Every State spends Federal taxpayer dollars on common activities like health care, transportation, housing, education, and agriculture. Taxpayers, legislators, and agencies should have access to data for comparing performance and costs objectively. The purpose of this Act is to improve accountability by objectively comparing performance and costs of government activities to ensure taxpayers get the best value for their dollar. States with lower activity costs will serve as models for others, promoting competition and efficiency in spending taxpayer dollars. The Act aims to enhance government accountability by requiring annual accountings from State governments using total accountability measures, including unit-cost data. The Act requires State governments to provide annual fiscal accounting reports, including unit-cost data, to enhance government accountability. State governments must submit a State fiscal accounting report to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget 15 days before the end of a Federal fiscal year. The report should include a one-page summary of total funding and expenditures for each budget entity, along with a unit-cost summary for each entity. The Director will publish all reports received from State governments on their expenditures and unit-cost summaries for each budget entity on an Internet website within 30 days of receiving the report. SEC. 4. STANDARDIZATION OF STATE FISCAL ACCOUNTING REPORTS. The Director will standardize State fiscal accounting reports to allow for comparison between states. Each State government must submit a description of programs and activities within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The Director will establish a uniform system for classifying programs and activities within State government entities based on descriptions submitted by each budget entity. The Director will classify agency activities and identify activity units and performance measures for each activity. The unit-cost summary for a budget entity of a State government must be one page long and include funds available, agency activities, and a reconciliation of funds with expenditures. The statement of funds available for a budget entity must identify each source of funds and the amount, including State appropriations and Federal financial assistance. The funds available for a budget entity include State appropriations, Federal financial assistance, and other sources determined by the Director. SEC. 7. AGENCY ACTIVITY LINE ITEM LISTINGS. SEC. 7. AGENCY ACTIVITY LINE ITEM LISTINGS. Line item listings for agency activities must identify the activity, total funds expended, number of activity units, and unit cost. Relevant details about the agency activity should also be described. The agency activity line item listings must identify the activity, total funds expended, number of activity units, and unit cost. The description should include what conduct constitutes an activity unit, each purpose for the agency activity, and each intended beneficiary. Special rules apply for determining expenditures for certain agency activities. The Director may allocate expenditures for agency activities without measurement methods to similar activities with measurement methods. Total funds expended by a budget entity must include payments to contractors or subordinate entities. Unit costs for agency activities must be determined. The unit-cost of an agency activity is determined by including amounts paid to contractors or subordinate entities. The formula for reconciliation of funds available with adjusted expenditures includes UC, m, and q as defined terms. SEC. 8 outlines the reconciliation of funds available with adjusted expenditures, which involves identifying adjusted expenditures and explaining any differences with the sum of all funds available. Adjusted expenditures are determined by the formula AE = EXP + PT + REV. The formula in paragraph (1) defines terms for adjusted expenditures: AE is adjusted expenditures, EXP is total expenditures for agency activities, PT is pass-throughs, and REV is reversions. A budget entity can classify amounts as pass-throughs or reversions based on criteria set by the Director. SEC. 9. NONCOMPLIANCE.\n\nIf the Director finds a State government failed to submit a timely fiscal report, 10% of federal financial assistance will be withheld for the following year.\n\nSEC. 10. RULES.\n\nThe Director can create necessary rules for implementing this Act.\n\nSEC. 11. DEFINITIONS. SEC. 11. DEFINITIONS.\n\nDefines \"State government\" as the government of States, the District of Columbia, and other U.S. territories. \"Budget entity\" refers to State agencies or the State judiciary. \"Agency activity\" is major operational activities of a budget entity. \"Federal financial assistance\" includes amounts determined appropriate by the Director."
