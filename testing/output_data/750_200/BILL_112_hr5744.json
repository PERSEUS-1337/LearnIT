The Act aims to prevent catastrophic wildfires. The \"Catastrophic Wildfire Prevention Act of 2012\" aims to expedite wildfire prevention projects on Federal lands, reduce threats to endangered species, and provide efficiency tools to streamline projects for wildfire prevention. The \"Catastrophic Wildfire Prevention Act of 2012\" defines terms like \"at-risk community\" and \"at-risk forest\" to address high wildfire risk on Federal lands. The \"Catastrophic Wildfire Prevention Act of 2012\" defines terms related to wildfire prevention projects on Federal lands, including conditions for post-fire disturbances and authorized prevention measures. The \"Catastrophic Wildfire Prevention Act of 2012\" defines an authorized wildfire prevention project as measures developed for hazardous fuels reduction, forest health, restoration, watershed protection, and species habitat protection on at-risk forests or endangered species habitats. This project may involve activities like livestock grazing and timber harvest for these purposes on Federal lands. The \"Catastrophic Wildfire Prevention Act of 2012\" defines authorized wildfire prevention projects as measures for hazardous fuels reduction, forest health, restoration, watershed protection, and species habitat protection on at-risk forests or endangered species habitats, including livestock grazing and timber harvest on Federal lands. Federal land includes land of the National Forest System and public lands. The term \"Secretary concerned\" refers to the Secretary of Agriculture for National Forest System land and the Secretary of the Interior for other public lands, excluding specific areas where vegetation removal is prohibited by Federal law. The term \"threatened and endangered species habitat\" refers to Federal land where natural fire regimes are important for endangered or threatened species, as identified in species recovery plans. The curr_chunk discusses the protection of endangered species, threatened species, or their habitats as outlined in species recovery plans or Federal Register notices. SEC. 4. AUTHORIZED WILDFIRE PREVENTION PROJECTS. Authorized wildfire prevention projects will be implemented in at-risk forests and endangered species habitats to reduce surface, ladder, and canopy fuels. Projects aim to enhance protection from wildfires, including catastrophic events, for endangered species. Authorized wildfire prevention projects aim to provide enhanced protection from wildfires, including catastrophic events, for endangered species and habitats. Projects must comply with guidelines specified in the species recovery plan under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. In at-risk forests, projects are carried out to improve the condition of Federal land. In at-risk forests, authorized wildfire prevention projects aim to improve Federal land conditions by using grazing, timber harvesting, and thinning to reduce fuel loads and prevent catastrophic wildfires. Grazing standards are waived for these projects. Authorized wildfire prevention projects aim to reduce ladder and canopy fuel loads to prevent catastrophic wildfires. The Secretary concerned is not required to revise land and resource management plans for conducting these projects. Public petitions for the designation of Federal land must be considered within 60 days. The Secretary concerned must review and make a determination on public petitions for the designation of Federal land as at-risk forest or threatened and endangered species habitat within 60 days. SEC. 5. PUBLIC REVIEW AND ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS. The Secretary must publish a notice of proposed wildfire prevention projects in the Federal Register for public comment. Specific written comments related to the project can be submitted within 30 days. Within 60 days of the notice, the Secretary will make a final decision on the project after considering any received comments. The Secretary will designate the final project and publish a notice in the Federal Register. Only those who commented on the proposed project can submit specific written comments on the final designated project within 30 days. The Secretary will publish a notice in the Federal Register with the date of the publication. Environmental analysis and compliance with relevant laws are required for wildfire prevention projects. Interagency cooperation and special rules apply to certain projects. Regulations apply to authorized wildfire prevention projects, with special rules for projects involving timber harvesting or grazing. The Secretary must prepare an environmental assessment within 30 days of publishing notice for proposed agency actions. Failure to meet the deadline results in compliance with all requirements. The authorized wildfire prevention project is deemed compliant with the National Environmental Policy Act if the deadline is not met. For livestock grazing projects, the environmental assessment is valid for 10 years, and for timber harvest projects, it is valid for 20 years. No requirement for alternatives in this section. Compliance with this section deems the environmental assessment sufficient for a minimum of 20 years. No requirement for alternatives in the environmental assessment. Compliance satisfies various environmental acts. The curr_chunk mentions the Endangered Species Act of 1973, the Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960, and the Management Act of 1976. SEC. 6. ADMINISTRATIVE AND JUDICIAL REVIEW. Administrative review of authorized wildfire prevention projects follows the special process under the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003. Judicial review is conducted according to the same Act. SEC. 7. THREATENED AND ENDANGERED SPECIES DESIGNATIONS. Before listing a species under the Endangered Species Act, the Secretary must assess the impact on forest fuel loads and include wildfire risk analysis in recovery plans and habitat determinations."
