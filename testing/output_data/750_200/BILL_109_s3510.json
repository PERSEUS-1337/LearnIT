    "content": "The National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 is amended to authorize $9,839,262,000 for fiscal year 2007, with $50,000,000 allocated for Partnerships for Access to Laboratory Sciences. The National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 authorizes funding for Partnerships for Access to Laboratory Sciences (PALS) to enhance access to laboratory science. The National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 authorizes grants to high-need local educational agencies for partnerships to improve laboratory access and quality of STEM instruction at the secondary school level. Grants are awarded competitively based on merit. Grants are awarded to high-need local educational agencies for partnerships to enhance STEM instruction at the secondary school level. Eligibility requires partnerships with higher education institutions, businesses, and nonprofit organizations. The Federal share of the cost of activities carried out using amounts from a grant under this section shall not exceed 33 percent. A high-need local educational agency approved for a grant application can receive grants for activities described in the application for a period of 3 years. High-need local educational agencies can receive grants for 3 fiscal years for activities outlined in their application. To be eligible, agencies must submit a plan to the Director involving input from teachers, science administrators, scientists, and education researchers. The plan must detail how the laboratory science program will be carried out. The plan for laboratory science program grants must describe how improvements align with academic standards and enhance STEM instruction quality. The plan for laboratory science program grants must detail how laboratory experiences are designed to produce clear learning outcomes, complement classroom science instruction, integrate science learning with content, and incorporate student reflection and discussion. Additionally, it should describe professional development opportunities. The plan for laboratory science program grants should include ongoing student reflection and discussion, professional development for teachers, safety assurances, maintenance of facilities post-grant period. The laboratory science program grants should include plans for maintaining facilities post-grant period and expanding research literature on the effect of laboratory science on student understanding and achievement. Grants should supplement existing programs and activities. Grants awarded under this section should supplement existing programs and activities, focusing on improving secondary science education through enhancing laboratories and providing instrumentation to enhance mathematics, science, engineering, and technology instruction at the secondary school level. Grants under this section aim to enhance secondary science education by improving laboratories and providing instrumentation for mathematics, science, engineering, and technology instruction at the secondary school level, in line with State academic standards. This includes developing a plan for laboratory improvement, acquiring equipment and materials, and maintaining facilities. Grants under this section support secondary science education by enhancing laboratories, providing equipment, and training teachers in laboratory safety and curriculum development. Grants support secondary science education by enhancing laboratories, providing equipment, and training teachers in laboratory safety and curriculum development. Additionally, they include hands-on laboratory experiences to encourage interest in mathematics, science, engineering, and technology for individuals identified in the Science and Engineering Equal Opportunities Act. The curr_chunk discusses the limitations on the use of funds for grants awarded under a specific section, prohibiting the construction of new facilities. It also outlines the selection process for high-need local educational agencies to apply for these grants. The selection process for high-need local educational agencies seeking grants under this section involves submitting an application to the Director with details of the partnership and implementation plan. The application for grants under this section must include details of the partnership, implementation plan, activities aligned with academic standards, and promoting student achievement in mathematics and science. The application for grants must include activities promoting student achievement in mathematics and science based on research and best practices to improve performance and strengthen instruction quality. Activities encouraging individuals' interest should also be described. The application for grants must include activities promoting student achievement in mathematics and science based on research and best practices to improve performance and strengthen instruction quality. It should also describe activities that encourage the interest of individuals in mathematics, science, engineering, and technology to prepare them for postsecondary studies in these fields. Assessment of changes in student achievement must also be outlined. The application for grants must include activities promoting student achievement in mathematics and science based on research and best practices. It should describe how changes in student achievement will be assessed, how the partnership will assess its success, and how programmatic assessments will be made available to the research community. The Director will evaluate the partnership's ability to effectively carry out proposed programs. The partnership's ability to carry out proposed programs effectively will be evaluated based on research and best practices, alignment with state academic standards, and the likelihood of activities being widely implemented. The evaluation criteria for partnerships include alignment with academic standards, potential for widespread implementation, and encouragement of interest in STEM fields. The program focuses on preparing individuals for postsecondary studies in mathematics, science, engineering, and technology. The Director will assess the program using common benchmarks to identify best practices and materials developed by partnerships. The Director will evaluate the program to compare the effectiveness of practices and materials developed by partnerships with those funded by other agencies. Results will be disseminated to the public and relevant committees. The Director will disseminate results to relevant committees and make effective materials widely available to the public. Technical assistance will be provided upon request for high-need areas. The Director will provide technical assistance to high-need local educational agencies in developing quality grant applications and activities. An annual meeting will be convened by the Director in consultation with the Secretary of Education. The Director, with the Secretary of Education, will convene an annual meeting for high-need local educational agencies receiving grants under this section to promote national collaboration. A report on coordination will be provided to relevant House committees. The annual report will describe how the program authorized under this section is coordinated with the program authorized under part B of title II of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. The report must be submitted with the President's annual budget request. The President's annual budget request includes definitions for \"high-need local educational agency\" and \"National Laboratory\" as per specific legislation."
