    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Pulmonary Hypertension Research Act of 2003\". It includes findings related to pulmonary hypertension. The Congress finds that Federal investment in pulmonary hypertension research must be expanded to find a cure or effective treatment. Primary pulmonary hypertension is a rare, chronic, and historically incurable lung disorder with a poor survival rate. Primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH) is a rare lung disorder with a poor survival rate. In the United States, about 300 new cases of PPH are diagnosed each year, with the majority in women aged 21-40. However, PPH can also affect men and women of all ages and racial backgrounds. Primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH) can affect individuals of all ages and ethnic backgrounds. The disease is rare, making it challenging to study, especially due to the lack of a good animal model. In advanced stages, PPH can severely limit a patient's activity and may progress to complete bedriddenness. In some cases, PPH is familial, occurring in about 6 to 10 percent of patients. Primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH) can severely limit a patient's activity, even when resting, and may progress to complete bedriddenness. PPH is difficult to diagnose and can be mistaken for other heart and lung conditions. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute established the first PPH-patient registry in 1981 to study the disease over a period of up to 7.5 years. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute established a PPH-patient registry in 1981, following 194 people with PPH for up to 7.5 years. Research is focused on understanding the cause and progression of PPH, including immunologic and genetic factors, agents causing narrowing of pulmonary blood vessels, and factors leading to smooth muscle growth and scar tissue formation in vessel walls. During 1996-1997, 6,000,000 Americans took anorexic drugs, leading to PPH in some. Many cases of PPH from diet drugs are expected in the future. SPH is caused by conditions like emphysema and bronchitis. Common causes of SPH include breathing disorders like emphysema and bronchitis, inflammatory diseases such as scleroderma and systemic lupus erythematosus, congenital heart defects, chronic pulmonary thromboembolism, HIV infection, liver disease, and certain diet drugs. The Public Health Service Act is amended to expand research on pulmonary hypertension under the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. The Public Health Service Act is amended to expand research on pulmonary hypertension under the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. The Director of the Institute is tasked with expanding, intensifying, and coordinating research activities on pulmonary hypertension, as well as collaborating with other national research institutes and agencies related to this condition. Additionally, the establishment of Centers of Excellence is emphasized. The Director of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute is responsible for expanding research on pulmonary hypertension and collaborating with other national research institutes and agencies. Centers of Excellence will be established to conduct research, training, and education on pulmonary hypertension. Centers assisted under paragraph (1) will conduct research, training, and education on pulmonary hypertension, including basic and clinical research, training programs for scientists and health professionals, and information programs for health professionals. The center will conduct programs for education and information dissemination to health professionals and the public. Stipends may be provided for scientists and health professionals in training programs. The Director will coordinate centers and require reports. The Director will coordinate information among centers, ensure regular communication, and may require reports on center activities. Each center will use the facilities of a single institution or a consortium of cooperating institutions. The Director will establish not less than three centers, each using the facilities of a single institution or consortium. Support for a center can last up to 5 years, with possible extensions for additional 5-year periods based on center operations. The Director may extend support for centers for up to 5 years, with possible additional 5-year extensions based on peer review recommendations. The Institute will establish a data system for collecting and analyzing data on pulmonary hypertension patients. The Director of the Institute will establish an information clearinghouse to disseminate knowledge about pulmonary hypertension to health professionals, patients, industry, and the public. Public input will be solicited for the purpose of identifying individuals at risk of developing the condition. The Director of the Institute will provide means for public input on programs related to primary hypertension. Biennial reports on activities will be prepared and included in the Director's overall reports. Authorization of appropriations will be made for these purposes. The Director will include reports on primary hypertension programs in biennial reports. Up to $25,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2004 through 2008 for this purpose."
