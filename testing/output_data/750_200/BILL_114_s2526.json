If multiple members qualify for preference, the agency can require the consortium to select who should receive it. The head of each participating agency must submit a report to the Secretary within 90 days, detailing how preference will be given to consortium members for financial or technical assistance. The participating agency must report to the Secretary on how preferential consideration will be given to consortium members for financial or technical assistance. Additionally, the Secretary may provide a Federal point of contact to help consortium members access funds and technical assistance under the manufacturing community program. Financial or technical assistance may be awarded to a member of a manufacturing community consortium under a program established by a participating agency. The assistance must align with the economic development strategy of the consortium. A recipient of financial or technical assistance may use the funds to support investments in infrastructure and access to capital to improve US manufacturing competitiveness. The recipient of financial or technical assistance may use the funds for various purposes such as infrastructure improvements, access to capital, promotion of exports and foreign direct investment, equipment upgrades, workforce training, energy efficiency, business incubators, site preparation, and advanced research. The Secretary of Commerce coordinates with participating agencies to identify programs for infrastructure improvements, access to capital, promotion of exports, equipment upgrades, workforce training, energy efficiency, business incubators, site preparation, advanced research, and supply chain development. Inter-agency coordination is also required among the participating agencies. The Secretary of Commerce coordinates with participating agencies to identify programs for infrastructure improvements, access to capital, promotion of exports, equipment upgrades, workforce training, energy efficiency, business incubators, site preparation, advanced research, and supply chain development. Inter-agency coordination is required to leverage complementary activities and avoid duplication of efforts in the designation of Manufacturing Communities by the Secretary. The Secretary designates eligible consortiums as manufacturing communities through a competitive process. An eligible consortium includes an institution of higher education and a private sector entity. The eligible consortium for manufacturing communities may consist of an institution of higher education, a private sector entity, and a government entity, along with various partners such as economic development groups, financial institutions, and labor organizations. The eligible consortium for manufacturing communities may include a lead applicant such as a district organization, an Indian tribe, or other community and labor groups, financial institutions, or utilities.

An eligible consortium seeking a designation under specific criteria must submit an application to the Secretary, including details like regional boundaries and manufacturing concentration assessment. The consortium must provide an assessment of its manufacturing concentration and rank nationally based on employment, sales, and other relevant measures. Additionally, an integrated assessment of the local industrial ecosystem in the region must be included in the application. The consortium must provide an evidence-based plan for developing components of the industrial ecosystem in the region, including workforce, supplier network, research, infrastructure, trade, operational improvements, and capital access for manufacturing activities. An evidence-based plan for developing components of the industrial ecosystem in the region by making specific investments to address gaps and manufacturing the region uniquely competitive. The consortium will track outcome-based metrics, benchmarks, and milestones to evaluate their strategy for improving manufacturing in the region.
