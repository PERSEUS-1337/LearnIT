    "content": "Congress's contempt power is used to respond to acts that obstruct the legislative process, such as a witness refusing to comply with a congressional subpoena. This power can be used to coerce compliance, punish the contemnor, or remove the obstruction. Congress has three formal methods to combat noncompliance with a subpoena: inherent contempt power allows detention until compliance, criminal contempt statute certifies citation to executive branch. Contempt serves to encourage compliance with a congressional directive and allows for criminal prosecution of the contemnor. Criminal contempt is a punishment for noncompliance with a subpoena, while Congress can also seek a civil judgment from a federal court to enforce compliance. Congress may seek civil enforcement of a congressional subpoena through a federal court to ensure compliance. Noncompliance could lead to contempt of court, especially for executive branch officials. This report explores Congress's contempt power and the procedures for inherent contempt, criminal contempt, and civil enforcement of subpoenas. This report examines Congress's contempt power, procedures for inherent contempt, criminal contempt, and civil enforcement of subpoenas, and obstacles in enforcing contempt actions against executive branch officials. It is closely tied to Congress's investigative power. The power of Congress to punish for contempt is closely tied to its investigative authority. Congress has broad authority to investigate and obtain information, including confidential information, essential for its legislative function. This power is implied from the general vesting of legislative powers in Congress, as established by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has established Congress's broad legislative authority to seek and enforce informational demands, describing it as essential for the legislative function. This power was confirmed in two rulings related to the Teapot Dome scandal in the 1920s. The Supreme Court emphasized the importance of Congress's authority to gather information for effective legislation, stating that compulsion may be necessary when voluntary requests for information are insufficient or inaccurate. This power was recognized in rulings related to the Teapot Dome scandal in the 1920s. The Constitution grants Congress the power of inquiry with enforcing process to effectively exercise the legislative function. In Sinclair v. United States, a witness at congressional hearings who refused to provide answers was prosecuted for contempt of Congress. In Sinclair v. United States, a witness at congressional hearings refused to answer questions and was prosecuted for contempt of Congress. The witness cited a lawsuit between the government and Mammoth Oil Company as the reason for withholding information, but the Supreme Court upheld the conviction, rejecting the excuse of pending lawsuits. The Supreme Court rejected the excuse of pending lawsuits for withholding information during congressional hearings in Sinclair v. United States. The Court clarified that Congress has the authority to require disclosures to investigate the administration of laws, even if the information may also be useful in pending lawsuits. The Supreme Court has consistently upheld Congress's broad investigative authority, stating that its power of inquiry is as extensive as its power to enact laws. Congress's ability to conduct investigations is inherent and not limited by pending lawsuits. The Supreme Court has affirmed Congress's broad investigative authority, stating that its power of inquiry is as extensive as its power to enact laws. Congress's investigative power is inherent and encompasses inquiries into the administration of existing laws and potential statutes. The Court emphasized that congressional investigative power is strongest when addressing alleged waste, fraud, abuse, or maladministration within government departments. The Supreme Court has affirmed Congress's broad investigative authority, stating that its power of inquiry is as extensive as its power to enact laws. Congress's investigative power is inherent and encompasses inquiries into the administration of existing laws and potential statutes. The Court emphasized that congressional investigative power is strongest when addressing suspected corruption, inefficiency, or waste within government departments. The Court recognizes Congress's power to investigate corruption and inefficiencies in government agencies. The inherent contempt power allows individuals to be tried before the House or Senate and potentially imprisoned. This power was upheld in Supreme Court decisions Anderson v. Dunn and McGrain v. Daugherty. The inherent contempt power allows individuals to be tried before the House or Senate, potentially imprisoned as punishment or coercion. The procedure is similar to the one in Anderson v. Dunn, where a witness can be detained until compliance, following traditional methods. In Anderson v. Dunn in 1818, a House Member accused Anderson of bribery. The House resolution led to Anderson's arrest and appearance before the House, where he was granted counsel and defense witnesses. In Anderson v. Dunn in 1818, a House Member accused Anderson of bribery. The House granted him counsel, defense witnesses, and a copy of the accusatory letter. Anderson's witnesses were called, questioned, and a resolution was passed finding him guilty of contempt. The Speaker was directed to reprimand him and discharge him from custody, establishing a pattern of attachment, hearing, determination of guilt, and imposition of penalty for contempt. The curr_chunk discusses the process for contempt proceedings in Congress, including provisions for charges, identification of the accuser, counsel, and a hearing. Judicial review through a writ of habeas corpus is available for witnesses cited for contempt. The court's review is limited to whether Congress acted within its jurisdiction and if due process standards were followed. While not required to provide all procedural rights of a criminal defendant, notice and an opportunity to be heard must be given. In Congress, contempt proceedings require notice and an opportunity to be heard, following due process standards. Courts may impose monetary fines instead of incarceration in inherent contempt cases to avoid a court proceeding. In Congress, contempt proceedings require notice and an opportunity to be heard, following due process standards. Courts may impose monetary fines as an alternative to incarceration in inherent contempt cases to avoid a court proceeding on habeas corpus grounds. This argument is supported by dicta from the 1821 Supreme Court decision in Anderson, questioning the extent of punishing power of deliberative assemblies. The 1821 Supreme Court decision in Anderson questioned the punishing power of deliberative assemblies, stating that imprisonment is the least possible power adequate for self-preservation. Other forms of punishment are seen as mere commutation for confinement. The Supreme Court suggested that Congress can compel testimony in investigations, similar to a court of justice, but punishment for contempt as a witness is only valid if the testimony is relevant to the House's jurisdiction. The House or Senate can conduct summary proceedings and cite a person for contempt as a witness, but there is no precedent for Congress imposing a fine in contempt cases. The House or Senate can conduct summary proceedings and cite a person for contempt as a witness without needing cooperation from the executive or judicial branches. The contemnor can seek limited judicial review through a writ of habeas corpus, but imprisonment for non-compliance with a subpoena cannot extend beyond the current session of Congress. The inherent contempt process allows for the incarceration of a contemnor until compliance with a subpoena, but imprisonment cannot go beyond the current session of Congress. However, this method is seen as outdated and ineffective, with the last use dating back to 1935. To streamline the process, initial fact-finding and witness examination could be conducted by a special committee. The inherent contempt process allows for incarceration of a contemnor until compliance with a subpoena, but imprisonment cannot exceed the current session of Congress. To streamline the process, initial fact-finding and witness examination could be conducted by a special committee, with the final decision on guilt made by the full House or Senate. Between 1795 and 1857, 14 inherent contempt actions were initiated by the House and Senate, with 8 resulting in contempt charges. In 1857, a statutory criminal contempt procedure was enacted, largely due to a specific proceeding in the House of Representatives that year. In 1857, a statutory criminal contempt procedure was enacted in response to a specific proceeding in the House of Representatives that year. The statute allows for judicial trial of the contemnor by a United States Attorney, serving as an alternative to the inherent contempt procedure. Despite a criminal contempt referral in 1858, most contempt proceedings in the following two decades were still handled at the bar of the house. In 1857, a statutory criminal contempt procedure was enacted in response to a specific proceeding in the House of Representatives. Most contempt proceedings in the following two decades were still handled at the bar of the house, rather than through criminal contempt. Today, these provisions are codified as 2 U.S.C. Sections 192 and 194, stating that a person summoned as a witness who fails to testify or produce documents is guilty of contempt. A witness summoned by a house or committee who fails to testify or produce documents may be fined up to $100,000 and imprisoned for up to one year. Section 194 outlines the procedure for referring a witness to the courts for criminal prosecution. The procedure for referring a witness to the courts for criminal prosecution under Section 194 involves approval by committee, reading the committee report on the floor, House approval of a resolution authorizing the Speaker to certify the report for prosecution, or an independent determination by the Speaker, and certification by the Speaker to the U.S. Attorney. The criminal contempt statute is punitive and aims to punish a non-cooperative witness to deter similar behavior. The criminal contempt procedure is punitive and aims to punish non-cooperative witnesses to deter similar behavior. Once a witness is voted in contempt, they lack an incentive to cooperate with the committee. In some cases, the House has certified to the U.S. Attorney that further proceedings are not necessary. The House has certified to the U.S. Attorney that further proceedings concerning contempts were not necessary where compliance with subpoenas occurred after contempt citations had been voted but before referral of the cases to grand juries. It is unclear whether the U.S. Attorney's duty to present the contempt to the grand jury is mandatory or discretionary. The U.S. Attorney's duty to present contempt to the grand jury is uncertain due to conflicting case law. In Ex parte Frankfeld, witnesses were released for not following proper procedure in a case related to violating 2 U.S.C. Section 192. The court ordered the release of witnesses for not following proper procedure. Congress prescribed reporting obdurate witnesses to the House or Senate, with the Speaker or President certifying the facts to the district attorney. The court mandated the certification of facts to the district attorney, leaving no discretion for the Speaker or President. The U.S. Attorney is obligated to submit the facts to the grand jury, as seen in United States v. United States House of Representatives. The court in Wilson v. United States determined that the duty of the Speaker to certify contempt citations to the U.S. Attorney during adjournments is discretionary, not mandatory, based on legislative history and congressional practice. The court in Wilson v. United States found that the duty of the Speaker to certify contempt citations to the U.S. Attorney during adjournments is discretionary, not mandatory. Congress's view is that a committee's contempt resolution can only be referred to the U.S. Attorney after approval by the parent body when in session. Review of a committee's contempt citation is provided by the Speaker or President of the Senate when Congress is not in session. This review may be inherently discretionary. The court in Wilson v. United States found that the duty of the Speaker to certify contempt citations to the U.S. Attorney during adjournments is discretionary. The U.S. Attorney's function may also be discretionary, despite statutes using mandatory language. U.S. Attorneys are generally given broad prosecutorial discretion, even when statutes appear to mandate their actions. The courts generally give U.S. Attorneys broad prosecutorial discretion, even when statutes use mandatory language. Congress can seek judicial enforcement of a congressional subpoena through civil enforcement in federal district court. Noncompliance may lead to contempt of court, rather than contempt of Congress. The court finds an obligation exists and issues an order, noncompliance may lead to contempt of court. The House has pursued civil enforcement before, and in 1978 Congress enacted a civil enforcement procedure applicable only to the Senate. The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia has jurisdiction over civil actions to enforce Senate subpoenas or orders. The Senate Legal Counsel can seek compliance or a declaratory judgment through this procedure. The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia has jurisdiction over civil actions to enforce Senate subpoenas or orders. The Senate Legal Counsel can seek compliance or a declaratory judgment through this procedure. The Senate may choose to seek a declaration concerning the validity of a subpoena before directly ordering compliance, giving the party a chance to comply voluntarily. The court will review the subpoena's validity regardless of the enforcement method chosen by the Senate. The court's jurisdiction is limited to enforcing congressional subpoenas, with the ability to order compliance but not to enjoin the congressional proceeding. The court can order compliance with a congressional subpoena, and if the individual still refuses, they may face contempt of court proceedings. Civil enforcement has limitations, especially when it comes to subpoenas issued to federal government officers or employees. The House of Representatives cannot use the Senate's civil enforcement statute for such cases. The House of Representatives may authorize a committee to seek civil enforcement action to compel compliance with a subpoena, as seen in the 2008 case involving Harriet Miers. This marked the first instance of a single house authorizing civil enforcement in federal court. The House of Representatives authorized a committee to seek civil enforcement of a subpoena in federal court, as seen in the 2008 case involving Harriet Miers. This marked the first congressional attempt to seek civil enforcement solely by resolution of a single house, establishing jurisdiction for such claims. In 2012, the House again authorized a committee to pursue a civil action in federal court to enforce a subpoena. In 2012, the House authorized a congressional committee to pursue civil enforcement in federal court for a subpoena issued to an executive branch official. This was in response to Attorney General Eric Holder being held in contempt of Congress for not fully complying with subpoenas related to Operation Fast and Furious. The committee was approved to initiate a civil lawsuit to enforce the outstanding subpoenas. The committee filed a civil lawsuit seeking a declaratory judgment to enforce subpoenas against the Attorney General. The court rejected the DOJ's motion to dismiss and discussed federal court jurisdiction, standing, causes of action, and separation-of-powers concerns. Motions for summary judgment were denied, and the DOJ was ordered to provide the court with information. Following the court's decision on federal court jurisdiction, standing, causes of action, and separation-of-powers concerns, motions for summary judgment were denied. The DOJ was ordered to provide a list of withheld documents and reasons for privilege. Authorization by resolution of the full House is required for civil enforcement of subpoenas or orders, as seen in previous cases involving Miers and Holder. Without such authorization, courts will not entertain civil motions. Authorization by resolution of the full House is necessary for civil enforcement of subpoenas or orders. Without this authorization, courts will not entertain civil motions on behalf of Congress or its committees. However, if an authorizing resolution by the House can be obtained, there is a likelihood that the court will allow civil enforcement of subpoenas or committee orders. The DOJ has acknowledged this possibility. The court may find no legal impediment to civil enforcement of subpoenas or committee orders. The DOJ recognizes that civil enforcement is the preferred method, but the executive branch argues that Congress cannot use inherent contempt or criminal contempt procedures against an executive official asserting executive privilege. The Attorney General has directed the U.S. Attorney to refrain from pursuing criminal contempt prosecution under certain circumstances when an executive official asserts executive privilege in response to a congressional subpoena. This stance is supported by DOJ opinions from the 1980s and past actions in contempt proceedings against various officials. The House approved contempt citations against several officials, including Anne Gorsuch Burford, Harriet Miers, Josh Bolten, and Eric Holder, but the DOJ declined to prosecute for criminal contempt. This highlights the limitations of the criminal contempt provision when executive privilege is invoked, leading Congress to seek other enforcement avenues like civil enforcement through federal courts. The 2014 controversy involving Lois Lerner at the IRS is also mentioned. The House approved contempt citations against officials like Anne Gorsuch Burford, Harriet Miers, Josh Bolten, and Eric Holder, but the DOJ did not prosecute for criminal contempt. This shows the limitations of criminal contempt when executive privilege is invoked, leading Congress to explore civil enforcement through federal courts. The 2014 case involving Lois Lerner at the IRS suggests a broader stance on using criminal contempt against executive officials. The House approved contempt citations against officials like Anne Gorsuch Burford, Harriet Miers, Josh Bolten, and Eric Holder, but the DOJ did not prosecute for criminal contempt. In the 2014 case involving Lois Lerner at the IRS, she invoked the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, leading to a contempt citation approved by the House. However, the DOJ has not pursued a criminal case against Lerner despite the contempt citation. The DOJ's past refusals to prosecute for contempt of Congress have involved executive privilege, but Lois Lerner's case is different. She invoked the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, leading to a contempt citation, but the DOJ has not pursued a criminal case against her. The committee subpoena pertains to the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. The DOJ's discretion in not pursuing criminal contempt charges against executive branch officials extends beyond cases involving executive privilege. Lessons from past disputes show Congress faces obstacles in enforcing subpoenas against officials through criminal contempt statutes. Efforts to enforce a subpoena against an executive branch official through criminal contempt may not be successful, especially if the President is involved in directing noncompliance. The DOJ is unlikely to prosecute in such cases, relying on prosecutorial discretion. The DOJ may not pursue prosecution for criminal contempt if the President is involved in directing noncompliance. In cases where an executive branch official acts against a congressional subpoena to protect personal interests, criminal contempt could still be used to punish them. The criminal contempt provision can be effective in punishing executive officials, even if the executive branch chooses not to prosecute them. Congress may enforce its subpoenas through a civil action, but this method may not adequately protect congressional prerogatives due to time constraints. Enforcing a subpoena against an executive official through a civil action may not effectively protect congressional prerogatives due to lengthy legal processes, as seen in the Miers case. Litigation to enforce a congressional subpoena could involve a prolonged appeals process, leading to delays in achieving a final, enforceable ruling. Enforcing a congressional subpoena through litigation can result in a lengthy appeals process, as seen in the Miers case. This can lead to delays in obtaining a final decision, potentially diminishing Congress's ability to effectively utilize the information gained for oversight. Congress may not always rely on the executive branch or civil enforcement to enforce subpoenas. Inherent contempt allows Congress to enforce subpoenas independently."
