Aliens can submit separate entries even if they are spouses, but unmarried children under 21 can be derivative beneficiaries.

If a lottery winner dies before getting LPR status, the visa is revoked and derivative beneficiaries are affected. Derivative beneficiary visas are counted against the 50,000 visa cap. If a diversity lottery winner dies before obtaining LPR status, the visa is automatically revoked and derivative beneficiaries are no longer entitled to diversity visa classification. Winners of the FY2005 diversity lottery will be notified by mail between May and July 2004, and visas will be issued between October 1, 2004, and September 30, 2005. Winners of the FY2005 diversity lottery must act quickly to file necessary documentation to demonstrate admissibility as LPRs before September 30, 2005.

Some question the continuation of the diversity visa lottery, preferring the 55,000 visas be used for backlog reduction in other visa categories. Supporters argue the diversity visa provides new immigrants from countries not heavily represented in the immigration system. There are calls to amend the INA to prevent nationals from terrorism-sponsoring countries from receiving visas. Some argue for amending the INA to exclude nationals from terrorism-sponsoring countries from the diversity visa lottery due to difficulties in background checks and terrorism concerns. Supporters believe the policy should be uniformly applied, and the issue of who should bear the costs of operating the lottery has also been raised. Some argue for excluding nationals from terrorism-sponsoring countries from the diversity visa lottery due to background check challenges and terrorism concerns. There are debates on who should cover the lottery operation costs and whether a fee should be charged to enter the lottery. The diversity visa is criticized for being vulnerable to fraud, but the State Department claims to be addressing these issues."
