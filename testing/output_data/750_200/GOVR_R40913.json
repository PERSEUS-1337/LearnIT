    "content": "The United States has historically had abundant natural resources, but growing industrialization and population led to increased reliance on foreign energy sources in the 20th century. Federal efforts have aimed to increase energy independence and reduce domestic consumption. The establishment of programs focused on energy efficiency, conservation of resources, and research for renewable energy sources has been prompted by fluctuations in supply driven by world events. These programs, spanning various sectors, have been periodically reauthorized and redesigned over almost 40 years to meet changing economic conditions and national interests. Since 2005, Congress has enacted major energy laws including the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT 2005), the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA), the Energy Improvement and Extension Act (EIEA), and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). These laws have established programs that apply broadly to various sectors and have been designed to meet current needs and future challenges. The Energy Improvement and Extension Act (EIEA) and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) established energy efficiency and renewable energy programs, primarily operated by the Department of Energy (DOE), Treasury, and Agriculture. Other departments like Interior, Labor, Housing, Veterans Affairs, and Small Business Administration also have some programs. This report outlines federal programs providing grants, loans, and incentives for energy efficiency, conservation, and renewable energy RDD&D. Programs are administered by various agencies including DOI, DOL, HUD, VA, and SBA, with details indexed in the appendixes. Most program descriptions for federal energy efficiency, conservation, and renewable energy RDD&D programs were compiled from authorizing statutes, the U.S. Code, Administration budget request documents, DSIRE, Assistance Listings, and Energy Star website. Budgetary figures were sourced from executive agency budget justifications and congressional committee reports. For more information on agriculture-related grant programs, refer to CRS Report R43416, Energy Provisions in the 2014 Farm Bill (P.L. 113-79): Status and Funding. For more information on programs supporting alternatives to conventional fuels and engines in transportation, refer to CRS Report R42566, Alternative Fuel and Advanced Vehicle Technology Incentives: A Summary of Federal Programs. Tax credits for biofuels and vehicles are covered in detail in the same report. The curr_chunk discusses federal renewable energy and energy efficiency incentives, including programs like Clean Renewable Energy Bonds and Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grants Program. It also covers expired federal energy efficiency and renewable energy incentive programs. The curr_chunk lists various federal renewable energy and energy efficiency incentives, including Clean Renewable Energy Bonds and Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grants Program. It also mentions expired federal energy efficiency and renewable energy incentive programs. The curr_chunk provides a summary of federal renewable energy and energy efficiency incentives, including Bonds, Advanced Energy Manufacturing Tax Credit, and Renewable Energy Grants."
