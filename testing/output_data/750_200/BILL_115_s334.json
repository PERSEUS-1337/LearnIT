    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Fracturing Regulations are Effective in State Hands Act\". Congress acknowledges the long-standing use of hydraulic fracturing in the US and the proactive state regulations to protect water resources. The 2009 report found that state regulations for oil and gas activities are environmentally proactive and preventive, providing protection for water resources. Additionally, a 2004 EPA study found no evidence of drinking water wells contaminated by hydraulic fracturing, and a 2009 report by the Ground Water Protection Council was also mentioned. The 2009 report by the Ground Water Protection Council found no evidence that hydraulic fracturing poses a risk to groundwater. States have comprehensive laws and regulations to ensure safe operations and protect drinking water. No verified cases of groundwater contamination associated with hydraulic fracturing have been found. Lisa Jackson testified that there is no proven case where the fracking process itself has affected water. Bureau of Land Management Director Bob Abbey stated that no adverse effects have been seen. The fracking process has not been proven to affect water quality, according to Lisa Jackson and Bureau of Land Management Director Bob Abbey. Activities related to hydraulic fracturing are already regulated at the Federal level under various environmental statutes. In 2011, the Secretary of the Interior announced plans for new Federal regulations on hydraulic fracturing on Federal land, despite Congress not including the process in the Safe Drinking Water Act. In 2011, the Secretary of the Interior announced plans for new Federal regulations on hydraulic fracturing on Federal land. A 2012 study by the Energy Institute at the University of Texas found no evidence of chemicals from hydraulic fracturing fluid in aquifers. On October 1, 2014, the Ground Water Protection Council and State Oil and Gas Regulatory Exchange released a report describing State-based oil and gas regulations that have substantially improved groundwater protection laws and regulations. The term \"Federal land\" in this Act includes public lands, National Forest System land, Bureau of Reclamation land, and Corps of Engineers land. State authority is also addressed in the Act. The State has sole authority to regulate well treatment with fluids and propping agents for fracturing in geologic formations to enhance oil, gas, or geothermal production on State land. Federal land is subject to separate regulations. The State regulates well treatment with fluids and propping agents for fracturing in geologic formations on State land, while Federal land follows separate regulations."
