Congressional members are working to resolve these issues and move the program forward. This report outlines the history of UCLASS requirements development in response to Congressional requests. The report details the history of UCLASS requirements development, based on open-domain information. In 1999, the Navy and DARPA began research on an unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV), while the Air Force and DARPA worked on a separate UCAV project. The Navy's UCAV was designed for a specific niche. The Navy and DARPA collaborated on a UCAV project, with the Navy focusing on reconnaissance missions and identifying targets for manned aircraft attack waves. Northrop Grumman independently built the X-47A air vehicle for the N-UCAV program, with its first flight in February 2003. The OSD issued a program decision memorandum on December 31, 2002. The OSD directed the consolidation of Navy and Air Force UCAV programs into a joint demonstration program called Joint Unmanned Combat Air Systems (J-UCAS) in 2003 to demonstrate technical feasibility and military utility. The Joint Unmanned Combat Air Systems (J-UCAS) program was a DARPA-Air Force-Navy effort to demonstrate the technical feasibility, military utility, and operational value of a networked system of high-performance, weaponized unmanned air vehicles for missions in denied enemy territory. The 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review called for the termination of the J-UCAS program. The 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review terminated the J-UCAS program and called for the development of a new bomber by the Air Force and an unmanned longer-range carrier-based aircraft by the Navy. This led to the creation of the Navy Unmanned Combat Air System (N-UCAS) with similar requirements as J-UCAS, focusing on operating from aircraft carriers and providing persistent, penetrating capabilities in denied airspace. The Navy initiated the Unmanned Combat Air System Demonstration (UCAS-D) program in 2006 as part of the N-UCAS program to demonstrate the feasibility of operating unmanned air combat systems from aircraft carriers. In 2013, the Navy successfully launched and landed a UCAS-D on an aircraft carrier. The Navy invested over $1.4 billion in the UCAS-D program, a subset of N-UCAS, which aimed to develop unmanned vehicles with capabilities similar to manned fighters. Following the success of UCAS-D, the Navy received approval to start planning for the UCLASS acquisition program, focusing on sea-based surveillance and operational platforms. The Navy invested in the UCAS-D program to develop unmanned vehicles with capabilities similar to manned fighters. The UCLASS program aimed to address a capability gap in sea-based surveillance and enhance the Navy's ability to operate in highly contested environments. The JROC approved the UCLASS Initial Capabilities Document, defining it as a carrier-based Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance asset with precision strike capabilities. In 2012, the JROC revisited the UCLASS requirement during budget preparations. The JROC revisited the UCLASS requirement for permissive airspace ISR capabilities in the FY2014 budget submission, favoring intelligence and surveillance over strike capabilities due to budget constraints. Dyke Weatherington cited fiscal realities for the reduction in strike capability of the Navy's next-generation carrier-based unmanned aerial vehicle. The Pentagon's director of unmanned warfare and ISR, Dyke Weatherington, explained that the Navy's next-generation carrier-based unmanned aerial vehicle was developed in response to fiscal constraints. JROCMs 086-12 and 196-12 redefined the scope of the program to prioritize affordability and adaptability, emphasizing the need for a platform supporting various missions. The JROC highlighted affordability as the top priority in a December 2012 memorandum. The Office of the Secretary of Defense emphasized affordability as the top priority for the program, setting a limit of $150 million for the recurring fly-away cost of air vehicles. The Navy issued a draft request for proposals for the UCLASS system on April 17, 2014, with limited funding pressuring industry to provide mature systems and focus on cost during development. The Navy issued a draft request for proposals for the UCLASS system on April 17, 2014, emphasizing affordability, timely fielding, and endurance. The program aims to provide intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance orbits at tactically significant ranges 24/7 over uncontested airspace, with a light strike capability. The UCLASS system aims to provide intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance orbits at tactically significant ranges 24/7 over uncontested airspace, with a light strike capability. The design allows for capability growth to operate in contested environments, and the end goal is an autonomous aircraft capable of precision missions. The UCLASS system is expected to grow into missions required before the 2012 JROC memo, aiming for an autonomous aircraft capable of precision strike in a contested environment. The timeline for procurement is unclear, with ongoing delays due to changes in requirements. Since September 2013, the Navy's UCLASS schedule has been delayed due to questions about its mission and capabilities. A review of airborne surveillance systems and carrier air wing's future has led to schedule adjustments, with the air system contract now expected in fiscal year 2017, a 3-year delay. Early operational capability is now projected for fiscal year 2022, a 2-year delay. The Navy's UCLASS program is facing delays, with early operational capability now expected in fiscal year 2022, a 2-year delay. A Milestone A review is anticipated in fiscal year 2017, a 3-year delay from the previous timeline. The program's schedule may continue to be impacted by various reviews and changes in DOD priorities."
