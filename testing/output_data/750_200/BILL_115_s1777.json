Employees employed for less than a full year by an applicable taxpayer will have the amount described in subparagraph (A) reduced based on the ratio of weeks not employed to 52 in the calendar year. The applicable percentage for determining employee benefits is based on a ratio to 52 in the calendar year. The applicable employee ratio determines the percentage for employee benefits as follows: 25% or less = 25%, greater than 25% but not greater than 50% = 50%, greater than 50% but not greater than 75% = 75%, greater than 75% = 100%. The low-wage employee ratio is calculated as the percentage of low-wage employees to total employees for an applicable employer. This ratio is used to determine the health and retirement offset for employees. The applicable employer's health and retirement offset can be reduced by 25 percentage points if they offer full-time low-wage employees the opportunity to enroll for all months during the calendar year. Employees (and their spouse and dependents) have the opportunity to enroll in minimum essential coverage under an eligible employer-sponsored health plan for all months during the calendar year, where the plan's share of allowed costs is at least 60 percent and the required contribution is met.

The annual retirement benefit must meet certain criteria, including a contribution of at least 2 percent multiplied by the employee's years of service with the employer or 20 percent multiplied by the employee's final average pay.

The Secretary may prescribe regulations for alternative plan designs for applicable employers. The Secretary may prescribe regulations for applicable employers to meet retirement benefit requirements through a combination of defined contribution or defined benefit plans. Plans must meet requirements without considering social security contributions and benefits.
