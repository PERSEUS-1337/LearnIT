The growth in international trade, especially containerized trade, is straining the nation's transportation network and causing traffic congestion near major U.S. international gateways. Between 2000 and 2005, the value of international trade increased from $2 trillion to $2.6 trillion, and the number of containerized trade shipments rose from 59 million to 81 million 20-foot equivalent units. Between 2000 and 2005, international trade value grew from $2 trillion to $2.6 trillion, with containerized trade shipments increasing from 59 million to 81 million 20-foot equivalent units. The United States is part of the World Trade Organization and has agreed to 11 free trade agreements, with negotiations ongoing for 4 more agreements. Traffic congestion in the United States is worsening, leading to Americans wasting billions of hours in traffic and spending billions of dollars on extra fuel each year. Additionally, over 200 freight bottlenecks are causing economic losses and delays in the goods movement industry annually. The goods movement industry incurs $8 billion in economic losses annually and 243 million hours of lost productivity due to traffic congestion. Government investments of $235 billion in 2006, $304 billion in 2015, and $472 billion in 2030 are needed to maintain and improve transportation systems for economic productivity. The government must invest $288 billion in 2006, $368 billion in 2015, and $561 billion in 2030 to address transportation needs and reduce freight congestion along trade corridors. The goal is to increase economic productivity and develop corridors to support freight movement.
