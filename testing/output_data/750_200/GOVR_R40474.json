    "content": "This report examines recent gun regulations in the District of Columbia and proposed congressional amendments. Key laws discussed include federal provisions like the National Firearms Act and Gun Control Act, the D.C. Firearms Control Regulation Act, the Second Amendment Enforcement Act (H.R. 645), and the District's Firearms Control Amendment Act and Inoperable Pistol Amendment Act. The curr_chunk discusses congressional proposals to amend the District of Columbia's gun laws, including the Firearms Control Amendment Act of 2008 and the Inoperable Pistol Amendment Act of 2008. It mentions Title II of S. 160 from the 111th Congress and H.R. 645 from the 112th Congress, highlighting their similarities and differences. This report compares congressional proposals to amend DC's gun laws, focusing on S. 160 from the 111th Congress and H.R. 645 from the 112th Congress. It analyzes the impact of these proposals on DC's firearms laws post the FCAA and IPAA, following the Supreme Court's decision in District of Columbia v. Heller. After the Supreme Court's decision in District of Columbia v. Heller, DC firearms laws changed to protect an individual's right to possess a firearm for self-defense within the home. The decision invalidated three provisions of the District's Firearms Control Regulation Act, including the ban on handgun registration. The Supreme Court's decision in District of Columbia v. Heller invalidated provisions of the District's Firearms Control Regulation Act, including the ban on handgun registration and restrictions on carrying a pistol without a license. The opinion did not address the District's license to carry requirement. After the Supreme Court's decision in District of Columbia v. Heller, the DC Council enacted emergency legislation to amend the city's gun laws temporarily. The Firearms Control Emergency Amendment Act of 2008 was the first of several emergency enactments, but some criticized the changes for not fully complying with the Heller decision. After the DC Council enacted emergency legislation to temporarily amend gun laws following the Heller decision, H.R. 6691, the Second Amendment Enforcement Act, was introduced in Congress to overturn or loosen provisions of the District's existing gun laws. H.R. 6842, which included the content of H.R. 6691, was passed in the House of Representatives but not in the Senate. H.R. 6691, aimed at amending gun laws in DC, was included in H.R. 6842, which passed in the House but not the Senate. Senator John Ensign introduced an amendment using the same language in S. 160, which was approved by the Senate but faced stalled progress. The Senate passed S. 160 with a vote of 61-37, but progress on the legislation stalled. In response, the DC Council enacted emergency legislation until permanent laws could be established. The Firearms Control Amendment Act of 2008 and the Inoperable Pistol Amendment Act of 2008 were passed by the DC Council and later became effective in 2009. The Firearms Control Amendment Act of 2008 and the Inoperable Pistol Amendment Act of 2008 were passed by the DC Council and transmitted to Congress for approval. These amendments amended firearms provisions in the DC Code and imposed new restrictions on firearm regulation and ownership. The amendments were challenged but upheld in court in 2010. The Firearms Control Amendment Act of 2008 and the Inoperable Pistol Amendment Act of 2008 amended firearms provisions in the DC Code, imposing new restrictions on firearm regulation and ownership. The language of Title II- S. 160 was adopted from a previous bill introduced in the 110th Congress. The most recent congressional legislation, H.R. 645, seeks to overturn or loosen many of the District's gun provisions, taking into consideration the passage of the FCAA and IPAA. Sections 3-8 of H.R. 645 would amend firearms provisions in the DC Code similarly to Title II- S. 160, limiting the District's ability to regulate firearm possession and repealing the registration scheme. Sections 9-13 would preserve certain provisions. The Firearms Control Amendment Act of 2008 and the Inoperable Pistol Amendment Act of 2008 imposed new restrictions on firearm regulation and ownership in DC. H.R. 645 seeks to overturn or loosen these provisions, limiting the District's ability to regulate firearm possession and repealing the registration scheme. Federal firearms laws set minimum standards, allowing states to supplement with their own laws. The District of Columbia has the authority to create its own firearms laws under the Home Rule Act, including regulations on firearms possession. The Home Rule Act grants the DC Council the authority to regulate firearms, allowing them to amend laws passed by Congress. Congress still retains the power to legislate for the District and impose limits on the DC government's legislative authority. The Home Rule Act grants the DC Council the authority to regulate firearms and amend laws passed by Congress. Congress retains the power to legislate for the District and impose limits on the DC government's legislative authority. The question of whether the District of Columbia can amend or repeal a particular congressional enactment depends on Congress's express authority. Under the Home Rule Act, the District of Columbia's ability to amend or repeal a congressional enactment depends on Congress's intent. For example, H.R. 645 and S. 160 impose limits on the District's legislative authority in certain areas. The District of Columbia is prohibited from enacting laws that restrict private ownership or use of firearms, as stated in H.R. 645. The proposed language in H.R. 645 emphasizes that the Council would not have the authority to promulgate laws related to firearms regulation, regardless of any provisions in the DC Code or other laws. It is unclear what would constitute a \"constructive prohibition.\" The proposed language in H.R. 645 restricts the Council from enacting firearms regulations under the DC Code or any other law. It is unclear what would constitute a \"constructive prohibition\" on acquiring firearms. The language also prevents the District from prohibiting possession of firearms not already regulated under federal law. District firearms laws would align closely with federal laws, except for carrying regulations. The proposed language in H.R. 645 limits the District from enacting firearms regulations beyond federal laws. It is unclear what would violate the prohibition against discouraging private firearm ownership. The District's authority to enforce sanctions for firearm misuse would be restricted. The proposed language in H.R. 645 limits the District from enacting firearms regulations beyond federal laws, restricting its authority to enforce sanctions for firearm misuse. The District could regulate concealed or open carry but may not explicitly prohibit individuals from carrying firearms altogether. The proposed language in H.R. 645 limits the District from enacting firearms regulations beyond federal laws, allowing regulation of concealed or open carry but not explicitly prohibiting individuals from carrying firearms altogether. The District could argue for a complete ban on open or concealed carry, but opposing views suggest that the District may not have the authority to do so under this provision. The proposed language in H.R. 645 limits the District from enacting firearms regulations beyond federal laws, allowing regulation of concealed or open carry but not explicitly prohibiting individuals from carrying firearms altogether. The DC Code's previous definition of \"machine gun\" included any semiautomatic weapon capable of shooting more than 12 shots without manual reloading, which was prohibited from being registered. Under the District's old definition, a \"machine gun\" could shoot more than 12 shots without manual reloading and was prohibited from being registered. The NFA defines a \"machine gun\" as a weapon that can shoot automatically more than one shot with a single trigger function. The District amended its definition of \"machine gun\" to align with federal law, allowing semiautomatic firearms to be registered. However, the District also prohibits certain firearms based on a list similar to California's laws. If H.R. 645 is passed, the definition of \"machine gun\" may change. If H.R. 645 is enacted, the definition of \"machine gun\" in DC would revert to its pre-Heller state, aligning with federal law. The DC Code prohibits registration of certain firearms, including sawed-off shotguns and short-barreled rifles. The DC Code prohibits registration of certain firearms, including shotguns, machine guns, short barreled rifles, or pistols not validly registered prior to September 24, 1976. The FCAA now allows the registration of pistols for self-defense, and semiautomatic handguns may be registered as long as the applicant meets other requirements. An exemption from the registration requirement is included for a person who temporarily possesses a firearm registered to another while in the home. The FCAA includes an exemption from registration for a person temporarily possessing a firearm registered to another in the home for self-defense. Amendments are made to qualification and information requirements for firearm registration, including restrictions for those convicted of certain offenses within five years. Applicants with certain criminal convictions or history of violent behavior within five years are prohibited from registering a firearm under the FCAA. Additionally, completion of firearms training or safety is required for applicants. The FCAA prohibits individuals with foreign protection orders from registering a firearm. Applicants must complete firearms training, provide an affidavit signed by a certified instructor, and pass a firearms competency test. The Chief of Police must conduct ballistics identification on registered pistols and can only register one pistol per person every 30 days, except for new residents with legally owned pistols from another jurisdiction. H.R. 645 would repeal the registration requirement for firearms in DC, allowing residents to purchase firearms without needing a registration certificate. The bill would still prohibit possession of certain types of firearms but remove the registration process. H.R. 645 would repeal the registration requirement for firearms in DC, eliminating the need for a registration certificate or licensing of gun owners. The Chief would no longer be required to have pistols submitted for ballistics testing or limit registration to one per month, allowing individuals to purchase multiple handguns per month. H.R. 645 aims to repeal the registration requirement for firearms in DC, allowing individuals to purchase multiple handguns per month without restrictions. The bill would also permit the transfer of ammunition to any person, including DC residents. Section 5 of H.R. 645 eliminates ammunition certificate requirements and allows the transfer of ammunition to any person, including DC residents. It also removes the need for licensed dealers to track ammunition inventory. Both H.R. 645 and Title II- S. 160 enable interstate firearm purchases, but through different methods. Both H.R. 645 and Title II- S. 160 allow interstate purchase of firearms, with different approaches. Title II- S. 160 proposes an amendment to federal law to permit federal licensees in Maryland or Virginia to sell handguns to DC residents. H.R. 645, on the other hand, suggests amending the DC Code to treat federally licensed firearms dealers in Maryland or Virginia as DC dealers. Under the proposed legislation, federally licensed firearms dealers in Maryland or Virginia would be treated as DC dealers under the DC Code. This would allow them to sell handguns to District residents if certain legal conditions are met. There is no federal requirement on how firearms should be stored or secured. The GCA requires licensed dealers to sell handguns with secure storage or safety devices. The District's trigger lock requirement, deemed unconstitutional, mandated firearms to be unloaded, disassembled, or locked unless in use for lawful purposes. The FCAA amended these provisions. Under the FCAA, any firearm in lawful possession must be unloaded and secured by trigger lock to prevent access by minors without parental permission. Title II- S. 160 would repeal the section of the FCAA that requires firearms to be securely locked unless carried on a person. In contrast, H.R. 645 would create penalties for allowing minors access to loaded firearms. Section 7 of H.R. 645, similar to DC law, imposes penalties for allowing minors access to loaded firearms resulting in injury. Violators would be guilty of unlawful storage and subject to a fine up to $1,000 and/or a term. The proposed legislation in H.R. 645 imposes penalties for minors accessing loaded firearms resulting in injury. Violators could face a fine of up to $1,000 and/or a one-year imprisonment, with exceptions for securely stored firearms or those kept on the person's body for quick access. The legislation in H.R. 645 imposes penalties for minors accessing loaded firearms resulting in injury, with exceptions for securely stored firearms or those kept on the person's body for quick access. Exceptions include informing the minor of the key location or combination of the trigger lock, unlawful entry, self-defense, supervised hunting or target shooting, and law enforcement possession during official duties. Currently, under DC law, a general violation of the registration scheme for firearms warrants a fine of up to $1,000 or one year's imprisonment, or both. A second conviction for unregistered possession of a firearm in certain areas will result in a fine. H.R. 645 would amend the DC Code to remove criminal penalties for unregistered possession of a firearm, with fines up to $5,000 or imprisonment up to five years for repeat offenders. Title II- S. 160 would also eliminate penalties for selling firearms to minors. District's firearms laws were amended to redefine terms like \"machine gun\" and \"firearm.\" The District of Columbia amended its firearms laws, including definitions like \"machine gun\" and \"firearm.\" H.R. 645 aims to harmonize definitions between Titles 7 and 22 of the DC Code. The IPAA allows DC to restrict firearm possession on its property. The IPAA amended DC law to allow the District of Columbia to restrict firearm possession on its property. Private property owners in DC can also prohibit or restrict firearms on their premises, except for law enforcement personnel. Private property owners in the District of Columbia may prohibit or restrict firearms on their premises, except for law enforcement personnel. Additionally, the District has the authority to restrict or prohibit firearm possession on public property. The District of Columbia has the authority to restrict or prohibit firearm possession on public property, including buildings with security measures in place. This does not apply to lessees in residential or business premises. The proposed language narrows the application of firearm regulations to \"buildings or structures under its control\" in the District of Columbia, potentially excluding real property. It also clarifies that lessees occupying buildings under the District's control are exempt from these regulations. The District of Columbia's proposed firearm regulations would apply to buildings or structures under its control, with exemptions for lessees occupying these spaces. Uncertainty remains regarding the extent of the District's authority over buildings without specified security measures. The District of Columbia's proposed firearm regulations would repeal the Chief's authority to issue licenses for concealed carry, allowing her discretion to do so. H.R. 645 would also maintain a provision prohibiting carrying a rifle or a firearm. H.R. 645 would allow the Chief to issue concealed carry licenses at her discretion, while maintaining a provision prohibiting carrying rifles or shotguns in the District of Columbia. States can also impose their own laws on carrying firearms. The District currently permits persons with valid firearm registrations to carry firearms in specific circumstances, as outlined by the IPAA. H.R. 645 would modify these provisions to allow the Chief to issue concealed carry licenses at her discretion. H.R. 645 would allow individuals to carry firearms without a license in their dwelling, place of business, on land they own or have permission to be on, for recreational or training purposes, and while transporting it lawfully as permitted by District or federal law. H.R. 645 would restore the Chief's authority to issue concealed carry licenses, allowing firearm owners to carry their weapons outside specific circumstances. The IPAA allows lawful transportation of firearms for any lawful purpose, as long as the firearm is unloaded and not readily accessible in a vehicle. H.R. 645 makes technical changes to the District Code regarding the transportation of firearms, including toy and antique pistols. It also grants jurisdiction to the Office of Administrative Hearings for cases related to firearms dealer licenses. H.R. 645 grants jurisdiction to the Office of Administrative Hearings for cases related to firearms dealer licenses, but it may no longer be necessary due to the repeal of the firearm registration scheme. Amendments to the DC Code under the FCAA and IPAA would be eliminated under the proposed legislation. The congressional proposal in H.R. 645 would repeal the FCAA and IPAA, leading to the elimination of related provisions in the DC Code. This would impact the requirements for obtaining a dealer's license and engaging in firearm transactions. The FCAA created new requirements for obtaining a dealer's license and engaging in firearm transactions. H.R. 645 would repeal the District's registration scheme, allowing individuals not prohibited by federal or District law to apply for a dealer's license or purchase firearms from licensed dealers. The federal GCA prohibits certain individuals from possessing firearms, including those convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment exceeding one year, fugitives, users of controlled substances, and those adjudicated as mentally ill. Reporting duties for dealers regarding lost, stolen, or destroyed firearms and ammunition would be repealed. Individuals prohibited from possessing firearms under federal regulations include those convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment exceeding one year, fugitives, users of controlled substances, mentally ill individuals, illegal immigrants, dishonorably discharged military personnel, renounced U.S. citizens, individuals under restraining orders for domestic violence, and those convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence. The Federal regulations prohibit certain individuals from possessing firearms, including those convicted of certain crimes, fugitives, mentally ill individuals, illegal immigrants, dishonorably discharged military personnel, renounced U.S. citizens, individuals under restraining orders for domestic violence, and those convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence. It is unlawful for licensed dealers and non-licensed persons to sell or transfer firearms to individuals falling within these categories. The FCAA imposes new eligibility requirements for registration certificates, which must be met by both non-licensed persons and licensed dealers wishing to transfer firearms. Under D.C. law, a non-licensed person may only sell or transfer firearms to a licensed dealer. Private sales between non-licensed individuals must go through a licensed dealer. H.R. 645 maintains the prohibition on licensed dealers transferring firearms to those prohibited by federal or DC law. H.R. 645 would remove registration requirements under DC law for firearm transfers, making only federal disqualifications applicable. It also affects the assault weapons ban by including specific firearms and their variations. The definition of \"assault weapon\" includes specific rifles, shotguns, and pistols, as well as semiautomatic firearms with military-type characteristics. The Chief can designate any firearm as an assault weapon if it poses a similar threat to those listed in the definition. The Chief has the power to designate any firearm as an assault weapon if it poses a similar threat to those listed in the definition. The new definition of \"assault weapon\" also applies in the Assault Weapon Manufacturing Strict Liability Act of 1990, holding manufacturers, importers, or dealers strictly liable for any damage resulting from the discharge of the assault weapon in the District of. The FCAA imposes strict liability for damages caused by assault weapons in DC, including those from large capacity ammunition feeding devices. H.R. 645 aims to repeal these provisions. The FCAA prohibits possession of large capacity ammunition feeding devices in DC, even though semiautomatic firearms are now allowed. H.R. 645 aims to repeal this provision. Under the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, licensed dealers are prohibited from transferring firearms to non-licensed individuals without a background check from the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). If no response is received after three business days, the dealer can proceed with the transfer after verifying the transferee's identity with valid identification documents. The DC Code and the IPAA impose waiting periods for firearm transfers. Licensed dealers must conduct background checks before transferring firearms, while non-licensed individuals are not required to do so under federal law. The IPAA now mandates a 10-day waiting period for firearm transfers. The IPAA mandates a 10-day waiting period for all firearm transfers, not just pistols. If repealed, the waiting period for handguns would revert back to 48 hours. The FCAA added provisions regarding microstamping for semiautomatic pistols manufactured after January 1, 2011. New requirements were set forth in sections 503 and 504, including the mandate that no licensee can sell a pistol that is not microstamp-ready. The FCAA added new sections 503 and 504, setting requirements for microstamp-ready semiautomatic pistols and prohibiting the sale of pistols not on the California Roster. The FCAA prohibits the sale of pistols not on the California Roster in DC since January 1, 2009. Ownership is allowed only if the pistol was lawfully owned and registered before that date. Residents can only sell or transfer such pistols through licensed firearms dealers. The FCAA prohibits the sale of pistols not on the California Roster in DC since January 1, 2009. A dealer with such a pistol can only transfer it to another licensed firearms dealer. The Chief reviews the roster annually for changes and can revise it.

The FCAA prohibits the sale of certain pistols in DC since 2009. The IPAA requires a special permit for firearm discharge and allows the District to restrict possession on its property. Private property owners can also restrict firearms possession, except for law enforcement personnel."
