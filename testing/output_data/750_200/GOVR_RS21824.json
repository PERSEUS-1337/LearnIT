Studies showed an increase in drug-related incidents on college campuses despite a general decrease in overall campus crime rates. Congress expressed worry about the rising number of drug and alcohol-related incidents during reauthorization discussions. Representative Souder highlighted the epidemic of drug abuse and proposed student eligibility provisions as a crucial first step in addressing the issue. During debates on the 1998 HEA amendments, Representative Souder emphasized the epidemic of drug abuse and proposed student eligibility provisions to address the issue. Congress added a provision to eliminate student eligibility for financial assistance for those convicted of drug-related crimes under P.L. 105-244. The legislation specifies that students convicted of drug offenses will not be eligible for federal student assistance under Title IV of the HEA. Students convicted of drug offenses will be ineligible for federal student assistance under Title IV of the HEA. The period of ineligibility depends on the type and number of convictions. Indefinite ineligibility occurs with multiple convictions, requiring completion of a drug rehabilitation program or record expungement for eligibility reinstatement. The period of ineligibility for federal student assistance due to drug offenses depends on the type and number of convictions. Possession of a controlled substance results in ineligibility for one to indefinite years, while sale of a controlled substance leads to ineligibility for two years to indefinite. Eligibility can be reinstated by completing a drug rehabilitation program or having the conviction removed from the student's record. The period of ineligibility for federal student assistance due to drug offenses varies based on the type and number of convictions. For a first offense, the period is two years from the date of conviction, while for a second offense, it is indefinite. Convictions prior to turning 18 or that have been overturned do not affect eligibility. Indefinitely ineligible students can regain eligibility by completing a drug rehabilitation program. Eligible programs must meet specific regulations. To regain eligibility for federal student assistance after a drug offense, students must complete a drug rehabilitation program that meets specific requirements outlined in program regulations. These requirements include receiving funds from government programs, being recognized by government agencies or courts, receiving payment from licensed insurance companies or healthcare providers, and conducting at least two unannounced drug tests. Participation in a rehabilitation program administered by a licensed hospital or medical doctor includes at least two unannounced drug tests. It reduces ineligibility for federal student assistance after a drug offense. The program can be completed for any conviction, not just those resulting in indefinite ineligibility. Since the adoption of the provision allowing participation in a rehabilitation program for any conviction, more than 180,000 students have been denied federal financial aid. This represents fewer than .25% of all federal financial aid applicants. The provision allowing participation in a rehabilitation program for any conviction has resulted in fewer than .25% of federal financial aid applicants being denied aid. California and Texas have seen a high number of students declared ineligible. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 amended the provision to only apply to convictions while the student is enrolled in postsecondary education. The amended provision specifies that only convictions for the sale or possession of a controlled substance while enrolled in postsecondary education and receiving Title IV student aid would disqualify a student from federal aid. The period of ineligibility remains based on the type of conviction, recency, and prior convictions. Legislative proposals for Title IV of the HEA may be considered in the upcoming reauthorization. Title IV of the HEA may be considered in the upcoming reauthorization, with legislative proposals to modify the existing drug conviction provision. Issues surrounding implementation, penalties, and who should be penalized continue to arise. Selected issues for reauthorization discussions include the types of penalties, deserving crimes for disqualification from financial aid, and the addition of this provision. During the 1998 reauthorization discussions, the provision for student eligibility requirements was added due to concerns about drug usage on college campuses and the rise in drug-related crimes. Critics argue that singling out drugs is unfair, with Representative Frank opposing this approach. During the 1998 reauthorization discussions, a provision for student eligibility requirements was added due to concerns about drug usage on college campuses and the rise in drug-related crimes. Critics argue that singling out drugs is unfair, with Representative Frank opposing this approach by stating that treating drug convictions more harshly than other crimes like rape, arson, or armed robbery is unjust. Supporters justify focusing on drug-related crimes by pointing out their prevalence on college campuses. The implications of limiting financial aid eligibility to students convicted of drug-related crimes may be considered during reauthorization. During reauthorization, the consideration of financial aid eligibility for students convicted of drug-related crimes may arise. The existing provision does not differentiate between misdemeanor or felony convictions, resulting in loss of eligibility regardless of jail time served. Separate ineligibility periods for selling versus possession of controlled substances acknowledge a distinction. The existing provision for financial aid eligibility does not differentiate between misdemeanor or felony drug convictions, leading to loss of eligibility regardless of jail time served. Distinctions are made between selling and possession of controlled substances, acknowledging a difference between users and sellers. Congress may also debate the impact of felony versus misdemeanor drug convictions on student aid eligibility."
