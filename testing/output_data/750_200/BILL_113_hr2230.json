The \"Track It to Prevent It Act\" includes sections on findings, definitions, improved climate assessments, inclusion of disciplinary actions, service-wide assessments, health welfare inspections, security reviews, diversity management role in sexual harassment cases, and authorization of appropriations. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress found that in fiscal year 2012, there were 3,374 reported sexual assault cases in the Armed Forces, a 6% increase from the previous year.

Climate assessments are mandatory by law, and commanders must comply as it is their core responsibility. Climate assessments are required by law for commanders to create a safe environment for their units and identify trends in bad behavior like sexual harassment and assault. Improved performance assessments and reporting are needed to address these issues. According to a recent Government Accountability Office report, reasons for not reporting sexual harassment and assault in the military include doubts about action being taken and fear of career impact. Commanders condoning or ignoring misconduct perpetuates a culture of sexual misconduct in the military. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The term \"sexual harassment\" is defined in Department of Defense Directive 1350.2, and \"sexual assault\" refers to offenses in section 920 of title 10, United States Code. The Secretary of Defense must ensure that command climate assessment results are shared with relevant commanders and higher levels of command. Each military department must include a designated form in performance evaluations for senior commanders to indicate if required climate assessments have been conducted. Failure to conduct assessments will have consequences. The Inspector General of the Department of Defense will develop a tracking system to monitor commanders' compliance with conducting climate assessments. Failure to conduct assessments will be noted in the commander's performance evaluation and may impact future promotions. Unit commanders will work with the Inspector General to gather climate compliance reports. Unit commanders must work with the Inspector General to gather climate assessments and develop compliance reports. These reports should include concerns expressed by unit members, perceptions of leadership, and a strategic plan to address the concerns. SEC. 5. INCLUSION OF LETTER OF REPRIMANDS, NONPUNITIVE LETTER OF REPRIMANDS AND COUNSELING STATEMENTS. The Secretary of Defense mandates commanders to include disciplinary actions related to sexual harassment or assault in the performance evaluations of Armed Forces members to increase visibility, identify trends of misconduct early, discipline repeat offenders, and prevent the transfer of sexual offenders. Additionally, there is a provision for service-wide 360 assessments. The Secretary of each military department is required to develop a 360-degree assessment program based on the Army's MSAF Program. The Secretary of Defense must report to Congress on the feasibility of including the 360-degree approach in performance evaluations. Individual counseling is also mandated as part of the program. Individual counseling is mandated as part of the performance evaluation process in each military department. The Secretary of each military department conducts monthly health welfare inspections to ensure security, military readiness, and discipline. Results are provided to commanders. Additionally, there is a review of security at military installations, including barracks and residences. The Secretary of Defense will review security measures on military installations, focusing on barracks and residences to ensure the safety of Armed Forces members and their dependents. This includes identifying security gaps and evaluating the use of 24-hour electronic monitoring or security personnel. The Secretary of Defense will assess security measures on military installations, specifically in barracks and residences, to address security gaps. A study will be conducted to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of 24-hour electronic monitoring or security personnel at entry points. Within 90 days, a report with cost estimates to eliminate security gaps and implement 24-hour monitoring will be submitted to Congress. SEC. 9. REVIEW OF THE OFFICE OF DIVERSITY MANAGEMENT AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITY ROLE IN SEXUAL HARASSMENT CASES. The Secretary of Defense will review the Office of Diversity Management and Equal Opportunity to identify resource gaps, assess its role in sexual harassment cases, and evaluate its collaboration with the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office.
