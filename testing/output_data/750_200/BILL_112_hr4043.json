    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Military Readiness and Southern Sea Otter Conservation Act\" and pertains to the Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness and Conservation Act. The Congress finds that the United States Fish and Wildlife Service developed a relocation and management plan for southern sea otters as authorized by Public Law 99-625. National defense-related activities at San Nicolas Island have not adversely affected southern sea otters. The expansion of the southern sea otter population into the area designated by Public Law 99-625 may have national security impacts due to military training programs evolving and requiring flexibility in training events. Military installations in California must have Sikes Act Compliant Integrated Natural Resources Management Plans. Public Law 99-625 authorized the designation of otters at San Nicolas Island as a nonessential experimental population under the Endangered Species Act and Marine Mammal Protection Act. The purpose of the Act of 1972 is to enhance conservation of the southern sea otter population while allowing for military readiness activities on San Nicolas Island. The Stump National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003 establishes the Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas for national defense purposes, including Naval Base Ventura County San Nicolas Island and Begg Rock. The Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas were established for national defense purposes, including Naval Base Ventura County San Nicolas Island and Begg Rock, and Naval Base Coronado San Clemente Island. The San Clemente Island 3NM Safety Zone includes Naval Base Coronado San Clemente Island and adjacent waters up to 3 nautical miles from the shore. The Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton area includes specific coordinates within its boundaries. The Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas are specified by coordinates and exempt from certain provisions of the Endangered Species Act for incidental takings of southern sea otters. The Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas are exempt from certain provisions of the Marine Mammal Protection Act for incidental takings of southern sea otters during military readiness activities. The Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas allow for the treatment of southern sea otters as species proposed to be listed under the Endangered Species Act during military activities. No federal law requires the removal of southern sea otters from these areas. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 allows for the protection of southern sea otters in the Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas, with no requirement for their removal. The Secretary of the Interior can revise or terminate exceptions if military activities impede otter conservation. The Secretary of the Navy is required to monitor the Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas every three years to track the southern sea otter population growth or decline. Reports on the monitoring must be submitted to Congress and the public every three years. The Secretary of the Navy must report to Congress and the public every three years on monitoring activities in the Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas. This section does not override any other federal laws. Ecosystem management plans must comply with relevant laws and involve the Directors of the US Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries. The Director of the US Fish and Wildlife Service and the Director of the National Marine Fisheries, in collaboration with the Marine Mammal Commission, are required to develop an ecosystem management plan for waters off the coast of California. The plan aims to ensure the recovery of the southern sea otter, black abalone, and white abalone, as well as maintain commercial shellfish fisheries at current harvest levels. The Director of the US Fish and Wildlife Service will assess the carrying capacity of southern sea otter habitat and continue implementing the relocation and management plan. The Director of the US Fish and Wildlife Service will continue implementing the relocation and management plan for southern sea otters until the completion of the required management plan and assessment. Definitions for incidental taking and optimum sustainable population are provided in this section. The curr_chunk defines terms related to the management of southern sea otters, including \"optimum sustainable population\" and \"take.\" The curr_chunk defines the term 'southern sea otter' as Enhydra lutris nereis and explains the term 'take' in relation to regulations under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 and the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972. The term 'military readiness activity' is defined as activities related to combat training and testing of military equipment by the Armed Forces, as per the Bob Stump National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003. The term 'military readiness activity' refers to combat training and testing of military equipment by the Armed Forces for proper operation and suitability for combat use.
