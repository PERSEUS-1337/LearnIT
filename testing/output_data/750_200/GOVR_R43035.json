    "content": "Since Burma's military junta transferred power to a quasi-civilian government in 2011, Congress has mostly deferred to the White House and relevant departments on U.S. policy towards Burma. The Obama Administration has primarily used executive authority or existing legislation for policy adjustments, with occasional consultations with congressional committees. The Obama Administration has made policy adjustments towards Burma using executive authority and existing legislation, consulting with congressional committees. However, further changes may require direct congressional action. Congress may need to reassess the situation in Burma and play a more active role in determining U.S. policy towards the country. The Obama Administration announced a new approach to U.S. relations with Burma in 2009, maintaining existing sanctions but adding elements like direct dialogue with Burma's ruling military junta to promote democracy and human rights. The Obama Administration's new approach to U.S. relations with Burma in 2009 included direct dialogue with the ruling military junta to promote democracy, human rights, and international security cooperation. The policy aimed to support a unified, peaceful, prosperous, and democratic Burma that respects human rights by pressing for the release of political prisoners and an end to conflicts with ethnic minorities. The Obama Administration's new approach towards Burma in 2009 aimed to promote democracy, human rights, and international security cooperation. It called for the release of political prisoners, an end to conflicts with ethnic minorities, and the initiation of a political dialogue with democratic opposition and ethnic minority leaders. Additionally, Burma was urged to sever ties with North Korea and abandon its alleged nuclear weapons program. Coordination with other nations on policies towards Burma was also emphasized. Following the announcement of a new U.S. policy towards Burma, the nation underwent a dramatic political transformation. The SPDC held parliamentary elections in November 2010, the first in 20 years, and released opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest. Despite the elections not meeting international standards, the SPDC respected the results and transferred power to a quasi-civilian government on March 30, 2011. Since March 30, 2011, Burma's quasi-civilian government, led by President Thein Sein, has implemented political and economic reforms, including the release of political prisoners and the repeal of oppressive laws. In response to encouraging signs in Burma, hundreds of political prisoners have been released, oppressive laws repealed, and parliamentary by-elections held in April 2012. Aung San Suu Kyi's party won a majority of seats, with the results accepted by the government. The Obama Administration has increased high-level meetings in response to these positive developments. The Obama Administration has responded positively to developments in Burma by increasing high-level meetings and easing sanctions. Key actions include appointing the first U.S. ambassador to Burma in 20 years, Hillary Clinton's visit as the first Secretary of State in over 50 years, and President Obama's visit as the first U.S. President while in office. Specific sanctions on Burma have been selectively eased. The Obama Administration has eased specific sanctions on Burma, including the ban on importing Burmese goods and new investments. Plans to increase U.S. assistance to Burma are underway, with the reopening of the USAID mission after 23 years. Despite changes in Burma, the political and economic situation is still serious and reforms are seen as fragile. The political and economic situation in Burma remains serious despite reforms under the quasi-civilian government. Ongoing fighting between the Burmese military and ethnic-based militias, particularly in Kachin State, has led to human rights violations. Ethnic tensions have been exposed by rioting in Rakhine State. Rioting in Rakhine State has revealed ethnic tensions in Burma. Despite some laws passed for civil liberties, oppressive laws remain. The NLD participated in the 2012 by-elections, but other parties face registration issues. Over 200 political prisoners are still held in Burma's prisons. Over 200 political prisoners are still held in Burma's prisons for political reasons. The 113th Congress may consider issues regarding Burma's political and economic development, including President Thein Sein's commitment to democracy and human rights, the ability to implement reforms, and collaboration with the Union Parliament and military for reform. US policy's close ties to Thein Sein's government, Aung San Suu Kyi, and the NLD are also questioned. The United States is questioning its close ties to President Thein Sein's government, Aung San Suu Kyi, and the NLD in promoting political and economic reform in Burma. The focus is on developing relations with Burma's ethnic minorities and their representative organizations, encouraging progress in negotiations, and the effectiveness of current sanctions enforcement. The United States is evaluating its relationship with Burma, focusing on promoting political and economic reform, supporting ethnic minorities, and enforcing sanctions. Key questions include the criteria for lifting sanctions, aid to Burma, alignment with the Asia-Pacific strategy, and Burma's role in regional geopolitics. The origins of the Obama Administration's Burma policy can be traced back to a 2007 article in Foreign Affairs by Michael Green and Derek Mitchell. The Obama Administration's Burma policy originated from a 2007 article in Foreign Affairs by Michael Green and Derek Mitchell, calling for political and economic reforms in Burma. The State Department adopted similar recommendations in 2009, including direct engagement with the military regime and sanctions continuation. The Obama Administration's approach towards Burma evolved over time, initially expressing skepticism towards the Union Government. Efforts were made to balance relations with the government and opposition parties, including Aung San Suu Kyi and ethnic groups. The Obama Administration initially had a skeptical approach towards the Burmese government but later became more optimistic, focusing on promoting progressive forces within President Thein Sein's government. This shift in policy led to closer ties between the two governments, possibly at the expense of relations with Burma's opposition parties and ethnic groups. The NLD agreed to participate in parliamentary by-elections in April 2012. U.S. policy shifted to promoting progressive forces within Thein Sein's government and isolating anti-reform individuals. U.S. officials now speak of a partnership with President Thein Sein's government, potentially straining relations with traditional opposition parties and ethnic organizations. The Obama Administration shifted its approach towards Burma from responding to positive developments with sanctions relief to promoting further reforms. This new strategy aims to create an environment conducive to more reforms, aligning closely with President Thein Sein's government and potentially straining relations with opposition parties and ethnic organizations. The Obama Administration's shift in Burma policy focuses on creating an environment for more reforms, aligning with President Thein Sein's government. There is debate among experts on whether the administration is moving too fast or too slow in rewarding progress towards U.S. goals in Burma. Some worry that remaining sanctions are hindering progress. The Obama Administration's new Burma policy aims to encourage reforms and align with President Thein Sein's government. Some experts believe the administration is moving too cautiously, while others worry that sanctions are impeding progress.

Despite high-level meetings, existing U.S. sanctions on Burma remained in place. The Obama Administration maintained existing U.S. sanctions on Burma during the ASEAN-U.S. leaders meeting in Singapore, stating they would only be lifted upon concrete progress towards reform. Additional sanctions could be imposed if necessary, but sanctions may be relaxed if Burma meets specified criteria in U.S. law. The decision was influenced by the tense political situation in Burma in 2010. The Obama Administration maintained U.S. sanctions on Burma, which could be lifted if Burma meets specified criteria in U.S. law. The tense political situation in Burma in 2010 influenced this decision, with the NLD and other pro-democracy parties boycotting the November elections due to unfair election laws. The SPDC transformed the USDA into a political organization. The SPDC transformed the Union Solidarity and Development Association (USDA) into a political party, the Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP), with Thein Sein as its leader. Ethnic militias were to be turned into Border Guard Forces (BGF) under Burmese military command or risk ceasefire agreements being revoked. Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army in Kokang region refused to join in August 2009. In August 2009, the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army in the Kokang region refused to join the Border Guard Forces, leading to a military offensive and over 30,000 refugees fleeing to China. Fighting broke out between the Burmese military and the Shan State Army-North in November 2010, sparking conflicts with other ethnic militias in eastern Burma. This may have influenced the cautious response of the Obama Administration to Burma's political transition. The Obama Administration's cautious response to Burma's political transition may have been influenced by reports of Burma's alleged nuclear weapons program and arms trade with North Korea. In 2009, U.S. naval vessels monitored a cargo ship carrying arms from North Korea to Burma in violation of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1874. The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) warned in 2010 that Burma was exploring nuclear weapons development. Al Jazeera aired a report in 2010 on \"Burma's Nuclear Ambitions.\" In June 2010, Al Jazeera reported that Burma was exploring nuclear weapons development with support from North Korea, raising concerns for the Obama Administration. Following the SPDC's transition to a quasi-civilian government, President Obama cautiously encouraged and criticized the regime for the flawed parliamentary elections in November 2010, stating they were neither free nor fair and failed to meet international standards. Obama highlighted the regime's continued repression, including the detention of over 2,100 political prisoners, including Aung San Suu Kyi. The regime in Burma continued to detain over 2,100 political prisoners, including Aung San Suu Kyi, silencing the National League for Democracy and manipulating the electoral process to hinder pro-democracy candidates.

The transfer of power to the Union Government in Burma in 2011 marked a step towards building a modern, developed, and democratic nation. However, President Thein Sein's statements on a \"disciplined democracy\" lack clarity on key elements of a future democratic Burma, such as civilian control over the military, special powers of the Tatmadaw, federal vs. central government structure, and ministerial appointments. The future democratic Burma raises questions about the balance of power between the branches of government, the role of the President and appointed Ministers, the selection process for the President and Vice Presidents, citizenship conditions, and civil liberties restrictions.

Talks between the Union Government and various ethnic organizations, including the UNFC, have led to preliminary ceasefire agreements with 13 out of 21 groups, excluding the KIO/KIA. Informal discussions in Ruili, China, in February 2013, resulted in an agreement for future talks, but none have completed the second step of the Union Government's peace process. Unresolved issues remain regarding the powers of the central government versus ethnic States for national reconciliation in Burma. The efforts for national reconciliation in Burma involve reaching a consensus on the powers of the central government versus ethnic States.

The parliamentary elections in November 2010 under the Constitution are also considered neither free nor fair. The 2008 Constitution in Burma is widely seen as fraudulent, with the parliamentary elections held in November 2010 also considered neither free nor fair. The Union Government and the Burmese military view the constitution as legitimate, but President Thein Sein is open to limited amendments, including potentially reducing the privileged status of the Tatmadaw in the Union Parliament. The Tatmadaw holds a privileged status under the constitution, with limited openness to changes that do not fundamentally alter their special status. Opposition parties, led by Aung San Suu Kyi, seek amendments to the 2008 Constitution, including provisions that bar her from serving as President. Opposition parties, led by Aung San Suu Kyi, seek amendments to the 2008 Constitution to allow her to serve as President. While the NLD and other opposition members are willing to follow the amendment process, many ethnic organizations do not accept the constitution and prefer direct negotiations with the Union Government and Tatmadaw for a new constitution. They may, however, consider following the constitution's amendment process as part of a negotiated agreement. The Union Government may want to follow the constitution's process to adopt amendments as part of a negotiated agreement. The requirements to amend the constitution may be too arduous. A bill must be submitted to the Union Parliament, supported by at least 20% of members, and receive at least 75% support to be adopted.

Key issues include the legitimacy of the government, the Burmese military's stance on political reform, and the reestablishment of military-to-military relations. Congress is also concerned about the Administration's intentions regarding the Special Representative and Policy Coordinator for Burma, as well as the accuracy and timeliness of reports submitted to Congress. The JADE Act requires the President to appoint a Special Representative and Policy Coordinator for Burma with the rank of ambassador, who cannot hold another position within the executive branch. Ambassador Derek J. Mitchell was confirmed by the Senate for this role. The Federal Vacancies Act of 1998 allows for temporary appointments for positions requiring Senate confirmation for up to 210 days. The Federal Vacancies Act of 1998 allows temporary appointments for positions requiring Senate confirmation for up to 210 days, with exceptions for pending nominations. The State Department's webpage shows that Murphy's temporary appointment as Special Representative and Policy Coordinator for Burma has exceeded the 210-day limit.

Burmese government officials have visited the U.S. in recent years, raising concerns about enforcement. The Treasury Department has delegated the responsibility of maintaining the list of Burmese persons subject to financial sanctions to its Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), which posts the designated individuals. The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) maintains the list of Burmese persons subject to financial sanctions, listed in the Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list. However, critics argue that the current SDN list lacks inclusion of many Burmese nationals and companies meeting sanction criteria. Delivery and quality of mandated reports have also faced criticism. The delivery and quality of congressionally mandated reports to Congress from the executive branch, as required by Burmese sanction laws, have faced criticism for not meeting stipulated deadlines. Some reports, such as those on global military assistance to Burma and foreign assets held by senior Burmese officials, have not been provided in full. The existing sanctions on Burma remain in effect until certain conditions are met or Congress acts to remove them. President Obama has waived some sanctions on Burma, but the authority to impose them remains. Congress must renew the general import ban annually. Obama has used existing authority to waive or ease some sanctions on Burma, but the underlying authority to impose sanctions remains.

President Obama and Secretary of State Clinton made commitments to provide assistance in various areas to the Union Government. The Obama Administration plans to provide assistance in Burma, including aid for landmine victims, English language training, academic exchange programs, and programs for democracy and governance. Additional federal funding will be needed for these activities, which may be affected by budget constraints like sequestration. The Budget Control Act of 2011 requires a 5% reduction in funding for FY2013. Sequestration allows for reprogramming of funds by the Department of State and USAID. Uncertainty over country allocations makes it difficult to calculate the impact of sequestration. The Budget Control Act of 2011 mandates a 5% reduction in funding for FY2013, leading to uncertainty in calculating post-sequestration funding levels for Burma. A rough estimate suggests reducing FY2012 estimates by 5%. The Department of State will determine country and program allocations post-legislation to calculate sequestration at the country level.
