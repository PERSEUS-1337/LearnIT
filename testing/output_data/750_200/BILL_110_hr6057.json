Congress finds that Americans cherish healthy oceans and wildlife, feel a strong moral responsibility to protect marine ecosystems, including the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas in Alaska, which provide habitat for a variety of wildlife. The Arctic ecosystem supports polar bears, eiders, walrus, seals, and fish, crucial for Alaska Native cultures. Scientists agree climate change is impacting sea ice habitat for these species. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service proposed listing the polar bear as a threatened species due to the projected loss of sea ice from global warming. The Department of the Interior missed the deadline to decide on providing protections under the Endangered Species Act. The Department of the Interior missed the legal deadline to decide on providing Endangered Species Act protections to the polar bear. On February 6, 2008, they moved forward with oil and gas leasing in the Chukchi Sea Lease Sale 193 area, which is polar bear habitat. A court ruling on April 19, 2008, mandated a decision on listing the polar bear under the Endangered Species Act by May 15, 2008. The Department of the Interior missed the deadline to decide on listing the polar bear under the Endangered Species Act. A court ruling mandated a decision by May 15, 2008. Reports projected a significant decline in the polar bear population by the middle of the 21st century due to changes in sea ice conditions. The observed decline in Arctic sea ice may be underestimated by current models, impacting the future status of polar bears. Global warming is a major threat, exacerbated by potential oil and gas development in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas. Spilled oil recovery in this harsh environment is currently ineffective, especially during icy conditions. The Minerals Management Service plans to offer millions of acres in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas for oil leasing, which overlaps with crucial polar bear habitat. The environmental impact statement for Lease Sale 193 in the Chukchi Sea highlights concerns about the effects of potential oil spills in icy conditions. The Minerals Management Service warns that a large oil spill in the Arctic Ocean, particularly during the broken-ice period, could pose significant risks to the polar bear population and other marine mammals like whales and walruses due to a lack of information on marine mammal ecology and habitat use. Onshore industrial development activities to support offshore oil and gas development are also highlighted as concerning. The threat of offshore oil and gas development to marine mammals and polar bears is a concern for tribal governments and conservation groups due to potential habitat damage and disturbance. Tribal governments and conservation groups oppose offshore oil and gas development in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas. Prohibition on leasing in Beaufort and Chukchi Sea planning areas. Section 8 of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act prohibits leasing in the Beaufort and Chukchi Sea planning areas until missing information is identified by the National Research Council. The National Research Council is tasked with identifying missing information on the composition, distribution, status, and ecology of living marine resources in the Beaufort and Chukchi Sea ecosystems, focusing on climate change impacts and supporting baseline information establishment. The National Research Council is responsible for determining the potential impacts of oil and gas activities on plant and animal species, marine environments, and Alaskan Native communities, as well as assessing the adequacy of environmental studies. The National Research Council evaluates environmental, public health, and cultural studies related to oil and gas activities in Alaska, including missing information and adequacy of ongoing studies, for a report to Congress. The National Research Council evaluates studies related to oil and gas activities in Alaska, including missing information and recommendations for additional research on endangered polar bears. The Secretary evaluates oil spill response gaps for arctic oil operations through a public process involving consultation with local governments. The Secretary sets a standard for oil spill recovery, requiring at least 85% of spilled oil to be mechanically removed within 30 days in any ice condition or season, after consulting with stakeholders. The standard for oil spill recovery set by the Secretary requires 85% of spilled oil to be mechanically removed within 30 days in any ice condition or season, with additional requirements for achieving this standard before issuing leases or approving exploration and production plans. The Secretary's standard for oil spill recovery mandates 85% oil recovery in any ice condition or season, with procedures to close areas to oil and gas activity if a response gap exists, and requirements for oil spill prevention systems. The Secretary mandates oil spill recovery standards, including operating restrictions and spill prevention systems to minimize risks in oil and gas exploration activities in the Beaufort and Chukchi Sea Planning Areas. The Secretary establishes oil spill recovery standards for Beaufort and Chukchi Sea Planning Areas to minimize risks in oil and gas exploration activities. This includes identifying mitigation measures to avoid adverse impacts on wildlife and subsistence, and addressing response gaps in achieving recovery standards. The term 'response gap analysis' refers to calculating response operating limits of spill response systems based on environmental factors and assessing conditions that could limit a response in a specific location. The response gap analysis involves assessing local response capabilities, oil spill contingency plans, and the cumulative interplay of factors that could exceed system limits when combined. The response gap analysis includes assessing factors that may prevent achieving the oil spill recovery standard, using environmental and climate data for a specific location or area. The response gap analysis involves quantifying the percentage of time local conditions exceed spill response system limits to achieve the oil spill recovery standard."
