    "content": "Recent advances in artificial intelligence focus on identifying analogies across domains without supervision. The paper introduces AN-GAN, a matching-by-synthesis approach, to find exact analogies between datasets by translating images across domains. It outperforms current techniques by breaking the cross-domain mapping task into domain alignment and learning the mapping function. AN-GAN is introduced as a matching-by-synthesis approach to find analogies between datasets by translating images across domains. The cross-domain mapping task is divided into domain alignment and learning the mapping function, which can be iteratively solved to achieve quality comparable to full supervision. Humans' ability to make analogies between multiple domains without prior supervision is crucial for using previous knowledge to obtain strong priors on new situations, making it an important problem for Artificial Intelligence. Recently, several approaches have been proposed for unsupervised mapping between domains, where no explicit example analogies are given in advance. These approaches take sets of images from two different domains without explicit correspondences between them. Unsupervised mapping between domains involves learning a mapping function that transforms images from one domain to another without explicit correspondences. This is achieved by ensuring that the distributions of mapped images and target domain images are indistinguishable, and by enforcing a cycle constraint where an image mapped back and forth remains unchanged. In this paper, the task of analogy identification involves finding pairs of examples in two domains related by a non-linear transformation. While constraints on image mappings have been effective, the lack of exemplar-based constraints may result in translated images lacking visual fidelity for exact matching. In this work, the problem of analogy identification is addressed by adding exemplar-based constraints to improve visual fidelity and performance. The method is effective even when only some sample images have exact analogies, and it can find correspondences between sets without exact correspondences available. The method described in the curr_chunk improves visual fidelity and performance by finding correspondences between sets even when exact analogies are not available. It involves a two-step approach for training a domain mapping function, which yields better results than previous unsupervised mapping approaches. The curr_chunk discusses mapping approaches for identifying analogies between datasets without supervision, related to image matching methods and unsupervised style-transfer. It mentions using a translation function T AB between domains and larger architectures for the supervised network. The curr_chunk provides an overview of related works in image matching, focusing on unsupervised visual feature matching. It mentions the use of deep neural networks for supervised matching and the relevance of generic visual features in unsupervised scenarios. The experiments show that standard visual features may not be effective due to the significant differences between domains. In experiments, standard visual features like VGG-16 BID15 are ineffective for analogies between different domains. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have revolutionized image synthesis, especially in image to image translation tasks. Most image translation works utilize GANs to generate realistic images. Most image to image translation work utilizes GANs to create realistic images by training a generator network G to synthesize samples from a target distribution. The generative architecture used is based on BID12, and unsupervised mapping for image translation has been recently implemented without supervision apart from sample images from the two domains. Unsupervised mapping for image translation does not require supervision apart from sample images from the two domains. This method has been recently implemented for image to image translation and slightly earlier for translating between natural languages. On the other hand, supervised mapping involves training directly with matching pairs of input and output images. An example of this method uses GANs, where the discriminator receives a pair of images for training. In unsupervised mapping for image translation, the U-net architecture is used to strengthen the link between source and target images. Successful completion of the algorithm generates correspondences between domains, allowing for the use of supervised mapping methods on the inferred matches. BID2 showed improved mapping results in supervised settings by employing perceptual loss without GANs. In unsupervised mapping for image translation, the U-net architecture is utilized to establish connections between source and target images. BID2 has shown enhanced mapping results in supervised settings by using perceptual loss without GANs. The method for analogy identification involves finding matching indexes between two sets of images in different domains A and B. The goal is to match every image from domain A with a corresponding image in domain B through an iterative approach. An iterative approach is used to match images from domain A to domain B using a GAN-based distribution approach. A mapping function T AB is trained to make images from domain A appear as if they belong to domain B. The distributional alignment is enforced by training a discriminator D to discriminate between the two domains. The distribution of T AB (x) is optimized to match that of y by training a discriminator D. The loss function for training T and D is binary cross-entropy. The networks L D and L T are trained iteratively. The two-sided cycle loss function, incorporating circularity and distance invariance constraints, is used to train one-sided GANs in both A \u2192 B and B \u2192 A directions. This approach ensures that an image translated from domain A to B and back recovers the original image. The two-sided cycle loss function ensures that images translated between domains A and B recover the original image. It provides exact matches between domains, unlike the distributional approach described in the previous section. The method provides exact matches between domains A and B by finding a set of indices for matching images. A fully supervised mapping function is trained to obtain high-quality mappings. The proposed match matrix assigns weights to match images between domains, aiming for a binary matrix with perfect matches. The method aims to find exact matches between domains A and B by assigning weights to match images using a fully supervised mapping function. The optimization involves continuous optimization over T AB and binary programming over \u03b1 i,j, with an entropy constraint to encourage sparse solutions. The relaxed formulation of the optimization objective enforces sparsity by adding an entropy constraint. The positivity and binary constraints on \u03b1 are enforced using an auxiliary variable \u03b2 and a Softmax function. The optimization can be done using SGD, and increasing the significance of the entropy term helps recover exact correspondences. The training scheme involves iteratively updating T AB and \u03b2 for N epochs each, achieving good results with full mapping performed only once at the beginning of the \u03b1 iteration. The optimization problem for achieving good matching with the exemplar-based method is challenging. AN-GAN is a cross domain matching method that combines exemplar and distribution based constraints. The AN-GAN loss function includes distributional loss, cycle loss, and exemplar loss to ensure good performance in matching images between domains. A good initialization of T AB is crucial for success. The AN-GAN optimization problem involves cycle loss, exemplar loss, and adversarial training of discriminators D A and D B. Initial \u03b2 values are set to 0 for equal likelihood matches. A burn-in period of 200 epochs with \u03b4 = 0 aligns distributions before individual images. Optimization includes one \u03b1-iteration of 22 epochs, one T-iteration of 10 epochs, and another \u03b1-iteration. The distribution is aligned before aligning individual images using T AB and T BA. The exemplar-loss is optimized for one \u03b1-iteration of 22 epochs, one T-iteration of 10 epochs, and another \u03b1-iteration of 10 epochs. The initial learning rate for the exemplar loss is 1e \u2212 3 and is decayed after 20 epochs by a factor of 2. The \u03b2 parameters are shared between the two mapping directions to inform each other of likelihood of matches. All hyper-parameters are fixed across all experiments. In experiments, different loss functions were tested for similarity determination between actual and synthesized examples. Euclidean or L1 loss functions were not perceptual enough, but using Laplacian pyramid loss showed some improvement. The best performance was achieved with a perceptual loss function, consistent with prior works. The loss function used in the study extracts VGG features for a pair of images, with the number of feature maps depending on image resolution. The second convolutional layer in each block is utilized, with 4 layers for 64X64 resolution images and five layers for 256X256 resolution images. Additionally, L1 loss on pixels is used to consider colors, and a perceptual loss function is defined using feature maps for the images. The study utilizes a perceptual loss function with VGG features for image pairs, considering feature maps based on image resolution. Evaluation is done through matching experiments on public datasets, comparing against existing methods. The approach is deemed unsupervised matching as features are not tailored to specific domains. The study compares different methods for cross-domain image matching, including exact matches and methods using L1 loss on raw pixels or VGG feature loss. The evaluation is done on public datasets, and the approach is considered unsupervised matching. The study evaluates various methods for cross-domain image matching, including L1 loss on raw pixels and VGG feature loss. Different approaches like CycleGAN and AN-GAN are trained with different iterations to compare performance. The evaluation is conducted on public datasets in an unsupervised matching setting. The study evaluates methods for cross-domain image matching using different approaches like CycleGAN and AN-GAN with varying iterations. Evaluation is done on public datasets including Facades, Maps, Zappos50K, and Amazon handbags. The study evaluates methods for cross-domain image matching using different approaches like CycleGAN and AN-GAN with varying iterations on public datasets including Facades, Maps, Zappos50K, and Amazon handbags. Edge images were automatically detected using HED for Zappos50K dataset and Amazon handbags dataset. The datasets were down-sampled to 2k images each for memory complexity. The method was compared with five others for exact correspondence identification. Images A and B were shuffled prior to training to recover the full match function. The study evaluates methods for cross-domain image matching using different approaches like CycleGAN and AN-GAN on public datasets. The objective is to recover the full match function for exact correspondence identification between images A and B. Results show that matching using pixels or deep features cannot solve the task due to the differences in the domains. In experiments on cross-domain image matching, CycleGAN and pixel-loss matching improve performance, but there is room for enhancement. Using VGG features as perceptual features also enhances matching, as exhaustive search was deemed too computationally expensive for the datasets. Using VGG features as perceptual features improved matching performance compared to pixel matching. To address computational limitations, subsampling of features was necessary. The method involved running \u03b1 iterations on mapped images from the source and target domains, matching linear combinations of images rather than individual ones. This approach, less sensitive to outliers, utilized the same \u03b2 parameters for both sides of the match, resulting in significant performance enhancements. The method presented significant improvements by using the same \u03b2 parameters for both sides of the match (A \u2192 B and B \u2192 A). The exemplar loss, aided by distributional auxiliary losses, was able to converge through \u03b1 \u2212 T iterations, showing the essential role of auxiliary losses in successful analogy finding. The full-method AN-GAN utilizes the full exemplar-based loss for optimization. The distribution and cycle auxiliary losses are crucial for successful analogy finding. The full-method AN-GAN optimizes the mapping function to match each source sample with the nearest target sample, resulting in significantly better performance across all datasets and matching directions. In experiments with a percentage of matches unavailable, images were randomly removed from the A and B domain datasets, leading to unmatched samples in both domains. The task involves identifying correct matches between samples in different domains, with a focus on finding exact matches. The evaluation metric is the percentage of images with exact matches out of the total number of images. The method shows success in dealing with partial exact matching, as shown in Table 2. The method successfully handles partial exact matching, with results comparable to clean cases even when 25% of samples do not have matches. AN-GAN achieves a 90% match rate with up to 75% of samples not having matches, particularly notable in the Facades dataset. In this experiment, the method is evaluated on finding similar matches when exact analogies are not available. The DiscoGAN architecture from BID9 is used for mapping in the Shoes2Handbags scenario. The DiscoGAN architecture BID9 is used for mapping in the Shoes2Handbags scenario. In FIG2, examples show that DiscoGAN mapping quality varies, with AN \u2212 GAN providing better analogies. The method aligns datasets accurately. The method proposed aligns datasets accurately by using AN \u2212 GAN to find analogies and training a mapping function. It achieved 97% alignment accuracy on the Facades dataset and used Pix2Pix for self-supervised mapping. Evaluation was done on facade photos for segmentation tasks. The method aligns datasets accurately using AN-GAN to find analogies and a fully self-supervised Pix2Pix mapping function. Evaluation on facade photos shows superior quality compared to CycleGAN and a fully-supervised Pix2Pix approach. Our self-supervised method outperforms CycleGAN and performs similarly to fully supervised methods in terms of image quality. The use of L1 loss in the supervised stage proves to be effective for tasks like edges2shoes and edges2handbags datasets. The use of an appropriate loss and larger architecture enabled by ANGAN-supervision improves performance over CycleGAN and is competitive with full-supervision. The method was also evaluated on point cloud matching, testing in low dimensional settings with close but not exact correspondences between samples in the two domains. Cloud matching involves finding the 3D transformation between points from reference and target objects. Experiments were conducted using the Bunny benchmark with random 3D rotations to test alignment success rates. Both CycleGAN and the proposed method utilized a specific architecture for the task. The proposed method for cloud matching involves a specific architecture with 2048 hidden units, BatchNorm, and Leaky ReLU activations. The mapping function is a 3X3 linear affine matrix with a bias term, constrained to be a rotation matrix. A loss term encourages orthonormality of the weights. Results show significant improvement over baseline at large angles in achieving alignment accuracy. Our method significantly outperforms the baseline results reported in BID17 for large angles, with an alignment accuracy of 0.05. The algorithm presented allows for cross-domain matching in an unsupervised manner, proving effective for low dimensional transformations and settings without exact matches. Previous work focused on mapping between images across domains often resulted in inaccurate matches. In this work, the exemplar constraint was introduced to improve match performance in unsupervised domain mapping. The method significantly outperformed baseline methods on various datasets for full and partial exact matching, even in cases where exact matches were not available. The approach presented offers an alternative view of domain translation by aligning domains and training a fully supervised mapping function between them. The exemplar constraint was introduced to enhance match performance in unsupervised domain mapping, outperforming baseline methods on various datasets. The approach aligns domains and trains a fully supervised mapping function between them, offering a different view of domain translation. Future work is needed to explore matching between different modalities such as images, speech, and text, as current distribution matching algorithms are insufficient for this challenging scenario. New algorithms would need to be developed to achieve this goal."
