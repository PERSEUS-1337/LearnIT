    "content": "Unsupervised learning of timeseries data is a challenging problem in machine learning. The proposed algorithm, Deep Temporal Clustering (DTC), integrates dimensionality reduction and temporal clustering in an unsupervised learning framework. It uses an autoencoder for dimensionality reduction and a novel temporal clustering layer for cluster assignment. The algorithm optimizes both clustering and dimensionality reduction objectives. Different temporal similarity metrics can be used in the clustering layer. The Deep Temporal Clustering (DTC) algorithm integrates dimensionality reduction and temporal clustering using various similarity metrics. A visualization method generates heat maps to show learned features in timeseries data from different domains, demonstrating superior performance over traditional methods. Deep learning is commonly used for supervised learning with labeled data, but unsupervised learning techniques are necessary when data labels are unavailable or unreliable. Current progress in learning complex structures from unlabeled data is limited, with more focus on labeled datasets. Unsupervised techniques like clustering are used to group similar objects together. The focus is on unsupervised learning of complex structures from unlabeled data, particularly in time series data. Clustering techniques are commonly used to group similar objects together, but their application to time series data remains a challenge. This gap in technology affects various fields such as financial trading, medical monitoring, and event detection. The problem of unsupervised time series clustering is challenging due to variations in properties and features across different domains. Real-world time series data often contain temporal gaps and high frequency noise. To address these issues, a novel algorithm called deep temporal clustering (DTC) is introduced. The novel algorithm, deep temporal clustering (DTC), addresses limitations of standard clustering techniques on time series data by transforming the data into a low dimensional latent space using a deep autoencoder network integrated with a temporal clustering layer. The DTC algorithm aims to uncover informative features on all time scales and disentangle data manifolds. The deep temporal clustering (DTC) algorithm aims to uncover latent dimensions in time series data by using a three-level approach. The first level, a CNN, captures short-time-scale waveforms, the second level, a BI-LSTM, learns temporal connections across all time scales, and the third level performs non-parametric clustering to find spatio-temporal dimensions. The DTC algorithm utilizes a three-level approach to uncover latent dimensions in time series data, including capturing waveforms at different time scales with a CNN, learning temporal connections with a BI-LSTM, and performing non-parametric clustering to find spatio-temporal dimensions. This approach achieves high performance on various datasets without needing parameter adjustments and includes a unique visualization feature for cluster-assignment activations across time. The DTC algorithm introduces a novel visualization feature for cluster-assignment activations across time, providing explanations for class assignment in unlabeled time series data. It is the first work to apply deep learning in temporal clustering, with the main contribution being an end-to-end algorithm that formulates objectives for meaningful temporal clustering. The DTC algorithm introduces an end-to-end approach for temporal clustering with a focus on effective latent representation and integrated similarity metrics. It outperforms existing methods like k-Shape BID15 and hierarchical clustering on real-world time series datasets. The current state-of-the-art in temporal clustering methods focuses on dimensionality reduction and similarity metric selection. Some solutions use application-dependent dimensionality reduction techniques to filter out noise, such as adaptive piecewise constant approximation and nonnegative matrix factorization. However, a drawback is that dimensionality reduction is often independent of the clustering criterion, potentially leading to the loss of long-range temporal information. One drawback of dimensionality reduction methods like factorization BID4 is the potential loss of long-range temporal correlations and relevant features. Another approach involves creating a similarity measure between time series based on features like complexity, correlation, and time warping (BID2, BID7, BID8) for traditional clustering. The study focused on similarity measures for time series data, incorporating features like complexity and correlation into clustering algorithms. The choice of similarity measure was found to significantly impact clustering results. However, without proper dimensionality reduction, optimal clustering results may not be achieved due to the high-dimensional nature of time series data. Recent research has shown that transforming time series data into a low dimensional latent space is effective for temporal clustering. However, there is a lack of a general methodology for selecting the optimal latent space. It is crucial to ensure that the similarity metric used is compatible with the temporal feature space for meaningful clustering results. Previous studies have demonstrated superior performance in clustering static data by jointly optimizing a stacked autoencoder for dimensionality reduction and a k-means objective for clustering. The proposed DTC method aims to perform unsupervised clustering of time series data by encoding it into a latent space using a convolutional autoencoder and a BI-LSTM. This approach is different from previous methods that focused on clustering static data. The DTC method encodes input signals into a latent space using a convolutional autoencoder and a BI-LSTM, forming a temporal autoencoder (TAE). The BI-LSTM's latent representation is then used in a temporal clustering layer to generate cluster assignments. Effective latent representation is crucial for temporal clustering, achieved through the TAE architecture with a 1D convolution layer extracting short-term features. The temporal autoencoder (TAE) utilizes a 1D convolution layer followed by max pooling and L-ReLUs to extract short-term features and reduce dimensionality. The BI-LSTM then captures temporal changes in both directions to obtain a latent representation, crucial for further processing and avoiding long sequences for improved performance. The BI-LSTM is used to obtain a latent representation by learning temporal changes in both directions. The clustering layer assigns the BI-LSTM latent representation to clusters, driven by minimization of cost functions including mean square error for input sequence reconstruction. The BI-LSTM latent representation is used for input sequence reconstruction with mean square error, while the clustering layer assigns the representation to clusters using a clustering metric like KL divergence. This optimization modifies weights in the BI-LSTM and CNN to separate sequences into distinct spatio-temporal clusters. The clustering metric optimization in the network modifies weights in the BI-LSTM and CNN to separate input sequences into distinct spatio-temporal clusters efficiently. This process disentangles the complicated high-dimensional manifolds of input dynamics, unlike traditional approaches. The network optimizes weights in the BI-LSTM and CNN to efficiently separate input sequences into distinct spatio-temporal clusters, disentangling high-dimensional manifolds of input dynamics. This contrasts traditional approaches that only optimize reconstruction or separation, resulting in improved unsupervised categorization with end-to-end optimization. The approach shows significant improvement in unsupervised categorization through end-to-end optimization, utilizing the temporal continuity of spatio-temporal data to extract informative features in the latent representation of the BI-LSTM. The temporal clustering layer includes k centroids to enhance performance. The temporal clustering layer in the BI-LSTM model utilizes k centroids to cluster latent signals z i obtained from input data x. Hierarchical clustering with complete linkage is performed in feature space Z to initialize the centroids. Unsupervised training is then used to refine the centroids estimates. The temporal clustering layer in the BI-LSTM model utilizes k centroids to cluster latent signals z i from input data x. Initial centroids estimates are obtained through hierarchical clustering in feature space Z. Unsupervised training refines the centroids using a two-step algorithm involving probability assignment and centroid updates. The temporal clustering layer in the BI-LSTM model uses centroids to cluster latent signals from input data. Centroids are initially estimated through hierarchical clustering in feature space Z, and then refined through unsupervised training with a two-step algorithm involving probability assignment and centroid updates. Confidence assignments are computed using a target distribution p, and distances from centroids are normalized into probability assignments using a Student's t distribution kernel. The latent space Z from temporal autoencoder encodes input signal x i \u2208 X. Parameter \u03b1 represents degrees of freedom in Students t distribution. siml() is a temporal similarity metric to compute distance between encoded signal z i and centroid w j. Experimenting with various similarity metrics like Complexity Invariant Similarity (CID). In this study, various similarity metrics are experimented with, including Complexity Invariant Similarity (CID) which computes similarity based on the euclidean distance corrected by complexity estimation of two series x, y. The distance is calculated using a complexity factor defined as min(CE(x), CE(y)), where CE(x) and CE(y) are complexity estimates of time series x and y. The core idea of CID is that as complexity differences between series increase, the distance also increases. The Complexity Invariant Similarity (CID) measures the distance between time series x and y based on their complexity differences. If both sequences have the same complexity, the distance is simply the euclidean distance. Additionally, the study also explores Correlation based Similarity (COR) using pearson's correlation and Auto Correlation based Similarity (ACF). To compute the Complexity Invariant Similarity (CID), the distance between time series x and y is measured based on their complexity differences. The Auto Correlation based Similarity (ACF) in BID7 calculates similarity using autocorrelation coefficients and weighted euclidean distance between latent representation z i and centroids w j. The objective in training the temporal clustering layer is to minimize KL divergence loss between q ij and target distribution p ij to strengthen high confidence predictions. The objective is to minimize the KL divergence loss between q ij and a target distribution p ij to strengthen high confidence predictions and normalize losses. This is achieved by using DISPLAYFORM0 where f j = n i=1 q ij. The KL divergence loss is computed using the target distribution, with n and k representing the number of samples and clusters. Joint optimization of clustering and autoencoder is performed by minimizing KL divergence loss and mean squared error loss batch-wise. The optimization problem involves joint optimization of clustering and autoencoder by minimizing KL divergence and mean squared error loss. Effective initialization of cluster centroids is crucial, with centroids reflecting the data's latent representation. Pretraining the autoencoder parameters ensures a meaningful latent representation, followed by initializing cluster centers through hierarchical clustering. Autoencoder weights and cluster centers are then updated iteratively. The cluster centers are initialized through hierarchical clustering with complete linkage on embedded features of all datapoints. Autoencoder weights and cluster centers are updated using gradients and backpropagation mini-batch SGD. Target distribution is also updated during every SGD iteration. This approach helps prevent problematic solutions and ensures convergence towards a suitable representation to minimize clustering loss. The latent representation converges to minimize clustering and MSE loss, identifying main data features. A heatmap-generating network is used to localize tumors in medical images based on cluster labels from a DTC network. A new supervised hierarchical convolutional network is trained to classify inputs x, generating heatmaps to show relevant parts of the inputs for clustering. Heatmaps correctly mark the time location of events. The DTC algorithm performance is evaluated on real-world datasets from the UCR Time series Classification Archive. Heatmaps generated by a supervised hierarchical convolutional network correctly mark event locations. The study combines training and test datasets from the UCR Time series Classification Archive and includes spacecraft magnetometer data from the NASA MMS Mission for automated detection of flux transfer events (FTEs) characterized by bipolar signatures in the magnetic field. The study involves comparing a DTC algorithm with hierarchical clustering and k-Shape, a state-of-the-art temporal clustering algorithm, using four similarity metrics on 104 time series data with 1440 time steps each. In the study, four similarity metrics were used for experiments: Complexity Invariant Distance (CID), Correlation based Similarity (COR), Auto Correlation based Similarity (ACF), and Euclidean Based Similarity (EUCL). Expert labels were available for the datasets, but the training pipeline was unsupervised. Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) and area under the curve (AUC) were used as evaluation metrics, with ROC curves averaged over 5 trials using bootstrap sampling. Parameter optimization through cross-validation was not feasible in unsupervised clustering. The autoencoder network used in the study had 50 filters in the convolution layer with a kernel size of 10. Two Bi-LSTM's had filters of 50 and 1 respectively. The pooling size was chosen to keep the latent representation size under 100 for faster experimentation. The deconvolutional layer had a kernel size of 10, and all weights were initialized to a zero-mean Gaussian distribution with a standard deviation of 0.01. The network was pre-trained using the Adam optimizer. The deconvolutional layer has a kernel size of 10 and weights are initialized to a zero-mean Gaussian distribution with a standard deviation of 0.01. The autoencoder network is pre-trained using the Adam optimizer over 10 epochs. Temporal clustering layer centroids are initialized using hierarchical clustering with complete linkage. The deep architecture is jointly trained for clustering and autoencoder loss until a convergence criterion of 0.1% change in cluster assignment is met. Mini-batch size is set to 64 for both pretraining and end-to-end fine-tuning, with a starting learning rate of 0.1, held constant across all datasets. The baseline algorithms used in the experiments are parameter free. Results of DTC for three distinct time series from the MMS dataset are shown in FIG1. The activation map profiles correlate well with the location of the bipolar signatures of the events, with events highlighted by dashed ovals for readers' convenience. The heatmap correctly identifies both events in the second time series. The paper highlights the superior performance of joint training of reconstruction loss and clustering loss compared to disjoint training. The algorithm correctly identifies events in the second time series, while a non-event is correctly identified as such. Direct comparison between joint end-to-end training of the DTC vs disjoint DTC training on the MMS dataset shows an average AUC of 0.93 for joint training and 0.88 for disjointed training. Results from DTC and baseline clustering techniques on 13 datasets demonstrate improved performance by our algorithm across all metrics. Our algorithm outperformed baseline techniques across all datasets and metrics. DTC showed superior performance compared to k-Shape, as illustrated in the ROC comparisons. The results demonstrate the robustness of DTC in unsupervised learning of temporal patterns across datasets with varying characteristics. In this work, the focus was on unsupervised learning of patterns in temporal sequences, event detection, and clustering with different dataset sizes, lengths, and data imbalances. The results showed high agreement between unsupervised clustering and human-labeled categories, indicating effective dimensionality reduction. This approach holds promise for analyzing time-continuous and unlabeled natural stimuli.
