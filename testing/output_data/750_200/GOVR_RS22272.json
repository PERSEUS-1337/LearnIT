    "content": "The Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA), amended by the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA), regulates \"federal election activity,\" including voter registration drives, voter identification, get-out-the-vote drives, and public communications that refer to a federal candidate. The Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) regulates \"federal election activity,\" including public communications that refer to a federal candidate. \"Public communications\" are defined as various forms of political advertising to the general public. Candidate and party committees can only use regulated federal funds for such activities. Regulated federal funds are subject to FECA's contribution limitations. The BCRA amendments to FECA in 2002 led to a lawsuit against the FEC by Representatives Shays and Meehan, challenging regulations that exempted Internet communications from federal campaign finance regulation. In 2004, Representatives Shays and Meehan sued the FEC in U.S. district court to invalidate regulations that excluded Internet activities from campaign finance laws. The court agreed with the BCRA sponsors and overturned the FEC's regulations on political communications online. The Shays court overturned FEC regulations excluding Internet activities from campaign finance laws, stating that some Internet communications qualify as \"general public political advertising.\" The court left it to the FEC to determine specific criteria for such communications. The Shays court overturned FEC regulations excluding Internet activities from campaign finance laws, stating that some Internet communications qualify as \"general public political advertising.\" The court left it to the FEC to determine specific criteria for such communications, while also finding issues with the FEC's 2002 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. The FEC rule exempting Internet communications from the definition of \"public communications\" was found by the Shays court to prevent such communications from being considered \"coordinated communications\" subject to FECA regulation. The court emphasized the importance of preventing circumvention of regulation in campaign finance law. The court found that the FEC rule exempting Internet communications from coordinated communications was contrary to campaign finance law. The case was remanded to the FEC for further action. In response, the FEC published an NPRM seeking comments on amending the definition of \"public communication.\" In April 2005, the FEC published an NPRM to amend the definition of \"public communication\" following the court's decision in Shays v. FEC. The proposed rules included paid Internet advertisements in the definition and sought comments on related definitions, disclaimer regulations, and exceptions for certain Internet activities. The FEC proposed rules in April 2005 to regulate Internet communications by political committees, aiming to ensure proper financing and disclosure without restricting individual citizens' freedom to speak online. After a public hearing in June 2005, the FEC unanimously approved the new regulations in March 2006. In March 2006, the FEC unanimously approved new Internet regulations, citing the 2004 Shays v. FEC court decision. The regulations aim to exempt blogs maintained by individuals from FECA regulation, as long as no fee is involved. The rules were drafted with consideration of preventing corruption and circumvention of the BCRA. The Commission recognized the importance of BCRA in preventing corruption and promoting free speech on the Internet. There is no evidence of corruption or circumvention related to Internet activities. The FEC proposed to consider paid Internet advertising as a \"public communication\" under the regulations, but aimed to exclude most Internet communications from this definition. The regulations apply when money is exchanged for online campaign ads, subjecting them to FECA limitations and reporting requirements. Key aspects of the FEC regulations include regulating Internet-related campaign advertisements. The FEC regulations include limitations, source restrictions, and reporting requirements for funds spent on advertisements. Paid Internet ads are considered \"public communications\" and are subject to FECA regulations, including contribution limits and disclosure requirements. Disclaimer statements are also required for these ads. Fees for political ads are subject to FECA limits, source restrictions, and disclosure requirements. Disclaimers are required on all public political committee websites and paid Internet ads advocating for or against federal candidates. Disclaimers are not needed for individual or group emails unless they are political committees. Committees must include disclaimers for sending over 500 similar unsolicited emails within 30 days. Candidate payments to bloggers must be disclosed on candidate statements. Coordinated internet ads for federal elections on another website for a fee are considered in-kind contributions. Fees for such ads are subject to FECA regulations. Coordinated internet ads for federal elections on another website for a fee are considered in-kind contributions subject to FECA regulations, including contribution limits, source restrictions, and disclosure requirements. The general exemption from FECA coverage of news stories, commentaries, and editorials distributed through broadcasters, newspapers, and periodicals also applies to such communications distributed over the Internet. Exceptions exist for individual or volunteer activity on the Internet. During Congress's consideration of BCRA in 2001 and 2002, communications over the Internet were not addressed, but it was discussed during debate on a previous version of what became BCRA during House consideration of H.R. 417 (Shays-Meehan) in the 106th Congress. An amendment was offered to exempt communications over the Internet from regulation under FECA for individual or volunteer activity. During the 109th Congress, bills were proposed to exempt Internet communications from BCRA regulation under FECA. H.R. 1606, the Online Freedom of Speech Act, failed to pass with a 225-182 vote. During the 109th Congress, H.R. 1606, the Online Freedom of Speech Act, failed to pass with a 225-182 vote. The bill was later ordered reported favorably by the House Administration Committee but the vote was postponed pending FEC regulatory action. Additionally, H.R. 4194 (Shays-Meehan) was introduced to exclude Internet communications from FECA regulation. During the 110th Congress, two bills were proposed regarding the regulation of political communications on the Internet. H.R. 4194 aimed to exclude Internet communications from FECA regulation, while H.R. 4900 sought to exempt most individual online communications from regulation. However, House floor action was postponed indefinitely following new FEC regulations in 2006. H.R. 894 was also introduced during this Congress. During the 110th Congress, H.R. 894 proposed extending disclaimer requirements to Internet communications. H.R. 5699 aimed to exempt uncompensated Internet services from regulation. H.R. 5699 aimed to exempt blogs and other Internet publications from regulation, excluding them from being treated as expenditures. It was referred to the Committee on House Administration. No similar legislation has been introduced in the 111th Congress."
