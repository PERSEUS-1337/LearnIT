Obesity increases the risk of diabetes, heart disease, stroke, cancer, and other health problems. The annual cost of obesity in the United States is $117 billion. There has been a significant increase in meals prepared or eaten outside the home, with a third of calories and almost half of total food dollars spent on food from restaurants and food-service establishments. Excess saturated fat intake is a major risk factor for heart disease, the leading cause of death in the United States. Heart disease also leads to significant healthcare expenditures and lost productivity, totaling $142 billion in 2005. Increased sodium intake is linked to high blood pressure. Increased sodium intake is associated with a higher risk of high blood pressure, which can lead to cardiovascular disease, especially stroke. The proportion of adults with high blood pressure increases with age, reaching 45% at age 50, 60% at age 60, and over 70% at age 70.
