    "content": "In a well-studied approach for machine learning on relational data, entities and relations are represented in an embedding space. Our approach proposes a multimodal embedding using different neural encoders to incorporate various data types like text, images, and numerical values. Two new benchmarks, YAGO-10-plus and MovieLens-100k-plus, are created with additional relations such as textual descriptions and images. Our model utilizes additional information effectively to improve accuracy in predicting missing multimodal attributes. Knowledge bases are crucial in various computational systems but often suffer from incompleteness and noise, leading to inefficient inference. Learning relational knowledge representation has been a focus of active research to address deficiencies in knowledge bases such as incompleteness and noise. Approaches involve estimating fixed, low-dimensional representations for entities and relations to encode uncertainty and infer missing facts accurately and efficiently. The knowledge bases in the real world contain various data types, including numerical attributes, textual attributes, and images, which are crucial for knowledge base completion. These different types of relations cannot be directly represented as links in a graph but provide important evidence for completing the knowledge base. Relational modeling beyond link-based graphs is essential for knowledge base completion, utilizing all observed information including textual descriptions and images as evidence for attributes like age and profession. This additional information, while valuable, faces similar limitations as conventional link data, such as being missing or noisy, requiring prediction for query resolution. In this paper, a multimodal embedding approach is introduced for modeling knowledge bases, incorporating various data types like textual, images, numerical, and categorical values. The approach extends the DistMult method by adding neural encoders to learn vectors for entities and relations, aiming to represent uncertainty in relational evidence beyond traditional link-based graphs. In this study, the DistMult approach is enhanced by incorporating neural encoders for different types of evidence data, such as images and textual attributes. The scoring module remains the same, producing a score indicating the likelihood of a triple being correct. This unified model allows for information flow across various relation types, improving accuracy. The module produces a score indicating the probability of the triple being correct, allowing for information flow across different relation types. Evaluation on relational databases shows that the model effectively utilizes additional information for improved link-prediction accuracy. In our evaluation, we demonstrate that our model effectively utilizes additional information to improve link-prediction accuracy. Knowledge bases contain various types of information about entities such as links, textual descriptions, attributes, values, and images. The existing approaches to embedded relational modeling focus on dense vectors for linked data. Our model extends these approaches to a multimodal setting, incorporating all types of information about entities in knowledge bases. The goal is to train a machine learning model to score the truth value of factual statements represented as triplets of subject, relation, and object. The link prediction problem involves learning a scoring function for factual statements represented as triplets of subject, relation, and object. Training data consists of observed facts from a knowledge base, with models learning fixed-length vectors for entities and relations to make predictions. The link prediction problem involves learning scoring functions for triplets of subject, relation, and object. The DistMult approach maps entities to vectors and relations to matrices, computing scores for triples using learned representations. The DistMult approach computes scores for triplets using learned representations in a d\u00d7d matrix. It uses a pairwise ranking loss to score existing triples higher than non-existing ones, with negative samples generated by replacing entities. This method learns entity and relation representations from the knowledge base. DistMult learns entity and relation representations from knowledge base triplets by replacing entities with random ones. It can be used for completion, queries, or cleaning. Existing approaches assume fixed entity sets, but real-world KBs have objects of various data types. To incorporate these types, embeddings are proposed for numerical, categorical, image, and text data. The proposed work aims to incorporate different types of data objects into existing relational models like DistMult by learning embeddings for attributes such as title, poster, genre, and release year using domain-specific encoders. These embeddings are then used to score the truth value of the triple by the Scorer, utilizing deep learning to construct encoders for representing object values. The model utilizes deep learning to construct encoders for representing object values in a knowledge base. It embeds subjects and relations for any triple (s, r, o) using a direct lookup, and employs appropriate encoders based on the object's domain (indexed, string, numerical, or image). The model uses deep learning to encode object values in a knowledge base by embedding subjects and relations for triples. It employs specific encoders based on the object's domain, such as CNNs for images and LSTMs for text. Negative sampling replaces object entities with random entities from the same domain during training. The encoders used for multimodal objects include embedding subject entity and relation as independent vectors, and embedding categorical object entities using selu activation. For numerical objects, a feed forward layer is used to process real numbers. For numerical objects, real numbers are embedded into a higher-dimensional space using a feed forward layer after basic normalization. This contrasts with existing methods that treat numbers as distinct entities. When encoding different types of information in text, character-based stacked, bidirectional LSTM is used for short attributes like names, while a CNN over word embeddings is used for longer strings like detailed descriptions of entities. This contrasts with how numerical objects are embedded into a higher-dimensional space using a feed forward layer after basic normalization. When modeling entities, detailed descriptions are treated as a sequence of words and encoded using a CNN over word embeddings. Images can also provide valuable information for modeling entities, such as extracting person's details or location information from map images. Various models have been used to represent the semantic information compactly. Images can provide valuable information for modeling entities, such as extracting person's details or location information from map images. Various models have been used to represent semantic information compactly, applied to tasks like image classification and question-answering. To embed images with semantic information, the last hidden layer of VGG pretrained network on Imagenet is used, followed by compact bilinear pooling. The paper discusses utilizing different data types for learning KB representations, such as speech/audio data with CNNs, time series data with LSTM, and geospatial coordinates with feedforward networks. The modeling of these data types is left for future work, with a focus on low-dimensional representations using various operators like matrix and tensor scoring for triples. Incorporating various data types for learning knowledge base representations, the paper explores using text, numerical values, and images as relational triples of information. Unlike existing approaches that focus on fixed entities, this method integrates different types of information in the encoding component. The paper explores incorporating different data types like text, numerical values, and images as relational triples in the encoding component for learning knowledge base representations. Various methods use extra information as observed features for entities, including numerical values, images, and text. Additionally, graph embedding approaches are also utilized. The paper introduces a model that incorporates different types of information (numerical, text, image) as relational triples in a unified model, representing uncertainty in them. This approach differs from existing methods by treating the information as structured knowledge instead of predetermined features. Our model incorporates structured knowledge as first-class citizens of the data, representing uncertainty and supporting missing values for information recovery. Two new benchmarks are provided by extending existing datasets with additional information. The second benchmark enhances the YAGO-10 dataset with image, textual, and numerical information from DBpedia and YAGO-3 databases. TAB0 will provide statistics for these datasets. The MovieLens-100k dataset, a popular benchmark for recommendation systems, contains 100,000 ratings from 1000 users on 1700 movies with rich relational data. The genre attribute for each movie is represented as a binary vector with a length of 19. The MovieLens dataset includes movie titles, genres represented as binary vectors, movie posters from TMDB, 5-point ratings as KB triples, and validation data using 10% of samples. Despite its variety of data types, MovieLens is small and specialized. Another dataset with more appropriate information is also considered. The YAGO3-10 knowledge graph is more suitable for knowledge graph completion and link prediction compared to MovieLens. It contains around 120,000 entities and 37 relations, making it closer to traditional information extraction goals. The dataset is extended with textual descriptions and images for half of the entities provided by DBpedia. The dataset from DBpedia includes textual descriptions and images for half of the entities, along with additional relations like wasBornOnDate and happenedOnDate. The model's ability to utilize multimodal information is evaluated through link prediction tasks and genre prediction on MovieLens and date prediction on YAGO. A qualitative analysis is also provided. The model's performance is evaluated in genre prediction on MovieLens and date prediction on YAGO using text, images, and categorical data. Hyperparameters are tuned using grid search, and evaluation is done using mean reciprocal rank (MRR), Hits@K, and RMSE metrics.

Additionally, a recently introduced approach, ConvE BID4, achieves higher results than the models based on DistMult. The recently introduced approach, ConvE BID4, outperforms models based on DistMult by scoring triples differently. Additional analysis on the YAGO dataset shows that incorporating textual descriptions benefits certain relations like isAffiliatedTo and isLocatedIn. Images are useful for detecting genders. The evaluation on multimodal attributes prediction (text, image, numerical) shows benefits for different relations like isAffiliatedTo, isLocatedIn, hasGender, and playsFor. Approaches using this information as features cannot predict missing relations. Link prediction evaluation on MovieLens with test data consisting only of movies' genre is presented in TAB5. TAB5 presents the link prediction evaluation on MovieLens using only movies' genre in the test dataset. The model incorporating all information outperforms other methods, showing the ability to predict movie genres by utilizing posters and titles. Our model predicts movie genres by incorporating information from posters and titles, with posters providing more data. The link prediction evaluation on YAGO-10-plus involves test data consisting of numerical triples, with a test dataset obtained by holding out 10% of numerical information in the training dataset. Only numerical values larger than 1000 are considered for a denser distribution. Predictions on the year are made by dividing the numerical interval [1000, 2017] into 1000 bins, finding the mid-point of the bin with the highest model score for each triple in the test data, and using this value to compute the RMSE. Our model utilizes multimodal values for more fruitful modeling of numerical information, with S+N+D+I outperforming other methods. Although we can only encode multimodal data, we provide examples of querying for multimodal attributes.
