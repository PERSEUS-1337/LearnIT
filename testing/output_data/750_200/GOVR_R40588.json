    "content": "In April 2009, a novel influenza virus, initially called \"swine flu,\" emerged and spread globally. The World Health Organization (WHO) later explained that pigs can be infected by various flu viruses from birds, humans, and pigs, leading to gene swapping and the emergence of new virus strains. This reassortment process had already been observed in pigs in the United States. The currently circulating influenza A (H1N1) virus is a reassortment of swine, avian, and human genes, with origins unknown. It is now being transmitted from human to human, and the role of swine in its emergence is under investigation. WHO refers to the virus as Influenza A(H1N1). The H1N1 virus, also known as Influenza A(H1N1), is transmitted from human to human and is slightly more lethal than seasonal flu. It is not as deadly as H5N1 avian influenza but has the potential to become more virulent. On April 21, 2009, CDC reported two children in California had recovered from this unique influenza strain. On April 21, 2009, CDC reported two children in California had recovered from a unique influenza strain with gene segments from swine flu viruses. Two days later, five more H1N1 cases were reported in California and Texas. Mexico announced a new influenza strain with over 1,000 suspected cases, leading to school closures and event cancellations. The WHO raised the influenza pandemic alert level from Phase 4 to Phase 5 on April 29, 2009, due to human-to-human spread of the virus. The WHO raised the pandemic alert level to Phase 5 due to human-to-human transmission of an influenza virus capable of causing community-level outbreaks. Phase 5 indicates spread to at least two countries in one WHO region, signaling an imminent pandemic. On June 11, 2009, the alert level was raised to Phase 6 by WHO Director-General Margaret Chan. On June 11, 2009, WHO raised the pandemic alert level to Phase 6, the highest level, due to the spread of the moderately severe H1N1 virus. Over 50,000 confirmed cases and 231 deaths were reported in more than 80 countries and territories. The number of cases may be higher than reported, as it only includes confirmed cases. The number of H1N1 cases reported may not reflect the actual number of people infected, as it only includes confirmed cases. WHO advises against travel restrictions as they would not effectively stop the virus from spreading but could disrupt the global community. Ill individuals are cautioned to delay international travel. According to WHO, most people with H1N1 experience flu-like symptoms and recover without antiviral treatment. Antiviral drugs can reduce symptoms, duration of illness, and prevent severe disease and death. The circulating H1N1 strain is a new virus, with only a small number of cases treated with antiviral drugs. The WHO has found that older antiviral drugs are not very effective against the new H1N1 virus, but oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza) are effective. They have a global stockpile of 5 million adult treatment courses of oseltamivir donated by manufacturers and donor countries, initiated after H5N1 outbreaks. WHO has distributed some treatments and is distributing 3 million adult treatment courses. The WHO has a global stockpile of 5 million adult treatment courses of oseltamivir and zanamivir donated by manufacturers and donor countries. They are distributing 3 million adult treatment courses to developing countries in need. Currently, there is no available vaccine against the H1N1 strain, but efforts are being made to develop one, which could take between five and six months to mass-produce once the strain is modified. The WHO estimates that once the H1N1 strain is modified, it could take 5-6 months to mass-produce a vaccine. Sanofi-Aventis and GlaxoSmithKline have pledged to donate millions of vaccine doses to WHO for distribution to poor countries. Most countries have followed WHO recommendations against banning international travel, except for China which has quarantined Mexican nationals. Mexico responded to China's quarantine of Mexican nationals by barring all flights to China until discrimination concerns were addressed. Some countries have warned against nonessential travel to the United States and Mexico, with the European Union Health Commissioner urging Europeans to postpone nonessential travel to these countries on April 27, 2009. On April 27, 2009, the European Union Health Commissioner advised postponing nonessential travel to the United States and Mexico. The CDC recommended avoiding nonessential travel to Mexico, later downgrading it to a \"travel health precaution\" on May 15, 2009. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano defended the decision not to close U.S. borders with Mexico, citing marginal benefits and high costs. Closing the border to Mexico would have minimal benefits and high costs. The virus strain from Mexico is already widespread in the US, making containment through border closures unrealistic. Focus should now be on mitigating the virus. Some countries are using thermal scanners in airports to screen travelers with high body temperatures. Several countries have implemented measures to prevent the spread of H1N1, including the use of temperature scanners in airports to screen travelers. Egypt has ordered the slaughter of pigs, and some countries have banned pork imports from the US, Canada, and Mexico. USAID has established a Pandemic Influenza Response Management Team. The United States established the Pandemic Influenza Response Management Team on May 1, 2009, to coordinate humanitarian response to H1N1 outbreaks in Latin America and the Caribbean. Over $16 million has been provided for this purpose, focusing on H1N1 specifically and building on preparedness efforts since the 2003 SARS outbreak. The response is mainly carried out by CDC and USAID. The U.S. response to global H1N1 outbreaks, mainly led by CDC and USAID, focuses on commodity delivery, disease detection, and surveillance. USAID also donated 4,000 PPE kits and biodegradable powder to Vietnam to help animal health workers respond to potential new outbreaks of avian or H1N1 influenza. The CDC has provided biodegradable powder kits valued at over $57,000 to help animal health workers respond to H5N1 bird flu or H1N1 outbreaks. CDC's influenza laboratory in Atlanta collaborates with WHO and creates testing kits for identifying influenza subtypes. The CDC provides reagents to detect influenza subtypes to national centers worldwide. CDC also sends testing kits to public health labs globally at no cost. HHS Secretary announced moving 400,000 treatment courses to Mexico. The Administration plans to distribute 2 million courses in Latin America and the Caribbean. The Administration plans to distribute 2 million courses of treatment in Latin America and the Caribbean, with 400,000 treatment courses being moved to Mexico. CDC has deployed staff to Mexico and Guatemala to assist with influenza response efforts. Teams are working under the WHO/Pan American Health Organization Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network to better understand illness severity and transmission. The CDC collaborates with global teams to understand H1N1 severity and transmission patterns, improve laboratory capacity in Mexico, and support pandemic influenza preparedness in over 50 countries. They work with WHO offices and foreign ministries of health, and provide funding through cooperative agreements. CDC collaborates with global teams and provides funding through cooperative agreements for international H1N1 assistance. USAID announced additional funding for WHO and PAHO to support efforts in Latin America and the Caribbean, focusing on disease surveillance and control measures. In 2009, USAID provided $6.1 million for international H1N1 assistance, with $0.9 million for Mexico, $0.2 million for Panama, and $5 million for the region. The assistance included support for animal surveillance efforts and distribution of over 100,000 PPE kits to protect first responders. Additionally, USAID pre-positioned 400,000 PPE kits in 82 countries in preparation for a possible outbreak. USAID pre-positioned 400,000 PPE kits in 82 countries to prepare for a possible influenza pandemic. A three-day pandemic preparedness exercise was held in Ethiopia as part of the Humanitarian Pandemic Preparedness Initiative, bringing together stakeholders and national authorities from nine East African countries. The exercise aimed to identify roles, establish coordination principles, and develop a pandemic response action plan. During a three-day pandemic preparedness exercise in Ethiopia, stakeholders and national authorities from nine East African countries met to establish coordination principles, develop a pandemic response action plan, and test existing ones through a simulation exercise. The exercises help governments prepare for potential influenza pandemics and address cross-border population movements. Regional events allow national leaders to interact and identify possible issues. USAID conducts pandemic preparedness exercises in various regions, working with the Department of Defense to provide military assistance in 30 countries across Africa and Asia. In FY2005, Congress provided emergency supplemental funds for U.S. technical assistance efforts related to global pandemic influenza preparedness and response, funding U.S. efforts to train health workers in foreign countries. Since FY2005, Congress has funded U.S. efforts to train health workers in foreign countries for global pandemic influenza preparedness and response. The U.S. Department of State announced that the United States has pledged $949 million for global avian and pandemic influenza efforts, making it the largest single donor. These funds have supported international efforts in over 100 nations. The United States has pledged $949 million for global avian and pandemic preparedness efforts, making it the largest single donor. The funds have supported international efforts in over 100 nations, focusing on preparedness, surveillance, and response. The United States has pledged $949 million for global avian and pandemic preparedness efforts, with funds allocated to various organizations and programs including the FAO, UNDP, IFRC, UNSIC, OIE, and UNICEF. This includes $123 million for regional programs, $83 million for a global contingency fund, $77 million for technical and humanitarian assistance, $71 million for influenza research and wild bird surveillance. The United States has allocated $67 million for stockpiles of non-pharmaceutical supplies, $13 million for global communications and outreach, and $949 million in total for international influenza research, wild bird surveillance, and pandemic preparedness efforts. The United States has allocated $949 million for international influenza research, wild bird surveillance, and pandemic preparedness efforts. This includes contributions from USAID, HHS, USDA, DOD, and DOS. President Obama has also requested $1.5 billion for domestic and international pandemic preparedness and response activities. The 2009 Supplemental Appropriations bill allocated $50 million for USAID pandemic preparedness and $200 million to CDC for domestic and international H1N1 activities. The conference report did not specify how much of the $200 million CDC should spend on international efforts. Infectious diseases cause over 25% of global deaths, with recent outbreaks like H5N1 avian influenza and severe acute diseases. Infectious diseases account for over 25% of global deaths. Recent outbreaks like H5N1 avian influenza and SARS have raised concerns about global security. The emergence of influenza A H1N1 highlights the threat posed by infectious diseases, with about 75% originating from animals. Effective responses require a multidisciplinary approach involving stakeholders from various sectors. Investments made by the United States and other international players to prepare for infectious diseases like H1N1 have been beneficial. Health experts have made progress in developing tests, treatments, and a global surveillance system. Some health experts are concerned about poorer countries lacking capacity to monitor and respond to H1N1, while others warn against complacency as influenza transmission accelerates in winter. Southern hemisphere countries are entering winter and reporting cases, raising questions about potential gene changes in the virus. In May 2009, there was a debate about whether WHO should maintain its pandemic influenza phase system, reflecting virus spread and transmission patterns, not severity. Some suggested developing an alert system based on severity to improve public understanding. In May 2009, there was a debate about whether WHO should maintain its pandemic influenza phase system, reflecting virus spread and transmission patterns, not severity. Some argued for an alert system based on severity to improve public understanding. On June 11, 2009, WHO raised the pandemic phase level from 5 to 6, despite concerns about potential panic and economic disruptions. On June 11, 2009, WHO raised the pandemic threat level to Phase 6, emphasizing that it did not indicate a change in severity. The update included a new pandemic influenza preparedness and response guide, outlining steps for governments to plan and prepare for an epidemic. U.S. agencies also acknowledged the infectious threat. The update on June 11, 2009, raised the pandemic threat level to Phase 6, emphasizing the need for governments to plan and prepare for an epidemic. U.S. agencies recognized the threat of infectious diseases, particularly those of animal origin, and announced a new program in collaboration with CDC and USDA to develop a global early warning system for diseases like SARS, H5N1, and HIV/AIDS. USAID will invest in establishing a network of laboratories. USAID plans to invest in establishing a network of laboratories in Africa to improve the ability to diagnose new emergent pathogens in both animal and human populations. Concerns have been raised about the poor condition of laboratory and surveillance systems in sub-Saharan Africa, with South Africa being the only country to have confirmed cases of H1N1. Laboratory and surveillance systems in sub-Saharan Africa are in poor condition, except for South Africa and Botswana. Limited public health and surveillance capacity may be the reason for the absence of case reports in most African countries. Efforts are being made by CDC, USAID, and other international health experts to improve laboratory and disease surveillance capacity in Africa. CDC has distributed H1N1 testing kits to 18 laboratories in Africa out of 237 worldwide. Countries without the kits send viral samples to WHO collaborating centers. The CDC has sent H1N1 testing kits to 237 laboratories in 107 countries, including 18 in Africa. Countries without the kits send viral samples to WHO collaborating centers in Atlanta, Britain, Japan, and Australia. Access to treatments and vaccines for diseases in poor countries has been a debated issue, especially during HIV/AIDS and H5N1 outbreaks. Indonesia has raised concerns about affordability of vaccines for poorer countries. Indonesia raised concerns about affordability of vaccines for poorer countries during global H5N1 avian flu outbreaks. Access to medicines is limited in poorer areas of Africa and Asia. WHO estimates that over 90% of global influenza vaccine capacity is in Europe and North America. WHO estimates that over 90% of global influenza vaccine capacity is in Europe and North America, leading to concerns about access for poorer countries during a potential pandemic. Richer countries may hoard treatments, raising questions about fairness and the ability of poorer countries to administer mass vaccination campaigns. WHO stated it would not conduct mass H1N1 vaccination campaigns, leaving it to national authorities. Some argue that countries unable to administer routine vaccines may struggle with mass vaccination efforts. In 2002, 1.4 million deaths in children under five could have been prevented by routine vaccination. WHO is concerned about factors affecting global child mortality. Health experts, including the WHO, are concerned about the severity of the H1N1 strain circulating globally and the potential for reassortment with H5N1 bird flu, which could create a new strain with the potential to cause human illness. Concerns about H5N1 causing an influenza pandemic have been raised since 2004 when the first human cases were reported in Thailand and Viet Nam. In January 2004, Thailand and Viet Nam reported their first human cases of avian influenza H5N1, which raised concerns among health experts due to the potential for a pandemic. By 2006, H5N1 outbreaks had affected eight Asian nations and spread to about 50 countries worldwide. Despite limited human-to-human transmission, the disease has become endemic in Asia. In 2008 and 2009, six countries reported human H5N1 cases, with Indonesia and Cambodia not reporting H1N1 cases. H5N1 bird flu is more deadly but less easily transmissible than H1N1. Most human deaths from H5N1 occur after direct contact with sick birds."
