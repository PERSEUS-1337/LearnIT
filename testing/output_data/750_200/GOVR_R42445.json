    "content": "The Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act (SAFETEA-LU) authorized federal spending on surface transportation programs, including highways and mass transit. Since its expiration in 2009, these programs have been operating on extensions due to budget constraints. The highway trust fund has been the primary source of funding for surface transportation. The financial resources available to authorizers have become more constrained since SAFETEA was passed in 2005. Revenues from highway taxes supporting the highway trust fund have declined due to the economy and vehicle fuel efficiency improvements. Passing a multi-year bill without cutting infrastructure spending, raising the gas tax, or increasing the budget deficit is a key issue in the ongoing debate. Other topics include alternative finance, tolling, and public-private partnerships. The ongoing debate in the transportation sector includes issues such as raising the gas tax, increasing the budget deficit, alternative finance, tolling, public-private partnerships, project delivery acceleration, and performance management. The question of equity in federal spending distribution among states remains unresolved due to forecasted revenues. For more details, refer to CRS Report R41512, Surface Transportation Program Reauthorization Issues for the 112th Congress. The Senate passed MAP-21, reauthorizing surface transportation programs for two years. The House committees reported favorably on H.R. 7, a five-year bill for infrastructure and energy jobs. H.R. 7, the American Energy and Infrastructure Jobs Act, is a five-year bill with a total authorization of $260 billion. It includes provisions to increase oil and gas production to fund highway infrastructure, controversially discontinuing mass transit funding with Highway Trust Fund revenues. H.R. 7 differs significantly from MAP-21 in programmatic content and treatment of the Highway Trust Fund, reducing the number of programs by two-thirds and eliminating program earmarks. The House passed the Surface Transportation Extension Act of 2012, Part II (H.R. 4348) on April 18, 2012, extending surface transportation authorizations through the end of FY2012. It includes provisions related to the Keystone XL Pipeline, Gulf Coast Restoration Trust Fund, Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund guarantee, Coal Residuals Reuse and Management Act (H.R. 2273), and environmental streamlining provisions of Title III of H.R. 7. The Senate agreed to an amendment on April 24, 2012, that replaced the House-passed language in H.R. 4348 with the language of MAP-21, allowing the measure to go to conference. Negotiations will involve the entire substance of H.R. 7 and provisions of the extension bill. Surface transportation reauthorization is a complex issue before Congress. The report analyzes H.R. 7 and the complexities of surface transportation reauthorization before Congress. The highway trust fund is funded by various sources, with the majority coming from excise taxes on motor fuels. The Highway Trust Fund (HTF) is primarily funded by excise taxes on motor fuels, with 90% of revenue coming from gasoline and diesel taxes. The fund is divided into highway and mass transit accounts, with specific allocations from the fuel taxes. Fuel tax rates have not been raised since 1993, leading to stagnant revenues that do not adjust for inflation. The Highway Trust Fund's revenues do not increase with inflation as fuel tax rates have not been raised since 1993. Due to sluggish economic performance and improved fuel efficiency, fuel tax revenues have fallen below projections. The fund has required transfers from the general fund to cover shortfalls, with a projected shortfall of $4.6 billion by the end of FY2013. The Congressional Budget Office projected a $4.6 billion shortfall in the Highway Trust Fund by the end of FY2013, with a gap of $8-9 billion per year through FY2022. The mass transit account is expected to fall to a negative $1.2 billion shortfall by the end of FY2014. The Highway Trust Fund is projected to have a shortfall of $1.2 billion by the end of FY2014, which deepens to $5 billion by the end of FY2015. Without an increase in fuel taxes, the trust fund will struggle to support transportation spending, leading policymakers to consider new revenue sources or a smaller program. The Federal-Aid Highway Program (Highway Program) faces a choice between finding new revenue sources for transportation or accepting a smaller program. State DOTs manage the program, following federal planning guidelines for project development and construction. The Federal-Aid Highway Program is managed by state DOTs following federal planning guidelines. Projects require a state/local matching share, typically 10% for Interstate System projects and 20% for other roads. FHWA distributes funds through notifications, with apportionment among states. The Federal-Aid Highway Program distributes federal funds to states for highway projects through apportionment and allocation. Reimbursement is provided once a project is approved and costs are incurred, to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse. Contract authority allows for obligation without appropriation. Contract authority is a type of budget authority available for obligation without an appropriation. It legally commits the federal government to reimburse the state for the federal share of a project, even before an appropriation is made. Limitation on obligations, or ObLim, sets a cap on the total amount of contract authority that can be obligated in a fiscal year to control FHWA spending. The ObLim sets a limit on FHWA spending, similar to an appropriation. There are formula and discretionary programs for allocating funds to states. Formula programs distribute funds based on specific factors, while discretionary programs are smaller and allocated by FHWA or Congress. The majority of federal-aid highway money is apportioned to state DOTs for project spending under SAFETEA. Under SAFETEA, federal-aid highway money is mainly apportioned to state DOTs through core formula programs like IM, NHS, STP, HBP, CMAQ, HSIP, and EB. These programs receive about 80% of SAFETEA's contract authority and fund most federal-aid highway projects. EB funds are distributed among the other programs mentioned. The Highway Program funding under SAFETEA is distributed to state DOTs through core formula programs like IM, NHS, STP, HBP, CMAQ, HSIP, and EB. Each program has its own formula factors to determine state apportionment. State DOTs have flexibility to transfer funds between programs, except for HSIP. Some funding can also be used for transit projects. The state DOTs have increasing flexibility to transfer funds between highway programs, reducing the importance of funding formulas. The Equity Bonus Program ensures each state receives a minimum share of funds, regardless of formulas. Some state DOTs feel restricted by the programmatic structure in using federal highway funds as they see fit. The Equity Bonus Program guarantees each state a minimum share of funds, regardless of funding formulas. Smaller discretionary highway programs are also part of the Federal-Aid Highway Program, earmarked by Congress during SAFETEA. During SAFETEA, Congress earmarked funding for projects chosen through competition. The term \"program\" is broadly defined, with FHWA listing 59 activities, some programmatic and others resembling specific project designations or temporary pilot programs. The federal transit program, administered by FTA, consists of individual programs with varying funding amounts and distribution mechanisms. The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) in the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) administers various individual programs with different funding amounts, distribution mechanisms, and spending eligibility rules. There are four main federal transit programs in SAFETEA, accounting for 85% of authorized transit funding. Two of these programs, the Urbanized Area Formula Program and the Fixed Guideway Modernization Program, distribute funds by formula. The Urbanized Area Formula Program provides funding to urbanized areas with populations of 50,000 or more, covering a broad range of expenses including capital and planning. The Urbanized Area Formula Program in SAFETEA provides funding to urbanized areas with populations of 50,000 or more, covering expenses like capital, planning, transit enhancements, and operations. Fixed Guideway Modernization Program funds are mainly for replacing and rehabilitating transit rail system assets. New Starts Program funding is available on a competitive basis for new fixed guideway systems. The New Starts Program, part of the Capital Program, provides funding for new fixed guideway systems and extensions through competitive grants. It also includes a \"Small Starts\" program for projects costing $250 million or less, with a federal share of $75 million or less. Additionally, the program funds various transit projects such as busways, bus rapid transit, ferries, automated guideway systems, and vintage trolleys. The Small Starts program receives $200 million annually from the New Starts authorization for projects costing $75 million or less. Bus Program funds, 9% of authorized funding, are used to purchase buses and related equipment, with funds now allocated by the FTA. Other smaller funding programs include the Rural Formula Program, JARC program, Elderly and Disabilities grants program, and New Freedom program. Highway transportation accounts for the majority of transportation-related fatalities and injuries in the United States. States have the primary responsibility for highway safety and can legislate restrictions on driver behavior. Federal highway safety programs assist states in improving highway safety, administered by three DOT agencies. The federal government has established highway safety programs to assist states in improving highway safety, with three DOT agencies administering these programs. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration focuses on driver behavior and vehicle safety, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration focuses on commercial driver qualifications and vehicle safety, and the FHWA focuses on roadway design safety. NHTSA provides grants to states, regulates motor vehicle safety, and conducts research on traffic. The NHTSA focuses on roadway design safety, providing grants to states, regulating motor vehicle safety, and conducting research on traffic safety. States must submit highway safety plans approved by NHTSA to receive federal traffic safety funds. NHTSA also offers training and technical assistance to states. NHTSA provides grants to states through various programs to improve traffic safety, including data collection, speeding reduction, seat belt usage, drunk driving prevention, and discouraging unsafe driving behaviors. FMCSA promotes commercial vehicle safety through regulation, enforcement, training, and grants to states for truck and motor coach operations. It aims to reduce drunk and drugged driving, motorcycle crashes, school bus crashes, and unsafe driving behaviors. HSIP funding program focuses on reducing traffic fatalities and injuries through highway improvements. The HSIP funding program aims to reduce traffic fatalities and serious injuries by improving roadways. States receive funding based on road lane-miles, vehicle miles traveled, and traffic fatalities, with a minimum allocation of 0.5%. The program includes set-asides for railway-highway grade crossing hazard elimination and construction on high-risk rural roads. SAFETEA extended existing mechanisms for road safety improvements. SAFETEA extended mechanisms to ensure annual funding levels for high-risk rural road improvements, creating \"fire walls\" to protect funds from being reallocated. It also guaranteed funding levels for FY2005 through FY2009, preventing lower appropriations. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 specified SAFETEA ObLim levels for FY2005 through FY2009, preventing lower appropriations. The Budget Enforcement Act's budget firewalls were honored by appropriators until the House eliminated the rule in the 112th Congress, removing the last protection guarantees. RABA can raise or lower the firewall. Despite the elimination of protection guarantees in the 112th Congress, RABA allows for adjustments to funding levels based on annual highway account receipts. Congress has never allowed funding cuts despite revenues consistently falling below guarantee levels. In recent years, funding for highways has consistently fallen below guarantee levels, leading to potential funding reductions under RABA. However, the issue has been considered moot due to general fund transfers supplementing the Highway Trust Fund. Despite this, mechanisms to align spending with receipts may still be considered in reauthorization. The Budget Control Act mandates sequestration of certain funding authorizations if a special joint committee fails to agree on spending reductions, as seen with the Budget Control \"Super Committee\" in 2011. The Budget Control \"Super Committee\" failed to reach an agreement on spending reductions in November 2011. Exemptions to the sequester process likely mean that surface transportation spending beyond FY2012 would not be significantly reduced. Exempted programs include Federal-Aid Highways, Highway Traffic Safety Grants, NHTSA operations and research, and National Driver Register. The $739 million of annual contract authority exempt from obligation limitations may be subject to sequester, including the Federal Transit Administration's New Starts program. SAFETEA expired in 2009, and surface transportation programs have been operating on extension legislation. SAFETEA expired in 2009 and surface transportation programs have been operating on extension legislation. The House-passed STEA-II extends the HTF and federal surface transportation programs until September 30, 2012. The Senate replaced the House language with MAP-21, sending the bill to conference. The House passed STEA-II to extend surface transportation programs until September 30, 2012. The Senate replaced it with MAP-21, allowing the bill to go to conference for negotiation. Chairman John Mica stated that H.R. 7 provisions will also be part of the discussion. The House and Senate versions of the transportation bill are being negotiated in conference. Provisions from H.R. 7 not in either version may be proposed. Conference reports must stay within the allowable scope to avoid points of order in both chambers. Waivers can be granted by a majority vote in the House and with the support of 60 Senators in the Senate. The Senate rules allow for waiving points of order on conference reports with the support of 60 Senators. STEA-II includes provisions unrelated to surface transportation programs, such as the North American Energy Access Act transferring permitting authority for the Keystone XL pipeline. Title II of the bill includes provisions related to the Keystone XL pipeline, requiring the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to issue a permit within 30 days. It also establishes the Gulf Coast Restoration Trust Fund financed by 80% of collected amounts. The Gulf Coast Restoration Trust Fund, established by the RESTORE Act of 2011, would be funded by 80% of Deepwater Horizon-related penalties. The fund would be administered by the Secretary of the Treasury, with 35% going to Gulf Coast states, 60% to the Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council, and 5% for research. Unlike S. 1400, H.R. 4348 would require a future act of Congress for revenue distribution. The House-passed H.R. 4348 would require a future act of Congress for revenue distribution, unlike S. 1400. The bill would ensure that budgetary resources match receipts credited to the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund, with funds restricted to harbor maintenance programs. Title V of the bill includes provisions from the Coal Residuals Reuse and Management Act (H.R. 2273) to authorize states to manage coal combustion residuals. Title V of H.R. 4348 includes provisions from the Residuals Reuse and Management Act (H.R. 2273) to authorize states to manage coal combustion residuals. The House and Senate bills aim to expedite project delivery and reduce highway programs by two-thirds. MAP-21 is a two-year reauthorization bill funding the Federal-Aid Highway Program at baseline levels. MAP-21 is a two-year reauthorization bill that reduces highway programs by two-thirds and makes significant changes to the structure, formulas, and funding distribution of the federal highway program. It authorizes $39.5 billion for FY2012 and $40.5 billion for FY2013, with an additional $400 million allocated for research and education each fiscal year. The bill eliminates all formula factors under individual formula programs, apportioning contract authority to each state based on its total share. MAP-21 eliminates formula factors in individual programs, apportions contract authority to states based on their share of total apportionments, and guarantees a 95% return. This change reduces federal and congressional influence on program direction and project selection. MAP-21 reduces federal and congressional influence on program direction and project selection by eliminating program formulas and congressional designation of projects. National interests and needs will be driven by federal planning, performance management, project delivery, and project eligibility requirements. Transferability between core programs is limited to 20% of each formula program's apportionment, and the number of programs will be reduced by roughly two-thirds. The MAP-21 bill reduces the number of programs by two-thirds, shifting program eligibility to core programs and eliminating most discretionary grant programs under FHWA control. The Transportation Enhancements Program is merged into the CMAQ program, with some controversial uses eliminated. States can use TE funds for non-TE CMAQ uses after building up a balance. The National Freight Program is also introduced. The CMAQ program allows unspent balances to be carried over for one and a half years. Some TE-type projects are eligible for funding in other programs. The National Freight Program aims to increase funding for freight projects by removing competition with non-freight projects. The Senate bill significantly increases funding for the TIFIA program. H.R. 7 is a five-year reauthorization bill if FY2012 funding is included. H.R. 7 is a five-year reauthorization bill that would provide modest increases for federal-aid highways and allocate $440 million annually for research and education. Existing programs like the Interstate Maintenance and Highway Bridge programs would be folded into the National Highway System and Surface Transportation Programs, while retaining the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality program and the Highway Safety Improvement programs. The Highway System and Surface Transportation Programs would be streamlined, reducing the number of distinct programs by about two-thirds to approximately 30. The Equity Bonus program would guarantee a 94% state rate of return on payments to the Highway Trust Fund. The Mass Transit Account would be renamed the Alternative Transportation Account, providing funding for mass transit and $2.267 billion annually for highway programs. Fuel taxes credited to the Mass Transit Account would be redirected to the Highway Account. The House bill for FY2013-FY2016 would redirect fuel taxes from the Mass Transit Account to the Highway Account. Changes to the National Environmental Policy Act would exempt highway and transit projects costing less than $10 million or with federal funding below 15%. TIFIA funding would increase significantly, while MAP-21 would maintain funding for the Federal Transit Administration at current levels. The Highway Trust Fund would provide 79.9% of the funding. MAP-21 provisions include a nearly ten-fold increase in TIFIA funding, with $10.458 billion annually allocated for transit programs. The State of Good Repair program would replace the Fixed Guideway Modernization Program, while the Bus and Bus Facilities program would be eliminated, except for the Bus and Bus Facilities SGR program which would provide competitive grants for bus upkeep. Funding for this program would be $75 million set aside from the New Starts program. H.R. 7 proposes competitive grants for bus maintenance through the Bus and Bus Facilities SGR program, funded with $75 million from the New Starts program. It also includes renaming the Mass Transit Account to the Alternative Transportation Account (ATA) and redirecting motor fuel taxes to the Highway Account, with $40 billion transferred from the general fund. The bill authorizes $10.458 billion for FY2012 and $10.498 billion annually for FY2013 through FY2016. The ATA would be funded by transferring $40 billion from the general fund and eliminating various programs. MAP-21 includes provisions for a national rail plan and a rolling stock equipment pool. MAP-21 includes provisions for a national rail plan, rolling stock equipment pool, and positive train control. It also amends the RRIF program for freight rail and makes modest changes to laws affecting rail freight enforced by the Surface Transportation Board. The House bill contains provisions on Amtrak funding and the RRIF program. The bill includes provisions to raise revenue or provide offsets for $13.872 billion over ten-and-a-half fiscal years for the Highway Trust Fund, with $9.279 billion to be transferred. It also makes modest changes to laws affecting rail freight enforced by the Surface Transportation Board. The House bill contains provisions on Amtrak funding, the RRIF program, and positive train control implementation. The Senate bill extends highway-related taxes at current rates through FY2015 and extends highway trust fund expenditure authority through FY2013. The bill includes provisions to raise $13.872 billion over ten-and-a-half fiscal years for the Highway Trust Fund. This includes transfers from various sources such as the Leaking Underground Storage Tank trust fund, Gas Guzzler Tax, revocation of passports of tax delinquents, and allowing the Treasury to levy up to 100% of the payment to a Medicare provider. The curr_chunk details revenue sources for the Highway Trust Fund: $841 million from revocation of passports of tax delinquents, $4.52 billion from future import tariffs on automotive products, $244 million from a change in tax treatment of securities, $25 million from IRS levy on federal employee's Thrift Savings Account, and $363 million from pension transfers extension. The curr_chunk discusses revenue sources for the Highway Trust Fund, including $9.467 billion from pension funding stabilization, $4.970 billion transfer from the Treasury general fund, and $459 million from allowing Section 420 of the U.S. tax code to apply to life insurance benefits. $4.970 billion transfer from the Treasury general fund to the Highway Trust Fund, $459 million from federal agencies offering phased retirement, $244 million from reporting life insurance policies sale, $99 million from extending taxes on cigarette manufacturers, $3.627 billion from delaying worldwide interest expense allocation, and $1.022 billion from authorizing special measures against foreign jurisdictions and financial institutions. The Finance Committee reported favorably on provisions that cost money, including a $761 million reduction over 10 years by changing the Small Issuer Exception rules for bond modifications. This could create an opportunity for deficit reduction or additional spending. The Finance Committee reported favorably on provisions that cost money, including changes to bond rules resulting in a $761 million reduction over 10 years. Additionally, there were savings from other modifications such as excluding certain bonds from the alternative minimum tax and extending employer-provided benefits. The incorporation of the Sustainable Water Infrastructure Act also contributed to cost savings. The Senate bill includes provisions for TRIP bonds through state infrastructure banks and modifies the Transportation Access for All Americans Act. The bill includes modifications to the Transportation Access for All Americans Act, changing the depreciation period for long-term highway leases to 45 years and ensuring a minimum amortization period of 15 years for toll collection rights. This aims to make highway privatization less appealing to private investors. The finance provision in the bill establishes a \"solvency account\" for excess amounts appropriated to the HTF before October 1, 2013, under MAP-21. These amounts would be made available for the needs of the HTF. The Senate bill proposes to use the LUST trust fund as a new revenue source for the highway trust fund, established in 1986 to address groundwater contamination from leaking underground storage tanks containing petroleum. The LUST trust fund was established in 1986 to address groundwater contamination from leaking underground storage tanks containing petroleum. It receives revenues from a 0.1 cent per gallon excise tax on gasoline and diesel fuels. The fund supports environmental contamination investigation and cleanup programs, as well as UST leak prevention programs authorized in the Solid Waste Disposal Act. States historically used the fund to oversee corrective actions by responsible parties and conduct actions where no responsible party is identified. The LUST trust fund was established in 1986 to address groundwater contamination from leaking underground storage tanks containing petroleum. It supports environmental contamination investigation and cleanup programs, as well as UST leak prevention programs. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 expanded state and EPA responsibilities and authorized the use of trust fund monies for UST leak prevention and cleanup programs. Over 85% of the 501,000 reported releases have been addressed, leaving a backlog of 88,000 releases requiring cleanup. Since the establishment of the LUST trust fund in 1986 to address leaking petroleum tanks, over 85% of the 501,000 reported releases have been addressed. There is a backlog of 88,000 releases requiring cleanup. The fund had a balance of $3.392 billion at the beginning of FY2012, with an estimated $117 million in interest payments and $181 million in tax receipts expected. Congress typically appropriates around $113 million annually from the trust fund, with states receiving a minimum of 80% as grants. EPA uses the remainder for program implementation. The LUST trust fund was established in 1986 to address leaking petroleum tanks, with over 85% of reported releases already addressed. There is a backlog of 88,000 releases needing cleanup. States receive a minimum of 80% of the annual appropriation as grants, while the EPA uses the remainder for program implementation. Section 40301 of the Senate bill proposes transferring $3.0 billion from the LUST trust fund to the highway trust fund in FY2012, and Section 40302 suggests appropriating one-third of future LUST trust fund receipts from the gasoline and diesel fuel tax to the highway trust fund. Section 40302 of the Senate bill would appropriate one-third of future LUST trust fund receipts from the gasoline and diesel fuel tax to the highway trust fund, providing an estimated $3.685 billion over ten years. The LUST trust fund expenditure authority, set to expire on March 31, 2012, would be extended through September 30, 2013. These finance provisions were included in the American Energy and Infrastructure Jobs Financing Act of 2012. The finance provisions of H.R. 7 reauthorize HTF expenditure authority through FY2016 and extend existing highway taxes through FY2018. It includes a provision for future transfers to the HTF to be fully offset in budget authority and outlays. The finance provisions of H.R. 7 aim to reconfigure the highway trust fund by addressing gaps in revenue. One gap is the difference between highway account revenues and authorized levels, while the other involves $40 billion in general fund resources for an alternative transportation account. Unlike the Senate bill, H.R. 7 does not allocate balances or revenues from the LUST trust fund to the Highway Trust Fund. Instead, it proposes amending the Internal Revenue Code to extend the LUST trust fund. Section 15002(c) of H.R. 7 extends the LUST trust fund from April 1, 2012, until October 1, 2016, without allocating balances or revenues to the Highway Trust Fund. The bill originally aimed to direct federal revenues from energy leasing and production into the highway account of the Highway Trust Fund, establishing a new allocation of government receipts from leasing and drilling activities. The House approved energy leasing and production provisions on February 16, 2012, under a rule to be incorporated into H.R. 7. Offshore energy development is governed by the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, managed by the Department of the Interior. The program allows leasing for oil and gas development in federal ocean areas in exchange for payments and royalties. Federal receipts from offshore oil and gas totaled $6.5 billion. The Department of the Interior manages offshore energy development under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, allowing leasing for oil and gas in federal ocean areas. Federal receipts from offshore oil and gas totaled $6.5 billion in FY2011. Receipts are allocated to various programs, including the Land and Water Conservation Fund and the National Historic Preservation Fund. Portions of receipts from submerged acreage are permanently appropriated to states, with Gulf Coast states receiving allocations. H.R. 7 renames the mass transit account of the Highway Trust Fund to the alternative transportation account and provides a one-time appropriation of $40 billion. It transfers 2.86 cents per gallon of motor fuels taxes to the highway account. Title XVI, Federal Employee Retirement, is included to offset the $40 billion in general fund revenues provided to the alternative transportation account. MAP-21 proposes total authorizations of $80.8 billion over two years, with $39.9 billion for FY2012 and $40.9 billion for FY2013. The Senate bill does not reinstate TEA-21 or SAFETEA funding firewalls. MAP-21 eliminates the Equity Bonus Program and guarantees a state share based on SAFETEA. MAP-21 guarantees a state share based on SAFETEA and a 95 cent return on each dollar paid by highway users to the HTF. It includes a provision called the \"ratchet mechanism\" to ensure the solvency of the highway account, estimating balances for FY2012 and FY2013. The DOT will reduce FY2012 ObLim if account balance falls below $2 billion in FY2012 or $1 billion in FY2013. The reduction will be reflected in state distributions, with withdrawn ObLim lapsing immediately. Similar calculations will be made for future years under year-long appropriations bills, not short-term resolutions. This provision addresses the pending HTF shortfall under MAP-21 spending levels. The provision in the appropriations bill commits the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee to keeping spending within the means of the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) to address the shortfall under MAP-21 levels. Implementing a ratchet mechanism if HTF balances are breached may face resistance in Congress due to past negative calculations. H.R. 7 proposes a $205 billion federal-aid highway program authorization over five years, with specific HTF obligation limitations for each fiscal year. Despite past negative RABA calculations, Congress chose to override reductions by drawing down the HTF balance. H.R. 7 proposes a $205 billion federal-aid highway program authorization over five years. It includes an Alternative Transportation Account providing an additional $2.7 billion annually for FY2013-FY2016. The bill does not include spending guarantee mechanisms like SAFETEA but guarantees each state's total highway grants will equal at least 94% of the motor fuel taxes paid into the HTF, capped at $3.9 billion per year. The House bill proposes a $205 billion federal-aid highway program authorization over five years. It includes an Alternative Transportation Account providing an additional $2.7 billion annually for FY2013-FY2016. The program ensures each state's total highway grants will be at least 94% of the motor fuel taxes paid into the HTF, capped at $3.9 billion per year. Additionally, the bill allows expanded tolling of the Interstate system and federal participation in projects to increase highway capacity. H.R. 7 proposes tolling of the Interstate system with federal participation in projects to increase highway capacity. Unlike previous acts, MAP-21 determines state apportionments for major programs using a single methodology. MAP-21 establishes a single methodology to determine state apportionments for major programs, based on each state's initial amount and adjusted to ensure a minimum level of funding. The MAP-21 legislation sets a minimum funding level for state apportionments based on estimated tax payments from highway users. Adjustments may not be necessary due to federal highway spending exceeding revenues for FY2005-FY2009. Additionally, a portion of funds is set aside for the new CMAQ program based on each state's CMAQ percentage and Surface Transportation Program funding for FY2009. The CMAQ program receives a set-aside amount from the adjusted initial funding determined in the first two steps. The metropolitan planning amount is calculated based on a state's apportionment under Title 23 Section 134 for FY2009. The remaining initial amount is divided among core programs: 58% for NHPP, 29.3% for TMP, 7% for HSIP, and 5.7% for NFP. The provision would reduce state apportioned amounts for privatized toll roads based on privatized lane mileage and vehicle miles traveled. It applies to formerly publicly operated toll roads that have been privatized. The provision would reduce state apportioned amounts for privatized toll roads based on lane mileage and vehicle miles traveled, affecting three states - Illinois, Indiana, and Colorado. Other states would see an increase in apportionments. The apportionments are adjusted as follows: Illinois reduced by 0.087%, Indiana by 4.375%, and Colorado by 0.045%, while all other states increase by 0.115%. MAP-21 does not have an equity program like SAFETEA's Equity Bonus Program. MAP-21 does not have an equity program but determines the \"initial amount\" for each state based on their share of total funding during FY2005-FY2009. There is an adjustment mechanism to ensure all states receive at least a 95% rate of return on their payments to the HTF, with a nationwide rate of return of $1.23 on the dollar. If Congress does not provide sufficient funding, adjustments may be needed to guarantee the minimum return. If Congress does not provide enough funding for the program authorized in MAP-21, adjustments may be necessary to ensure a 95% return for all donor states. Some states prefer using state return on payments to the HTF to determine the \"initial amount\" due to earmarking legacy issues from SAFETEA, which had a high number of earmarks valued at $24.3 billion. In MAP-21, $22.1 billion of highway earmarks were \"below the line,\" reducing Equity Bonus distribution to states. 33% of earmark funding was \"above the line,\" increasing funds to receiving states. Extension legislation did not extend individual earmarks but benefited states with higher base amounts. States that previously did well in obtaining above-the-line earmarks have benefited from higher base amounts under extensions in MAP-21, which is free of project earmarks. The unequal distribution of earmarking under SAFETEA was controversial, with some states receiving increased apportionment shares under MAP-21 reflecting past earmark amounts. The distribution of earmarks among Members of Congress and states was controversial. MAP-21 reduces funding programs by two-thirds to around 30 programs, absorbing eligibilities into new core programs. The five core programs plus metropolitan transportation planning would be authorized at $39.143 billion for FY2012 and $39.806 billion for FY2013. The NHPP, the largest program within the restructured Federal-Aid Highway program, would receive $20.5 billion for FY2012 and $21 billion for FY2013 to improve the National Highway System by combining three SAFETEA core programs. The NHPP, the largest program within the restructured Federal-Aid Highway program, would combine the Interstate Maintenance Program, the National Highway System Program, and the Highway Bridge Program's NHS component. It aims to achieve national performance goals for infrastructure improvement, including highway segments, bridges, tunnels, ferry facilities, bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure, and traffic information. The NHPP combines various programs to improve infrastructure, including bridges, tunnels, ferry facilities, bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure, and traffic information. States must develop asset management plans with performance metrics and targets. States cannot spend more than 40% of their NHPP apportionment on new capacity. The program aims to improve the conditions and performance of federal-aid highways and bridges on public roads by transferring funds from other programs if bridge conditions fall below set standards. It replaces SAFETEA's Surface Transportation Program, excluding the Transportation Enhancement set-aside, with the TE shifting to the enhanced CMAQ program. The Transportation Modernization Program (TMP) authorizes roughly $10.5 billion annually for FY2012 and FY2013. TMP funds are eligible for various transportation projects including transit, carpool programs, congestion pricing, recreational trails, ferry facilities, and more. TMP funds can be used for various transportation projects, including scenic roads, truck parking facilities, safe routes to school projects, natural habitat and wetlands mitigation efforts, and maintenance of public roads near international borders. States could face penalties for non-compliance with program requirements. The proposed legislation focuses on the condition of public roads near international borders with a high percentage of federally owned vehicles. States may face penalties for an increase in deficient bridge deck areas. Funds will be sub-apportioned within states based on population distribution in different areas. The proposed legislation would eliminate the Appalachian Development Highway System program, giving states more flexibility in spending. The Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement program would be expanded to include Transportation Enhancements, Safe Routes to Schools, and Recreational Trails, with an annual budget of roughly $3.3 billion under MAP-21. Eligibility for CMAQ would be broadened. Under MAP-21, the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement program (CMAQ) would receive approximately $3.3 billion annually for FY2012 and FY2013, expanding eligibility to include demand-shifting projects like telecommuting and ridesharing. The Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP) would remain mostly unchanged, focusing on improving road safety with an annual budget of around $2.5 billion. The HSIP under MAP-21 would focus on improving road safety by addressing hazardous road locations and would be funded at roughly $2.5 billion annually for FY2012 and FY2013. The High Risk Rural Roads Program and the Rail-Highway Grade Crossing Program would be eliminated, while the newly designated National Freight Program (NFP) would receive around $2 billion annually for the same period. The MAP-21 program would allocate $2 billion annually for FY2012 and FY2013 for the National Freight Program. It would also reduce the maximum percentage of funding that states can transfer between programs from 50% to 20%. The bill would restrict the transfer of TMP funding suballocated by population. The core programs under MAP-21 have overlapping eligibility areas, potentially reducing the need for inter-program transfers. H.R. 7 proposes to consolidate or eliminate programs differently than MAP-21. H.R. 7 would consolidate or eliminate many programs, retaining core program structure but expanding the National Highway System Program and the Surface Transportation Program. The Interstate Maintenance program would be folded into the National Highway System Program, and the Highway Safety Improvement Program would be retained. The 10% STP set-aside for Transportation Enhancements is eliminated. The 10% STP set-aside for Transportation Enhancements, such as bike trails and streetscape improvements, is eliminated in H.R. 7. Many absorbed or eliminated programs' eligibilities continue under other programs. The obligation limitations for core highway programs total $150.7 billion for FY2013 through FY2016, with an additional $8 billion for the CMAQ program from the alternative transportation account. H.R. 7, the largest formula program in the bill, would allocate $70.4 billion for FY2013-FY2016 to expand funding for the National Highway System (NHS) program. This funding would cover maintenance and repair of the Interstate Highway system and bridges on the NHS. Only projects on the NHS would be eligible for funding, with a focus on national performance goals. Under H.R. 7, $42.4 billion would be authorized for the Surface Transportation Program (STP) for FY2013-FY2014. Projects must support national performance goals and states must participate in developing state asset management plans for the National Highway System (NHS). The program's eligibility criteria would be broadened to include construction, inspection, rehabilitation, and replacement of bridges and tunnels of all classifications. The bill, H.R. 7, authorizes $42.4 billion for the Surface Transportation Program (STP) for FY2013-FY2014. It broadens eligibility criteria to include construction, inspection, rehabilitation, and replacement of bridges and tunnels of all classifications. The bill eliminates the requirement for 10% of STP funds to be set aside for transportation enhancement purposes and allows up to 15% of STP funds for areas with populations under 5,000 to be used on roads classified as minor collectors. H.R. 7 authorizes $42.4 billion for the Surface Transportation Program (STP) for FY2013-FY2014, broadening eligibility criteria. It allows up to 15% of STP funds for areas with populations under 5,000 to be used on minor collector roads. The bill also reduces the percentage of funds required to be spent on urbanized areas with populations over 200,000 to 50%. States must consult with local planning organizations before obligating funds for projects in population areas of 5,000 to 200,000. $10.4 billion is allocated for Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP) for the same period, with states needing their own safety programs and plans to receive funds. H.R. 7 requires states to develop highway safety improvement programs and state safety plans to receive HSIP funds. Plans must set safety goals, identify projects, and evaluate progress annually. Federal cost share remains at 90%. $8 billion over FY2013-FY2014 would be provided for CMAQ from the proposed alternative transportation account. Each state would receive guaranteed funding under the amended program. H.R. 7 would amend the CMAQ program to ensure each state receives a minimum 94% return in core program apportionments. It authorizes $15.6 billion over FY2013-FY2014, with a limit of $3.9 billion per year to fulfill the guarantee. The previous authorization under SAFETEA was for \"such sums as necessary.\" The estimated contract authority needed was $40.9 billion. The EB authorization was for \"such sums as necessary.\" The estimate at the time of passage was $40.9 billion in contract authority. If the $3.9 billion annual amount is insufficient to bring all states up to 94%, the STP authorization would be decreased to provide the needed additional funds. The Senate bill, Section 1107, would clarify eligibility criteria regarding roads and bridges damaged by natural disasters or catastrophic failures from an external cause. Roads already closed to traffic or already scheduled for the construction phase in the approved statewide transportation improvement plan at the time of the disaster would not be eligible for ER funds. It would also reiterate that ER funds can only be. The $100 million ceiling on a single natural disaster or catastrophic failure in a state would be eliminated. Section 1506 allows adjustment of the 180-day emergency period for federal government to pay 100% of repair costs due to lack of access to damaged facilities. The Secretary of Transportation may allow 100% federal share if repair costs exceed. The Secretary of Transportation may allow 100% federal share for repair costs exceeding the annual state apportionment under 23 U.S.C. 104. \"Comparable facility\" is defined in H.R. 7, Section 1111, as meeting current geometric and construction standards for traffic volume. Debris removal costs reimbursement is limited to expenses not covered by the Stafford Act, with U.S. territories capped at $20 million. Debris removal costs are limited to expenses not covered by the Stafford Act, with U.S. territories capped at $20 million. Assistance requires an emergency declaration by the governor or President, with states needing to provide project lists and costs within two years. ER funding is allowed for federal lands highways and tribal roads, even if not on the federal-aid highway system. Senate bill Section 1116 would restructure Federal Lands Highways Programs. The Senate bill Section 1116 proposes to restructure the Federal Lands Highways Programs by creating the Federal Lands and Tribal Transportation Program. This new program includes the Tribal Transportation Program, the Federal Lands Transportation Program, and the Federal Lands Access Program. The Tribal Transportation Program would be funded at $450 million annually, while other federal lands programs would receive $550 million annually. Changes in the Tribal Transportation Program include a new formula for distributing funds based on road mileage and tribal population. The Tribal Transportation Program and Federal Lands Access Program funding are allocated based on road mileage, tribal population, federal land amount, recreational visitors, federal road miles, and federally owned bridges. H.R. 7 authorizes $465 million annually for the Tribal Transportation Program and $535 million annually for the Federal Lands Transportation Program for FY2013-FY2016. The Senate bill combines the Puerto Rico and Territorial Highway programs, funding them at $180 million. The Senate bill combines the Puerto Rico and Territorial Highway programs, funding them at $180 million annually for FY2012 and FY2013. Puerto Rico would receive a 75% per year set-aside, or $135 million annually, with specific program eligibilities. H.R. 7 retains the Puerto Rico Highway Program and authorizes it at $150 million annually. The NHPP allocates funds for various highway purposes, including the Puerto Rico Highway Program and the Territorial Highway Program. H.R. 7 authorizes $150 million annually for Puerto Rico and $50 million annually for the Territories from the alternative transportation account. The Senate bill incorporates the ADHS into the Transportation Mobility Program and increases the federal share for constructing highways on the Appalachian Development Highway System to 95%. H.R. 7 proposes to raise the federal share for constructing highways on the Appalachian Development Highway System to 95% under certain conditions. The program would be authorized at $470 million per year for FY2013-FY2016, with funds available until expended. States can use toll credits for the local matching share. Funds would be apportioned based on the latest cost estimate, with no state receiving less than 1% and no state receiving more than 25%. The Senate bill establishes a similar program. The Senate bill, Section 1118, establishes a $1 billion discretionary program for high-cost surface transportation infrastructure projects in FY2013. Funds would be apportioned with no state receiving less than 1% and no state receiving more than 25%. The program aims to improve national and regional economic benefits, increase global competitiveness, reduce congestion, and enhance national energy security. The Senate bill, H.R. 4348 as amended by MAP-21, Section 1119, would create a general fund program for Ferries and Ferry Terminal Facilities, aiming to improve transportation safety and national energy security. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) is required to report on the selection process and justification for each project under H.R. 7. The Senate bill, H.R. 4348 as amended by MAP-21, Section 1119, proposes a general fund program for Ferries and Ferry Terminal Facilities. Funding distribution is based on passengers, vehicles, and route miles served by ferry systems. MAP-21 authorizes $67 million for each fiscal year. The House bill (H.R. 7, Section 1113) proposes funding of $67 million for each fiscal year FY2013-FY2016 for the Ferry Boat and Ferry Terminal Facilities Program under the Alternative Transportation Account. Funding distribution is based on passengers, vehicles, and route miles served by ferry systems. The House bill proposes funding of $67 million annually for the Ferry Boat and Ferry Terminal Facilities Program via the Alternative Transportation Account. Funds would be distributed based on vehicles, passengers, and route miles served by ferry systems. The House bill proposes funding of $67 million annually for the Ferry Boat and Ferry Terminal Facilities Program, distributed based on vehicles, passengers, and route miles served by ferry systems. Ferry boats and facilities on the National Highway System would also be eligible for formula funds. Additionally, the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act provides federal credit assistance for large transportation projects. MAP-21 proposes significant changes to the TIFIA program, including authorizing $1 billion annually from the highway trust fund to cover administrative and subsidy costs. Loans must be repaid with a dedicated revenue stream, typically a project-related user fee. MAP-21 proposes significant changes to the TIFIA program, authorizing $1 billion annually from the highway trust fund to cover administrative and subsidy costs. Administrative costs would be capped at 1% of this amount, leaving about $990 million for loan subsidy costs. This may allow DOT to make loans totaling $9.9 billion per year with an average subsidy cost of 10%. The proposal also includes increasing the share of project costs that TIFIA may provide from 33% to 49%, potentially reducing the share of nonfederal resources leveraged with federal loans. Additionally, credit assistance could be provided for a program of projects secured by a common security pledge through a \"master credit agreement.\" The TIFIA program under MAP-21 proposes changes to allow credit assistance for a program of projects secured by a master credit agreement, rather than on a project-by-project basis. This change is sought by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority to accelerate financing for transit projects. The proposed threshold for eligible projects remains at $50 million, except for rural infrastructure projects, which would have a threshold of $25 million. MAP-21 proposes a $25 million threshold for rural infrastructure projects, defined as projects outside urbanized areas or connecting rural areas to cities with <250,000 inhabitants. Rural projects receive loans at half the Treasury rate and 10% of TIFIA funds are reserved for them. Currently, TIFIA project evaluation includes eight criteria. MAP-21 proposes changes to TIFIA funding, including abolishing project evaluation criteria and moving to a first-come, first-served basis. Projects can secure future credit assistance or pay their own credit subsidy. Unused TIFIA funds may be apportioned to states for transportation projects. H.R. 7 authorizes $1 billion annually for TIFIA from the highway trust fund, with funds available for administrative and subsidy costs. Administrative costs are capped at $3.250 million. The bill also allows for master credit agreements for credit assistance and eliminates evaluation criteria, providing assistance on a first-come, first-served basis. Unused TIFIA funds may be apportioned to states for transportation projects. H.R. 7 expands TIFIA assistance by removing evaluation criteria and providing assistance on a first-come, first-served basis. It maintains thresholds for non-ITS and ITS projects, adds thresholds for rural projects and master credit agreements, and increases federal assistance to 49%. The bill also proposes $750 million per year for state infrastructure banks. H.R. 7 proposes to raise federal assistance to 49% and authorize $750 million per year for state infrastructure banks. There is no separate federal freight transportation program in SAFETEA, with most funding provided through regular highway programs. The SAFETEA legislation focuses on supporting passenger and freight mobility, with most freight funding going to states through existing highway programs. There is limited funding specifically dedicated to freight improvements, leading to questions about the need for a more defined federal freight program. The Senate bill (MAP-21) addresses this issue. The federal government is considering funding freight improvements through a new dedicated program in the Senate bill (MAP-21), while the House bill (H.R. 7) includes provisions that impact freight transport. Both bills require the U.S. Department of Transportation to develop a national freight transport plan in consultation with stakeholders. The Senate bill (MAP-21) proposes a new core program to prioritize infrastructure segments critical to freight movement, known as the \"primary freight network\" (PFN), with input from shippers and carriers. Private-sector participation in financing transportation improvements, like expanding the TIFIA program, could enhance freight carriers and shippers' involvement in project planning and development. The Senate bill proposes a \"primary freight network\" (PFN) consisting of 27,000 centerline miles of existing roadways, prioritizing infrastructure critical to freight movement. States would be guided to allocate funds to the PFN before other freight-related infrastructure. The Secretary of Transportation could add up to 3,000 centerline miles based on future importance. The PFN could include an additional 3,000 centerline miles of roads based on future freight importance. States can designate \"critical rural freight corridors\" connecting to the PFN or Interstate System, with a maximum of 20% of funds allocated. These corridors, along with portions of the Interstate System and the PFN, form the \"national freight network (NFM).\" The national freight network (NFM) includes critical rural freight corridors, portions of the Interstate System, and the Primary Freight Network (PFN). States can use freight program funds on non-Interstate highways or transit projects to improve freight flows on nearby interstates. Up to 10% of funds can be used for freight rail or maritime projects if approved by the Secretary of Transportation. The Secretary of Transportation can approve funding for freight rail or maritime projects if they significantly improve freight flow and provide a better return than highway projects on the Primary Freight Network (PFN). Creating a specific funding program for freight movement and requiring states to develop performance measures will prioritize freight needs in project selection. The PFN, consisting of about 30,000 miles of highway, focuses funds on critical segments for freight movement. DOT estimates that on 4,700 miles of highway with high truck volume, trucks have to travel below optimal speeds. The Department of Transportation (DOT) aims to concentrate funds on critical segments for freight movement, particularly in urban interchanges where congestion is a major issue. With over 8,500 trucks per day, trucks often travel below the speed limit during rush hours on 4,700 miles of highways, and experience stop-and-go conditions on an additional 3,700 miles. States may be hesitant to address costly bottlenecks that primarily benefit trucks over local shippers. Programs like TIFIA, Projects of National and Regional Significance (PNRS), and CMAQ may be more suitable for addressing these issues. The Senate and House bills under MAP-21 focus on funding projects for freight transport, with the Senate bill requiring a study on truck size and weight limits. The House bill reallocates funds by reducing programs not relevant to shippers and terminating the transfer of federal gas taxes to the mass transit trust fund. The House bill reallocates funds by reducing programs not relevant to shippers and terminating the transfer of federal gas taxes to the mass transit trust fund. It seeks greater reliance on tolling for highway construction, opposed by trucking organizations preferring fuel tax increases. The bill also proposed increasing truck weight limits, but this was not approved by the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. The Transportation and Infrastructure Committee did not approve the addition of a sixth axle to increase truck weight limits. Instead, they approved a DOT study on the issue. H.R. 7 includes provisions for increasing the length of double trailers for LTL carriers to 33 feet, trailers for truckload carriers to 53 feet, and auto transporters to 80 feet. The bill also allows for a four-year pilot program in which up to three states can increase truck weights to 126,000 pounds on certain Interstate Highway segments. The bill proposes a four-year pilot program allowing up to three states to increase truck weights to 126,000 pounds on specific Interstate Highway segments. The committee report mentions coal transport in West Virginia and timber trucking in Minnesota as participants in this pilot. Additionally, a weight exemption for idle reduction equipment was raised from 400 pounds to 550 pounds. MAP-21 would bring significant changes to transportation planning requirements at various levels. MAP-21 proposes significant changes to transportation planning requirements, including the use of performance management with state and metropolitan planning required to include performance measures and targets. Specific performance measures would be developed by states and MPOs, with consequences for failing to meet targets. The consequences for failing to meet performance targets set by states and MPOs under MAP-21 are mild, requiring a remedial plan. The new National Freight Program would require a national freight strategic plan with quantifiable performance measures for freight movement on the primary network. Each state must set performance targets for freight movement to receive funding from the program. The Surface Transportation and Freight Policy Act under MAP-21 requires states to set performance targets for freight movement to receive funding from the new freight program. Failure to meet these targets would necessitate submitting a freight performance improvement plan to the Secretary of Transportation. Additionally, provisions include the establishment of a national surface transportation and freight policy and the development of a national surface transportation and freight strategic plan. The Surface Transportation and Freight Policy Act under MAP-21 requires states to set performance targets for freight movement to receive funding from the new freight program. Provisions include the establishment of a national surface transportation and freight policy and the development of a national surface transportation and freight strategic plan. Some provisions in the Act repeat or conflict with those in Division A, Title I, such as goals for reducing traffic fatalities and developing a national strategic freight plan. The Surface Transportation and Freight Policy Act under MAP-21 requires states to set performance targets for freight movement to receive funding from the new freight program. Provisions include the establishment of a national surface transportation and freight policy and the development of a national strategic freight plan. Section 1115 calls for a national strategic freight plan within three years, while Section 33003 calls for a national surface transportation and freight performance plan within two years. States must develop a risk-based asset management plan with performance targets and an investment strategy under the National Highway Performance Program. Non-compliant states must outline actions to achieve targets. The Surface Transportation and Freight Policy Act under MAP-21 requires states to set performance targets for freight movement to receive funding from the new freight program. States failing to make progress towards targets must submit action plans. The Secretary would establish minimum standards for pavement and bridge conditions on the Interstate System and NHS. States may need to redirect federal funds to improve facilities. State planning requirements remain, with the need for statewide transportation plans and improvement programs. The Surface Transportation and Freight Policy Act under MAP-21 requires states to set performance targets for freight movement to receive funding from the new freight program. States failing to make progress towards targets must submit action plans. State planning requirements would remain the same, with states still required to develop statewide transportation plans and improvement programs. However, there are changes in Section 1202 that would require statewide plans to incorporate metropolitan transportation plans and programs without change, as well as cooperate with nonmetropolitan areas. MAP-21 proposes a stronger requirement for nonmetropolitan areas in transportation planning, incorporating a performance-based approach with coordination of performance measures and targets. It also suggests creating two tiers of MPOs based on population size. MAP-21 proposes two tiers of MPOs based on population size, with Tier I for areas with 1 million or more people and Tier II for areas with less than 1 million. Each tier must meet minimum technical requirements, including performance-based planning and targets for Tier I MPOs. Regulations for these requirements must be issued within one year of enactment. Tier II MPOs will have requirements at the discretion of the Secretary, which may include performance measures. MAP-21 proposes two tiers of MPOs based on population size, with Tier I for areas with 1 million or more people and Tier II for areas with less than 1 million. Tier II MPOs will have requirements at the discretion of the Secretary, which may include performance measures and optional development of multiple scenarios. Both Tier I and Tier II MPOs are allowed to select projects from their TIPs in consultation with states, but must also have the concurrence of the facility owner. MAP-21 also proposes to require the designation of MPOs only in urbanized areas of 200,000 population or more. MAP-21 proposes to require the designation of MPOs only in urbanized areas of 200,000 population or more, up from 50,000 as required in current law. MPOs in areas below 200,000 could be designated by agreement between the governor and local officials, but must meet minimum technical requirements for Tier II MPOs. Existing MPOs in areas under 200,000 population may be terminated three years after regulations are promulgated for Tier II MPOs if not reaffirmed by the MPO and governor. The intent of MAP-21 seems to be consolidating metropolitan planning. H.R. 7, like MAP-21, aims to consolidate metropolitan planning within a single MPO in each urban region, but allows for multiple MPOs if deemed appropriate by the governor and existing MPO. It also includes provisions for national transportation planning and performance measurement, requiring a national strategic transportation plan to be developed by the DOT. H.R. 7 mandates the development of a national strategic transportation plan by the DOT, including projects of national significance from states. It also requires a national performance management system to track progress towards national performance goals for highway and public transportation systems. H.R. 7 mandates a national performance management system for transportation systems, including measures for congestion solutions at airports and freight rail corridors, as well as considerations for ports and waterways. States must report annually on progress towards meeting performance targets and identify projects of national significance in their long-range plans. H.R. 7 mandates a national performance management system for transportation systems, including measures for congestion solutions at airports, freight rail corridors, ports, and waterways. It also adds a requirement for planning to consider the role of intercity buses in reducing congestion, pollution, and energy consumption. Additionally, H.R. 7 proposes to increase the urbanized population threshold for the designation of a Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) in the metropolitan transportation planning process. H.R. 7 proposes to increase the urbanized population threshold for the designation of an MPO from 50,000 to 100,000. Existing MPOs in areas under 100,000 may continue unless the governor and localities agree to terminate the designation. The bill also adds a requirement for metropolitan planning to consider the role of intercity buses. Budgetary pressures have raised concerns about using transportation resources effectively. The federal government's role in project delivery is also a key consideration. The federal government's role in project delivery for transportation projects is a key consideration. Both House and Senate proposals aim to expedite project delivery by changing elements of the environmental review process. Activities within the process may start during the planning stage and conclude during preliminary engineering. During highway and transit project development, activities begin in the planning stage and end in the preliminary engineering and design stage. The process involves preparing documentation to identify and address project-related impacts on the environment, considering factors like economic benefits, and ensuring compliance with state, tribal, and federal requirements. Various environmental requirements may apply to transportation projects, such as obtaining permits from agencies like the Army Corps of Engineers or the U.S. Coast Guard. Activities may include mitigating project effects on historic sites and identifying alternatives to avoid adverse impacts on parks, wildlife refuges, or historic structures. Compliance with state, tribal, and federal regulations is essential. The NEPA requires federal agencies to assess environmental impacts before approving transportation projects. Approval from FHWA or FTA is needed before design, property acquisition, or construction can proceed. Coordination of environmental investigations and compliance with regulations is essential. The NEPA requires federal agencies to assess environmental impacts before approving transportation projects. Approval from FHWA or FTA is necessary before design, property acquisition, or construction can proceed. Coordination of environmental investigations and compliance with regulations is crucial. DOT policy mandates that all environmental investigations, reviews, and consultations be coordinated as a single process, with compliance reflected in the NEPA document. The distinction between NEPA requirements and those identified during the compliance process may be blurred, impacting project delays and solutions for expediting the environmental review process. Legislative efforts under SAFETEA and TEA-21 aim to expedite environmental reviews. Recent legislative efforts under SAFETEA and TEA-21 focused on expediting environmental reviews for major transportation projects, particularly in relation to NEPA compliance. The proposed provisions in H.R. 7 and MAP-21 also aim to streamline the environmental review process for highway and transit projects, with the House proposal suggesting more significant changes than MAP-21. These changes are intended to accelerate project delivery by modifying existing environmental compliance requirements. The provisions in H.R. 7 and MAP-21 aim to expedite highway and transit project delivery by modifying environmental compliance requirements. The changes may either accelerate environmental reviews and project delivery or potentially slow them down by removing coordination mechanisms or adding requirements. These provisions specifically apply to the environmental review phase of transportation project development. The environment-related provisions in MAP-21 focus on the environmental review phase of transportation project development, ensuring compliance with state, tribal, and federal environmental requirements, including NEPA. FHWA or FTA must confirm completion of the environmental review process before project activities like property acquisition or construction can proceed under NEPA regulations. Before property acquisition or construction can proceed for transportation projects, the environmental review process must be completed by FHWA or FTA to comply with NEPA regulations. This process includes determining if a project may significantly impact the environment, with projects that do not having significant impacts being categorically excluded from preparing an environmental impact statement or assessment. Since 1998, about 90% of highway projects approved annually by FHWA were processed as categorical exclusions (CEs), while approximately 6% required an environmental assessment (EA). These projects, deemed to have no significant environmental impact under NEPA, may still need to comply with other environmental laws such as the National Historic Preservation Act, Clean Water Act, and Endangered Species Act. The most significant changes in the environmental review process under MAP-21 involve new requirements for issue resolution and accelerated decision-making. These changes aim to ensure all parties meet project deadlines and resolve disputes efficiently. The provisions in MAP-21 aim to establish criteria for timely completion of the environmental review process and resolution of disputes that could cause delays or denials of project approvals. Financial transfer provisions would apply if an agency fails to issue required permits, with penalties of $10,000 or $20,000 per week for delays. The office of the agency head responsible for delays must transfer $10,000 or $20,000 weekly to divisions handling permit decisions. Transfers are required 180 days after a complete application or final project decision under NEPA, unless the delay is not the agency's fault. Various agencies, such as EPA or U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, issue approvals for DOT projects. The approval process for transportation projects involves agencies like EPA, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, or U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Delays in issuing permits can be due to under-staffing or lack of funds. Limited agency funds may need to be redirected to expedite project approvals. The approval process for transportation projects can be delayed due to under-staffing or lack of funds. Redirecting limited agency funds to expedite one project may slow down other applications. MAP-21 requires DOT to compare completion times of projects initiated before and after 2005. The DOT is required by MAP-21 to compare completion times of transportation projects initiated before and after 2005, including CEs, EAs, and EISs. Reporting to Congress is mandated within one year of enactment, with no specific funding allocated for assessments. Determining the time needed for NEPA documents completion, especially for EISs, may pose challenges as accurate data is lacking, particularly for projects processed with EAs or CEs by State DOTs. The DOT is required by MAP-21 to compare completion times of transportation projects initiated before and after 2005, including CEs, EAs, and EISs. Little data is available for projects processed with EAs or CEs, and State DOTs do not track the time for NEPA compliance. Extracting accurate information about NEPA process completion times may be challenging. Congress may require states to track and report this information to DOT. The DOT may require states to track and report NEPA process completion times to meet Congress's directive. This would be an addition to the existing environmental clearance process under MAP-21 provisions, specifically focusing on Programmatic Agreements and Additional Categorical Exclusions. DOT would survey state agencies for new CE suggestions and update regulatory requirements accordingly. The DOT would be required to promulgate regulations adding projects to the existing list of Categorical Exclusions (CEs) based on new suggestions. Additionally, specific projects currently requiring documentation and approval would be moved to a list where no additional DOT approval is needed. Other provisions specify DOT agency roles in NEPA compliance for multimodal projects and criteria for projects within existing highway right-of-ways. The DOT would be required to promulgate regulations specifying criteria for projects within existing highway right-of-ways. Assistance to Affected State and Federal Agencies would authorize federal transportation funds for dedicated staff to expedite transportation project planning and delivery. The section outlines requirements for receiving DOT funding for transportation projects, including the need for a memorandum of understanding between the agency and the state. It also allows states to use funds for attorneys' fees related to eligible activities and proposes making the Surface Transportation Project Delivery Program permanent. The Surface Transportation Project Delivery Program, outlined in \u00a71307, would become permanent, allowing any state to take on federal responsibilities for environmental reviews. DOT would assess states' ability to participate. Additional provisions in MAP-21 emphasize Congress's focus on certain activities and clarify existing ones. The House bill under MAP-21's Subtitle C identifies key activities important to Congress, reinforces DOT's current implementation efforts, and clarifies NEPA compliance requirements. Provisions in Title III and Subtitle C of the bill extensively change NEPA requirements for environmental review processes in federal-aid highways and rail programs. Title VIII, Railroads in H.R. 7 proposes significant changes to NEPA requirements for federal highway and transit projects. NEPA would no longer apply to projects costing less than $10 million or with federal funding below 15% of total costs. The bill would alter the NEPA compliance process by changing project alternatives, document formats, and evaluation levels. The House bill proposes changes to NEPA requirements for federal highway and transit projects, including altering project alternatives, document formats, and evaluation levels. It also sets specific timeframes for permits, a 270-day deadline for environmental review, and limits on judicial review and legal sufficiency standards. Additionally, the bill amends requirements for parks, wildlife refuges, recreation areas, and historic sites. The House proposal includes significant amendments to requirements for parks, wildlife refuges, recreation areas, and historic sites. The Senate has agreed to substitute the language of MAP-21 for the House-passed language of H.R. 4348 and called for a conference with the House. The inclusion of H.R. 7 streamlining provisions in H.R. 4348 ensures they will not be challenged as out of scope. The House streamlining provisions in MAP-21 will not be challenged as out of scope. MAP-21 introduces changes to allow state DOTs to enter into CM/GC contracts, which combine design and construction responsibilities. The House streamlining provisions in MAP-21 introduce changes to allow state DOTs to enter into CM/GC contracts, combining design and construction responsibilities. This method involves a single contractor handling all design and construction work, accelerating project delivery by starting construction tasks before design work is complete. H.R. 7 also provides specific authority for state DOTs to enter into CM/GC contracts. H.R. 7 allows state DOTs to enter into CM/GC contracts, combining design and construction responsibilities. MAP-21 increases federal funding share by 5% for highway projects using innovative delivery methods or technology. Examples include prefabricated bridge elements and digital modeling technologies. MAP-21 includes innovations like prefabricated bridge elements, digital modeling technologies, and alternative contracting methods. It also introduces a pilot program for advance payment of moving costs for those affected by highway projects, limited to five states. The \"Alternative Relocation Payment Demonstration Program\" allows advance payments for moving costs for those affected by highway projects. This program aims to expedite the removal of people from project right-of-ways, but it is a minor change compared to other proposed alternatives for property acquisition and relocation laws. State transportation officials have suggested allowing states to use their own laws if they meet federal requirements. Under Section 1113 of MAP-21, states can use their own property acquisition and relocation laws if they meet federal requirements. The CMAQ program, established to reduce transportation-related pollutants, may be re-written. The EPA sets air quality standards, including NAAQS for ozone and carbon monoxide. The CMAQ program provides funds for projects in areas that do not meet National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for pollutants like ozone, carbon monoxide, and particulate matter. Areas that meet or exceed NAAQS are in \"attainment,\" while those that do not are in \"nonattainment.\" Maintenance areas were previously in nonattainment but are now attaining NAAQS with a maintenance plan. The CMAQ program provides funds for projects in nonattainment and maintenance areas to meet NAAQS. Proposed amendments would change funding levels and distribution within states based on population. The CMAQ program funding levels are determined by Congress based on state population and pollution levels. MAP-21's CMAQ apportionment for FYs 2012 and 2013 is tied to previous funding amounts plus a percentage of STP funds. Funds are distributed within each state based on specific limitations. The CMAQ program funding levels are determined by Congress based on state population and pollution levels. MAP-21's CMAQ apportionment for FYs 2012 and 2013 is tied to previous funding amounts plus a percentage of STP funds. States would be required to reserve a portion of the CMAQ funds for specific transportation projects and activities. The CMAQ program funds projects for transportation choices like pedestrian and bicycle facilities. Half of the funds are suballocated based on state-approved formulas weighted by population and pollution severity in nonattainment areas. The CMAQ program funds transportation projects based on population and pollution severity in nonattainment areas. Suballocated funds must be used for fine particulate areas and low-emissions equipment. Remaining funds can be used for eligible projects in any nonattainment areas, including those in attainment for NAAQS. The CMAQ program funds transportation projects in nonattainment areas based on population and pollution severity. States in attainment for NAAQS can also use funds for eligible projects. Proposed provisions in MAP-21 may change program implementation, including prioritizing projects to reduce pollutants like PM 2.5 and developing cost-effectiveness tables. Proposed provisions in MAP-21 aim to enhance the CMAQ program by requiring the development of cost-effectiveness tables for various projects. MPOs would have the option to conduct technical assessments to demonstrate emissions reductions and prepare performance plans for CMAQ-funded projects. The House bill includes provisions to amend CMAQ program requirements, specifically project eligibility requirements under 23 U.S.C. \u00a7149(b). Current laws offer incentives for alternative fuels and advanced technology vehicles, such as tax credits for plug-in vehicles and biofuels from cellulose. Incentives for alternative fuels and advanced technology vehicles include tax credits for plug-in vehicles and biofuels from cellulose. Non-tax incentives under the CAFE program and various highway programs also provide benefits. The CAFE program and highway programs offer non-tax incentives for alternative fuels and advanced technology vehicles. These incentives include allowing low-emission vehicles in HOV lanes, with proposed extensions in legislation like H.R. 7 and MAP-21. However, these bills also propose limitations on exemptions if HOV lanes become degraded. Under current law, states must limit exemptions for vehicles causing degradation in HOV lanes. Proposed legislation like H.R. 7 and MAP-21 aim to address degradation by restricting access regardless of the cause. These bills also support the expansion of electric vehicle infrastructure by allowing highway funds to be used for new charging stations at parking facilities. MAP-21 would also amend the Clean Fuels Grant Program to provide grants for purchasing alternative fuels and advanced diesel. MAP-21 would amend the Clean Fuels Grant Program to include grants for purchasing alternative fuel vehicles, with a focus on clean fuel buses and facilities. It would also incorporate \"zero emission buses\" into the program. H.R. 7 does not have similar provisions. The Senate's public transit provisions in MAP-21 authorize $10.458 billion for the Federal Public Transportation Act of 2012. The Senate's public transit provisions in MAP-21 authorize $10.458 billion annually for federal transit programs, with funding from the mass transit account of the highway trust fund and the general fund. H.R. 7 would rename the mass transit account as the alternative transportation account and authorize $10.458 billion for FY2012 and $10.498 billion for FY2013 through FY2016. H.R. 7 renames the mass transit account to the alternative transportation account and authorizes $10.458 billion annually for FY2012 and $10.498 billion for FY2013 through FY2016. The bill eliminates the use of motor fuel taxes for mass transit and transfers revenue to the highway account. $40 billion from the general fund is transferred to the alternative transportation account in place of fuel tax revenue. The FPTA in MAP-21 restructures the federal transit program, including the Fixed Guideway (Rail) program. The FPTA in MAP-21 restructures the federal transit program by replacing the existing Fixed Guideway (Rail) Modernization Program with a new State of Good Repair (SGR) Grant Program. This proposed program includes a High Intensity Fixed Guideway SGR Formula Program that distributes funding for the maintenance, repair, and replacement of fixed guideway public transit systems that are at least seven years old. The Fixed Guideway SGR Grant Program would distribute competitive grants for the upkeep of fixed guideway systems, funded by the general fund. The High Intensity Motorbus SGR program would distribute funds for public transportation on facilities with access for high-occupancy vehicles, funded by the mass transit account of the highway trust fund. The Intensity Motorbus SGR program distributes funds for public transportation on facilities accessible to high-occupancy vehicles, at least seven years old. Funding comes from the mass transit account and is distributed based on motor bus vehicle miles and route miles. The Bus and Bus Facilities SGR program provides competitive grants for bus upkeep, with $75 million set aside from the New Starts program. The FPTA eliminates the heavily earmarked discretionary Bus and Bus-Related Facilities program. The FPTA proposes significant changes, including the elimination of the heavily earmarked discretionary Bus and Bus-Related Facilities program. Funding from this program would be added to other formula programs. Additionally, the Formula Grants for Elderly Individuals and Individuals with Disabilities Program and the New Freedom Program would be combined into a single program called Formula Grants for Enhanced Mobility of Seniors and Individuals with Disabilities. The Senate bill proposes combining the Formula Grants for Elderly Individuals and Individuals with Disabilities Program and the New Freedom Program into a single program called Formula Grants for Enhanced Mobility of Seniors and Individuals with Disabilities. The Jobs Access and Reverse Commute program would be shifted to the Urbanized and Non-Urbanized Area Formula programs. Recipients would need to allocate at least 3% of their Urbanized Area apportionments to projects aiding low-income individuals in commuting to work. Additionally, two new programs similar to existing highway programs would be created. The Senate bill proposes combining programs for elderly individuals and individuals with disabilities into a new program for enhanced mobility. It also includes new programs for public transportation assistance and emergency relief, with funds allocated for transit on Indian reservations. The House bill (H.R. 7) proposes doubling the amount set aside for transit on Indian reservations from $15 million to $30 million annually. It eliminates some programs like the Clean Fuels Grant Program and combines others into a single program. H.R. 7 eliminates the Clean Fuels Grant Program, the Transit in Parks Program, and the Growing and High Density State Formula. It combines the New Freedom Program, the Elderly Persons and Persons with Disabilities Program, and the Jobs Access and Reverse Commute Program into a single program. Funding for the Bus and Bus-Related Facilities Program would be distributed by formula, unlike in SAFETEA where it was a heavily earmarked discretionary program. Funding would only go to providers of bus transit in urbanized areas that do not provide heavy rail, commuter rail, or light rail. H.R. 7 proposes changes to transit funding, including incentives for contracting out bus services and allowing private intercity operators access to federally funded facilities. H.R. 7 proposes changes to transit funding, including incentives for contracting out bus services and allowing private intercity operators access to federally funded facilities. The Senate bill would make substantial changes to the New Starts program, allowing funds for core capacity improvement projects and simplifying the process to three stages: project development, engineering, and construction. The New Starts program is being changed to have three stages: project development, engineering, and construction. Applicants must apply to the Secretary of Transportation to enter the project development phase and start the NEPA process. The bill would remove the separate alternatives analysis currently required by law and require project sponsors to provide information for project justification and local financial commitment during project development. During project development, the project sponsor must provide information for project justification and local financial commitment to the Secretary. The project can enter the Engineering Phase after the NEPA process is completed with a ROD, FONSI, or Categorical Exclusion, and is selected as the locally preferred alternative. If successful, the project can then enter into a full funding grant agreement. The project is adopted into the metropolitan plan and justified on its merits. If successful, it can enter into a full funding grant agreement with the Secretary for federal funding assistance and move into the construction phase. The Senate bill aims to advance projects more quickly using special warrants for projects with federal shares of $100 million or less. It would eliminate the Small Starts program for projects requesting $75 million or less in federal assistance. Additionally, a pilot program for expedited project delivery would be created. The House bill (H.R. 7) proposes funding for projects requesting $75 million or less in federal assistance and costing $250 million or less. It includes a pilot program for expedited project delivery for certain fixed guideway capital projects. The bill also makes changes to the New Starts program, maintaining the distinction between New Starts and Small Starts projects. $150 million is allocated for New Starts projects in the House bill. The House bill (H.R. 7) maintains the distinction between New Starts and Small Starts projects, allocating $150 million for Small Starts. It eliminates the alternatives analysis but requires evaluation against a no-action alternative. H.R. 7 includes provisions for expediting projects, such as using special warrants for new urban circulator service. Project justification criteria are also modified, dropping costs of sprawl. H.R. 7 would change project justification criteria by adding private contributions and intermodal connectivity as factors. It maintains the prohibition on federal funds for operating expenses in urbanized areas over 200,000 people but adds exceptions. The bill H.R. 7 prohibits federal funds for operating expenses in urbanized areas with over 200,000 people, but allows exceptions for small bus transit systems. Urbanized areas with high unemployment rates can use up to 25% of their Urbanized Area apportionments for operating expenses for up to three years. The House bill (H.R. 7) allows urbanized areas with high unemployment rates and over 200,000 people to use federal funds for operating expenses for up to three years. Transit bus systems with 100 buses or fewer in peak service can also use federal funding for operating expenses. The House bill (H.R. 7) allows urbanized areas with high unemployment rates and over 200,000 people to use federal funds for operating expenses for up to three years. Transit systems with 100 buses or fewer in peak service can use federal funding for operating expenses, with varying cost shares based on the number of buses operated. Additionally, H.R. 7 would increase the share of funds for Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) paratransit from 10% to 15% for both urbanized and nonurbanized areas. The Senate and House bills propose increasing the share of funds for Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) paratransit from 10% to 15%. They also call for the development of a national rail plan to guide future investments and regional rail plans to refine the national plan for each region, excluding the Amtrak-owned Northeast Corridor (NEC). The bill proposes developing regional rail plans, excluding the Amtrak-owned Northeast Corridor, to refine the national plan for each region. States may also create state rail plans to further refine the regional plan. The plans are relevant for federal capital grants for intercity passenger service. Amendments are made to the NEC advisory commission, and Amtrak is required to submit a new plan for high-speed service. The bill proposes creating a commission to oversee high-speed rail service plans, including measuring train delays and conducting data assessments for intercity passenger rail. It also mandates reporting on track access arrangements and dispute resolution processes within two years. The bill requires DOT to survey and report on track access arrangements for intercity passenger rail on other railroads' tracks and resolve disputes. It also aims to develop a standardized equipment pool for corridor intercity passenger services and includes Amtrak as an eligible recipient for capital grants. The bill aims to establish a standardized equipment pool for corridor passenger service, including Amtrak as an eligible recipient. This initiative seeks to achieve economies of scale in car production and maintenance but may hinder innovation in car design. Federal regulations mandate that passenger cars in the U.S. be designed to limit damage in collisions, setting them apart from foreign rail systems that prioritize crash avoidance over crash survival. The U.S. mandates passenger cars to limit damage in collisions, making them heavier than foreign cars. Positive train control may align U.S. requirements with foreign ones, potentially opening a global market. H.R. 7 would repeal the congestion grant program for high-priority rail corridors. H.R. 7 would repeal the congestion grant program for high-priority rail corridors and reduce funding for Amtrak's operating assistance grants. H.R. 7 would amend the law on food and beverage service on Amtrak trains, repealing the self-supporting requirement and requiring the Federal Railroad Administration to oversee the provision of food. H.R. 7 would repeal the self-supporting requirement for food and beverage service on Amtrak trains, require competitive bidding for the service provision, and allow subsidies only if a net loss is anticipated. Additionally, it would expand a federal grant program to include the relocation of roads affected by railroad line relocations. The Senate bill proposes changes to the Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing (RRIF) Program, allowing state or local subsidies as collateral and expanding eligible uses of a RRIF loan. It also includes modest changes to laws governing the Surface Transportation Board (STB), raising the ceiling on freight charges. The bill proposes changes to laws governing the Surface Transportation Board (STB), raising the maximum total dollar value of freight charges that shippers can bring before the STB. It also imposes shorter procedural deadlines for rate relief cases and requires the STB to study incorporating railroad asset replacement costs in its annual examination of railroad revenue. The bill, H.R. 7, proposes changes to the Surface Transportation Board (STB) laws, including raising the maximum total dollar value of freight charges for shippers. It also requires the STB to study incorporating railroad asset replacement costs in its annual revenue examination and mandates reporting of railroad service complaints on the agency's website. Additionally, the bill repeals a capital grant program for smaller freight railroads and includes provisions to improve access to the RRIF loan program. The bill includes provisions to improve access to the RRIF loan program and mandates the installation of positive train control (PTC) on passenger and freight railroads to prevent accidents caused by human error. Railroads have raised concerns about the high cost of implementing PTC for rare accidents involving toxic-by-inhalation products. The Senate bill allows for an extension of the deadline for implementing positive train control (PTC) technology beyond December 31, 2015, if deemed infeasible by a railroad. It also makes PTC implementation eligible for RRIF funding and requires a joint study on spectrum needs for PTC. The Senate bill extends the deadline for implementing Positive Train Control (PTC) technology and allows for RRIF funding. The House bill (H.R. 7) extends the PTC deadline to 2021 for passenger routes and eliminates it for routes carrying certain chemicals. Highway safety programs fall under the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The Senate bill would retain existing NHTSA grant programs and create an incentive grant program to discourage texting while driving and cell phone use by drivers under 18. It would also increase civil penalties for vehicle safety violations and require event data recorders in passenger vehicles starting in 2015. The House bill, H.R. 7, proposes consolidating NHTSA grant programs into one general highway safety grant program with reduced funding. It would also prohibit federal funding for measuring motorcycle helmet usage and creating motorcyclist checkpoints. In contrast, the Senate bill authorizes higher highway safety grants for FY2012 and FY2013. The Senate bill authorizes higher highway safety grants for FY2012 and FY2013 compared to the House bill. Both bills aim to create a clearinghouse for drug and alcohol test results by commercial drivers and strengthen DOT's actions against \"reincarnated carriers.\" They also provide similar funding levels for truck safety grants to states in FY2013. The two bills provide similar levels of funding for truck safety grants to states in FY2013. The transit safety section in MAP-21 is similar to a proposal made by the Administration in 2009 and the Public Transportation Safety Act of 2010. It would authorize DOT to set standards for transit agency operations. The Public Transportation Safety Act of 2010 (S. 3638) authorizes DOT to establish and enforce safety standards for rail transit systems, create a safety certification program, and ensure state safety oversight agencies are financially independent from transit systems they oversee. H.R. 7 aims to ensure that state safety oversight agencies overseeing transit systems are financially independent. It would provide grants to states for this purpose and require funds to be spent on safety and state of good repair projects. DOT would certify oversight organizations for technical capacity and authority. The proposed legislation would authorize funding for state safety oversight organizations and transportation research. It includes financial assistance for oversight organizations and a technology deployment program. Both bills also allow for prize competitions to promote surface transportation. The proposed legislation includes funding for state safety oversight organizations, transportation research, and a technology deployment program. Both bills authorize prize competitions to promote surface transportation innovations and direct studies on various transportation aspects. MAP-21 would award 35 grants annually to university transportation centers, while H.R. 7 would award 30 grants. H.R. 7 and MAP-21 authorize grants for transportation research. Both bills emphasize the need to fully spend revenues from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund on waterside infrastructure maintenance. H.R. 4348 includes a provision to match budgetary resources with fund receipts. The provision in H.R. 4348 would require budgetary resources to match receipts from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund for harbor maintenance programs."
