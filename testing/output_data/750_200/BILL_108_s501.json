    "content": "The \"Gifted and Talented Students Education Act of 2003\" establishes a grant program for gifted and talented students under Chapter B. This program includes authorized activities for supporting these students. The \"Gifted and Talented Students Education Act of 2003\" recognizes that gifted and talented students require specialized services to fully develop their capabilities, regardless of cultural, racial, or socioeconomic background. Some of these students may have disabilities or English as a second language, and many come from historically underrepresented groups. Elementary school students who are gifted and talented have already mastered a significant portion of the material covered in a school year before it begins. Teachers receive training to meet the diverse needs of students in their classrooms. Most teachers receive training to meet the needs of diverse students, including those with limited English proficiency, disabilities, and from various cultural backgrounds. However, they often lack training to support gifted and talented students, who may not have access to private programs like some of their peers. Gifted education programs in public schools are crucial for high-ability students, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds. Parents and families play a vital role in supporting the educational and emotional needs of gifted children. The curr_chunk discusses the lack of federal requirements to identify and serve gifted students, with varying resources and support at the state and local levels. The lack of federal requirements to identify and serve gifted students leads to varying resources and support at the state and local levels, resulting in disparities in services for this special-needs population. It is crucial for more students to achieve higher levels of education to meet future economic and national security needs, especially for highly capable students who need education that prepares them for innovative and creative work. The performance of twelfth-grade advanced students in the United States on international assessments was among the lowest in the world in physics and mathematics. In 1990, only a small fraction of education spending in the US went towards elementary and secondary education. In 1990, a minimal amount of funding was allocated for challenging programs for gifted students in the US.
