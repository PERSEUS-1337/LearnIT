    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 34171 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to define terms related to administrative budget and administrative cost allowance for successor agencies. The administrative cost allowance for successor agencies is set at 5% of property tax for the period January 1, 2012, through June 30, 2012, and up to 3% for each fiscal year ending on June 30, 2016. The allowance cannot be less than $250,000 unless reduced by the oversight board or by agreement with the successor agency. Starting July 1, 2016, the administrative cost allowance for successor agencies is up to 3% of the property tax distributed by the county auditor-controller in the previous fiscal year. The allowance cannot be less than $250,000 unless reduced by the oversight board. The administrative cost allowance for successor agencies is up to 3% of the property tax distributed by the county auditor-controller in the previous fiscal year, with a minimum of $250,000 unless reduced by the oversight board or by agreement with the department. Starting July 1, 2016, a successor agency's annual administrative costs cannot exceed 50% of the total Redevelopment Property Tax Trust Fund distributed to pay enforceable obligations in the previous fiscal year. This limit applies to administrative costs regardless of whether they are paid within the administrative cost allowance or not, but excludes costs paid from bond proceeds or grant funds. Starting July 1, 2016, a successor agency's annual administrative costs cannot exceed 50% of the total Redevelopment Property Tax Trust Fund distributed to pay enforceable obligations in the previous fiscal year. This limitation applies to administrative costs whether paid within the administrative cost allowance or not, but does not apply to costs paid from bond proceeds or grant funds. The oversight board approves the administrative cost allowance as the sole funding source for legal expenses related to civil actions. Employee costs for project implementation activities are not considered administrative costs. (c) \u201cDesignated local authority\u201d refers to a public entity established under Section 34173.\n(d) (1) \u201cEnforceable obligation\u201d includes specific criteria outlined in the legislation. Enforceable obligation refers to bonds issued by a former redevelopment agency, including required debt service and reserve set-asides. A reserve may be held when necessary for future bond payments. Loans borrowed by the redevelopment agency for lawful purposes must be repaid according to a required schedule. Payments to the federal government, preexisting state obligations, and obligations imposed by state law, including federal base reuse obligations for the former Norton Air Force Base, pass with a state water contractor agreement. Costs incurred for fulfilling collective bargaining agreements for layoffs or terminations of city employees who worked directly for the former redevelopment agency are considered enforceable obligations payable from property tax funds. These obligations to employees will remain enforceable and payable from property tax funds, excluding passthrough payments made by the county auditor-controller and legally required payments related to employee benefits. The obligations to employees from the former redevelopment agency are enforceable and payable from property tax funds, even if the employee is transferred to the entity taking over housing functions. The successor agency must reimburse the housing entity for any employee obligation costs. The oversight board, along with the successor agency, has the authority to appeal judgments or set aside settlements against the former redevelopment agency. Any legally binding agreement or contract can be terminated by the successor agency or oversight board with compensation. Titles or headings in a document do not determine enforceable obligations. Contracts or agreements necessary for the administration or operation of the successor agency, including litigation expenses, settlements, office space, equipment, supplies, and insurance costs, must comply with specified sections. Legal expenses related to civil actions challenging the validity of certain parts shall only be incurred after January 1, 2016. Legal expenses related to civil actions challenging the validity of certain parts shall only be payable out of the administrative cost allowance. A sponsoring entity may provide funds to a successor agency for legal expenses related to civil actions challenging the validity of certain parts. If the successor agency succeeds in the action, the funds provided for legal expenses shall be repaid under specified terms. The funds provided by the sponsoring entity to a successor agency for legal expenses may be considered a grant if the agency does not receive a final judicial determination granting relief, and will not qualify for repayment as an enforceable obligation. Repayments owed to the Low and Moderate Income Housing Fund of a redevelopment agency must be approved by the oversight board and transferred to the Low and Moderate Income Housing Asset Fund for affordable housing purposes. The \"enforceable obligation\" for redevelopment agencies does not include agreements between the city and the former agency, except for written agreements related to indebtedness obligations issued by December 31, 2010, or for refunding or refinancing by June 27, 2011. Loan agreements and written agreements entered into at the time of issuance, but no later than June 27, 2011, for the purpose of refunding or refinancing prior indebtedness obligations may be considered enforceable obligations. Additionally, agreements between the redevelopment agency and the city, county, or city and county created within two years of the agency's establishment may also be deemed enforceable obligations. Agreements entered into by the redevelopment agency within two years of its creation may be enforceable obligations. Agreements related to state highway infrastructure improvements committed by the agency prior to June 28, 2011, are also considered enforceable obligations. Additionally, agreements requiring the former redevelopment agency to repay loans or fulfill development obligations are enforceable. The former redevelopment agency must repay loans or fulfill development obligations imposed by federal agencies like the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. Contracts or agreements between the former redevelopment agency and other public agencies outside of redevelopment project areas that were not properly authorized shall be void, except for housing-related contracts authorized under Part 1. The curr_chunk defines \"Indebtedness obligations\" as debt instruments issued to finance redevelopment projects, \"Oversight board\" as entities established by Section 34179, and \"Recognized obligation\" as obligations listed in the Recognized Obligation Payment Schedule. The curr_chunk further defines \"Oversight board\" as entities established by Section 34179 and \"Recognized obligation\" as obligations listed in the Recognized Obligation Payment Schedule, which outlines payment amounts and due dates for enforceable obligations. The curr_chunk defines \"School entity\" as entities defined in the Revenue and Taxation Code, \"Successor agency\" as the entity succeeding the former redevelopment agency, \"Taxing entities\" as entities receiving property tax payments, and \"Property taxes\" as all property tax revenues. The curr_chunk further defines \"Department\" as the Department of Finance, \"Sponsoring entity\" as the entity authorizing the redevelopment agency, and \"Final judicial determination\" as a conclusive court decision. The housing entity administrative cost allowance is up to 1% of property tax allocated to the Redevelopment Obligation Retirement Fund from July 1, 2014, to July 1, 2018, with a minimum of $150,000 per fiscal year. The housing entity administrative cost allowance, up to 1% of property tax allocated to the Redevelopment Obligation Retirement Fund, shall be remitted by the successor agency to the local housing authority that assumed the housing functions of the former redevelopment agency. If there are insufficient funds in the Redevelopment Obligations Retirement Fund, the unpaid amount can be carried over to future payment schedules without a time limit."
