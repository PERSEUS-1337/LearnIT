    "content": "President Bush signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 (H.R. 2673; P.L. 108-199) on January 23, 2004, which included funding for transportation and election reform projects. The Act also included an across-the-board rescission of 0.59% and a total of $89.8 billion in appropriations. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 included an additional $1.1 billion in funding for transportation and election reform projects. Congress passed a continuing resolution for FY2004 funding, extending funding for programs to January 31, 2004. The Senate passed its version of the FY2004 Transportation, Treasury, and Independent Agencies Appropriation bill with a recommended $91.0 billion, $5.1 billion more than requested by the Administration. The major change was an extra $4.5 billion in highway funding. The FY2004 Transportation, Treasury, and Independent Agencies Appropriation bill passed by the House of Representatives provided $85.8 billion, including an additional $4.4 billion in highway funding. The bill also deleted $3.4 billion for grants-in-aid to airports due to a point of order against funding administrative expenses from contract authority. The FY2004 Transportation, Treasury, and Independent Agencies Appropriation bill consolidated funding for DOT, Treasury, Postal Service, Executive Office of the President, and General Government provisions. This change was due to the creation of a new federal department. The FY2004 Transportation, Treasury, and Independent Agencies Appropriation bill consolidated funding for various government entities into a single appropriations bill. This change was a result of the creation of the Department of Homeland Security, which led to the reorganization of subcommittees in the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations. Key agencies like the United States Coast Guard and the Transportation Security Administration were transferred to the Department of Homeland Security as part of this reorganization. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was created in FY2004, leading to the transfer of key agencies like the United States Coast Guard, Transportation Security Administration, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, Customs Service, United States Secret Service, and Office of Homeland Security to DHS. Budget numbers were adjusted for comparison. The House and Senate divided their appropriation bills differently, with the Senate including the Postal Service under Independent Agencies title. The FY2003 Consolidated Appropriations Resolution included a 0.65% across-the-board rescission for the Department of Transportation and Department of the Treasury. The FY2003 figures in this report reflect the rescission, differing slightly from the figures in the resolution. The Administration's FY2004 budget request for the Departments of Transportation and Treasury, the Executive Office of the President, and Related. The Administration's FY2004 budget request for the Departments of Transportation and Treasury was $85.9 billion, $740 million below the final FY2003 figure. Funding allocation details are shown in Table 2. The House Committee on Appropriations and House Report 108-243 provided a Budget Authority table, excluding \"Senate Reported\" from the Senate Committee on Appropriations, S.Rept. 108-146. The Senate divides the budget differently from the House, placing the Postal Service under \"Related Agencies\" in the Senate report. The Postal Service appropriation has been subtracted from the Senate and Conference totals for Title V in the conference report table. The House deliberations on H.R. 2989 resulted in funding cuts for FAA's Grants-in-Aid to Airports program and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's Border Enforcement program, reducing total transportation funding in the bill from $58.4 billion to $54.9 billion and total funding in the bill from $89.3 billion to $85.8 billion. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 reduced total transportation funding in the bill from $58.4 billion to $54.9 billion, resulting in a drop in total funding from $89.3 billion to $85.8 billion. This includes an across-the-board rescission of 0.59%. Funding trends for transportation/treasury appropriations from FY1999-FY2004 are outlined in Table 3. Figures for Department of Transportation and Department of the Treasury appropriations from FY1999-FY2003 have been adjusted for comparison with FY2004 figures by subtracting specific agencies and adding others. The Department of Transportation and Department of the Treasury appropriations for FY1999-FY2003 were adjusted by subtracting specific agencies and adding others for comparison with FY2004 figures. This includes across-the-board rescissions in FY2001 and FY2003, as well as a rescission in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004. The Administration's FY2004 budget proposed a DOT budget of $54.3 billion, 2.6% below FY2003's enacted budget. The Administration's FY2004 budget proposed a DOT budget of $54.3 billion, which is 2.6% below FY2003's enacted budget. The budget request aligned with the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) and the Wendell Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act of the 21st Century (FAIR21 or AIR21), with some proposed changes to the highway and transit funding structure. The request proposed changes to the highway and transit funding structure in line with the Administration's reauthorization proposal. Figures in the Department of Transportation Appropriations table may differ slightly from the Administration's totals. The Committee on Appropriations noted discrepancies in totals compared to the Administration's figures due to differing treatment of offsets. During House deliberations on H.R. 2989, funding for FAA's Grants-in-Aid to Airports program and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's Border Enforcement program was struck on points of order, reducing the total. The House deliberations on H.R. 2989 resulted in a reduction of transportation funding by $3.425 billion for FAA's Grants-in-Aid to Airports program and $47 million for the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's Border Enforcement program. These amounts are in addition to the 0.65% rescission in P.L. 108-7 and do not include the 0.59% rescission in H.R. 2673. Funding for these programs may be restored in conference. The FY2004 funding for various transportation programs included $102 million for the Essential Air Service program, $187 million for the Appalachian Development Highway System, and additional grants for motor carrier safety activities. NHTSA's budget saw a $131 million difference from FY2003 due to funding transfers. The difference in budgetary resources available to NHTSA for FY2003 and FY2004 is $131 million, not $231 million. Congress postponed Amtrak's repayment of a $100 million loan from the DOT in FY2003 and would do so again in FY2004. The total resources for RSPA in FY2003 were $119 million, and in FY2004, it was $132 million, excluding $14 million in permanent appropriations. Rescissions of unobligated previous years' contract authority were subtracted from the total funding. The FAA received $13.93 billion in FY2004, a $440 million increase from FY2003. Rescissions of prior years' contract authority do not impact the current fiscal year's budgetary resources. Total resources available for FY2003 enacted were $55.9 billion. In FY2004, the FAA received a $440 million increase in funding to $13.93 billion. The majority of the increased funding would be used for Operations & Maintenance expenses, with no major new initiatives proposed. Funding is primarily provided from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund. In FY2004, the FAA received a $440 million increase in funding to $13.93 billion, with the majority allocated for Operations & Maintenance expenses. The funding comes mainly from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund, with a small portion from the Treasury general fund. The Administration proposed a general fund contribution of almost $3.3 billion for FY2003, aiming to return to a higher historical contribution level. Ultimately, both the House and Senate agreed on $3.4 billion for FY2003. In FY2004, the FAA budget increased to $13.93 billion, with $4.5 billion coming from the general fund, a significant increase from the initial proposal of $1.5 billion. This funding split has been a key aspect of the annual FAA budget debate, with the rationale being that the public benefits from aviation. The FY2004 FAA budget increased to $13.93 billion, with $4.5 billion from the general fund. The funding split has been a crucial part of the annual FAA budget debate, with the rationale that the public benefits from aviation. The FY2004 Act provides $7.5 billion for Operations and Maintenance (O&M) spending, mainly for FAA personnel in air traffic control, certification, and safety activities. The FY2004 budget for FAA personnel in air traffic control, certification, and safety activities increased to $13.93 billion, with $4.5 billion from the general fund. The FY2004 Act allocated $2.91 billion for Facilities and Equipment (F&E), with a Senate proposal to transfer $100 million to the Airport Improvement Program dropped in Conference. Unobligated F&E funds of $30 million are subject to rescission in P.L. 108-199. The Airport Improvement Program (AIP) was dropped in Conference. Unobligated F&E funds of $30 million are subject to rescission in P.L.108-199. F&E funding is used primarily for capital investment in air traffic control and safety. P.L. 108-199 expends $119.4 million on Research, Engineering, and Development (RE&D), slightly more than the Senate proposal. The enacted level is well below the FY2003 level. The Essential Air Service program receives funding from user fees collected from foreign aircraft overflights. Despite an annual authorized funding level of $50 million, additional funding has been necessary from other sources. In FY2003, $102 million was provided for the program. The Essential Air Service program receives significant support in Congress, with $102 million provided in FY2003. The FY2004 Act allocates the same amount, with $50 million from regular authorization and $52 million from the aviation trust fund. The Act does not rely on the overflight fee as its main funding source and excludes funding for a pilot cost-sharing program. The FY2004 Act maintains $102 million funding for the Essential Air Service program, rejecting calls to reduce its size and require local contributions. It also excludes a provision for communities to report on program improvements. The Airport Improvement Program (AIP) requested $3.4 billion in the Bush Administration's FY2004 budget proposal. The Airport Improvement Program (AIP) provides grants for airport development and planning. The House-reported bill recommended $3.425 billion for AIP, with $20 million allocated for the Small Community Air Service Program. However, during floor debate, the AIP provision was removed from the bill. The House-passed bill, H.R. 2989, did not include funding for AIP. The Senate-passed bill provided $3.5 billion for AIP, with a $100 million transfer from the facilities and equipment account. Priority was given to projects at 241 airports named in the report. The report language for AIP discretionary grants prioritized projects at 241 airports. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 provided $3.4 billion for AIP, excluding a $100 million transfer from the F&E account. Prohibitions were in place for using AIP grants for certain airport improvements. The report language prioritized projects at 241 airports and provided funding for airport projects totaling just under $258 million. Prohibitions were in place for using AIP grants for certain airport improvements. The FHWA budget provides funding for the Federal-Aid Highway Program. The FHWA budget requested $30.2 billion for FY2004, a decrease of $2.2 billion from the previous year. The proposed obligation limitation was set at $29.3 billion, with funding for exempt programs at $931 million. The FHWA budget for FY2004 proposed a $931 million funding for exempt programs, including a new $1.0 billion Infrastructure Performance and Maintenance initiative. Funds would be distributed for \"ready-to-go\" projects addressing congestion and infrastructure improvements, with states required to commit funds within the first six months of the fiscal year. The FY2004 FHWA budget proposed funding for projects addressing congestion and infrastructure improvements. States had to commit funds within the first six months of the fiscal year. The budget also included redirecting revenues from the gasohol excise tax to the highway trust fund, projected to add $600 million in revenues. The House-passed FY2004 Appropriations bill provided a total of $34.6 billion. The House-passed FY2004 Appropriations bill (H.R. 2989; H.Rept.108-243) allocated $34.6 billion for FHWA, exceeding the President's request by $4.4 billion. The obligation limitation was set at $33.4 billion, with $931 million in exempt obligations. Earmarking of federal-aid highway discretionary programs continued as usual. The Senate also passed a similar appropriations bill. The Senate-passed FY2004 appropriations bill (H.R. 2989 as amended by S. 1589; S.Rept. 108-146) provided $34.8 billion for FHWA, with discretionary programs heavily earmarked. $175 million was directed for surface transportation projects earmarked in the report language. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 allocated $175 million for surface transportation projects earmarked in the report language. The total budgetary resources for FHWA were $34.7 billion, slightly higher than the House total and slightly lower than the Senate total, representing an increase of over 6% from FY2003. The limitation on obligations was similar to both the House and Senate bills. The FY2004 budget request for the Administration is $33.8 billion, with limitations on obligations similar to the House and Senate bills. Most discretionary programs under FHWA control are heavily earmarked, including Interstate Discretionary, Bridge Discretionary, Ferry Boats, TCSP, National Corridor Planning, and CORBOR programs. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 earmarks funds for various programs including the Interstate Maintenance Program, National Highway System, Surface Transportation Program, Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program, and Highway Bridge Replacement and Rehabilitation Program, totaling over $1 billion. This marks a departure from traditional practice of leaving these programs free of earmarks and under state control. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 earmarks over $1 billion for various programs, including the Interstate Maintenance Program, National Highway System, and others. Section 115 of Division F in the Conference Report specifies that unobligated core program funds will be used for projects, with a 100% federal share for funding. This is a departure from past practices where the federal share was determined by the program. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 earmarks over $1 billion for various programs, including the Interstate Maintenance Program and National Highway System. The act provides for the use of nearly $300 million unobligated core formula funds for interagency transfers and project earmarks, with funds going to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, construction of Pennsylvania Avenue, and Amber Alert grants. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 allocates $150.5 million for the Highway Traffic Safety Administration, $15 million for construction of Pennsylvania Avenue, and $20 million for Amber Alert grants. An additional $150 million is provided for the Appalachian Development Highway System, with $75 million earmarked. The act extends the TEA-21 Funding Framework, which was set to expire in 2003. TEA-21, the largest surface transportation program in U.S. history, was set to expire in 2003 but was extended to February 29, 2004 and then to April 30, 2004. Any new legislation is expected to largely retain the existing program funding framework. The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) was extended to April 30, 2004, and new legislation is expected to continue most of the existing highway and transit programs from its predecessor, ISTEA. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has various highway programs, including the National Highway System, Interstate Maintenance, Surface Transportation Program, Bridge Replacement and Rehabilitation, and Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement. Funding for these programs is apportioned annually by formula. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has various highway programs funded through apportionment on an annual basis by formula. There are three categories of highway funding: Basic Formula, Exempt, and Allocated programs. The Exempt category includes minimum guarantee funding and emergency relief, while the Allocated programs are under direct control of FHWA or other governmental entities. The FMCSA, created in 1999, assumed responsibilities from DOT's Office of Motor Carrier Safety and enforces regulations. The FMCSA, established in 1999, took over responsibilities from DOT's Office of Motor Carrier Safety. It enforces federal motor carrier safety regulations for interstate commercial truck and bus operations, issues licenses for commercial drivers, and administers grants for state safety programs. FMCSA also conducts inspections of Mexican-domiciled commercial drivers and vehicles entering the US, promotes Intelligent Transportation Systems, and reviews carriers.

The President's budget request for FMCSA's administrative and operations expenses in FY2004 was $224 million, with funds allocated for research, technology, and regulatory development. The House approved $236.8 million, the Senate approved $246 million, and the final agreed amount was $176 million. Activities to be funded include enforcement to reduce unsafe carriers and drivers, outreach efforts to educate the public on sharing the road with commercial vehicles, and the establishment of a medical review board to assist FMCSA. The FMCSA's budget supports various activities such as outreach to educate the public on road safety with commercial vehicles, establishment of a medical review board, and funding for agency information systems. The FMCSA budget funds activities like outreach for road safety, a medical review board, and agency information systems. Funds are also allocated for grants to states for the Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program, covering up to 80% of truck and bus safety program costs. The MCSAP grants cover up to 80% of state truck and bus safety program costs, with 10,000 law enforcement officers conducting over 2.6 million roadside inspections annually. The Senate bill includes $47 million for border inspection stations, while the FY2004 conference agreement allocates $170 million for MCSAP and $20 million for safety initiatives and information systems. Additionally, $111.5 million is provided under the FHWA miscellaneous appropriation. The FHWA miscellaneous appropriation provides an additional $111.5 million for initiatives such as southern border inspection facilities, southern border operations grants, and CDL improvement grants. NHTSA funding supports programs to improve traffic safety by addressing behavioral and vehicle-related issues. NHTSA aims to enhance traffic safety by reducing impaired driving, improving occupant protection, and ensuring compliance with federal vehicle safety regulations. They also provide grants to states for highway traffic safety programs, with a requested budget of $665 million for FY2004, reflecting an increase of $231 million from the previous year. The FY2004 budget request included $447 million for traffic safety grants to states and $218 million for NHTSA's operations and research activities to reduce highway fatalities and prevent injuries. This reflected an increase of $231 million from the previous year, with $100 million transferred from FHWA to NHTSA for safety belt use and impaired-driving law incentive programs. The FY2004 budget request included $447 million for traffic safety grants to states and $218 million for NHTSA's operations and research activities to reduce highway fatalities and prevent injuries. The funding was allocated for research, highway safety programs, safety assurance, and safety performance standards. The House, Senate, and conference agreement recommended funding amounts for NHTSA and FRA in FY2004. NHTSA received $451.1 million, with $225 million for highway traffic safety grants and $222.5 million for operations and research. FRA's funding totaled $1.455 billion, with a majority allocated to Amtrak. The Administration requested $900 million for Amtrak.

P.L. 108-199 provided $1.225 billion for Amtrak, postponed repayment of a $100 million loan, and directed the Secretary of Transportation to establish a competitive bidding procedure for non-Amtrak operators. P.L. 108-199 directs the Secretary of Transportation to establish competitive bidding for state-supported routes currently operated by Amtrak. States can contract with non-Amtrak operators, with the option to use Amtrak's equipment and services if needed. If terms cannot be agreed upon, the Secretary has the power to compel Amtrak to provide necessary resources. In P.L. 108-199, the Secretary of Transportation can compel Amtrak to provide equipment, facilities, and services as needed. Congress directed Amtrak's FY2003 appropriation to go through the Secretary of Transportation, reducing Amtrak's discretion with federal funding. Amtrak was required to submit a 5-year business plan to Congress in April 2003. Amtrak submitted a 5-year business plan to Congress in April 2003, requesting $1.6 billion annually for maintenance and addressing $6 billion in maintenance needs. Authorization for Amtrak expired in FY2002, but bills have been proposed to reauthorize it, including H.R. 2572 for $2 billion annually for three years.

President Bush's FY2004 budget request for FTA was $7.226 billion, with proposed changes to FTA's program structure. The House and Senate agreed on funding amounts for FTA, with the Senate providing $7.305 billion and the House providing $7.231 billion. The Administration's proposed changes to FTA's program structure have not been approved yet. For more information on FTA's programs and funding structure, refer to CRS Report RL31854. The FTA Appropriation for FY2003-FY2004 was $677 million, including a $70 million supplement from other FTA programs. The figures were sourced from an FY2004 Transportation-Treasury Appropriations bill Conference Report Budget Authority table provided by the House Committee on Appropriations. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 contained an across-the-board rescission of 0.59%, not reflected in these figures. MARAD's mission is to promote the development and maintenance of a U.S. merchant marine. MARAD's mission is to promote the development and maintenance of a U.S. merchant marine. For FY2004, the President requested $219 million for MARAD, with a total of $226.4 million provided by the Consolidated Appropriations Act. This funding benefits U.S. vessel owners, shipyards, and ship crews. The Consolidated Appropriations Act allocates $226.4 million for MARAD in FY2003, $11 million less than Congress appropriated. The focus is on the Maritime Guaranteed Loan Program, which provides loans for purchasing ships and modernizing shipyards to promote growth. The Administration has requested no funds for additional loans in FY2004, calling the program a \"corporate subsidy.\" The Administration has requested no funds for additional loans in FY2004 for the Maritime Guaranteed Loan Program, calling it a \"corporate subsidy.\" However, $4.5 million has been requested for the administration of existing loans. Congress provided $25 million for the program in the Wartime Supplemental Appropriations bill for FY2003. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004 agrees with the President's request, providing $4.5 million for administrative expenses. The DOT Inspector General's report on the Title XI program called for more effective review of loan applications, rigorous financial oversight of borrowers, and the use of an external financial advisor. This was prompted by the bankruptcy of American Classic Voyages, leaving MARAD with $367 million in bad loans for cruise ship construction. At a Senate Commerce Committee hearing, the General Accounting Office also highlighted issues with the program. MARAD faced $367 million in bad loans for cruise ship construction. The General Accounting Office identified weaknesses in the Title XI program and made recommendations for financial oversight improvements. The Administration requested $104.4 million for operations and training, including funds for the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy and state maritime academies. In FY2003, Congress appropriated $52.9 million for the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, $9.5 million for state maritime academies, and $42 million for MARAD operations.

The Administration requested a budget of $118 million for RSPA in FY2004, with most funding allocated to transportation safety programs. This included $67 million for pipeline transportation safety and $25 million for hazardous materials transportation safety. The Administration requested $118 million for RSPA in FY2004, with $25 million for hazardous materials transportation safety. Additional funding was intended to enhance RSPA's ability to ensure compliance with hazardous materials transportation regulations and oversee containment systems for nuclear fuel and radioactive wastes. The House approved $111.3 million for RSPA in FY2004, including $23.6 million for hazardous materials transportation safety and $64.1 million for pipeline safety. The House approved $111.3 million for RSPA in FY2004, including $23.6 million for hazardous materials transportation safety and $64.1 million for pipeline safety. The Senate approved $110.3 million for RSPA in FY2004, including $22.8 million for hazardous materials transportation safety and $67.6 million for pipeline safety. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 provides $112.9 million for RSPA, including $23.7 million for hazardous materials transportation safety and $66.3 million for pipeline safety. The Treasury Department has performed four basic functions in recent decades, including formulating economic policies, serving as the financial agent for the federal government, and enforcing financial laws. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 provides $112.9 million for RSPA, with allocations for hazardous materials transportation safety and pipeline safety. The Treasury Department's functions include economic policy formulation, financial management for the government, and law enforcement. However, its role in law enforcement has become more limited since the creation of the Department of Homeland Security in 2002. The Treasury Department is the government's economic policymaker, financial manager, revenue collector, and producer of currency. Its role in law enforcement is now limited, with departmental offices handling policy formulation and operating bureaus carrying out specific duties. The bureaus are mainly divided into those with financial responsibilities and those involved in law enforcement, accounting for over 95% of the Department's employment and funding. The Treasury Department's bureaus can be categorized into those with financial responsibilities and those involved in law enforcement, accounting for over 95% of the Department's employment and funding.

The 4.1% increase, retroactive to January 1, 2004, includes a 2% adjustment. The adjustment to base pay is determined by the Employment Cost Index (ECI) minus 0.5. The base pay adjustment for federal civilian personnel in January 2003 was 3.1%, with a full pay increase of 4.1% under Section 637, Division J, P.L. 108-7. An additional 1% was allocated to locality-based comparability payments, retroactive to January 2003. In January 2003, federal civilian personnel received a 3.1% base pay adjustment with an additional 1% retroactive to January 2003 for locality-based comparability payments. In January 2004, the President proposed a 2.0% pay increase, but Congress did not pass legislation, so the President's plan for a 1.5% increase in basic pay and 0.5% increase in locality pay went into effect. In January 2004, the FY2004 budget resolution included a provision for civilian and military pay parity. The proposed pay increase was 4.1% for civilian employees, matching the military increase. The President would decide how to split the increase between basic and locality pay. The pending Consolidated Appropriations, 2004 bill would address this pay provision. The Office of Personnel Management stated that the 4.1% increase would be split with 2.7% for basic pay. The pending Consolidated Appropriations, 2004 bill includes a 4.1% pay increase for civilian employees, with 2.7% for basic pay and 1.4% for locality-based payments. The adjustment for the Washington, DC area will be 4.41% under the overall 4.1% increase. The Federal Wage System compensates federal blue-collar workers at local prevailing rates. The Federal Wage System compensates federal blue-collar workers at local prevailing rates, with wage rates and adjustments varying based on labor costs and compensation in the private sector. Congress has limited the rates of adjustment in recent years to prevent FWS wages from exceeding salaries paid to General Schedule supervisors in high-cost areas. The Monroney Amendment extended out-of-area survey application to Department of Defense personnel, while P.L. 107-117 capped high cost area wages for Federal Wage System workers. Additionally, a proposed amendment aimed to change the salary determination system for the Senior Executive Service by eliminating the six-tier system. An amendment to the statute governing salary levels for the Senior Executive Service was enacted under the National Defense Authorization Act for 2004. The changes include eliminating the six-tier system, transferring salary setting authority to the Office of Personnel Management, and capping rates at Level II of the Executive Schedule. The minimum pay rate for January 2004 is $103,700, with a maximum of $145,600 for most. Those in agencies with certified performance appraisal systems can receive up to $158,100, equivalent to Members of Congress and U.S. District Court judges. The Administration's FY2004 pay proposal includes a 2% across-the-board increase and a $500 million fund for top-performing individuals to receive permanent base pay increases. There are no provisions in the House-passed or Senate-reported versions addressing the pay of Members of Congress, Judges, and Other Officials. The pay adjustment for Members of Congress, Judges, and other federal officials is scheduled to be 2.2% effective January 2004. However, due to a previous basic pay adjustment rate of 1.5%, the adjustment was limited to 1.5% until the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 was passed. The full adjustment of 2.2% will be retroactive. The pay adjustment for federal officials in 2004 was limited to 1.5% initially, but will now be the full 2.2% retroactively. The Senate voted against an amendment that would have denied the pay increase to Members of Congress. Pay adjustments for federal officials are based on ECI calculations, with a 2.2% adjustment scheduled for January 2004. The pay adjustment for federal officials in January 2004 was initially limited to 1.5% due to the General Schedule base pay adjustment. However, a 2.2% adjustment was retroactively approved. Unlike Members of Congress and executive branch officials, judges require specific authorization for annual pay increases, which was granted in P.L. 108-167 for the January 2004 adjustment. The annual pay increase for judges must be specifically authorized, as stated in P.L. 108-167. Presidents now receive a salary of $400,000 per year, up from $200,000 since 1969. Former Presidents receive a pension equal to Cabinet Secretaries' pay rate. The Federal Employees Compensation Act (FECA) provides workers' compensation benefits for Federal employees injured on the job. The costs of administration are covered by appropriation directly to the Labor Department. Former Presidents receive a pension equal to the rate of pay for Cabinet Secretaries. The Administration proposed changes in FECA to charge administrative costs to each employing agency, aiming to improve workplace safety by making agencies bear the full cost of employees' claims. The administrative surcharge would be around 3.5% of benefit costs. The Administration proposed changes in FECA to charge administrative costs to each employing agency, aiming to improve workplace safety by making agencies bear the full cost of employees' claims. The surcharge would be around 3.5% of benefit costs, with most paid by the U.S. Postal Service and the Defense Department. The Administration supported competitive sourcing and opposed an amendment that could hinder it, threatening a veto if the bill contained a prohibition on funding for public-private competitions. This occurred after H.R. 2989 was included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004. The Office of Management and Budget successfully altered competitive sourcing provisions in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004. Competitive sourcing, part of the President's Management Agenda, applies to commercial activities of federal executive agencies. OMB has implemented initiatives to promote competitive sourcing, including revising Circular A-76 and requiring agencies to submit inventories of inherently governmental activities. Circular A-76 provides policy and guidance for public-private competitions. Circular A-76 provides policy and guidance for public-private competitions, with competitive sourcing provisions found in Section 647 of H.R. 2673 (P.L. 108-199). Section 647(a) imposes conditions on competitions involving more than 10 federal employees, requiring agencies to develop a plan for a most efficient organization (MEO). Circular A-76 requires agencies to develop a plan for a most efficient organization (MEO) in competitions involving more than 10 federal employees. This requirement may pose challenges in meeting the 90-day deadline for streamlined competitions. Additionally, Section 647(a) also mandates consideration of the conversion differential in streamlined competitions. Section 647(a) requires consideration of the conversion differential in streamlined competitions, which may take precedence over Circular A-76's requirements. The conversion differential is the lesser of $10 million or 10% of the personnel costs of the government's MEO. Section 647(a) directs the competitive sourcing official to consider the cost of contractor performance compared to the agency's costs, with no specified standard for comparison. The impact of this decision on streamlined competitions is yet to be determined. The cost of contractor performance is being evaluated to determine if it is more cost-effective for the agency. The decision-making process involves completing a streamlined competition form and considering the conversion differential. In standard competitions, both the circular and Section 647(a) apply, with a more stringent requirement for standard competitions found in the circular. Agencies must add the conversion differential to the cost of the non-incumbent's performance on the standard competition form. The circular requires agencies to add the conversion differential to the cost of the non-incumbent's performance on the standard competition form. Section 647(b) mandates executive agencies to submit annual reports to Congress on competitive sourcing activities, including completed and ongoing competitions, associated costs, and FTEs. The first report is due within 120 days of enactment, with subsequent reports due by December 31 each year. The circular mandates agencies to report on completed and ongoing competitions, costs, FTEs, and decision-making processes. A reporting requirement could aid congressional oversight and inform OMB policy, but the absence of a methodology for collecting required information may be a challenge. The absence of an established methodology for identifying, defining, and collecting the required information may detract from its usefulness in informing OMB policy and agency decisions. Fulfilling this requirement could potentially increase the costs of competitive sourcing. Agency heads would not be required to limit the performance period in a letter of obligation issued to an MEO to five years or less under Section 647(c). MEOs would still be subject to recompetition as required by Circular A-76, but recompetitions might occur less frequently due to the flexibility allowed by this provision. Allowing agencies to write letters of obligation with performance periods longer than five years could mitigate recruitment or retention problems among federal government employees concerned about frequent recompetitions. This modification may result in different treatment for government agencies and private sector sources, as contractors winning public-private competitions are subject to recompetition under the Federal Acquisition Regulation. Section 647(d) allows agency heads to use funds for monitoring activities after public-private competitions, supporting oversight and decision-making by funding information collection and analysis. Section 647(e) prohibits moving work converted to contractor performance outside the United States if previously done by federal government employees within the country, potentially impacting contractors' ability to submit competitive bids. Labor costs in other countries may be cheaper, affecting competitiveness. The FY2004 Transportation-Treasury appropriations bill had provisions to prevent funds from enforcing restrictions on travel or travel-related transactions, potentially impacting contractors' ability to submit competitive bids due to cheaper labor costs in other countries. This could help retain jobs in the United States and benefit employers with workforce proximity to their facilities. The FY2004 Transportation-Treasury appropriations bill, H.R. 2989, initially included provisions to prevent funds from enforcing travel restrictions, but these were dropped in the final Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004, P.L.108-199. Additionally, two Cuba-related provisions on remittances and educational exchanges were removed from the bill due to the White House's threat of vetoing any legislation that weakened economic sanctions against Cuba. The White House threatened to veto any legislation weakening economic sanctions against Cuba, including provisions on remittances and educational exchanges. US policy towards Cuba since the 1960s has focused on isolating the Communist government through sanctions like a trade embargo and restrictions on financial transactions and travel. Congressional efforts have consistently strengthened these sanctions. Comprehensive economic sanctions, including a trade embargo and prohibitions on U.S. financial transactions with Cuba, were strengthened by congressional initiatives in 1992 and 1996 with the passage of the Cuban Democracy Act and the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act. Sanctions on financial transactions with Cuba, including those related to travel, are governed by the Cuban Assets Control Regulations (CACR) administered by the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). Cuba sanctions have been a source of controversy in recent years. Regulations on financial transactions with Cuba, including travel, are governed by the Cuban Assets Control Regulations (CACR) administered by the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). There are differing opinions in Congress on how to achieve the overall objective of U.S. policy toward Cuba, with some advocating for maximum pressure on the Cuban government, others calling for lifting some sanctions hurting the Cuban people, and still others pushing for swift reforms. The House-approved version of H.R. 2929 had three Cuba provisions, approved during September 9, 2003 floor consideration, that would have prevented funds from being used to administer or enforce restrictions on travel and remittances, and from being used to eliminate the travel category of people-to-people educational exchanges. H.Amdt. 375 (Flake), approved by a vote of 227-188, would have prevented funds from being used to enforce. The House-approved version of H.R. 2929 included provisions to prevent funds from enforcing travel restrictions and eliminating people-to-people educational exchanges in Cuba. Restrictions on travel have been a contentious issue in U.S. efforts to isolate Cuba, with certain categories of travelers allowed under general licenses. Certain categories of travelers are allowed to visit Cuba under a general license, including U.S. government officials, journalists, persons with close relatives in Cuba, professionals for research or meetings, and athletes in international competitions. Other travelers engaging in educational, religious, or other activities may be eligible for specific licenses. Supporters of the Flake amendment argue that U.S. policy towards Cuba restricts the rights of ordinary Americans to travel to other countries. Supporters of the Flake amendment argue that U.S. policy towards Cuba restricts the rights of ordinary Americans to travel to other countries with communist or authoritarian governments, while opponents believe that not enforcing travel restrictions would provide the Cuban government with tourist revenue amidst crackdowns on democracy activists. In March 2003, OFAC amended Cuba travel regulations to allow travelers to carry up to $3,000 in remittances, with a $300 limit per quarter for Cuban households. H.Amdt. 377 (Delahunt) aimed to prevent funds from enforcing restrictions on remittances, approved by a vote of 222-196. Supporters argued for unlimited financial support for Cuban Americans to send to their families in Cuba. Supporters of the Delahunt amendment argued for unlimited financial support for Cuban Americans to send to their families in Cuba, while opponents feared that lifting the cap on remittances would benefit the Cuban regime through government-owned dollar stores with inflated prices. H.Amdt. 382 (Davis) aimed to prohibit the elimination of the travel category for people-to-people educational exchanges, and its language became section 749 of the House bill. In March 2003, OFAC announced tighter regulations for certain types of educational travel to Cuba. In March 2003, OFAC tightened Cuba travel regulations, restricting certain types of educational exchanges. People-to-people educational exchanges unrelated to academic coursework were no longer allowed. Some groups supported the restriction, while others criticized the decision to limit travel opportunities to Cuba. Senate approved S.Amdt. 1900 (Dorgan) on October 23, 2003, during consideration of H.R. 2989. The Senate approved S.Amdt. 1900 (Dorgan) on October 23, 2003, to prevent funds from enforcing restrictions on Cuba travel. The provision was similar to the Flake amendment in the House version of the bill. The Dorgan amendment, as amended by S.Amdt. 1901 (Craig), stated that the provision would take effect one day after enactment of the bill. Cuba's human rights crackdown in 2003 impacted legislative proposals to ease U.S. sanctions policy toward Cuba. The House-approved Cuba amendments to H.R. 2989 had less support than in 2002. The Flake amendment to H.R. 2989 was approved by a vote of 227-188, compared to a similar amendment in the FY2003 Treasury Department appropriations bill which was approved by a vote of 262-167. An amendment to the FY2003 Treasury Department appropriations bill was approved by a vote of 262-167. Relevant reports include CRS Report RL31740 on Cuba issues and CRS Report RL31139 on U.S. restrictions on travel and legislative initiatives. Key acronyms include ARC for Amtrak Reform Council, AIP for Airport Improvement Program, AIR21 for aviation reform act, ARAA for Amtrak reform act, and ATSA for aviation and transportation security act. The current legislation includes ATSA for aviation security, BRR for Bridge Replacement program, CMAQ for air quality, and FAIR21 for aviation reform. Key agencies mentioned are DOT, CG, FAA, and FHWA. The curr_chunk discusses various programs and agencies related to transportation, including FHWA, FRA, FTA, Hazmat, HPP, HTF, IM, ITS, MCSAP, New Starts, and NHS. These programs and agencies are part of the Federal-Aid Highway Program and aviation authorizing legislation. The curr_chunk lists various transportation-related programs and agencies, including FMCSA, NHS, NHTSA, NMCSA, O&M, OIG, OST, RABA, RD&T, RE&D, RSPA, SCASD, and STB. The curr_chunk provides an overview of various transportation-related programs and agencies, including FHWA, FAA, RSPA, SCASD, STB, STP, TCSP, TEA-21, TIFIA, and TSA. Transportation is function 400 in the annual unified congressional budget and is part of the discretionary budget. Funding for the DOT budget is also mentioned. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is part of the discretionary budget, with funding derived from various sources including transportation trust funds like the highway trust fund, airport and airway trust fund, and inland waterways trust fund. Trust funds accounted for over two-thirds of total funding in FY2002. In FY2002, trust funds like the highway trust fund, airport and airway trust fund, and inland waterways trust fund accounted for well over two-thirds of total federal transportation spending. Highway and transit funding make up the largest component of DOT appropriations, with contract authority linking to the highway trust fund. This contract authority allows authorized funds to be automatically available at the start of projects. In Title 23 U.S.C., authorized funds are automatically available at the beginning of each fiscal year for transportation projects. Obligations can be made without appropriations legislation, but appropriations are needed for future outlays. Transportation appropriators have existing authority to spend on major programs, with mechanisms in place to obligate funds. During the 105th and 106th Congresses, legislation changed relationships between transportation trust funds and the federal budget. The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century linked highway program spending to revenue collections, creating a \"firewall\" around highway funding in the federal budget. The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century created a \"firewall\" around highway and transit spending programs in the federal budget, ensuring funding guarantees that are difficult to alter annually. Additional highway funds can be provided through Revenue Aligned Budget Authority (RABA) based on trust fund revenues. However, for FY2003, the RABA adjustment could have led to an unexpected drop in funding if left intact during the appropriations process. TEA-21 changed the role of House and Senate appropriations committees in determining annual spending levels for highway and transit programs. The committees are no longer able to set annual obligations, as these are now established by TEA-21 and adjusted by RABA computation. This limits the committees' previous authority in determining funding levels. TEA-21 limits the House and Senate appropriations committees' authority in setting annual spending levels for highway and transit programs. The FY2000 and FY2001 appropriations acts attempted to regain some discretion over highway spending by redistributing funds among programs and adding earmarked projects. The FY2001 and FY2002 Acts continued the trend of adding funds for earmarked projects and redistributing funding between programs. The FAIR21 Act guarantees Federal Aviation Administration program spending. FAIR21 (P.L. 106-181) guarantees Federal Aviation Administration program spending through two point-of-order rules for the House and Senate. Supporters believe it requires increased spending on aviation programs, with spending growing significantly in FY2001 and FY2002. However, the guarantees are seen as weaker than those provided by TEA-21. Congress can waive points-of-order. FAIR21 guarantees FAA program spending with weaker provisions than TEA-21. Congress can waive points-of-order during legislation consideration. Transportation budgeting uses a confusing lexicon of budget authority and contract authority. In a constrained budgetary environment, transportation budgeting utilizes a confusing lexicon of budget authority and contract authority. Contract authority, a form of budget authority, provides funding for trust fund-financed programs like the federal-aid highway program. Changes in transportation budget spending were previously achieved by combining changes in budget/contract authority and placing limitations on obligations to control outlays in line with congressional budget agreements. The limitation on obligations controls outlays to correspond with congressional budget agreements. Contract authority provides funding for projects without entering into a contract immediately. TEA-21 reduced the role of appropriations in highway and transit programs. TEA-21 limited appropriations in highway and transit programs by setting obligations levels for FY1999 through FY2003. States pay for projects upfront and receive federal payments after completion. Obligated funds are not subtracted from trust fund balances. The trust fund balances remain high because obligated funds are not subtracted from balances, covering current and future commitments in highway and transit accounts. There are unobligated amounts dedicated to projects but not yet committed. The trust fund balances remain high due to outstanding obligations for future payments. Unobligated amounts are still allocated to highway and transit projects, with funds distributed through apportionments and allocations. Apportionments are for formula-driven programs, while allocations are for programs under direct federal control. Federal funds are distributed on an administrative basis to programs under direct federal control or to other governmental entities, such as states or Indian tribes. Recipients may mistakenly assume that state apportionments are part of the federal budget process."
