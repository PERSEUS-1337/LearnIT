    "content": "Total nonfarm employment declined steadily between December 2007 and October 2009, falling from 137,951,000 to 129,633,000. The majority of job losses occurred after November 2008, with a small increase in employment in November 2009. Despite this, the number of jobs on employer payrolls decreased the following month. Both private and public employers have since increased aggregate employment, with the number of jobs rising to 130,470,000 in July 2010. The goods-producing sector, including mining, construction, and manufacturing, has been the most affected by job losses during the economic downturn. The goods-producing sector, including mining, construction, and manufacturing, has been severely impacted by job losses. Construction workers started experiencing job cuts even before the recession began. Employment in the service-providing sector peaked in December 2007, with some industries like education and health services adding workers. However, job losses in other service industries outweighed these gains. The financial activities industry also began losing jobs before the economic downturn, partly due to real estate being a component of this sector. The financial activities industry, including real estate, has been negatively affected by the housing market collapse, leading to job losses. Despite the belief that the recession ended in 2009, the rebound in jobs may not be immediate based on historical patterns. Based on historical patterns, job growth may not immediately rebound after the end of a recession. In past postwar recessions, sustained job growth typically occurred within three to five months of the start of recoveries, but in some cases, it took up to 22 months for steady job growth to begin. Congressional actions to create jobs by increasing demand for goods and services have been a response to recessions. In response to recessions, Congress has historically created jobs by increasing demand for goods and services through infrastructure projects. This includes public works like road and bridge building, as well as green economic activities. Other methods of job creation, such as public service employment and employment tax credits, have been used less frequently. The discussion focuses on the job-generating impact of green economic activities, including industries utilizing renewable resources and producing energy-efficient goods and services. The discussion focuses on the job-generating impact of infrastructure spending, with a focus on estimating job creation in the construction industry and other sectors. The section discusses estimating job creation in the construction industry and other sectors, highlighting the challenges researchers face in determining the number of jobs supported by green economic activities. Policymakers are interested in understanding the job impact of different stimulus options and shifting expenditures between federal budget categories. An input-output (I-O) model is often used to estimate the number of jobs created by economic activities, showing the interrelationships between industries in the production process. Policymakers are interested in understanding the job impact of stimulus options and shifting expenditures between federal budget categories. An I-O model illustrates how industries are interconnected in the production process, distributing the dollar value of sales across different sectors. It shows the relationship between final and supplier industries, such as the production of roof trusses by one industry and bricks by another for construction. This information is then used to determine employment requirements. The employment requirements for different industries are determined based on their productivity estimates. This includes direct and indirect employment associated with a specific final demand, expressed as the number of jobs per billion dollars of expenditures. Employment requirements tables show the number of jobs supported by one billion dollars of expenditures in different industries. This includes direct employment within the industry and indirect employment from suppliers. An employment requirements table allows estimation of the impact of expenditures on various industries and types of spending. Input-Output models freeze technology and productivity, potentially affecting job creation compared to earlier periods with technological advancements. The job-generating potential of economic activities can vary over time due to technological advancements and changes in price levels. Estimates of job creation may differ from actual outcomes because input-output models assume unlimited resources and may not account for full capacity operations in the economy. Input:\nPrev_chunk: The job-generating potential of economic activities can vary over time due to technological advancements and changes in price levels. Estimates of job creation may differ from actual outcomes because input-output models assume unlimited resources and may not account for full capacity operations in the economy.\nCurr_chunk: because I-O models assume that resources are unlimited. If, for example, the economy was performing at a fairly high level with plants operating near full capacity and with fairly few workers unemployed, the actual number of new jobs might fall short of the estimate due to capital and labor constraints. This is less likely to matter during a broad-based economic downturn. Further, I-O tables do not necessarily differentiate between imported and domestically produced goods. As a consequence, the domestic employment impact of expenditures might be overstated to the extent that inputs are imported. Similarly, I-O tables typically do not express employment in terms of full-time equivalents (i.e., both full-time and part-time jobs are counted\n\nOutput:\nI-O models assume unlimited resources, which may lead to underestimated job creation in high-performing economies with limited capital and labor. Economic downturns may mitigate this issue. I-O tables may overstate domestic employment impact by not distinguishing between imported and domestically produced goods, and by not accounting for full-time equivalents in employment calculations. Output:\nI-O models assume unlimited resources, potentially underestimating job creation in high-performing economies with limited capital and labor. Economic downturns may mitigate this issue. I-O tables may overstate domestic employment impact by not distinguishing between imported and domestically produced goods, and by not accounting for full-time equivalents in employment calculations. Programs relying on industries with more part-time workers may appear to create more jobs than those with more full-time workers. Comprehensive job estimates include direct, indirect, and induced jobs from economic activities. The type of economic activity has three components: direct jobs, indirect jobs, and induced jobs throughout the economy. Induced jobs depend on the spending of those in direct and indirect jobs. Estimating induced jobs or the multiplier effect is challenging. Estimates of induced jobs or the multiplier effect from federal spending on roads are uncertain due to varying factors such as spending behavior and economic conditions. The Federal Highway Administration provides one of the most well-known estimates of the employment impact. The Federal Highway Administration provides estimates on the employment impact of federal spending on roads, with the most recent update indicating that $1.25 billion in highway construction could support 34,779 jobs. The Federal Highway Administration estimates that $1.25 billion in highway construction, with $1 billion from the federal government and $250 million from state government, could support 34,779 jobs. Without a state match, $1 billion in federal funds supports 27,800 jobs. The number of jobs has decreased due to increases in input prices like asphalt and diesel fuel. The estimate breaks down to 9,536 construction-oriented jobs and 4,324 jobs in supporting industries per billion dollars of federal spending on highways. The Federal Highway Administration estimates that $1.25 billion in highway construction, with $1 billion from the federal government and $250 million from state government, could support 34,779 jobs. This includes 9,536 construction-oriented jobs, 4,324 jobs in supporting industries, and 13,962 induced jobs. Input prices like asphalt and diesel fuel have caused a decrease in the number of jobs supported by federal funds. The Federal Highway Administration estimates that $1.25 billion in highway construction could support 34,779 jobs, with induced jobs accounting for half of the total estimate. Job estimates may vary based on specific projects and local utilization ratios. These employment figures have been used to justify including highway spending in economic stimulus packages. The FHWA estimates that $1.25 billion in highway construction could support 34,779 jobs, with induced jobs accounting for half of the total estimate. Job estimates vary based on specific projects and local utilization ratios. Employment figures have been used to justify highway spending in economic stimulus packages. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics provides free access to employment requirements tables for assessing the impact on employment of different policies or actions. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics provides employment requirements tables based on official I-O tables developed by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis every five years. The tables are updated to reflect recent production and distribution technologies, with the latest one referencing 2006 data. The employment requirements table in this report, based on 2006 data, provides information for the construction industry as a whole, including subdivisions like building construction and civil engineering. The construction industry is divided into three main categories: building construction, civil engineering construction, and specialty trade contractors. $1 billion in construction spending supports 11,768 jobs, with the majority being in the construction industry itself. The construction industry supports a majority of jobs in construction itself, with potential disparities in job figures due to various factors like industry definition and data sources. BLS employment requirements do not account for other types of construction discussed in federal job creation packages. The BEA produces estimates of employment, earnings, and output dependent on additional spending in various industries through its Regional Input-Output Modeling System (RIMS II). The survey information on construction activities, including new schools, hospitals, and roads, was last updated a few decades ago. The BEA utilizes benchmark I-O data to estimate job creation and economic impact at the subnational level. Each state's job creation varies due to its unique mix of industries. The unique mix of industries in each state affects job creation and the capacity to supply goods for construction projects. Estimating green infrastructure job dependencies is more challenging due to the lack of specific data on green industries in the current classification system. The current classification system (NAICS) does not separately identify green industries that utilize renewable resources. Renewable energy sources like wind, solar, and biomass are grouped under the \"other\" category, which hinders accurate estimation of job dependencies in green infrastructure. The conventional I-O model is not suitable for estimating job numbers in green activities like using wind for electricity or plant material for biofuel. The construction industry lacks a specific category for retrofitting, which requires a different mix of inputs compared to new construction. This poses challenges for accurate estimation using traditional I-O models. The traditional Input-Output model is not ideal for estimating job numbers in green industries like wind and solar energy, biomass, building retrofitting, and mass transit. This creates challenges for accurate estimation due to the unique input requirements of these industries. The traditional Input-Output model does not recognize green industries like wind, solar, biomass, building retrofitting, and mass transit. Researchers create synthetic industries by combining existing industries to estimate job numbers, with varying methods used in studies. Studies on green jobs often present employment projections based on different assumptions and timeframes, such as the shift from coal to wind and geothermal power generation. Some reports also include induced employment, but this is not always clear. Results from analyses specific to a state may not be applicable to other areas due to differing industry mixes in state economies. Some analyses on green jobs lack clarity and may not be generalizable to other areas due to varying state economies. Assumptions and methodologies behind job creation estimates are often unclear, making review challenging. Studies by green economy proponents may not have been intended for quickly stabilizing or increasing jobs during stimulus legislation crafting. The September 2008 report, Green Recovery: A Program to Create Jobs and Start Building a Low-Carbon Economy, commissioned by the Center for American Progress, proposed broad-based green economy strategies to stimulate the labor market. It accelerated a 10-year program from a 2007 report. Progress, a research and educational institute, proposes a two-year $100 billion \"green economic recovery program\" to create or preserve almost 2 million jobs. Federal spending of $46 billion would go towards activities like public building retrofits, mass transit expansion, and smart initiatives. The proposed $100 billion \"green economic recovery program\" includes federal spending of $46 billion for activities like public building retrofits, mass transit expansion, and smart grid development. Tax credits would also be used to incentivize businesses and homeowners to retrofit buildings. Some strategies can deliver results within a year, while others may take up to two years to implement. The Apollo Alliance proposed The Apollo Economic Recovery Act in December 2008 as part of a 10-year $500 billion program to create 5 million green-collar jobs. The initiative calls for federal spending of about $50 billion to create or maintain over 650,000 direct jobs and 1.3 million indirect jobs, with job creation figures derived from spending-to-jobs relationships estimated by other organizations. The job creation figures proposed in the Apollo Economic Recovery Act rely on spending-to-jobs relationships estimated by other organizations. This includes allocating federal funds for improving the electric transmission grid, repairing roads and bridges, and replacing aging buses and trains with U.S.-made clean-energy vehicles. Congress was concerned about timely tracking of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) required entities receiving ARRA appropriations to report estimates of direct jobs created. Congress focused on timely tracking of job creation in countercyclical legislation. The ARRA required recipients of federal funds to report estimates of direct jobs created by infrastructure projects. Reports had to be submitted quarterly and posted online by federal agencies. The OMB provided guidance on preparing the reports, including job estimates. The ARRA required recipients of federal funds to report job estimates for infrastructure projects. The OMB provided guidance for preparing the reports, with the CBO and GAO tasked to comment on the job estimates. Self-reported data showed 633,342 jobs saved or retained through September 30, 2009. OMB revised its guidance in June 2009 due to concerns about the concept of a saved job. OMB revised its guidance in December 2009 to define jobs created or retained as those funded by the Recovery Act, based on feedback from GAO. Recipients reported that 608,311 jobs were funded by ARRA. The guidance issued in December 2009 defines jobs created or retained as those funded by the Recovery Act. Recipients reported 608,311 jobs funded by ARRA in the fourth quarter of 2009 and 682,370 jobs created or saved in the first quarter of 2010. The Council of Economic Advisers is tasked with submitting quarterly reports on the effect of ARRA provisions on employment and economic indicators. This reporting requirement applies to $271 billion in direct government investment spending out of a total of $787 billion. The CEA's mandate goes beyond reporting requirements for $271 billion in direct government investment spending out of $787 billion. The first quarterly report in September 2009 estimated ARRA added one million jobs in August 2009. CBO comments on jobs created or saved from government purchases, grants, and loans. The CBO estimated the impact of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act on employment and economic output through direct government purchases, grants, and loans. This estimate is broader and comparable to that of the CEA, based on macroeconomic models and historical relationships. Based on macroeconomic models and historical relationships, CBO estimated that ARRA's tax cuts and outlay increases led to an increase of 600,000 to 1.6 million jobs by September 2009. CEA's estimate of 1.0-1.1 million additional jobs by August 2009 aligns with CBO's range. CEA's second report in January 2010 suggested ARRA may have raised year-end employment by 1.7\u20131.9 million jobs. The stimulus law, known as ARRA, potentially increased employment by 1.7-1.9 million jobs by the end of 2009. CBO and CEA reports also estimated a possible increase of 1.0-2.8 million jobs through the first quarter of 2010. The CEA estimated that ARRA may have increased employment by 2.5-3.6 million jobs in the second quarter of 2010 through various public investment outlays. The CEA estimated that public investment outlays under ARRA, including clean energy, human capital, transportation, health care, and building construction, may have increased total employment by over 627,000 jobs in the first quarter of 2010 and over 800,000 jobs in the second quarter."
