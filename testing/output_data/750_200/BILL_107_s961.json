According to findings by Congress, an estimated 1,000,000 to 2,000,000 American women have received breast implants over the last 35 years. In 1999, 82,975 women had breast reconstruction following mastectomies and 167,318 American women received breast implants for cosmetic purposes. From 1985 until January 2000, the FDA received 127,770 adverse reaction reports for silicone gel-filled breast implants and 65,720 adverse reaction reports for saline-filled implants. Women need complete and accurate information about the potential health risks and advantages of breast implants to make informed decisions. Silicone breast implants have never been approved by the FDA; saline breast implants have. In 2000, saline breast implants were approved by the FDA despite high complication rates. 43% of augmentation patients and 73% of reconstruction patients experienced local complications after three years. 40% of reconstruction patients needed additional surgery due to complications and device failure. The FDA approved saline breast implants in 2000 despite high complication rates. A criminal investigation was opened in 1998 regarding manipulation of research data by a breast implant manufacturer. The investigation was not disclosed to the FDA panel considering market approval for saline implants in 2000. The manufacturer's saline breast implant was approved, but the investigation remains ongoing. The FDA approved saline breast implants in 2000 despite high complication rates. A 1997 Mayo Clinic study showed that 1 in 4 women needed additional surgery within 5 years of receiving implants. Research in 2000 found that 70% of women had at least one ruptured implant after 10 to 15 years, with silicone migrating in 21% of cases. The investigation into manipulation of research data by a breast implant manufacturer remains open. The FDA approved saline breast implants in 2000 despite high complication rates. Research found that 70% of women had at least one ruptured implant after 10 to 15 years, with silicone migrating in 21% of cases. A 1993 study concluded that silicone breast implants should not be considered benign due to the incidence of anticollagen antibodies in women with implants. The Institute of Medicine's 1999 study on silicone breast implant safety highlighted local complications as the primary concern, emphasizing the lack of thorough research on these issues. Concerns persist regarding potential health implications from exposure to silicone breast implants. Exposure to silicone breast implants may lead to undefined connective tissue or autoimmune diseases. A 2001 study found higher rates of lung and brain cancer in breast implant recipients. Silicone migration in ruptured implants can cause severe inflammation. Silicone migration in women with ruptured silicone breast implants can lead to severe local inflammation and complications. Once silicone gel leaves the implant, it can elicit profound pathologic responses. The presence of silicone breast implants can hinder accurate mammograms by masking up to 40% of breast tissue, delaying early breast cancer detection. Breast implants can negatively impact breastfeeding, with uncertainty about silicone passing into breast milk. The purpose of this Act is to promote research on the health effects of breast implants, ensure women receive accurate information, and urge the FDA to conclude its investigation into allegations of wrongdoing by implant manufacturers. It is uncertain if silicone from implants can pass into breast milk and its potential effects on nursing infants are unknown. The Act aims to investigate allegations of wrong-doing by implant manufacturers that could impact the health of American women. It clarifies that existing regulations regarding silicone breast implants for reconstruction, correction of deformities, and replacement are not affected by the Act. The Act requires the Director of the National Institutes of Health to provide a report on existing breast implant research within 90 days. Additionally, a new section on breast implant research is added to the Public Health Service Act. The Director of NIH appoints a Department of Health and Human Services official as the National Institutes of Health coordinator for breast implant research, coordinating research across various Institutes. The Director of NIH appoints a coordinator for breast implant research across various Institutes, including the National Institute of Arthritis, Musculoskeletal and Skin diseases, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, and National Cancer Institute. Study sections or special emphasis panels are established to review grant applications for appropriate design. The National Institutes of Health appoint a coordinator for breast implant research and establish study sections to review grant applications for appropriate design. The Director of NIH conducts or supports research to expand understanding of health implications of saline and silicone breast implants through clinical studies. A multidisciplinary, clinical study of women with breast implants for at least eight years should differentiate between mastectomy, reconstructive, and cosmetic purposes, as well as saline and silicone implants. The study should focus on local complications such as capsular contracture, leakage, loss of nipple sensation, deflation, rupture, atypical symptoms, silicone migration, and neurological issues. The study of women with breast implants should focus on complications such as capsular contracture, leakage, loss of nipple sensation, deflation, rupture, atypical symptoms, silicone migration, and neurological issues. The Director of NIH will annually report the study results to Congress. The FDA will intensify postmarket research on saline breast implants based on recommendations from their panel. The Commissioner of Food and Drugs will report to Congress on the implementation status of these recommendations at regular intervals. Expansion and intensification of activities regarding silicone breast implants at the FDA. The FDA will expedite the conclusion of a criminal investigation into a breast implant manufacturer, brief Congress on the findings, and ensure up-to-date consumer information on breast implants. The FDA requires manufacturers of silicone breast implants to update package inserts and informed consent documents regularly with accurate information on local complications and ruptures. The FDA mandates manufacturers of silicone breast implants to update package inserts and informed consent documents regularly to include accurate information on local complications and ruptures. Manufacturers conducting clinical studies on these implants must provide patients with the FDA's breast implant booklet and informed consent documents. The FDA requires manufacturers of silicone breast implants to update informed consent documents to include accurate information on complications and ruptures. Patients must receive a copy of these documents at the initial consultation, be informed on how to obtain a Medwatch form, and be provided with inclusion criteria for participation in clinical studies. The FDA mandates manufacturers of silicone breast implants to update informed consent documents with accurate information on complications and ruptures. Patients should receive this information at the initial consultation, along with details on how to obtain a Medwatch form and inclusion criteria for clinical trials. Additionally, a special patient information panel is appointed annually to review breast implant information and advertisements for accuracy. The FDA requires manufacturers to provide accurate information on complications and ruptures in informed consent documents for silicone breast implants. A special patient panel, including breast implant recipients and medical experts, reviews information and advertisements for accuracy."
