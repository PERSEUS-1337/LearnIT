Offices of inspector general (OIGs) conduct audits, investigations, and may have law enforcement authority, including carrying firearms, making arrests without warrants, and executing warrants for arrest or search. Federal inspectors general (IGs) have significant independence and powers to combat waste, fraud, and abuse in federal departments and agencies. OIGs may engage in official duties, make arrests without warrants, and execute warrants for arrest, search, or seizure of evidence. Some OIGs believe law enforcement authority is essential for certain missions, especially when investigations pose safety risks. This report lists statutes and regulations that grant OIGs law enforcement authority and provides resources to support their need for such authority. Some federal inspectors general (IGs) believe law enforcement authority is crucial for certain missions, especially when safety risks are involved. OIGs may release public statements detailing their need for weapons or ammunition, as seen in the case of the Social Security Administration's OIG in August 2012. The SSA's OIG explained an ammunition purchase that drew public attention, clarifying that the type of ammunition ordered is standard for law enforcement agencies. The ammunition is used by OIG special agents for training and safety purposes, similar to what is used at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center. The USDA's OIG also faced inquiries about solicitations for weapons and body armor. The USDA's OIG received inquiries about solicitations for weapons and body armor to replace automatic firearms with new semi-automatic firearms. Mr. Paul Feeney, deputy counsel at the OIG, explained that the OIG is authorized to pursue criminal activity, fraud, and abuses impairing USDA's program and operations. The USDA OIG's criminal investigation responsibilities are extensive, with over 2,000 indictments, 1,350 convictions, and $460 million in monetary results from 2012 to 2014. OIG Special Agents can make arrests, execute warrants, and carry firearms for investigations involving potentially life-threatening situations. The USDA OIG's criminal investigation responsibilities are extensive, with OIG special agents conducting undercover operations and surveillance to investigate criminal activities such as fraud, theft, bribery, smuggling, and assaults against USDA employees. OIG can be vested with law enforcement authority explicitly under the IG Act of 1978. An OIG can be vested with law enforcement authority either explicitly under the IG Act of 1978 or by the Attorney General based on specific criteria. Additionally, some OIGs can have law enforcement authority through statutes outside the IG Act, as seen with six federal entities. The IG Act of 1978 provides law enforcement authority to 25 federal entities named in Section 6(e)(3). The Attorney General can delegate this authority if an OIG is hindered in their responsibilities, lacks assistance from other agencies, and has proper safeguards in place. The Attorney General has delegated law enforcement authority to OIGs in 10 federal agencies, including the National Archives, Amtrak, and the Securities and Exchange Commission, among others. This authority is granted under the IG Act of 1978 to ensure proper exercise of powers with internal safeguards in place. The National Science Foundation, Federal Housing Finance Agency, Securities and Exchange Commission, and Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction are among the agencies authorized by the Attorney General to have law enforcement powers under the IG Act. Guidelines were issued by then-Attorney General John Ashcroft on December 8, 2003, outlining the scope and limitations of these authorities, including training requirements for employees with law enforcement authority. OIGs with law enforcement authority must complete various training, including the Basic Criminal Investigator Training Program and firearms training. They must also follow the DOJ's deadly force policy and receive periodic refresher training in various legal and investigative areas. The OIGs with law enforcement authority must follow DOJ policies, receive training in various areas, and consult with DOJ before using electronic surveillance or starting undercover investigations. Some OIGs have law enforcement authority through laws outside of the IG Act. The Bureau of Justice Statistics maintains data on federal law enforcement officers, including OIGs. In September 2008, 33 OIGs had a total of 3,501 authorized agents to carry firearms, with no reported assaults or injuries to law enforcement officers within an OIG in that year."
