The \"MANIFEST for Human Spaceflight Act of 2016\" reaffirms Congress's goal for NASA to expand human presence beyond low-Earth orbit with international partners. The National Academy of Sciences reviewed human spaceflight goals and direction in a 2014 report titled \"Pathways to Exploration: Rationales and Approaches for a U.S. Program of Human Space Exploration\". The committee included leaders from various communities and gathered input from the public. The Committee on Human Spaceflight concluded that various rationales support human space exploration, including economic benefits, national security, scientific discovery, and inspiring citizens. They affirmed Mars as the long-term goal for human space flight and recommended focusing on it. The Committee on Human Spaceflight recommended that NASA define sustainable steps and conduct mission planning and technology development to place humans on Mars. The Committee on Human Spaceflight recommended NASA define sustainable steps and conduct mission planning and technology development to place humans on Mars. SEC. 3. HUMAN EXPLORATION STRATEGY. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2010 is amended to include human exploration of Mars, with a focus on extending human presence to the surface of Mars. The Administrator of NASA is directed to develop a strategy for human exploration of Mars. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2010 is amended to include human exploration of Mars through a series of sustainable missions utilizing cis-lunar space. The Administrator of NASA is tasked with developing a strategy for achieving this objective. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2010 is amended to include sustainable missions in cis-lunar space using the Space Launch System and Orion crew capsule. The Administrator of NASA is required to develop a strategy for an expanded human presence in cis-lunar space to enable missions to various destinations including Mars. The curr_chunk discusses the importance of exploring lunar orbits, the lunar surface, asteroids, Mars, and the moons of Mars for future human exploration. It also highlights the benefits of an expanded human presence in cis-lunar space for economic, scientific, and technological advancements, as well as opportunities for collaboration with international partners, private industry, and other Federal agencies. The curr_chunk discusses the opportunities provided by the International Space Station for scientific research and technological developments to support human presence in cis-lunar space and beyond. It also explores various exploration mission architectures for missions identified under paragraph (1), including capabilities for the Orion spacecraft. The curr_chunk discusses architectures and approaches for missions identified under paragraph (1), including capabilities for the Orion crew capsule and the Space Launch System. It compares architectures based on factors like cost effectiveness, schedule resiliency, safety, sustainability, and opportunities for international collaboration. The curr_chunk discusses the potential of architectures and approaches to create new markets, opportunities for industry, scientific discovery, technological excellence, competitiveness, leadership, and national security considerations. It also highlights the flexibility of these architectures to adapt to evolving needs. The curr_chunk discusses measures for setting standards to ensure crew health and safety, including radiation exposure limits, urgent medical care, and other safety issues. The curr_chunk provides a detailed plan for crew training needs, prioritizing missions, and intermediate destinations for ensuring safety and health in missions. The curr_chunk outlines prioritizing near-term intermediate destinations and missions, as well as assessing recommendations from a previous report to ensure their incorporation into the strategy. The Administrator ensures recommendations are incorporated into the strategy, and technical information is provided to identify interest from potential stakeholders. An independent review by the National Academy of Sciences is conducted for each interim report. The National Academy of Sciences reviews and comments on each interim report, identifying agreed-upon matters, concerns, and making further recommendations related to the strategy. The National Academy of Sciences provides further recommendations on matters covered in interim reports, ensuring timely review and comment to comply with requirements and facilitate incorporation of comments. The Administrator must submit interim reports every five years to the National Academy of Sciences for review and comment on the strategy required by paragraph (1) of the Act. The Administrator must submit final reports to Congress on the strategy required by paragraph (1) of the Act, incorporating the National Academy of Sciences' response to the interim reports. The Administrator must submit final reports to Congress on the strategy required by the Act, incorporating the National Academy of Sciences' response."
