    "content": "The \"Voting Restoration Act\" is the short title of this Act, which aims to restore voting rights. The Voting Restoration Act aims to restore voting rights by ensuring that the right to vote in all governmental elections is not denied based on race, sex, color, or previous conditions of servitude. Congress has ultimate supervisory power over Federal elections, and there is no uniform eligibility standard for participating in Federal elections due to different rules in each State regarding ex-felon voting eligibility. Different States have varying rules on ex-felon voting eligibility in Federal elections. While some States prohibit inmates from voting while serving their sentences, others disenfranchise ex-offenders even after completing their sentences. The process to regain voting rights is challenging, with requirements such as a pardon from the Governor or action from the parole board in different States. An estimated 3,900,000 Americans, or approximately 2 percent of the adult population, are currently ineligible to vote due to felony convictions. Three-fourths of these individuals are on probation, parole, or are ex-offenders. In some States, Federal offenders must obtain a Presidential pardon to regain their voting rights. The number of incarcerated individuals has grown exponentially in recent years, with 1 in 4 prison inmates in 1998 being incarcerated for a drug offense. Drug offenders made up 58 percent of Federal prison inmates in 1998, and more than one-third of women in prison are also incarcerated for drug offenses, which are predominantly nonviolent. One-third of women in prison are incarcerated for nonviolent drug offenses, with African-Americans disproportionately affected by racially disparate sentencing laws. Minorities are also impacted by laws that strip felons of their voting rights, leading to 1,400,000 African-American men being unable to participate in Federal elections. Congress should address discrepancies in voting rights that impact minority communities. The purpose of the Act is to restore voting eligibility to individuals who have completed sentences for criminal offenses and promote their participation in civic life. Protection of the right to vote and register in federal elections is emphasized in Section 3. The right to vote in federal elections cannot be denied based on a felony conviction, except while under state custody. Enforcement includes a private right of action for violations. Private right of action allows aggrieved individuals to bring civil action for violations of the Act if not corrected within specified time frames. Private right of action allows aggrieved individuals to bring civil action for violations of the Act without providing notice to the chief election official if the violation occurred within 30 days of a Federal election. Compensation for damages is also available for violations. The Attorney General can take legal action in court to address violations of the Act, seeking declaratory or injunctive relief as needed. If a violation occurs within three days of a Federal election, compensatory damages can be requested in a civil action without prior notice to the chief election official. Grant program to assist states in protecting rights of ex-felons to vote and register in federal elections. Establishment of a grant program by the Attorney General to assist eligible States in protecting the voting rights of individuals convicted of felonies in federal elections.

States can receive grants by meeting eligibility requirements, including submitting an application to the Attorney General. Additionally, States must conduct programs to increase voter registration rates among these individuals. The Attorney General's grant program requires States to submit an application with information and assurances to carry out voter registration programs for individuals convicted of felonies in federal elections. The grant amount awarded to a State is based on the total appropriation for the grants. The grant amount awarded to a State is based on the total appropriation for grants under this section and a percentage calculated from the number of individuals convicted of felonies in the State compared to all eligible States.

The program must establish an index of individuals convicted of felonies in the State who are under custody or supervision, including those on parole or probation.

The State must inform individuals convicted of felonies about their right to vote and the impact of any plea bargain on their voting rights. The State must notify convicted felons of their right to vote through various means, including media, the Internet, and cooperative agreements with public or private entities. Each State must also report to the attorney general. Each State receiving a grant must report to the Attorney General on activities related to informing convicted felons of their voting rights. The report should include the number and percentage of individuals informed of their right to register to vote. The program aims to increase voter registration rates among individuals convicted of felonies by reducing the number of felonies that result in disenfranchisement. Each state receiving a grant must carry out this program. The program under the Act aims to increase voter registration rates among individuals convicted of felonies by establishing an index of eligible individuals and implementing effective methods. The program aims to increase voter registration rates among individuals convicted of felonies by implementing activities to boost registration by at least 50% over a 5-year period. The State receives a grant to increase voting rates among convicted felons. It seeks cooperation with public and private service providers for this program. Private entities in the State provide services to individuals convicted of felonies and use the information to meet program requirements. States receiving grants must report to the Attorney General on program activities, including the number and percentage of convicted felons registered to vote. The report will detail the number and percentage of convicted felons in the State who are registered to vote and participated in the recent elections. The Attorney General will offer technical assistance to States receiving grants under the program. An annual report will be submitted to the Judiciary Committees of the House of Representatives and Senate on program activities.
