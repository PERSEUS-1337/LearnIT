    "content": "The \"Child Care Infrastructure Act of 1996\" allows for a credit for employer expenses for child care assistance under the new section 45D of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"Child Care Infrastructure Act of 1996\" introduces a credit for employer-provided child care expenses under section 38 of the Internal Revenue Code. The credit is 50% of qualified child care expenditures, not exceeding $150,000 per year. Qualified expenses include property acquisition, construction, rehabilitation, or expansion for child care purposes. The \"Child Care Infrastructure Act of 1996\" introduces a credit for employer-provided child care expenses under section 38 of the Internal Revenue Code. Qualified child care expenditure refers to amounts paid or incurred for property used as part of a qualified child care facility, eligible for depreciation deduction, and not part of the taxpayer's or any employee's principal residence. The taxpayer or any employee can use the credit for employer-provided child care expenses for operating costs of a qualified child care facility, including employee training, scholarship programs, and increased compensation. The taxpayer can use the credit for employer-provided child care expenses for a qualified child care facility that provides dependent care services or resource and referral services to employees. A qualified child care facility is a facility that primarily offers dependent care assistance. A qualified child care facility must meet all state and local regulations, including licensing requirements. The facility cannot be the operator's principal residence. A qualified child care facility must meet state and local regulations, including licensing requirements, and cannot be the operator's principal residence. Enrollment must be open to the taxpayer's employees, and the facility cannot be the taxpayer's main business unless at least 30% of enrollees are employees' dependents. A qualified child care facility must meet state and local regulations, including licensing requirements. Enrollment must be open to the taxpayer's employees, and the facility cannot be the taxpayer's main business unless at least 30% of enrollees are employees' dependents. Discrimination in favor of highly compensated employees is not allowed. If there is a recapture event with respect to any qualified child, the Acquisition and Construction Credit may be recaptured. If a recapture event occurs with a qualified child care facility, the taxpayer's tax for the year will increase by a percentage of the decrease in credits from prior years if the qualified child care expenditures were zero. The taxpayer's tax may increase if expenditures for a qualified child care facility were zero, with the applicable recapture percentage determined from a specific table. The taxpayer's tax may increase if expenditures for a qualified child care facility were zero, with recapture percentages ranging from 100% in Years 1-3 to 25% in Year 8. The taxpayer may face increased taxes if there were no expenditures for a qualified child care facility, with recapture percentages decreasing over time from 100% in Years 1-3 to 0% in Years 11 and beyond. The term 'recapture event' in this subsection refers to the cessation of operation or change in ownership of a qualified child care facility, leading to potential tax implications for the taxpayer. The credit described in subsection (a) can be allowed if the person acquiring an interest in a facility agrees in writing to assume the recapture liability of the person disposing of the interest before the disposition. In the event of an assumption of ownership, the acquiring person will be treated as the taxpayer for recapture liability purposes. The tax increase applies only to credits used to reduce tax liability under this section. In the case of credits not used to reduce tax liability, adjustments will be made to carryforwards and carrybacks under section 39. Any tax increase under this subsection will not affect the amount of credits under subpart A, B, or D. No recapture will be required due to casualty loss. The tax increase under this subsection will not impact credits under subpart A, B, or D. No recapture is needed for a casualty loss if it is restored within a reasonable period. Special rules apply for the allocation of tax credits among partners in partnerships, as prescribed by the Secretary. All persons treated as a single employer are considered a single taxpayer. No double benefit is allowed under this section. The credit allocation among partners in partnerships is regulated by the Secretary. If a credit is determined for property expenditures, the basis of the property is reduced by that amount. Recapture amounts during taxable years are subject to certain dispositions. During any taxable year, if a recapture amount is determined for property with reduced basis, the basis of the property shall be increased by the recapture amount. Recapture amount refers to any tax increase determined under subsection (d). The term 'recapture amount' refers to any tax increase determined under subsection (d). No other deductions or credits are allowed with respect to the credit determined under this section. This section does not apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1999. Section 38(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by removing \"plus\" at the end of paragraph (11). Section 38(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include a new paragraph for the employer-provided child care credit under section 45D. Additionally, the table of sections for subpart D of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 is updated to reflect this change. The employer-provided child care credit under section 45D applies to taxable years starting after December 31, 1996."
