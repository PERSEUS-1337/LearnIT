    "content": "The U.S. EPA proposed to repeal the controversial Clean Power Plan (CPP) in October 2017. The CPP aimed to limit CO2 emissions from fossil-fuel-fired power plants but has faced legal challenges and has not been implemented. Stakeholders have debated the rule's legal basis, design, and cost-benefit analysis. The Clean Power Plan (CPP) established national CO2 emission rates under the Clean Air Act Section 111(d). States had the option to comply through a \"rate-based\" or \"mass-based\" approach. The Clean Power Plan (CPP) allowed states to choose between a rate-based or mass-based approach to achieve emission reductions. States had flexibility in how to meet the standards while minimizing costs. EPA projected a 32% reduction in total power sector CO2 emissions nationwide under the CPP. The EPA provided a regulatory analysis in 2015 on the benefits and costs of the Clean Power Plan (CPP), projecting a 32% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2030. The proposed repeal of the CPP signifies a significant shift in the Administration's stance on the policy and legal issues. EPA's decision to repeal the CPP is based on a new interpretation of its authority under the Clean Air Act. The EPA determined that the Clean Power Plan (CPP) exceeded legal authority by setting CO2 emission goals for existing power plants that could only realistically be achieved using measures outside the plants' fence line. The agency also estimated the benefits and costs of the proposed repeal, which is considered an economically significant regulatory action. The Trump EPA's current legal interpretation states that the benefits and costs are not relevant to the decision about the proposed repeal. The EPA lacked statutory authority to promulgate the CPP in 2015. The benefit-cost analysis of the proposed repeal reveals methodological changes that may influence how EPA estimates benefits and costs of other regulations. Members of Congress and a group of 19 Senators have shown interest in understanding EPA's analysis of the proposed repeal. The EPA's 2017 benefit-cost comparisons differ from the 2015 analysis. A group of 19 Senators requested more information about the benefit-cost analysis for the proposed repeal. Changes in EPA's 2017 analysis may impact how federal agencies consider climate and human health benefits in regulations. This report summarizes EPA's analysis of the CPP's impacts for its proposed repeal. The report summarizes EPA's analysis of the impacts of the Clean Power Plan (CPP) for its proposed repeal, focusing on the comparison of benefit-cost analyses between 2015 and 2017. Key changes in the 2017 analysis include the estimation of climate benefits. The report compares EPA's 2015 and 2017 benefit-cost analyses of the Clean Power Plan, highlighting changes in the 2017 analysis such as estimating climate benefits, considering human health co-benefits, and accounting for energy savings impact. For more details on EPA's rationale for the proposed repeal, refer to CRS Report R44992, and for legal aspects, see CRS Legal Sidebar LSB10016. EPA conducts benefit-cost analyses for significant regulatory actions like the CPP. EPA prepares benefit-cost analyses for significant regulatory actions, such as the Clean Power Plan, in accordance with Executive Order 12866. The order directs federal agencies to examine the benefits and costs of regulatory actions to ensure that the benefits justify the costs. E.O. 12866 remains in effect today, directing federal agencies to assess benefits and costs of significant regulatory actions. These actions are defined as rules with an annual impact on the economy of $100 million or more, creating inconsistencies with other agency actions, altering budget impacts, or raising novel legal or policy issues. Rules that are economically significant must undergo a detailed regulatory analysis as per E.O. 12866. OMB Circular A-4 provides guidance on what constitutes a good regulatory analysis, including the need for the proposed action, analyzing alternative approaches, and assessing benefits. The OMB Circular A-4 outlines best practices for regulatory analysis, emphasizing the importance of explicitly stating the need for proposed actions, analyzing alternatives, and assessing benefits and costs. It aims to standardize the measurement and reporting of economically significant regulatory actions across federal agencies, in line with E.O. 12866. The analysis should determine whether the benefits of an action justify the costs, without requiring monetized benefits to outweigh costs. The \"justify\" criterion in regulatory analysis does not mandate that monetized benefits exceed costs. E.O. 12866 and Circular A-4 acknowledge the difficulty in quantifying all impacts of a regulatory proposal. Agencies are directed to quantify benefits and costs of significant regulations \"whenever possible\" but also consider non-quantified impacts that are important. EPA found the CPP economically justified in 2015. The EPA determined that the impacts of the CPP were economically significant and prepared a regulatory analysis. State-specific emission rate goals were calculated for the rate-based scenario, and state-specific emission goals for the mass-based scenario. The scenarios were considered illustrative, with states having flexibility in implementation. EPA characterized scenarios as illustrative, noting states' flexibility in CPP implementation. Emission reductions and compliance costs were estimated using the Integrated Planning Model. Compliance costs were based on the net change in emissions. EPA's analysis represented their best assessment of likely impacts under different state approaches. The EPA reported compliance costs for the Clean Power Plan (CPP) as the projected additional cost of complying with the regulations. These costs were based on changes in capital investment, operating pollution controls, fuel shifts, energy efficiency measures, and other actions associated with compliance. The estimates also included costs for monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping. The CPP was expected to reduce CO2 emissions and non-GHG emissions. The EPA expected the Clean Power Plan (CPP) to reduce CO2 emissions and non-GHG emissions. They used the IPM model to estimate CO2 reduction and applied the social cost of carbon (SCC) to determine the economic value of climate benefits. SCC includes changes in agricultural productivity, property damage, and energy system costs. The EPA estimated the human health benefits of reductions from non-GHG emissions, referred to as \"co-benefits\" because the CPP did not target those emissions. They quantified reductions in SO2 and NOx emissions, monetizing the benefits of reduced exposure to PM and ozone. The EPA calculated the average dollar value of human health benefits associated with reducing PM and ozone emissions using a \"benefit-per-ton\" approach. These estimates represented the value of reducing premature deaths and illnesses linked to exposure to pollutants, with PM health effects contributing significantly to the monetized health co-benefits estimates. The EPA calculated the average dollar value of human health benefits associated with reducing PM and ozone emissions. PM health effects accounted for most of the monetized health co-benefits estimates, with reductions in premature deaths related to PM exposure making up 98% of the estimates. SO2 emission reductions contributed significantly to the value of estimated PM health co-benefits, representing roughly 80-85% of the estimated dollar value of human health co-benefits in the scenarios analyzed for 2030. Ozone health effects accounted for a smaller share of the monetized health co-benefits. After finalizing the CPP, the Trump Administration proposed to repeal it, following the same rulemaking process. EPA is required to adhere to the same rulemaking process under Clean Air Act Section 307(d) regardless of whether a rule is promulgated, revised, or repealed. The EPA prepared a regulatory analysis for the proposed repeal of the Clean Power Plan, following the requirements of the Clean Air Act Section 307(d). The analysis focused on summarizing data and specifying the methodology used. The repeal was based on a change in legal interpretation of the Clean Air Act, leading to a revisit of the 2015 CPP regulatory analysis as an economically significant action. The EPA followed guidelines for economic analyses in preparing the regulatory analysis. The EPA prepared a regulatory analysis for the proposed repeal of the Clean Power Plan, focusing on the benefits and costs of the repeal. The benefits are the avoided compliance costs, while the costs are the forgone reductions in CO2 and non-GHG emissions. EPA defined the costs of the proposed CPP repeal as the forgone reductions in CO2 and non-GHG emissions, along with associated climate and health benefits. The agency plans to conduct updated power sector modeling using IPM for public comment before finalizing the repeal. The EPA finalized the proposed repeal of the CPP based on power sector modeling using IPM in 2015 and more recent projections from the U.S. Energy Information Administration's AEO 2017. Compliance costs and emissions reductions were used to monetize avoided costs and forgone benefits. The EPA used the AEO 2017 results to monetize compliance costs and emissions reductions under the CPP mass-based scenario. They also changed the accounting treatment of cost savings from energy efficiency measures, counting them as a positive benefit in the proposed repeal. EPA counted energy efficiency savings as a positive benefit of the CPP, with the 2015 analysis showing benefits outweighing costs. The 2017 analysis presented less favorable benefit-cost comparisons, with net benefits resulting when benefits exceed costs. The 2015 analysis of the CPP showed net benefits ranging from $25 billion to $45 billion in 2030, while the 2017 analysis ranged from net costs of $28.3 billion to net benefits of $14 billion in the same year. The 2017 analysis did not explicitly state the agency's view on the proposed repeal. Estimates for 2030 ranged from $28.3 billion in net costs to $14 billion in net benefits of the proposed repeal. The 2017 analysis did not explicitly state the agency's view on whether the benefits of the repeal are likely to outweigh the costs. Half of the benefit-cost comparisons showed net benefits to repeal the CPP, while the other half showed net costs. The AEO-based benefit-cost estimates for the proposed repeal of the CPP in 2030 ranged from $30.6 billion in net costs to $14.0 billion in net benefits. The effect of updated power sector projections on these estimates is unclear. EPA noted that the benefit-cost estimates based on its 2015 power sector modeling did not reflect recent changes in the power sector. The EPA's benefit-cost estimates for the proposed repeal of the CPP in 2030 are uncertain due to changes in the power sector, including shifts to lower-emitting sources. The AEO 2017 projections suggest potentially lower CO2 emission reductions and compliance costs compared to 2015 estimates. The EPA's AEO 2017 projections show a shift to lower-emitting sources, potentially reducing CO2 emissions and compliance costs under the CPP. The agency plans to update its power sector modeling before finalizing the proposed repeal, with higher SO2 reductions leading to increased human health co-benefits. The AEO 2017 scenarios projected higher human health co-benefits due to increased SO2 reductions compared to EPA's 2015 estimates. A study by Resources for the Future found greater coal emission reductions under the CPP in 2030 than EPA's 2015 estimates. The study highlighted uncertainties in the differences between models used in the 2015 RIA projections and the 2017 AEO projections. EPA made three primary changes in its analysis of the CPP's benefits and costs compared to 2015. EPA made three primary changes in its analysis of the CPP's benefits and costs compared to 2015. Specifically, they revised estimates of the SCC, assumed no human health co-benefits below set pollution levels, and counted energy efficiency savings as benefits. These changes accounted for the differences in conclusions between the 2015 and 2017 analyses. The EPA made three key changes in its analysis of the CPP's benefits and costs compared to 2015. The changes included revising estimates of the SCC, assuming no human health co-benefits below set pollution levels, and counting energy efficiency savings as benefits. EPA and other federal agencies use the SCC to value the climate benefits of CO2 reductions from rulemakings. The SCC is an estimate of the monetary value of impacts from a change in CO2 emissions in a given year. The Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) is an estimate of the monetary value of impacts from a change in CO2 emissions in a given year, including changes in agricultural productivity, property damage from increased flood risk, and energy system costs. SCC values are calculated using models that translate emissions changes into economic impacts. Analysts multiply SCC estimates by estimated CO2 emissions reductions to determine the monetary value of associated climate benefits. EPA estimated the climate benefits of the CPP in 2015 using four SCC values developed by an interagency working group. In 2015, EPA estimated the climate benefits of the CPP using four SCC values developed by an interagency working group (IWG). The IWG SCC estimates were $17, $53, $77, and $160 per metric ton of CO2 emissions in 2030 (2011$). The Trump Administration withdrew the IWG's SCC estimates in 2017. The Trump Administration withdrew the IWG's SCC estimates in 2017 and disbanded the IWG as part of E.O. 13783, which directed federal agencies to review federal requirements for domestic energy development. E.O. 13783 instructed agencies to ensure new estimates align with OMB Circular A-4, focusing on domestic benefits and costs with discount rates of 3% and 7%. Circular A-4 does not address specific regulation issues like climate change impacts. The EPA developed new interim values for the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) based on E.O. 13783, using similar models and assumptions as the disbanded IWG but focusing on domestic benefits and costs with discount rates of 3% and 7%. The EPA used three models to calculate domestic SCC estimates, adjusting global values to domestic values for one model. The interim domestic SCC estimates are $7 and $1 per metric ton of CO2 emissions in 2030 at discount rates of 3% and 7%, respectively. The United States emits CO2 and other GHGs which contribute to global GHG concentrations, affecting the global climate and having consequences worldwide. Stakeholders debate using domestic or global SCC values, with the IWG recommending global values in 2010. The IWG recommended global SCC values in 2010, stating that GHGs cause damages worldwide and should incorporate full global damages. EPA agreed in 2015, noting the interconnected global economy and potential spillover effects on national security, trade, and public health. Some stakeholders supported using global SCC estimates to avoid understating benefits. Some stakeholders supported using global SCC estimates to avoid understating benefits due to spillover effects on national security, trade, and public health. Others argued for a focus on global SCC values, citing economic, strategic, ethical, and legal justifications. Some stakeholders recommended using domestic SCC estimates for U.S. climate regulations in 2015, citing consistency with OMB Circular A-4 guidance and concerns about overstating benefits with global values. The 2017 analysis of the proposed repeal by the EPA focused on domestic SCC estimates in line with E.O. 13873 and OMB Circular A-4 guidance, which emphasizes benefits and costs for U.S. citizens and residents. Global SCC values may overstate benefits for country-specific rulemaking. The EPA's 2017 analysis of the proposed repeal focused on domestic SCC estimates, in line with E.O. 13873 and OMB Circular A-4 guidance, which prioritizes benefits and costs for U.S. citizens and residents. Global estimates were presented as part of a sensitivity analysis, but not compared to the avoided costs of the repeal. EPA acknowledged challenges in accurately estimating the domestic SCC, particularly in capturing relevant regional factors. The EPA and NAS highlighted challenges in estimating the domestic SCC due to difficulties in capturing relevant regional interactions. OMB Circular A-4 discusses discount rate selection for benefit-cost analysis. The EPA and NAS noted challenges in estimating the domestic SCC due to regional interactions. OMB Circular A-4 guides discount rate selection for benefit-cost analysis, recommending rates of 3% and 7% based on scenarios impacting consumer spending or private capital. The 3% rate, known as the \"consumption rate,\" reflects the average saver's discount rate for future consumption. The 3% rate, called the \"consumption rate,\" is based on the real rate of return on long-term government debt, while the 7% rate is tied to the opportunity cost of capital. Discounting in the SCC calculation allows for comparisons of climate change impacts over a long period. Discounting in the SCC calculation is essential for comparing economic impacts over time. The selection of a discount rate is challenging due to the intergenerational aspect of climate change, as the current generation must choose on behalf of future generations without their input. The current generation must choose a discount rate for future generations without their input, raising questions about accounting for future preferences. Different discount rates impact present values, with SCC estimates being highly sensitive to rate selection. The literature shows that lower discount rates result in higher present values, with SCC estimates being highly sensitive to rate selection. OMB Circular A-4 recommends conducting sensitivity analysis with lower discount rates, noting intergenerational rate estimates ranging from 1% to 3% in the 1990s. The Circular has not been updated since 2003, but under the Obama Administration, the Council of Economic Advisers assessed the discount rates in light of more recent market data in January 2017. The Council of Economic Advisers assessed the Circular A-4 discount rates in January 2017, recommending lowering the 3% rate to at most 2 percent and reducing the 7% rate. Stakeholders have divergent views on discount rate selection for the SCC, with environmental groups advocating for lower rates and industry groups recommending higher rates. The federal government is advised to use lower discount rates for the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC), with industry groups suggesting higher rates like 7%. The majority of climate change studies use rates of no more than 5%, according to the NAS. In 2010, the Interagency Working Group (IWG) recommended that the SCC discount rate should reflect the average saver's consumption rate, not the 7% rate based on the opportunity cost of capital. The Interagency Working Group (IWG) recommended discount rates of 2.5%, 3%, and 5% for the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC), diverging from the 7% rate based on the opportunity cost of capital. Academics and the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) have suggested alternative approaches to calculating discount rates to better account for uncertainty over long periods of time. The National Academy of Sciences recommended a new method for federal agencies to calculate discount rates for the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC), stating that the OMB Circular A-4 guidance is insufficient. EPA used interim SCC estimates for the proposed repeal, resulting in lower benefit estimates. EPA estimated the forgone climate benefits of the proposed repeal using interim SCC estimates, which produced lower benefit estimates than in 2015. Lower SCC values in the 2017 analysis reduced climate benefit estimates under the CPP. EPA acknowledged limitations of the interim SCC estimates. Table 2 summarizes the climate benefit and forgone estimates from two analyses. EPA conducted a sensitivity analysis using global values and a 2.5% discount rate. The 2017 analysis excluded human health co-benefits from some benefit-cost comparisons. EPA did not directly compare sensitivity analysis estimates to avoided compliance costs of the proposed repeal. The EPA's 2017 analysis diverged from the 2015 analysis by excluding human health co-benefits from some benefit-cost comparisons. Different benefit-cost comparisons either counted all, partially included, or completely excluded the forgone health co-benefits. One comparison focused solely on the forgone benefits from CO2, excluding health co-benefits entirely. The EPA's 2017 analysis excluded human health co-benefits from some benefit-cost comparisons, focusing solely on the forgone benefits from CO2. EPA stated that this approach may be appropriate for evaluating regulatory actions and requested public comment on the extent to rely on consideration of benefits. The EPA requested public comment on evaluating regulatory actions by considering benefits from reductions in a targeted pollutant relative to costs. Stakeholders raised concerns about including co-benefits, such as reduced exposure to PM, in regulatory analysis. Some questioned the attribution of PM benefits in EPA's analysis. The EPA's analysis of the Clean Power Plan (CPP) included monetized co-benefits, which some stakeholders criticized for potentially double-counting benefits. The 2015 analysis clarified that human health co-benefits were incremental to existing regulations on particulate matter (PM) and related emissions. Consideration of co-benefits is standard in benefit-cost analysis according to federal guidance. The principle of benefit-cost analysis includes quantifying and monetizing co-benefits and adverse impacts, as directed by federal guidance such as OMB Circular A-4 and EPA's Guidelines for Preparing Economic Analyses. OMB reports highlight that EPA's Clean Air Act analyses monetize co-benefits. The OMB's recent reports to Congress on the benefits and costs of federal regulations noted that EPA's Clean Air Act analyses monetize co-benefits, attributing large estimated benefits to the reduction in public exposure to fine particulate matter. This approach is consistent with standard accounting practices and has long been required under OMB Circular A-4. EPA applied a threshold to the forgone health co-benefits in the last two benefit-cost comparisons. The EPA applied a threshold to forgone health co-benefits in recent benefit-cost comparisons, counting only those exceeding a defined threshold for ambient PM levels. This diverged from past practice by using a threshold to calculate PM mortality impacts. The 2017 analysis by EPA used thresholds based on federal air quality standards for PM to calculate mortality impacts. One threshold was set at 12 \u03bcg/m3, assuming no deaths below it, while the second threshold was based on the lowest measured levels from long-term studies. EPA assumed no deaths below 5.8 \u03bcg/m3 and 8 \u03bcg/m3 in the studies. The PM air quality standard threshold, higher than the LML, significantly impacted the forgone co-benefit estimates and benefit-cost comparisons of the proposed repeal. Using the PM air quality standard threshold favored the repeal, while using the LML as a threshold was less favorable. EPA justified the use of these thresholds. EPA favored the proposed repeal when using the PM air quality standard threshold but was less favorable with the LML threshold. The thresholds were used to enhance transparency and provide insight into uncertainty in estimating PM benefits. EPA justified the use of these thresholds based on previous analyses showing greater uncertainty in estimating health risks below the federal standard. EPA justified using the LML threshold to examine uncertainty in PM-related mortality benefits, citing scientific evidence and peer-reviewed studies. The agency acknowledged the lack of a clear dividing line for setting a threshold, referencing the NAS and its 2009 Integrated Science Assessment for Particulate Matter. The EPA's 2015 analysis concluded that a no-threshold model best represents the PM-mortality concentration-response relationship, acknowledging lower confidence in benefits at lower concentrations of PM. The federal air quality standards are not \"risk-free,\" with some risk of adverse health effects even at levels meeting the standard. The analysis found benefits both above and below the federal air quality standard levels. The EPA's 2015 analysis found benefits of pollution control both above and below federal air quality standards. The agency plans to further research and evaluate the uncertainty associated with estimating health impacts using the benefit-per-ton approach. The EPA plans to evaluate the benefit-per-ton approach for estimating health impacts of pollutants like PM and conduct detailed air quality modeling. In 2017, the EPA changed the accounting treatment of demand-side energy efficiency savings from a negative cost to a benefit. The EPA changed the accounting treatment of energy efficiency savings from a negative cost to a benefit, resulting in increased cost and benefit estimates in their analysis. The EPA changed the accounting treatment of energy efficiency savings, resulting in higher estimates of costs and benefits for the proposed repeal of the CPP. The EPA's change in accounting treatment for energy efficiency savings led to higher estimates of costs and benefits for the proposed repeal of the CPP under E.O. 13771. The analysis reported cost savings but omitted the forgone benefits of regulation. The EPA's analysis under E.O. 13771 reported cost savings of the proposed repeal of two prior regulations but omitted the forgone benefits. The cost savings exceeded the compliance costs considered in the 2015 benefit-cost analysis. The EPA's analysis under E.O. 13771 found that costs exceeded compliance costs considered in the 2015 benefit-cost analysis. Benefit-cost analysis informs policy decisions by evaluating potential effects of regulatory options, but does not solely determine regulatory proposals. Qualitative impacts not captured in monetized estimates may also influence decisions on whether benefits justify costs. Quantifying and monetizing the benefits and costs of a proposed regulation can be complex, with decisionmakers considering various factors such as legal, technical, statutory, and ethical considerations. For example, the EPA's proposed CPP repeal was based on a change in legal interpretation and adherence to rulemaking procedures. Important qualitative impacts not captured in monetized estimates may also inform decisions on whether the benefits justify the costs of an action. Quantifying and monetizing the benefits and costs of a proposed regulation can be complex, drawing upon scientific data from multiple disciplines and involving ethical or policy-based decisions. Changes in policy priorities and technical information can influence the estimation of benefits and costs, as seen in EPA's analyses of the 2015 CPP and the 2017 proposed repeal. EPA's 2017 benefit-cost analysis reached different conclusions than the 2015 analysis due to changes in estimation methods. The EPA's 2017 benefit-cost analysis differed from the 2015 analysis due to changes in estimating economic impacts, including the use of new SCC estimates and thresholds that affected climate and human health benefit estimates. Congress has varying views on EPA regulatory policy, especially regarding GHG-related regulations. As EPA considers repealing the CPP, Congress may assess how policy priorities influence regulatory decisions. The EPA's assessment of the benefits and costs of the CPP changed between the Trump and Obama Administrations, reflecting differences in policy priorities. Congress may consider the impact of regulatory decisions on major industries and the health of U.S. citizens. EPA's 2017 analysis used \"interim\" SCC estimates, differing from the Obama Administration's IWG SCC estimates. The EPA's 2017 analysis used \"interim\" SCC estimates developed in response to E.O. 13783, differing from the Obama Administration's IWG SCC estimates. The interim SCC estimates followed a domestic perspective and used a 7% discount rate, lowering the estimated CPP climate benefits. Congress may consider the withdrawal of the IWG SCC estimates and its impact on federal agencies' valuation methods. Congress may also consider the implications of the withdrawal of the IWG SCC estimates on federal agencies' decisions regarding GHG-related regulations. EPA's 2017 analysis did not provide clear details on future steps for the SCC or its impact on other federal analyses. The EPA's 2017 analysis did not provide a timeline for updates on the impacts of climate change to the U.S. Other agencies like the U.S. Bureau of Land Management have followed a similar approach. The Department of Energy continued to use the IWG SCC estimates in one rulemaking despite their withdrawal. Congress may consider the precedent set by EPA's changes to health co-benefits analysis. The EPA's 2017 analysis showed different policy determinations in health co-benefits compared to the 2015 analysis. Both analyses acknowledged uncertainty in benefit estimates from PM reductions at lower concentrations. Congress may assess if EPA's changes will influence future air pollution rulemakings. The 2017 EPA analysis used a threshold to calculate PM mortality impacts, departing from previous analyses. It also excluded health co-benefits from a benefit-cost comparison, contrary to federal guidance."
