    "content": "Offshoring, or offshore outsourcing, involves U.S. businesses contracting with foreign firms for services previously done in-house. This practice has expanded from blue-collar to white-collar occupations, raising concerns about job loss among U.S. workers. The past decade has seen increased concerns about job loss and unemployment among U.S. workers due to offshore outsourcing. Despite firms moving work overseas for years, the impact on the labor market remains unclear. Some believe it contributed to the \"jobless recovery\" after the 2001 recession, while others argue that the link between economic growth and job creation still holds. Some argue that offshoring contributed to the \"jobless recovery\" after the 2001 recession, while others believe the labor market eventually recovered. Estimates suggest offshoring may have accounted for 3% of net job loss in the early 2000s. Concerns persist that offshoring is hindering the labor market's rebound from the 2007-2009 recession. Offshoring is seen as a factor in the slow recovery of the labor market post-2007-2009 recession. While globalization benefits the nation by offering a variety of products at lower prices, some question its impact on services offshoring. Offshoring of service activities may benefit companies by increasing profits through lower input costs, leading to higher dividends, stock prices, and mergers. The movement of service jobs overseas may have different implications for the labor market and public policy compared to production jobs. The offshoring of service activities may impact the labor market differently than production jobs. Factory workers typically have lower education levels, while administrative and professional workers often have college degrees. This shift in job skills raises concerns about college graduates facing a shortage of entry-level positions. The offshoring of service activities may result in a shortage of entry-level jobs for college graduates, raising concerns about the adequacy of existing trade adjustment assistance programs. Congress aims to promote job growth and assist workers affected by job losses due to economic downturns or shifts in job composition. The debate over job losses in the United States, whether due to economic downturns or shifts in job composition, has led to discussions on offshoring and its impact on domestic employment. Some policymakers advocate for measures to encourage U.S. firms to create more jobs domestically, while others support limited government intervention for promoting economic growth. This report briefly examines the development of outsourcing by U.S. companies and synthesizes information on offshore outsourcing's impact on U.S. employment since the early 2000s to help policymakers evaluate the nation's retraining and income adequacy. Offshore outsourcing has impacted U.S. employment since the early 2000s, with manufacturing work being relocated overseas decades before services offshoring. U.S. companies opened facilities abroad in response to competition, displacing well-paid U.S. factory workers. In the 1980s, U.S. companies began outsourcing activities previously done by well-paid factory workers to specialized domestic enterprises for efficiency. This trend continued over time, with jobs being outsourced to temporary help agencies, professional services, and independent contractors within the United States. The 2001 recession led U.S. employers to further outsource functions to achieve efficiencies through technological innovations, enabling offshoring beyond production jobs to other workers. The low cost, good quality, and high-speed transmission of voice and data communications have enabled U.S. firms to extend offshoring to service jobs, including IT workers and IT-enabled workers. Other countries have also enhanced their ability to export services, particularly IT services, to the United States and other developed countries, with events like addressing the Y2K crisis. One significant event that contributed to the ability of other countries to export IT services to the United States was addressing the Y2K crisis. This involved U.S. firms turning to companies in India to fix code issues, leading to a positive reception of the quality of work done by Indian programmers. Additionally, low-wage foreign nations have been producing a large number of well-educated individuals, including those with IT skills. The educational systems of low-wage foreign nations are producing an abundant supply of well-educated individuals with IT and accounting skills, sometimes exceeding local needs. This has allowed U.S.-based companies to outsource tasks to non-English-speaking, low-wage countries, leading to the fragmentation of tasks across borders. The globalization of tasks across borders, facilitated by advancements in technology and the availability of skilled workers in low-wage countries, has allowed U.S.-based companies to fragment tasks in manufacturing and services. This shift includes the outsourcing of intangible production tasks like research, design, management, and IT support to multiple countries. This trend, along with technological changes and deunionization, has contributed to increased wage dispersion in the United States. The increased wage dispersion in the United States in recent decades is attributed to offshoring, technological change, and deunionization. Data on job losses due to offshoring is limited, with the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics tracking layoffs involving firms moving work out of the country since 2004. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) has been tracking extended mass layoffs since 2004, focusing on large layoffs at firms with at least 50 employees. The series underestimates offshoring job losses, particularly in service providers, but consistently finds few job losses from work moving out of the U.S. In the third quarter of 2012, out of over 100,000 workers laid off, fewer than 1,600 were due to offshoring. In the third quarter of 2012, firms reported fewer than 1,600 workers were let go due to offshoring, with less than 1% moving jobs abroad. Forrester Research forecasted that 3.4 million service-sector jobs could potentially move overseas. Forrester Research projected that 3.4 million service-sector jobs could move abroad between 2003 and 2015, with 1.7 million jobs relocating outside the United States in the first 7 years. This forecasted loss of 300,000 jobs per year was considered a small share of the total jobs created and destroyed annually. Researchers have focused on identifying jobs susceptible to offshoring, estimating U.S. employment in these activities. Bardhan and Kroll found that 14 million jobs in 49 service occupations, about 11% of total U.S. employment in 2001, could be sent overseas. In 2001, 14 million jobs in 49 service occupations, representing about 11% of total U.S. employment, have characteristics that make them susceptible to being sent overseas. These characteristics include jobs that do not require in-person customer service, can be done through telecommuting, can be routinized, have a significant pay gap between the U.S. and destination countries, and face few language and cultural barriers. Occupational groups vulnerable to offshoring include office support, auditors, computer programmers, medical transcriptionists, and paralegals. The study focused on jobs susceptible to offshoring, such as office support, auditors, computer programmers, medical transcriptionists, and paralegals. Researchers projected potential job losses in various metropolitan areas due to offshoring, with minimal impact expected in most areas. The study projected potential job losses in metropolitan areas due to offshoring, with minimal impact expected in most areas. Only 2.2% of jobs in 246 areas were likely to be offshored between 2004 and 2015. Five metro areas, including Boulder, CO and San Francisco, CA, might lose between 3.1% and 4.3% of their jobs by 2015. Metropolitan areas most vulnerable to offshoring tend to be populous with 1 million or more inhabitants. Metropolitan areas most vulnerable to offshoring are typically populous with 1 million or more inhabitants, located in the Northeast and West, and have high concentrations of IT jobs or IT-enabled back-office jobs. Jensen and Kletzer developed a geographically based approach to estimate the share of offshorable and nonoffshorable jobs in manufacturing. Jensen and Kletzer developed a geographically based approach to estimate the share of tradable and nontradable jobs in various industries. In 2000, about 9.4% of total U.S. employment was in offshorable industries. Manufacturing and professional services industries were found to have above-average vulnerability to offshoring. Jensen and Kletzer analyzed the task content of 457 service occupations to determine their vulnerability to offshoring. They identified occupational groups such as computer and mathematical, architecture and engineering, legal, and life sciences as having a large share of offshorable jobs. The study by Jensen and Kletzer identified occupational groups like computer and mathematical, architecture and engineering, legal, and life sciences as having a large share of offshorable jobs. They found that service occupations with a higher level of educational attainment were more vulnerable to offshoring, accounting for 27.4% of all employment in services occupations in 2005. Service occupations with a higher percentage of bachelor's degree holders are more vulnerable to offshoring. Out of 515 service occupations, 160 are estimated to be susceptible to offshoring, with over half in professional and technical categories. In 2007, these offshorable occupations accounted for over one-fifth of total employment. In 2007, 30 million jobs in 160 offshorable service-providing occupations accounted for over one-fifth of total employment. Despite vulnerability to offshoring, these occupations saw slightly faster employment and wage growth between 2001-2007. However, the 33 most susceptible occupations experienced below-average growth in both employment and wages during this period. During the period, employment and wage growth varied among different occupations. The most vulnerable group included office and administrative support occupations with low education requirements, and professional and related occupations with higher educational requirements. An index of offshorability was created for various occupations based on the level of personal interaction required. Blinder estimated that a majority of U.S. occupations (533) and employed persons (92.6 million in 2004) are non offshorable, while a minority of occupations (about 200) and workers (almost 30 million) are highly offshorable or offshorable. This accounted for 22.2% of U.S. workers in 2004, but Blinder believed this was a conservative estimate due to technological advancements. Blinder estimated that 22.2% of U.S. workers in 2004 were in potentially offshorable jobs, but he believed this was a conservative estimate. He created moderate and aggressive estimates, with the aggressive estimate totaling almost 40 million workers or 29.0% of all U.S. jobs. Blinder noted that offshorable occupations are not necessarily low-end jobs in terms of wages or education. Blinder's research found that offshorable occupations are not necessarily low-end jobs in terms of wages or education. The correlation between skill and offshorability is almost zero, which contradicts previous research by Jensen and Kletzer. Blinder and Krueger used three survey methods to determine the vulnerability of jobs to offshoring, finding that about one in four U.S. jobs were at risk. Blinder and Krueger used three survey methods to determine that about one in four U.S. jobs are potentially offshorable, especially in factory and administrative support occupations, and industries like manufacturing, finance, information, and professional services. Some believe fears about services offshoring are exaggerated. Some believe fears about services offshoring in industries like finance, information, and professional services are overblown. Executives need to learn how to use offshore talent effectively to boost productivity. The management challenge will become more urgent as global salaries rise, reducing cost gains from offshore outsourcing. Deloitte Consulting predicts outsourcing will no longer be the \"holy grail\" and companies will be cautious about moving potentially vulnerable U.S. jobs abroad. In the future, companies will be cautious about outsourcing potentially vulnerable U.S. jobs. They will focus on retaining core functions in-house to maintain control and confidentiality. Some organizations may only outsource short-term, while others will re-insource to erode the outsourcing market. Dell, for example, brought back help services to the United States due to customer dissatisfaction. Some U.S. firms are bringing back IT services and call center operations to the United States, particularly in rural low-cost areas. \"Reshoring\" has contributed to the employment rebound in the manufacturing sector since the end of the 2007-2009 recession. About one-fifth of U.S. manufacturers surveyed in 2011 had brought production back from overseas. Perry found that about one-fifth of U.S. manufacturers brought production back from overseas in 2011 due to China's shrinking manufacturing advantages, long delivery times, rising shipping costs, quality control issues, and intellectual property concerns. Examples include Caterpillar, National Cash Register, Wham-O, Otis Elevator, and Buck Knives. Offshore providers of IT services were able to alleviate U.S. firms' security concerns post-9/11, allowing for continued outsourcing of maintenance jobs by U.S. airline carriers to overseas locations like Singapore and Brazil. Offshore providers of IT services have expanded their operations overseas, including countries like Singapore, Brazil, and the Dominican Republic, for both international and domestic aircraft. Concerns have also been raised about unrest in certain regions, prompting global software service providers to distribute work across various countries, including Canada and Mexico. Some U.S. employers prefer moving work to Canada due to fewer cultural differences with the U.S., potentially reducing customer dissatisfaction. Moving work to nearby Canada, with fewer cultural differences with the United States than India or the Philippines, reduces customer antipathy to offshoring. Despite rising labor costs in some Asian nations like India, low wages in countries like Vietnam continue to attract U.S. jobs. There is no comprehensive data on the number of U.S. workers losing jobs to offshore outsourcing, but empirical analyses focus on identifying jobs susceptible to moving beyond U.S. borders. The approach of identifying jobs susceptible to offshoring may overstate job losses as it does not consider all factors influencing employers' decisions on work location."
