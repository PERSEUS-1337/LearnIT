    "content": "The \"Tax Equity Act of 2009\" may be cited as the short title. It includes regional cost-of-living adjustments in individual income tax rates. The \"Tax Equity Act of 2009\" includes regional cost-of-living adjustments in individual income tax rates, with subsection (f) of section 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 amended to provide for these adjustments. The \"Tax Equity Act of 2009\" includes regional cost-of-living adjustments in individual income tax rates, with subsection (f) of section 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 amended to provide for these adjustments. The rate table for each individual's taxable year is adjusted by multiplying the minimum and maximum dollar amounts for each rate bracket by the applicable multiplier for that calendar year. The tax rate brackets are adjusted by a multiplier based on the individual's primary place of abode. The tax amount is also adjusted to reflect changes in the rate brackets. The tax rate brackets are adjusted annually based on the individual's primary place of abode. The Secretary determines applicable multipliers for each statistical area of the United States, which are used for taxable years beginning in the following calendar year. Amounts not multiples of $50 are rounded to the nearest multiple of $50. The tax rate brackets are adjusted annually based on the individual's primary place of abode in the United States. Applicable multipliers for each statistical area are determined by the Secretary for taxable years starting in the next calendar year. The cost-of-living differentials for statistical areas are determined annually based on percentage differentials, with specific multipliers assigned based on the range of differentials. The cost-of-living differential for any statistical area in a calendar year is calculated by dividing the area's cost-of-living by the average cost-of-living for the United States. The Secretary of Labor determines and publishes the cost-of-living for each calendar year after 2009. The Secretary of Labor determines and publishes a cost-of-living index for each statistical area based on average market prices for the area for the 12-month period ending on August 31 of the calendar year. The market prices for the cost-of-living index are determined based on the average prices in a statistical area for the 12-month period ending on August 31 of the calendar year, using the same methodology as the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers. A statistical area includes metropolitan statistical areas defined by the Secretary of Commerce and portions of states not within those areas. The amendment applies to taxable years starting after December 31, 2009, with a transition rule for prescribing multipliers. Areas outside the US have a multiplier of 1. The Internal Revenue Code, as added by this section, sets the date for prescribing applicable multipliers for taxable years starting in 2010 to be 1 year after the enactment of this Act."
