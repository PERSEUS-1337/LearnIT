The Congress finds that HIV/AIDS is predicted to become the worst infectious disease epidemic in history, surpassing the bubonic plague and the 1918-1919 influenza epidemic. The gap in HIV transmission from mother to child between rich and poor countries is widening, jeopardizing progress in child health. The transmission of HIV from mother to child is increasing, posing a threat to child survival in developing countries. UNAIDS predicts a significant rise in AIDS-related child mortality by 2010. The number of AIDS orphans worldwide is expected to triple in the next decade, leading to economic, social, and political challenges. The economic costs of infectious diseases, especially HIV/AIDS, could reduce gross domestic product by 20 percent or more by 2010 in some sub-Saharan African nations, contributing to economic decay, social fragmentation, and political destabilization in volatile societies. Children without care or hope may be drawn into prostitution, crime, substance abuse, or child soldiery. In sub-Saharan African nations, infectious diseases like HIV/AIDS could decrease GDP by 20% by 2010. Some countries have successfully implemented prevention programs to reduce HIV infection rates. US financial support for global medical research and disease containment benefits all Americans. Global strategy for medical research, education, and disease containment has significant benefits for Americans. Contribution to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria through the proposed Fourth Amendment to the IMF's Articles of Agreement is crucial in combating epidemics. International endorsement of the amendment in 1997 has not been fully implemented. The international community endorsed the proposed Fourth Amendment in September 1997, but it has not been implemented due to the lack of Congressional authorization. The Fourth Amendment has been accepted by 109 out of 110 members of the International Monetary Fund. Approval by the United States, holding 17.16 percent of the voting power, is crucial in combating epidemics. The International Monetary Fund seeks approval of the Fourth Amendment by the United States to allocate Special Drawing Rights. The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria leverages resources from donor nations to combat the HIV/AIDS crisis. The Bretton Woods Agreements Act is amended to accept the Fourth Amendment to allocate Special Drawing Rights to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. The United States Governor of the Fund accepts the Fourth Amendment to the Articles of Agreement. The Secretary of the Treasury is instructed to seek agreement for the Global Fund to hold special drawing rights. The Treasury will instruct the US Executive Director at the Fund to include the Bank as a prescribed holder of Special Drawing Rights. Upon agreement, the Treasury will contribute 1/3 of the Special Drawing Rights to the Global Fund in fiscal years 2004 through 2006. In fiscal years 2004 through 2006, the United States will contribute 1/3 of the Special Drawing Rights received to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. The Secretary of the Treasury will negotiate with other Fund members to encourage similar contributions."
