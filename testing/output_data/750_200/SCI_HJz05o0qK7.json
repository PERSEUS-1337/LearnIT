    "content": "Many machine learning algorithms use vector embeddings or discrete codes to represent input data. Evaluating compositionality in these representations is important, but the machine learning literature lacks tools for this. A procedure for measuring compositionality in vector-valued representation spaces is described. The procedure evaluates compositionality in vector-valued representation spaces by approximating the true model with a composed collection of primitives. It explores the relationship between compositionality, learning dynamics, human judgments, representational similarity, and generalization. The success of modern representation learning techniques has sparked interest in understanding the structure of learned representations, particularly in relation to compositionality. This involves measuring how well the known compositional structure of inputs is reflected in the learned codes. The success of modern representation learning techniques has sparked interest in understanding the structure of learned representations, particularly in relation to compositionality. One feature shared by many human-designed representation systems is compositionality: the capacity to represent complex concepts by combining simple parts. While some machine learning approaches use human-designed compositional analyses, it is also important to explore how compositionality arises in learning problems without built-in compositional structure. Consider a hypothetical character-based encoding scheme learned for a communication task. The example in Figure 1 illustrates a character-based encoding scheme for a communication task. The question is whether this encoding scheme is compositional, meaning if the agents' messages can be broken down into smaller pieces. Existing solutions for analyzing compositionality rely on manual or automated procedures tailored to specific problem domains. The present work aims to provide a formal, automatable, and quantitative technique for evaluating claims about compositional structure in learned representations. It focuses on an oracle setting where the structure of model inputs is known, aiming to determine if this structure is reflected in model outputs. This evaluation paradigm covers most existing representation learning methods. The paper introduces a formal framework for evaluating compositional structure in learned representations, focusing on an oracle setting where the structure of model inputs is known. It proposes an evaluation metric called TRE to assess compositionality in a given set of (input, representation) pairs. The core idea is to treat primitive meaning representations as hidden and optimize over them to explicitly measure compositionality. The proposal aims to evaluate compositional structure in learned representations by treating primitive meaning representations as hidden and optimizing over them to find a model that approximates the true model. This involves searching for attribute vectors that sum together to produce observed object representations or searching for value vectors and parameters of a binding operation for sparse combinations of (attribute, value) pairs. The paper presents a tool for assessing the compositionality of representations and explores the relationship between compositionality and learning through experiments and analyses. It aims to answer questions about how representation compositionality evolves during the learning process and how well it aligns with human judgments. The paper discusses the compositionality of representations and its relationship with learning. It explores how well representations track human judgments, constraints on distances between representations, and the necessity of compositional representations for generalization. It also touches on the debate between distributed and non-symbolic representations in modeling compositional phenomena. The discussion on compositional representations and their relation to learnability, including the debate between distributed and non-symbolic representations, was a key topic in 1980s-era connectionist-classicist debates. BID42 provides an overview of this discussion and its implementation of a compositional encoding scheme with distributed representations. Various approaches for compositional representation learning have since been proposed, some incorporating explicit composition operations. The main experimental question now is how and when compositionality emerges in models without predefined composition operations. The main experimental question is when and how compositionality arises in models without predefined composition operations. Existing proposals from linguistics and philosophy evaluate compositionality in formal and natural languages, but applying these techniques to non-string-valued representation spaces is challenging. Machine learning research has responded to the challenge of evaluating compositionality in non-string-valued representation spaces in various ways. One approach involves manual analyses of representation spaces, which provide insights but are time-consuming and non-reproducible. Another approach exploits task-specific structures to elicit pairs of representations. Our work aims to provide a standard and scalable alternative to model-and task-specific evaluations for measuring compositionality in representation spaces. Other authors base their analysis on related phenomena, such as correlation between representation similarity and oracle compositional analyses, and generalization to structurally novel inputs. Our approach examines how surrogate measures track compositionality, focusing on similarity and generalization. We validate our approach using an experiment from the natural language processing literature. The approach presented focuses on compositional representation learning in NLP, validating it through an experiment. It is agnostic to the choice of composition function and can be applied to representations from various models, even in non-linguistic settings. The text discusses using existing NLP techniques for compositional representation learning in non-linguistic settings. It involves a communication task where a speaker model sends messages to a listener model for downstream tasks. The training loss is seen as a measure of the compositionality of the representation system. The text discusses compositional representation learning in non-linguistic settings, focusing on identifying the referent from distractors based on message content. It proposes an automated procedure to determine if input structure is reflected in representations. The section proposes an automated procedure for answering questions about the structure of representations in a representation learning problem. It assumes prior knowledge about the compositional structure of inputs, labeled with tree-structured derivations. The section discusses the compositional structure of inputs, labeled with tree-structured derivations, and defines compositionality in terms of representations computed by a model f. It emphasizes the requirement for f to be a homomorphism from inputs to representations. The model f is compositional as a homomorphism from inputs to representations. Inputs are natural language strings with associated syntax trees. Representations are logical meanings. To show language compositionality, a lexicon D0 maps words to meanings and a grammar composes meanings through derivations. The curr_chunk discusses the challenges in identifying lexicon entries and dealing with languages lacking a clearly-defined syntax for compositionality in semantic parsing approaches. The curr_chunk addresses the identification of lexicon entries and handling languages with irregular structures in semantic parsing. The speaker model is compositional, suggesting a process for composing primitives to produce full representations. Predictions can be reproduced approximately by assigning strings to primitives, serving as a measure of compositionality. The quality of the approximation of predictors serves as a measure of compositionality. We should measure compositionality by searching for representations that allow a compositional model to approximate the true function closely. The evaluation procedure is defined as Tree Reconstruction Error (TRE) using a compositional approximation to f with parameters \u03b7. The evaluation procedure, Tree Reconstruction Error (TRE), involves choosing a compositional approximation to f with parameters \u03b7. This approximation uses parameter vectors \u03b7 i for each d i in D 0. Evaluation metrics like TRE aim to capture how well the intuition behind the model is represented. The Tree Reconstruction Error (TRE) involves choosing a compositional approximation to f with parameters \u03b7. Each term in the equation measures how well the best compositional prediction matches the true model prediction. TRE reduces to the familiar case for models that are homomorphisms. The definition of TRE leaves the choice of parameters up to the evaluator. The definition of TRE allows the evaluator to choose the composition function parameters. Care must be taken to avoid trivial solutions, especially when learning the composition function. If D is injective, there will always be a composition function that achieves TRE(X) = 0. Pre-commitment to a restricted composition function is necessary to avoid trivial solutions. In order to avoid trivial solutions, pre-commitment to a restricted composition function is necessary when evaluating TRE(X). Implementation details include using gradient descent to solve Equation 2 for models with continuous \u0398 and differentiable \u03b4 and *. For discrete \u0398, finding a continuous relaxation may allow for differentiability and the use of gradient descent. The paper discusses using gradient descent to solve Equation 2 for models with continuous \u0398 and differentiable \u03b4 and *. For discrete \u0398, a continuous relaxation may enable the use of gradient descent. Task-specific optimizers or general-purpose discrete optimization toolkits can be applied to Equation 2. The remainder of the paper explores using TRE to address compositionality in machine learning problems. The text discusses using TRE to address compositionality in machine learning problems, focusing on the relationship between compositionality and learning dynamics proposed by BID45. It suggests that learning in deep models involves an error minimization phase followed by a compression phase, where the mutual information between inputs and their representations decreases. The hypothesis is that the compression phase aims to find a compositional representation of the input distribution by isolating decision-relevant attributes and discarding irrelevant ones. The text investigates how the compression phase in machine learning aims to find a compositional representation of the input distribution by isolating decision-relevant attributes and discarding irrelevant information. It involves predicting classifiers in a meta-learning framework for various visual concepts and minimizing logistic loss during training. The model computes using images and labels, trained to minimize logistic loss. Visual concepts are single attributes or conjunctions, with addition as the composition function and cosine similarity for distance. Training dataset has 9000 image triplets. The model is trained using images and labels with logistic loss. It uses addition as the composition function and cosine similarity for distance. The training dataset consists of 9000 image triplets, achieving a validation accuracy of 75.2% on average. The relationship between the information bottleneck and compositionality is explored by comparing TRE(X) to the mutual information I(\u03b8; x) between representations and inputs during training. The relationship between TRE(X) and mutual information I(\u03b8; X) is analyzed to explore compositionality. Both quantities are computed on the validation set, showing that small TRE indicates high compositionality. Initially, both mutual information and reconstruction error are low but increase over training. The relationship between mutual information and reconstruction error is analyzed to explore compositionality in the information bottleneck framework. Both quantities start low and increase over training, decreasing together after mutual information reaches a maximum. This pattern suggests that compression in the framework is linked to the discovery of compositional representations. The discovery of compositional representations is linked to compression in the information bottleneck framework. High-dimensional embeddings of words and phrases are important for natural language processing applications. The focus is on exploring how compositional individual phrase representations are, with the hypothesis that bigrams with low reconstruction error are essentially compositional. The analysis presented focuses on the use of TRE to search for atomic representations in a language processing context. The goal is to validate the approach and show how it fits into the general framework proposed in the paper. Embeddings for words and bigrams are trained to explore the compositionality of multi-word expressions. The current paper discusses training word and bigram embeddings using the CBOW objective of BID29 in FastText BID5 with 100-dimensional vectors. The focus is on understanding the compositional structure of phrase embeddings in relation to their constituent word embeddings. The paper explores word and bigram embeddings using the CBOW objective in FastText with 100-dimensional vectors. It focuses on the compositional structure of phrase embeddings compared to their constituent word embeddings. The study compares bigram-level compositionality judgments with human ratings on noun-noun compounds. The study examines word and bigram embeddings using FastText with 100-dimensional vectors, focusing on the compositional structure of phrase embeddings. Results show an inverse correlation between tree reconstruction error (TRE) and human judgments of compositionality. High compositional collocations include application form, polo shirt, and research project, while low compositional words include fine line, lip service, and nest egg. The next section aims to formalize the relationship between TRE and representations analysis. The next section provides a formal characterization of the relationship between TRE and representations analysis, introducing the concept of topographic similarity. It argues that a learned representation captures relevant domain structure if distances between representations are correlated with distances between their associated derivations, providing weak evidence for compositionality. In this section, the relationship between edit distance and derivational similarity is explored by equipping derivations with a tree edit distance function. Proposition 1 states that an approximation to f estimated with all TRE(x) \u2264 for some, with \u2206 as the tree edit distance, correlates with derivational similarity. Proposition 1 states that an approximation to f estimated with all TRE(x) \u2264 for some, with \u2206 as the tree edit distance, correlates with derivational similarity. The tree edit distance is an approximate upper bound on \u03b4, emphasizing that small TRE is not a sufficient condition for topographic similarity as defined by BID7. In the final set of experiments, the relationship between compositionality and generalization is investigated through communication games. Existing work argues for a connection between the two. In communication games, the relationship between compositionality and generalization is explored. Existing work suggests a link between the two, emphasizing the need for compositional communication protocols for agents to generalize to unseen referents. This claim is empirically evaluated by training agents from random initial conditions, analyzing the language structure that emerges, and assessing their performance on familiar and novel objects. The speaker model sends a description of target objects to the listener model, who reconstructs them for fractional rewards. The experiment focuses on a reference game BID20 where two policies, speaker and listener, are trained to communicate using discrete codes and attribute sets to predict objects. The speaker sends a message to the listener to reconstruct target objects for rewards. Policies are trained using a policy gradient objective with RNNs. Each target referent consists of two objects with two attributes. The speaker sends a message to the listener to reconstruct target objects for rewards. Each target referent consists of two objects with two attributes. A subset of object pairs is held out during training to evaluate generalization. Representations are fixed-length discrete codes with more complex semantics than previous examples. The derivations in the current section have a more complex semantics than before, requiring a different class of composition and distance operations. Each agent message is represented as a sequence of one-hot vectors, with a composition function involving free parameters. These matrices can rearrange tokens in the input string but do not affect the token selection. The matrices in Equation 2 redistribute tokens in the input string without changing token selection, allowing for modeling non-commutative aspects of string production. Compositional languages have lower performance, even in successful training runs where agents achieve a reward > 0.5 on held-out referents. The text discusses the results of two multiagent training runs, showing different languages with similar listener performance. The training involves computing TRE via gradient descent and optimizing \u03b4 and * using subgradients. Results from training 100 speaker-listener pairs show a nuanced relationship between compositionality, generalization, and communication strategies. TRE is correlated with generalization error and absolute model reward, indicating that \"compositional\" languages may result from poor communication strategies. The correlation between Training Error Rate (TRE) and generalization error is highlighted, showing that \"compositional\" languages may stem from ineffective communication strategies. Low TRE does not guarantee good generalization, as some languages with trivial strategies perform poorly overall. The technique can identify languages achieving good generalization performance. The technique introduced can automatically mine training runs for languages achieving good generalization performance at different levels of compositionality. A new evaluation method called TRE generates graded judgments about compositional structure in representation learning problems. TRE infers primitive meaning representations that approximate observed representations and measures the quality of this approximation. The analysis has been applied to four different representation problems. The technique introduced can automatically mine training runs for languages achieving good generalization performance at different levels of compositionality. TRE-based analysis has been applied to four different representation problems, relating compositionality to learning dynamics, linguistic compositionality, similarity, and generalization. Many questions remain open regarding compositionality and representation learning, including how to generalize TRE to settings where oracle derivations are not available.
