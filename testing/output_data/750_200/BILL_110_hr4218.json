Diabetes is a major public health threat in the United States, with 21 million people currently living with the disease and 54 million at risk of developing it. It is the 6th leading cause of death, with the prevalence of the most common type tripling in the last 30 years. The prevalence of the most common type of diabetes has tripled in the last 30 years, with approximately 2,200 new diagnoses each day. Diabetes self-management training, also known as diabetes education, provides critical knowledge and skills to help patients effectively manage their diabetes. A certified diabetes educator, such as a nurse, dietitian, or pharmacist, specializes in assisting individuals with diabetes in developing necessary self-management skills. Diabetes self-management training, provided by certified diabetes educators, helps individuals with diabetes develop skills to stay healthy and prevent complications. Studies have shown its effectiveness in reducing risks associated with diabetes. Participants at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes who made lifestyle changes reduced their risk by 58%. The intervention was particularly effective for those aged 60 and older, reducing diabetes development by 71%. Studies show that patients under the care of a certified diabetes educator have better control of their diabetes and improved health status. Lifestyle changes taught by certified diabetes educators can lead to better glycemic control and reduced complications from diabetes. Evidence suggests that proper medical treatment and active self-management can prevent serious medical complications caused by diabetes by up to 90% (blindness), 85% (amputations), and 50% (heart disease and stroke).
