    "content": "The cultivation, distribution, and possession of marijuana are prohibited except for federally approved research under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970. However, several states and territories have legalized medical marijuana, while some have decriminalized possession. Colorado and Washington were the first states to legalize recreational marijuana for individuals 21 and older in 2012. Colorado and Washington were the first states to legalize recreational marijuana for individuals 21 and older in 2012. Following them, Alaska, Oregon, and the District of Columbia also approved measures to legalize, regulate, and tax marijuana for recreational purposes. Commercial sales of recreational marijuana began in Colorado on January 1, 2014, and in Washington on July 7, 2014. The District of Columbia approved measures to legalize marijuana, following a trend of state movements towards decriminalization. Polls show a majority of Americans support marijuana legalization, leading to debates at the federal level. Bills have been introduced in Congress to remove marijuana from Schedule I. The debate over marijuana legalization at the federal level includes bills to remove marijuana from Schedule I and impose a federal excise tax. A proposed National Commission on Federal Marijuana Policy would review revenue potential from taxing marijuana. The debate spans issues from criminal justice to public health and safety, with the revenue-raising potential of a marijuana tax being a key factor. The report focuses on the economic debate over federal marijuana legalization, specifically on imposing an excise tax on legalized marijuana. It provides an overview of marijuana production, arguments for taxes, estimates of suggested tax levels, and analyzes possible tax designs. Marijuana is derived from the plant Cannabis sativa and is used for recreational or medicinal purposes. Marijuana, derived from the plant Cannabis sativa, is used for recreational or medicinal purposes. The main psychoactive ingredient in marijuana is delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), responsible for the \"high\" users experience. Different strains of marijuana contain various cannabinoid compounds contributing to its effects. The potency and effects of marijuana can vary based on the different chemical compounds present in the plant. Consumers may seek strains high in cannabidiol (CBD) for anxiety relief, as THC concentrations increase in the leaves and flowers of the plant. Marijuana plants have male and female genders. Female plants grown without pollination from male plants can produce buds with high THC content. These sinsemilla varieties typically contain 10%-18% THC, much higher than commercial-grade marijuana. Marijuana is consumed by smoking dried plant matter in various forms such as joints or blunts. A typical joint contains less than half a gram of marijuana, with each hit containing approximately one-twentieth of a gram. Various devices like glass pipes are also used for consuming marijuana. Various devices for consuming marijuana exist, from glass pipes to vaporizers. Cannabis can be processed into different products with varying THC concentrations, such as hashish with over 40% THC content. THC can also be used in creating \"edibles\" like candy or baked goods by dissolving it in fats, oils, or alcohol. The curr_chunk discusses the economic analysis of imposing an excise tax on marijuana, citing reasons such as reflecting external costs, discouraging use, preventing price falls, funding programs, and raising revenue. It emphasizes economic efficiency when the price of a commodity equals its costs. The economic analysis of imposing an excise tax on marijuana aims to reflect external costs, discourage use, prevent price falls, fund programs, and raise revenue. Economic efficiency is achieved when the price of a commodity equals its costs, with the rationale often used for similar commodities like alcohol and tobacco. Separating external costs from user costs is crucial, such as considering the value of lost years of life due to substance use. The economic analysis of imposing an excise tax on marijuana aims to reflect external costs and discourage use. Costs should be separate from the costs the user bears, with society bearing some of the costs of treating illness. Future costs should be discounted, and external costs are typically much smaller than total costs. The external costs of alcohol and tobacco were estimated to be $30 billion in a 1991 study. Similar estimates for marijuana do not exist, but it is possible to estimate the cost by examining studies on other substances. A U.S. study suggests examining the costs of cannabis compared to alcohol to determine the necessary tax to correct for externalities. Alcohol is ranked higher in harm than cannabis, with cannabis being only 28% of alcohol's harm. Health costs per user for cannabis are estimated to be about 12%, lower than for alcohol. Non-health costs of marijuana are also likely lower than for alcohol. The non-health costs of marijuana are likely lower than for alcohol, with evidence showing that marijuana impairs driving ability less than alcohol. Smoking marijuana is inversely related to domestic violence. Enforcement costs for marijuana are larger, but this is likely due to its illicit status. The externalities of marijuana are smaller per user compared to alcohol. The prevalence of marijuana use is smaller compared to alcohol, with marijuana usage being 19% as common as alcohol based on past year use. External costs of marijuana range from $0.5 billion to $1.7 billion. The external costs of marijuana range from $0.5 billion to $1.7 billion, with estimates based on market size and price. A 2014 report by the White House ONDCP provides data on unit price, total expenditure, and consumption weight of marijuana in the US, extrapolated from NSDUH and ADAM survey data. The ONDCP report on drug-offense arrestees in ADAM jurisdictions shows a 40% increase in marijuana consumption in the US from 2002 to 2010. Estimates range from $30 billion to $60 billion for total expenditures on marijuana in 2010. THC levels in marijuana also rose during this period. External costs imply a tax of 0.8% to 5.3% of the current price based on market estimates. The White House's 2014 ONDCP report provides estimates of the price per gram of marijuana from 2000 to 2010, with the price per gram in 2010 estimated at $7.11. Anecdotal prices from anonymous sources and informal interviews with consumers or dealers in the underground market are also available. Other researchers have used different techniques to analyze marijuana prices. Researchers have used various techniques and data sources to estimate marijuana prices, including anecdotal reports and data from priceofweed.com. The estimated price of marijuana is $317 per ounce, but the representativeness of the data is unclear. The price of marijuana is estimated to be around $317 per ounce, but there are reports of high-quality marijuana being sold for as low as $28 per eighth of an ounce in certain areas. Tax rates on marijuana prices range from 0.8% to 5.3%, but prices are currently inflated due to the illicit nature of the market. In a legal market, prices would be lower. In a legal market, marijuana prices would be lower than the current inflated prices due to the illicit nature of the market. Estimates suggest external costs range from $1.60 to $16.80 per ounce with potential prices as low as $5 per ounce in a fully competitive market. The tax on marijuana could be as high as $0.30 per joint. The tax on a joint containing half a gram of marijuana could be around $0.30, similar to the tax on a six-pack of beer. States and localities also impose taxes on alcohol and tobacco, and they would likely tax marijuana as well. These state taxes may already exceed the external costs of marijuana. The tax on marijuana in states like Colorado and Washington may already be higher than the external costs of the drug. Imposing a tax could help discourage users, especially underage ones, who may underestimate the long-term health costs and potential dependence. Some argue that marijuana is not physically addictive but can lead to dependence. Some argue that marijuana is not physically addictive but can lead to dependence, especially among underage users. Studies show that about 9% of marijuana users become dependent, and medical marijuana laws in the US increase the likelihood of abuse or dependency by 15%-27% in adults. More research is needed to improve understanding of the risks associated with marijuana use. Economists debate whether user behavior is suboptimal, with \"rational addiction\" theories suggesting that consumers may continue use despite risks. Some economists disagree on whether user behavior is suboptimal, with theories suggesting rational addiction or hyperbolic discounting. The issue of determining a tax for the best interests of users is complicated by the potential reduction in income. Individuals who consume multiple joints per day may be affected by such taxes. A tax on marijuana, similar to alcohol and tobacco taxes, would primarily impact heavy users who consume a significant portion of the product. This regressive tax may reduce the welfare of users by decreasing their income. The tax on marijuana, like other excise taxes, may be regressive, impacting heavy users the most. Evaluating the benefit of imposing taxes to discourage consumption depends on users' response to price changes, expressed as elasticities by economists. The tax on marijuana may be regressive, impacting heavy users the most. Evaluating the benefit of imposing taxes to discourage consumption depends on users' response to price changes, expressed as elasticities by economists. Gallet (2014) examines price elasticity demand for marijuana, predicting elasticities ranging between. Gallet's model predicts that the demand for marijuana is relatively unresponsive to price changes, with elasticities ranging between -0.15 and -0.31. Imposing a tax on marijuana may harm users overall, as gains from optimal consumption may be offset by lost income from the tax. Government policies often aim to limit drug use by minors, including marijuana under state legalization laws. Imposing taxes on marijuana may reduce usage among youth, as they are more price-sensitive. However, minors may still find ways to obtain marijuana. The effectiveness of taxes in curbing youth usage depends on whether they access marijuana through legal or illegal channels. The policy question is how much tax burden should be placed on adult users to limit youth consumption of marijuana. Setting the tax to prevent a substantial price drop post-legalization is crucial, especially for minors who are more sensitive to price. After legalization, the cost of marijuana is expected to decrease significantly due to increased production and reduced costs of evading law enforcement. This may necessitate a tax to prevent prices from falling too low, especially to deter youth consumption. The tax level may need to be adjusted based on the outcomes of a legal market. Legalizing marijuana could lead to increased production and lower costs of evading law enforcement. This may result in a more competitive market where firms earn no profit above the normal return. Legalizing marijuana could lead to a more competitive market with lower production costs. A federal tax rate should be considered to offset part of the cost difference between legal and illicit production. Caulkins (2010) estimates the production costs of legalized marijuana, with outdoor production being significantly cheaper. The tax on marijuana should not be too high to discourage illicit production, aiming to offset only part of the price reduction from legalization. Outdoor production of marijuana is estimated to cost substantially less per pound, but may have lower THC levels compared to indoor cultivation. Processing costs are estimated to add $20 to $35 per pound. Greenhouse production costs around $215 plus $35 per pound, while outdoor production costs around $10 plus $35 per pound. THC concentration varies, with sinsemilla containing 10% - 18% THC. Outdoor production of marijuana costs about $2.80 per ounce, with THC concentration varying from 10% - 18%. Estimates suggest a cost of $5-$18 per ounce ($80-$288 per pound) when factoring in processing and retail market costs. In jurisdictions where marijuana is quasi-legal, prices are typically lower than street prices but higher than production costs. In Canada, medical marijuana prices range from $1.80-$5 per gram to the final consumer, with suppliers able to provide for $1-$4 per gram. Street prices are listed at $10-$15 per gram. Beginning in April 2014, the Canadian government set the price of medical marijuana at $7.60 (CAD) per gram, higher than the average priceofweed.com. Small growers and homegrown marijuana will no longer be allowed under the new law. Prices are higher than production costs but do not reflect a mature competitive market. Actual prices can be seen in Colorado marijuana. Actual prices of marijuana can be observed in Colorado through websites like Leafly.com, which provides consumer reviews and menu prices of products available at each shop. Leafly is a website and mobile app that helps users find marijuana shops, medical dispensaries, and doctors prescribing medical marijuana in their area. Leafly provides consumer reviews and menu prices of marijuana products in Denver. Prices range from $9 to $15 per gram, $29 to $40 per eighth of an ounce, and $190 to $350 per ounce. Prices listed may include tax. Submissions to priceofweed.com suggest that Colorado marijuana prices are lower than national averages. Colorado marijuana prices are lower than national averages, with high quality at $238 per ounce and medium quality at $197 per ounce. Prices reflect a mix of illicit and legal markets, potentially including taxes on legal purchases. Prices in Colorado indicate falling prices with legalization, but they are not close to production costs due to the quasi-legal status of the market. Prices in Colorado are lower than national averages, but they do not reflect production costs due to the quasi-legal status of the market. Marijuana businesses in Colorado may face challenges with banking assistance and high federal income taxes imposed without deductions. Marijuana businesses face challenges with banking and high federal income taxes, which can be equivalent to excise taxes and apply at each production stage. Despite lower prices in Colorado, the market's quasi-legal status hinders reflecting production costs. Legalization could lead to a significant price reduction, with estimates ranging from $40-$150 per ounce. Legalization of marijuana could lead to a 50% price reduction, with prices in the United States and the Netherlands suggesting an average of $100-$150 per ounce. The Netherlands, like Colorado, is not fully legalized due to import bans and anti-drug laws. Street prices of $200-$300 per ounce indicate room for a tax rate to align legalized prices with current illegal prices. If competitive prices reach $50 per ounce, there is potential for significant price reduction. The potential tax rate for legalized marijuana should align prices with current street prices of illegal marijuana, allowing for taxes up to $200 per ounce. However, setting taxes too high could encourage the illicit market, undermining the goal of eliminating it through legalization. Lowering taxes and monitoring market conditions may be necessary. The potential scope of a marijuana tax is uncertain, but lowering taxes and observing market conditions may be the best initial strategy. Some of the tax yield could fund marijuana research, including medical marijuana research approved by 23 states and the District of Columbia. Barriers to marijuana research include federal approval and lack of high-grade resources. The American College of Physicians report highlights barriers to marijuana research, such as federal approval and lack of high-grade resources. It discusses the potential benefits of marijuana for various conditions and calls for studying its efficacy and side effects. Legalization could facilitate research on externalities, addictive properties, and health effects for both recreational and medical users, with revenue potentially funding information programs on risks. An excise tax on marijuana could generate revenue to finance information programs on risks and discourage use by minors. This tax can be designed to meet specific revenue targets, similar to how cigarette taxes have been used to fund healthcare programs like CHIP. An excise tax on marijuana can be designed to achieve a revenue target, similar to cigarette taxes funding healthcare programs. Revenue from the tax is uncertain due to market price and quantity uncertainties, with potential increases from new casual consumers entering the market. These effects may not be captured in existing price elasticity estimates. The legal market for marijuana could be much larger than the current market due to consumers avoiding illegal activities. The pace of legalization at the state level could impact potential revenue from a federal excise tax. If more states legalize marijuana and set similar tax rates, federal revenue could increase. If states legalize marijuana and set equal excise tax rates to match illicit market prices, federal lawmakers may face constraints on imposing excise taxes without fueling the illicit market. Analysts estimate potential revenue from nationwide marijuana legalization, which could boost income through legal sectors subject to taxes. Miron and Waldock from the Cato Institute have studied this issue. Miron and Waldock of the Cato Institute estimate that a federal excise tax on marijuana could raise $5.8 billion annually. They assume a national market value of $13.13 billion, a 50% price decrease post-legalization, and a 25% increase in consumption. Additionally, they project $3.3 billion in annual savings from reduced law enforcement expenditures. Miron and Waldock estimate a federal excise tax on marijuana could raise $5.8 billion annually, with $3.3 billion in savings from reduced law enforcement expenditures. They suggest a tax of around $50-$75 per ounce, considering market size estimates and consumer response. The calculation outlines how to estimate revenues from the tax, factoring in aggregate consumption and interactions with income taxes. The results depend on specific assumptions about market conditions. A $50 per ounce tax on marijuana is discussed, considering its impact on aggregate consumption and interactions with income taxes. Revenue estimation requires data on price and quantity, with market value estimates ranging from $30 billion to $60 billion. Assuming a $40 billion market and a $250 current price, potential revenue effects are illustrated with a fully legalized industry nationwide, using a pretax price of $50 per ounce and a state tax of $50 per ounce. Assuming a fully legalized industry nationwide with a $50 per ounce pretax price and $50 state tax, the federal excise tax revenue would be $8 billion based on a $40 billion market and a $250 current price. The total price after taxes and costs would be $150 per ounce, leading to increased consumption and higher tax collections. The effect of legalization alone, reducing the price to $50 per ounce, would lead to a 50% increase in quantity. With taxes, the price becomes $150, resulting in a 14% increase in quantity and projected excise tax collection of $9.1 billion. The projected excise tax collection for marijuana is $9.1 billion, compared to the $10 billion tax on alcoholic beverages. The estimated revenue gain after accounting for income and wage tax losses is $6.8 billion, based on certain assumptions that could change. The yield will also be influenced by the extent of legalization and coverage of medical marijuana. The projected excise tax collection for marijuana is estimated at $9.1 billion, with potential revenue gains of $6.8 billion after considering income and wage tax losses. The yield will depend on the extent of legalization and coverage of medical marijuana, with early indicators from Colorado and Washington serving as valuable data points. Marijuana sales in Colorado are subject to multiple state taxes, including a 15% excise tax on the unprocessed product, a 10% retail marijuana excise tax, and a 2.9% general sales tax. The effective tax rate on marijuana products ranges from 15% to 25%. The effective tax rate on marijuana products in Colorado ranges from 15% to 25%, with additional local taxes possible. Colorado collected over $37.0 million in sales taxes, excise taxes, and license fees on recreational marijuana from January to September 2014. National market estimates can be derived from Colorado's tax revenue data. After analyzing tax revenue data from Colorado, it is estimated that the national sales tax base for recreational marijuana could be between $15.9 billion and $17.0 billion per year. Medical marijuana consumption data is harder to extrapolate to the general U.S. population due to incomplete data in some states. The tax collections data from Colorado suggest that medical marijuana consumption could double the consumption base. Combined medical and recreational marijuana sales in Colorado indicate a market of at least $30 billion in the United States, which may be underestimated due to factors like insufficient market development and ongoing illicit sales. The tax collections data from Colorado suggest that medical marijuana consumption could double the consumption base, indicating a market of at least $30 billion in the United States. Illicit sales continue due to lower prices or preexisting relationships, potentially overstating consumption. Design issues for an excise tax, including exempting medical marijuana and enforcement, are important considerations. An excise tax levied at earlier production stages has lower administrative costs and fewer tax evasion opportunities. An excise tax is generally levied on manufacturers and imports, with exemptions for exports. Marijuana can be taxed based on a per unit measurement or product price, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Multiple tax bases could be combined, such as a tax by weight. A weight-based tax for marijuana could be administered at the manufacturing level, similar to the federal excise tax regime for tobacco. It is relatively easy to administer and could be based on the \"wet\" weight or weight after drying. Retail-based weight tax could create issues for different products. A weight-based tax for marijuana could be administered at the manufacturing level, similar to the federal excise tax regime for tobacco. However, a potency-based tax could be more complicated and costly to enforce, requiring accurate lab testing of marijuana strains. Regulations defining sample sizes for testing would be necessary. Regulations would require producers to submit samples for potency testing, with costs ranging from $60-$120 per sample. Legalization may lead to more labs entering the market, potentially reducing testing prices. Competition could improve technology but also result in growers choosing labs that underestimate THC levels. Potency testing in marijuana could be unreliable due to growers choosing labs that underestimate THC levels. A tax based on THC potency may lead to increased consumption of less-potent marijuana, potentially causing undesirable health effects. An alternative could be a potency calculation based on THC to CBD ratio, encouraging consumers to purchase differently. An alternative potency calculation for marijuana taxation based on THC to CBD ratio could encourage consumers to buy more sedative strains. Ad valorem taxes, like those in Colorado and Washington, offer advantages such as automatic price adjustments and easy application to a variety of products. The Marijuana Tax Equity Act of 2013 also proposes using ad valorem taxes on wholesalers for marijuana taxation. The tax regimes in Colorado and Washington use ad valorem taxes on wholesalers for marijuana, while H.R. 501 proposes a 50% tax on producer or importer price. Ad valorem taxes require regulations to specify taxable price, while a manufacturers tax is simpler to administer. Federal excise taxes are typically imposed at the manufacturer stage. Federal excise taxes are typically imposed at the manufacturer stage, such as on tobacco, alcohol, and firearms. For vertically integrated firms, regulations must address how to determine a manufacturer's price when no market transaction occurs. A retail tax regime, similar to a sales tax, could capture price markups due to product type or firm branding. The price of products like marijuana or THC could be influenced by various characteristics beyond intoxication potential. The price of products containing marijuana or THC could be determined by various characteristics other than intoxication potential. A per unit tax could be indexed for inflation using measures like the Consumer Price Index. Sunset provisions for the tax could be included in the initial authorizing language of a marijuana tax due to uncertainty over prices and demand after legalization. Sunset provisions for marijuana tax could be included in initial authorizing language to adapt to evolving industry conditions. Tax rates could start low to combat illicit market, then gradually increase to limit consumption. Delegating authority to adjust tax rates based on criteria could be considered. Various taxation methods could also be explored. Legislation may delegate authority to adjust tax rates on marijuana based on specific criteria, such as price or weight. Differential tax rates could shape consumption to reduce negative social costs, but may create complexity and unequal tax burdens. Alcohol is taxed based on potency and category, with taxes per alcohol content. A federal marijuana tax could lead to complexity and unequal tax burdens for consumers. Alcohol is taxed based on potency and category, while cigarettes are taxed per unit. Lawmakers would need to address how to tax marijuana plants and products in jurisdictions where sales are legal. Integrating preexisting marijuana plants and products into the tax base could help meet initial demand, reduce complexity in tax regulations, and increase federal tax revenue. However, some products may not comply with new regulations. An alternative option could be to provide ample lead time before enacting a federal tax regime. An alternative option to integrating preexisting marijuana plants and products into the tax base is to provide ample lead time between enacting a federal tax regime and the effective date of the first legalized sales. This would give producers time to comply with new federal regulations, although it may add complexity to the taxation of marijuana in some jurisdictions. In Colorado, retail licenses were initially issued to existing medical marijuana dispensaries, some already growing their own plants. In Washington, current plants can be converted to legal stocks with a producer license and compliant growing space. Federal excise taxes increase, untaxed floor stocks are taxed to prevent inventory buildup. Issues may arise with restrictions, exemptions, and special treatment under a federal marijuana tax. Several issues could arise concerning restrictions, exemptions, and special treatment under a federal tax on marijuana. Policy makers could choose to implement such regulations at the federal level or allow the states to make their own laws pertaining to each of these issues. Age restrictions in Colorado and Washington limit recreational marijuana purchases to individuals aged 21 or older, potentially affecting the tax base. Age restrictions on marijuana purchases in Colorado and Washington limit recreational sales to individuals aged 21 or older. Surveys show that younger individuals use marijuana more, but post-legalization, this trend may change. Excluding younger consumers from the legal tax base could lead to underground production or indirect sales through of-age connections. Colorado residents can possess up to one ounce of marijuana and make unlimited transactions, while non-residents are limited to purchasing one quarter of an ounce in a single transaction to reduce risks of diversion. It is uncertain if this restriction has significantly impacted diversion. More restrictive purchasing limits and ad valorem tax rates can increase the effective tax rate on heavy marijuana users. Production limits in Washington aim to prevent sales diversion and control the number of licenses issued, with a target market size of 80 metric tons. Colorado does not have a specific target for its marijuana market size. Production limits in Washington aim to prevent sales diversion and control the number of licenses issued. Colorado has no specific target for its marijuana market size. Concerns about diversion of exports to countries where marijuana is illegal could be addressed by implementing a tax closer to the production chain. Mark Kleiman, a Professor of Public Policy at UCLA, suggests that production limits could also curb the power of larger producers and reduce negative social consequences of marijuana consumption. Production limits in the marijuana market aim to control the power of larger producers and prevent sales diversion. However, implementing production limits may lead to inefficiency and windfall profits for firms. The tax treatment of medical marijuana varies among jurisdictions, with some applying general sales tax or special gross receipts taxes. For example, Colorado imposes a 2.9% general state tax on medical marijuana. Medical marijuana is subject to different taxes in each jurisdiction, such as Colorado's 2.9% general sales tax. There is debate over the medical need for marijuana, with evidence showing a decrease in prescription drug overdoses in states with medical marijuana laws. This may attract consumers who want to avoid the illicit market. There is a negative correlation between medical marijuana and prescription drugs as deaths from prescription drug overdoses have declined in states with medical marijuana laws. Exempting medical marijuana from taxes could lead to users seeking medical prescriptions for cost incentives, but strict standards must be enforced to prevent abuse and limit the tax base. Medical marijuana exemptions from taxes could lead to users seeking medical prescriptions for cost incentives, but strict standards must be enforced to prevent abuse. Tax administration costs could increase if abuse is not prevented, requiring producers to segregate sales and implement marking devices. Rules for excise taxation vary across products, with different regulations in states like Colorado and Washington. Federal law prohibits home distilling of alcohol, unlike the allowance for home growing of marijuana in some states. In contrast to federal law, Washington does not permit home cultivation of marijuana for recreational use. There is a debate on whether home production should be allowed, with considerations on quantity limits. Expert opinions suggest that a single plant can yield a significant amount of marijuana, raising concerns about potential limits on home-growing. The debate over allowing home cultivation of marijuana in Washington revolves around concerns about the potential yield from a single plant and its impact on tax revenue and enforcement. Experts argue that while home production may not pose a significant threat to tax revenue, it could undermine enforcement efforts and lead to increased revenue from marijuana taxes. Banning home production of marijuana could increase tax revenue and enforcement efficiency. Small producers may be eligible for lower tax rates, but collecting taxes from larger producers is more efficient. A small businesses exemption could lead to evasion. One study suggests that legalizing marijuana could lower prices and promote outdoor cultivation due to lower energy usage. However, concerns exist about the environmental impact of outdoor cultivation on land and water resources. Outdoor marijuana cultivation may have negative environmental effects by diverting land and water resources. Incentives for higher-potency marijuana could lead to more indoor production. A federal tax option is to levy a special occupational tax on businesses involved in marijuana production, distribution, or sales. The Marijuana Tax Equity Act of 2013 proposes an occupational tax on marijuana businesses, aiming to generate revenue. Enforcement and administrative efforts are crucial for a sustainable federal tax regime on marijuana. Enforcement efforts are crucial for a sustainable federal tax regime on marijuana, similar to the historical measures taken to combat bootleg spirits after Prohibition. Today, marijuana enforcement would need to deter regular consumers from engaging in illicit transactions with trusted dealers. Enforcement is essential to deter consumers from engaging in illicit transactions with trusted dealers and compel producers to obtain licenses and pay taxes. Legalizing and taxing marijuana without adequate resources for tax enforcement could undermine the federal tax base. Marijuana smuggling may be more prevalent due to its compact nature, but it is more pungent than alcohol. Tax collection on marijuana production could be more efficient if done closer to the point of production, using tax stamps or seals on packages for monitoring. Individual marks could be used if sold as joints. Colorado has developed a system to track marijuana plants from seed to sale using RFID tags. New technological developments like genetic markers and tracking systems are also being considered for monitoring production. Colorado has implemented a system using RFID tags to track marijuana plants from seed to sale. Marijuana enterprises must report their inventory through a computer system called Marijuana Inventory Tracking Solutions (MITS) to the Colorado Department of Revenue's Marijuana Enforcement Division. Standardized weights and potency measurements may be necessary for a marijuana tax regime to ensure consumer safety and accurate dosing. Potency measurements are essential for a marijuana tax regime to ensure consumer safety and accurate dosing. The U.S. Department of the Treasury could establish marketing standards for labeling and branding different marijuana strains, including defining terms like \"indica\" and \"sativa.\" Different tax rates for medical and recreational marijuana could be implemented. Regulations may define labeling for \"indica,\" \"sativa,\" and hybrid strains, creating arbitrage opportunities for consumers. Heavy users could benefit from evading high excise taxes. Enforcement of regulations is crucial for income tax collection from nonprofit medical marijuana dispensaries. Hemp lacks psychoactive value due to low THC levels. The 113th Congress made changes to U.S. laws. The 113th Congress made changes to U.S. policies regarding industrial hemp, allowing certain research institutions and state departments of agriculture to grow hemp if permitted by state laws. Hemp, with low THC levels, has no psychoactive value and could be legalized for industrial production. Hemp could be legalized for industrial production if marijuana is legalized for commercial production. THC content is used to distinguish hemp from marijuana for tax purposes. Europe and Canada require less than 0.3% THC for legal hemp. Some argue that marijuana can be hidden in hemp fields, but cross-pollination would weaken marijuana plants. Higher-quality marijuana strains need controlled climates to reach peak THC potency. The federal legalization of marijuana could impact state tax policies. The federal legalization of marijuana could impact state tax policies by influencing the development of marijuana tax policy at the state level. States with marijuana legalization laws may choose to license private businesses for marijuana sales instead of implementing state-based monopolies. Proponents view state-based monopolies as a way to regulate consumption, while opponents see them as prone to corruption and driven by revenue motives. The dominance of licensing systems in states may make it challenging for lawmakers to switch to state monopolies in the future. The uncertainty surrounding legalized and taxed marijuana makes it difficult to predict its effects. The uncertainties surrounding legalized and taxed marijuana, such as post-legalization prices, market size, consumer response to price changes, spillover effects, and health effects, make it challenging to project revenues and set the level of tax. Choosing how to impose the tax is also limited by uncertainties regarding consumer response to potency and compliance costs. The setting of the tax on legalized marijuana is difficult due to uncertainties in consumer response to potency and price, compliance costs, and revenue-raising potential compared to alcohol or tobacco. Medical marijuana sales exemption from federal tax further limits the tax base. The discussion in the text provides broader information on the social costs and benefits of marijuana. The discussion in the text reported some broader information on the magnitude of the social costs and benefits of marijuana. This appendix discusses some components of those social costs, including the relationship between marijuana and alcohol consumption. If marijuana is a substitute for alcohol, it may have positive spillover effects on society due to fewer social costs associated with marijuana consumption. Researchers have not reached a consensus on the spillover effects of marijuana consumption when combined with alcohol. Many economic studies do not capture long-term effects or examine representative populations due to strict regulations on marijuana research in the United States. The National Institute on Drug Abuse in the United States does not fund research on the potential medical benefits of marijuana. Research on the effects of commercial and recreational legalization is limited to Colorado and Washington. This uncertainty hinders the possibility of implementing a marijuana tax based on alcohol and marijuana use. The uncertainty surrounding the relationship between alcohol and marijuana use limits the plausibility of levying a marijuana tax based on external costs to society. Initiatives in Colorado and Washington provide opportunities to understand the effects of broader legalization policies. The social costs of marijuana legalization could vary based on polydrug use. The social costs of marijuana legalization could vary based on polydrug use. Studies show marijuana has lower addiction risk than other drugs. Some believe it's a gateway drug. Survey data shows heavy marijuana users more likely to use other illegal drugs. The rate of \"heavy\" marijuana users using other illegal drugs is slightly more than 25%. Current research on marijuana's effects on traffic fatalities is limited by methodological shortcomings. Marijuana is the most frequently detected substance in drivers involved in accidents. Marijuana is the most frequently detected substance in drivers involved in accidents, but there is no clear causal link between marijuana use and traffic fatalities. Testing technology is limited in detecting marijuana intoxication levels accurately. Testing technology is currently limited in detecting marijuana intoxication levels accurately, as it is possible for a driver to test positive for cannabinol in the blood up to one week after use. More advanced tests are needed to distinguish between recent users and chronic medical marijuana patients. Marijuana legalization could lead to savings in criminal incarcerations. Some claim that marijuana legalization could lead to significant savings in criminal justice spending at federal, state, and local levels. Estimates vary, with Jeffrey Miron of Harvard University suggesting a potential $7.7 billion per year in enforcement cost savings. However, other research indicates that the savings could be smaller. Sevigny and Caulkins found that 8% of state and federal prison inmates serving drug-related sentences were marijuana-only offenders. Research suggests that estimates for marijuana-only offenders in state and federal prisons could be smaller. Sevigny and Caulkins estimated that 8% of inmates serving drug-related sentences were marijuana-only offenders. According to the U.S. Sentencing Commission, 28.4% of drug-related sentences in FY2013 were related to marijuana, the highest share among drug categories. Federal legalization of marijuana would not impact federal inmates already serving sentences for marijuana-related charges, but its effect on the future federal prison population is uncertain. In state and local jails, drug violations make up about one-fifth of incarcerations, with marijuana-only violations accounting for less than 10% of those charges. Legalizing marijuana could potentially lead to a 2% decrease in prisoners in jails over time, but federal legalization would not affect state and local inmates. Legalizing marijuana could potentially reduce the number of prisoners in jails by 2% over time. However, the benefits of legalization would be lost if taxes and regulations are too high, leading to continued illicit market activity. Legalizing marijuana could reduce prisoners in jails by 2% over time, but high taxes and regulations may lead to continued illicit market activity. The majority of costs related to the black market for drugs are for illegal stimulants and opiates, not marijuana, due to the higher price per pound of these drugs. Marijuana exchanges often occur indoors among known parties, reducing conflict risk compared to other drug transactions. Marijuana producers and retailers cannot deduct selling costs. Current Treatment of the Deductibility of Expenses for Marijuana-Related Businesses: Marijuana producers and retailers are unable to deduct selling costs for federal tax filings under IRC Section 280E. The IRS enforces a provision that prohibits marijuana-related businesses from deducting expenses on federal tax filings, effectively imposing a tax on these businesses. Some businesses, like Canna Care marijuana dispensary, have challenged this practice in court. Some businesses, like Sacramento-based Canna Care marijuana dispensary, are challenging IRS tax penalties of over $800,000 in a case before the U.S. tax court in San Francisco. The IRS refused to accept $2.6 million in business deductions for employee salaries, rent, and other costs over three years, creating economic incentives for underground activity due to discrepancies in federal and state tax treatments of marijuana-related businesses. The federal and state tax treatments of marijuana-related businesses create economic incentives for underground activity. Marijuana businesses cannot deduct their expenses, leading to implicit taxes of up to 39.6% or 35%. This gives illicit sellers an advantage as they are not directly taxed on their sales. The federal tax laws create an economic advantage for illicit marijuana sellers by not subjecting them to direct taxation on their sales. The Small Business Tax Equity Act of 2013 aims to exempt businesses conducting marijuana sales in compliance with state law from certain tax prohibitions. An estimate of the national marijuana sales volume can be calculated using Colorado data. Technical calculations for estimating a national marijuana tax base can be done using data from Colorado or Washington. The total sales volume can be extrapolated from tax collection data, although it may underrepresent total demand due to pending licenses and the unknown impact on the underground market. The most recent tax revenue data from Colorado is used to calculate the state's marijuana tax base for this report. The most recent tax revenue data from Colorado is used to estimate the state's marijuana tax base. The recreational tax base is calculated using data from the 10% retail marijuana sales tax and the 2.9% general sales tax. The two calculations are averaged to determine a monthly aggregate tax base for recreational sales. For example, the 10% retail marijuana sales tax collected $2.9 million and the 2.9% sales tax collected $886,915. The Colorado Department of Revenue reported that the 10% retail marijuana sales tax collected $2.9 million and the 2.9% sales tax collected $886,915 in September 2014. This led to an estimate of $30.0 million in recreational marijuana sales in Colorado for that month. The data can be used to calculate a national sales tax base. The national sales tax base can be estimated by extrapolating data from Colorado and applying it to other states and the District of Columbia. This calculation considers population and marijuana usage rates, assuming these are the main factors influencing consumption. It does not account for significant price changes or variations in state tax rates. The national sales tax base for recreational marijuana can be estimated at $14.5 billion to $15.4 billion per year using data from Colorado in August 2014. These estimates are subject to revision as recreational tax revenue in Colorado has been increasing since January 2014. A similar process can be used to calculate the medical marijuana tax base in Colorado, with only one tax levied on medical marijuana (the 2.9% general sales tax). In Colorado, the medical marijuana tax base is calculated using the 2.9% general sales tax. Sales in September 2014 were $31.3 million, with monthly sales ranging from $31 million to $35 million in 2014. Before recreational marijuana legalization in FY2013, the annual medical marijuana tax base was $314.2 million. It is uncertain how the recreational marijuana market has impacted this. The Department of Revenue in Colorado reported an annual medical marijuana tax base of $314.2 million in sales. It is unclear if the opening of the recreational marijuana market has affected the demand for medical marijuana. Medical marijuana data in Colorado may not be representative of the general U.S. population due to incomplete data in some states and potential self-selection bias among patients. Based on tax collections data, medical marijuana consumption could potentially double. Medical marijuana use could double total marijuana consumption in Colorado, even with stricter regulations post-legalization. Users denied a medical card could still purchase marijuana for recreational purposes."
