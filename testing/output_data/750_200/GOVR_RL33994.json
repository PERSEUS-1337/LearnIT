    "content": "Many observers criticized the United Nations for leaving Timor-Leste in 2005, leading to political violence in 2006. President Jose Ramos-Horta requested the UN to stay for five more years in 2008 due to ongoing security concerns. Civilians displaced in 2006 returned home in 2008-2009. A group of assassins, including former Major Alfredo Reinado, failed to assassinate President Ramos-Horta and Prime Minister Gusmao in 2008. Reinado was killed in the attempt. Former Major Alfredo Reinado's failed assassination attempt on President Jose Ramos-Horta and Prime Minister Xanana Gusmao in 2008 resulted in his death. Reinado led a group of over 600 former soldiers who were fired from the army in 2006. The new leader of Reinado's group surrendered in April 2008. While the security situation in Timor-Leste has improved, concerns remain about the delayed implementation of security reforms following the 2006 mutiny by security forces. The government no longer faces an armed rebel group, but observers are still wary. Security reforms following the 2006 mutiny by security forces in Timor-Leste have yet to be fully implemented. Despite the absence of an armed rebel group, the government has not effectively addressed the root causes of the mutiny. A joint Truth Commission report in 2008 blamed Indonesia for atrocities in 1999, leading to expressions of regret from Indonesian President Yudhoyono. President Ramos-Horta urged moving on from the past. Concerns also arose over government plans to withdraw funds in 2009. President Ramos-Horta urged Timor to move on and put the past aside after the report was released. Concerns over government plans in 2009 to withdraw funds from Timor's Petroleum Fund were raised. Timor is seeking ways to benefit economically from gas reserves in the Timor Sea, despite challenges such as political instability and geographical constraints. China's involvement in Timor-Leste increased in 2009, offering assistance in construction projects and selling power plants and patrol boats to the country. In 2009, China provided assistance with construction of government buildings and offered to sell heavy oil power plants and patrol boats to Timor-Leste. The government of East Timor created the National Recovery Strategy Program in 2007, covering areas such as housing, community trust-building, security, social protection, and local socio-economic development. The last IDP camps were being closed in June 2009, with the government needing support to complete the decommissioning and provide for returning persons. The Portuguese asserted control over East Timor in the 1640s, lasting until 1975 when Fretilin declared independence. Indonesia invaded in 1975, leading to a period of occupation with significant casualties. The UN did not recognize Indonesia's annexation of East Timor. East Timor will require support until 2009 to complete decommissioning of IDP camps. In 1975, Indonesia invaded East Timor, leading to an occupation where 100,000 to 250,000 East Timorese died. The UN did not recognize Indonesia's annexation of East Timor. A referendum in 1999 saw 78% of voters choosing independence, resulting in retaliation by pro-integrationist militias and Indonesian military, leading to over 1,300 deaths. In 1999, pro-integrationist militias, backed by elements of the Indonesian military, killed over 1,300 East Timorese. More than 260,000 were displaced in West Timor and 200,000 in East Timor. The militias destroyed 70% of East Timor's economic infrastructure, 80% of schools, and all medical facilities. To restore order, a U.N.-authorized peacekeeping mission called International Force East Timor (INTERFET) was deployed on September 20, 1999, under Australian command. Australia has continued to play a leading role in U.N. operations. Force East Timor (INTERFET) was established under Australian command on September 20, 1999. Australia has maintained a prominent role in U.N. operations and bilateral relations with East Timor since then. Jose Ramos-Horta, the current president and former prime minister of Timor-Leste, has been a key figure in advocating for the country's independence on the international stage. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1996 for his efforts in promoting Timor-Leste's cause. Former President Xanana Gusmao, the current prime minister of Timor-Leste, was a civil servant under Portuguese rule before leading the resistance against Indonesian occupation. He became the resistance leader after the death of Fretilin commander Nicolau Lobato in 1978 and was captured by Indonesian forces in 1992. Xanana Gusmao led the resistance in Timor-Leste after Nicolau Lobato's death in 1978. He was imprisoned by Indonesian forces in 1992 but released in 1999 by President B.J. Habibie. Gusmao became Timor-Leste's first president in 2002 and later served as prime minister after forming a coalition. In 2008, he survived an assassination attempt by Reinado forces. Mari Alkatiri, former prime minister of Timor-Leste, was targeted in an assassination attempt by Reinado forces in 2008. Alkatiri, a Muslim minority in the country, has a strained relationship with Xanana Gusmao, who opposes Fretilin's stance on using petroleum reserves to fund a budget deficit. The relationship between Alkatiri and Gusmao is hostile as Fretilin opposes using petroleum reserves to fund a budget deficit. Timor-Leste has a unicameral parliament of 65 members, elected in 2007 after gaining independence in 2002 under UN administration. East Timor gained independence in 2002 under UN administration. The new constitution established a parliamentary government with a popularly elected President. Xanana Gusmao led a coalition government formed in 2007. Xanana Gusmao leads the Alliance of the Parliamentary Majority, a coalition of four parties in East Timor. The main opposition party is Fretilin. The parliament faces challenges with members lacking legislative experience and education, hindering its effectiveness. In 2007, parliamentary and presidential elections were held in East Timor. Former prime minister Ramos-Horta was elected president with 69% of the vote. Xanana Gusmao was asked to become prime minister after the parliamentary elections in June 2007. Members of parliament lack education and experience, hindering their effectiveness. In 2007, President Horta received 69% of the vote. Xanana Gusmao became prime minister after parliamentary elections. Fretilin party won the most seats but did not have a majority. Violent protests followed Gusmao's appointment. East Timor held elections in 2001 and 2002, with high voter participation. Gusmao, an independence leader, won the 2002 Presidential election. In 2002, East Timor held a Presidential election with high voter turnout. Gusmao, an independence leader, won decisively as an independent candidate. Events in 2006 led to the reintroduction of foreign peacekeepers, including troops from Australia, New Zealand, Portugal, and Malaysia. The largest contingent of peacekeepers in East Timor in 2006 had around 1,100 troops deployed at the invitation of the government. UN Security Council Resolution 1704 established the United Nations Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT) with civilian, police, and military personnel to support stability, democratic governance, and national reconciliation efforts. The source of the 2006 strife was internal divisions within the country. The 2006 strife in East Timor stemmed from internal divisions within the dominant Fretilin party, dating back to their struggle against the Indonesians. This led to splits within the military and police forces, with most military members aligning with Xanana Gusmao, creating paramilitary units within the police. The allegiance of most military members to Gusmao led to the creation of paramilitary units within the police in East Timor. Divisions between the military and police arose from recruitment processes favoring Xanana loyalists and the hiring of former Indonesian police officers. Tensions between the president and ruling party, politicization of the police, and lack of regulatory framework for security forces were highlighted in an International Crisis Group report. The dismissal of 591 military members by former Prime Minister Alkatiri in March 2006 triggered political turmoil in East Timor, where the military was divided along regional lines. The lack of regulatory framework for security forces and the in-bred nature of the political elite exacerbated the situation. In July 2006, the police in East Timor broke into factions, with some joining rebels in the hills after protesting troops were dismissed in March 2006. This led to rioting, looting, deaths, and the fleeing of thousands of eastern East Timorese from the capital. Former Prime Minister Alkatiri stepped down in June amid accusations of discrimination against western districts. Former Prime Minister Alkatiri was accused of forming \"hit squads\" and failing to denounce the transfer of weapons to civilians. Interior Minister Rogerio Lobato was sentenced to seven years for authorizing weapon transfers to supporters and a hit squad. Lobato had a strained relationship with Gusmao and bought arms for the police, establishing paramilitary units. Former Prime Minister Alkatiri accused of forming \"hit squads\" and failing to denounce weapon transfers to civilians. Interior Minister Lobato had a strained relationship with Gusmao, bought arms for police, and established paramilitary units. Major Alfredo Reinado led violent protests in March 2006, escaped from prison in August 2006, and evaded capture by Australian forces in March 2007. Reinado persuaded a border patrol unit to hand over assault rifles on February 25, 2007, leading to government's decision to apprehend him. The decision to apprehend Reinado was made after he convinced a border patrol unit to hand over their assault rifles. Reinado had attracted support among young men resentful of the foreign military presence in East Timor and was also resentful of Fretilin for dismissing protesting troops. Unemployment and underemployment in East Timor is estimated to be as high as 70%. The escalating violence in East Timor involves gangs of unemployed youth, with high levels of unemployment and underemployment reaching 70%. Gang violence following the collapse of law and order in May 2006 led to deaths, displacement of residents, and property destruction. The instability since April 2006 has affected livelihoods, displacing an estimated 178,000 people. Many gangs in Dili support Reinado, who attracted young men resentful of foreign military presence and Fretilin's actions. The security situation in East Timor since April 2006 caused instability and volatility, displacing an estimated 178,000 people. By February 2007, around 100,000 remained displaced, facing challenges such as lack of access to clean water, poor sanitation leading to disease risks, and the threat of flooding in camps. Many did not have homes to return to due to damage or destruction. These conditions needed to be understood in the overall context of East Timor. Poor sanitation and risk of flooding were significant issues for internally displaced persons (IDPs) in camps in East Timor. The United Nations reported that over 40% of the population lived below the poverty line, leading to high child mortality rates due to lack of sanitation, infectious diseases, and malnutrition. Rice shortages, food price increases, deteriorating social structures, and limited access to healthcare and education further exacerbated the situation. The social structures and services in East Timor impact healthcare, education, and disaster response. The distribution of essentials focuses on internally displaced persons (IDPs), but needs are widespread. Transitioning from humanitarian to development programs is challenging due to extreme poverty levels. Funding increases during times of insecurity and displacement, with the UN's Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) providing assistance during violence in 2006. During periods of insecurity and displacement, funding for food and shelter assistance increased. In 2006, the UN's Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) and UNOCHA provided immediate emergency aid, with a total of nearly $40 million contributed. Security incidents in 2007 led to restrictions on humanitarian personnel movement, affecting access to assistance and raising concerns about the safety of displaced individuals and organizations providing aid. Access issues and concerns about protection and security for displaced individuals and organizations providing assistance arose during violent demonstrations, with some attributing the unrest to local gang-related incidents. Contingency planning was initiated by the National Disaster Management Office and Ministry of Labour and Community Reinsertion to address displacement concerns. The international humanitarian aid community, including the UN peacekeeping operation, provided contributions and assistance in response to the civil unrest. The humanitarian aid community, including the UN and other organizations, provided assistance in response to civil unrest in East Timor. By April 2008, IDPs willing to return received support packages and some IDP camps were closed. The Ministry of Social Solidarity oversaw the returns process with help from international organizations like the International Organization for Migration. In November 2008, Social Solidarity (MSS) and international organizations like the International Organization for Migration (IOM) assisted in the returns process for IDPs. Approximately 10,400 families received recovery packages and returned, with 21 camps closed. Transitional shelter sites were built to house displaced individuals. However, returning IDPs still face challenges with limited access to food, water, and basic services due to increasing food prices, shortages of dietary staples, lack of arable land, and the impact of natural disasters on food security since 2008. The deterioration in food security since 2008 was due to shortages of dietary staples, lack of arable land, and natural disasters. Challenges in IDP reintegration included land disputes, damaged homes, and fear of violence. IDP returns in East Timor in 2008 were relatively peaceful. Walter Kalin emphasized the need for human rights for IDPs during his visit. In December 2008, the U.N. Representative on Human Rights for IDPs, Walter Kalin, focused on sustaining returns and developing durable solutions in East Timor. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) ended its formal mission, with a national staff member continuing to work within UNMIT. The U.N. Security Council established the U.N. Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT) in August 2006 under Resolution 1704 (2006) for an initial six-month period, comprising civilian and police components. The U.N. Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT) was established in August 2006 under Resolution 1704 for an initial six-month period. The mission includes civilian, police, and military personnel to assist with security, political, and humanitarian issues, as well as support for electoral processes. Cooperation with the International Security Force (ISF) was also emphasized. The UNMIT mission in East Timor was established in August 2006 to assist with security and political issues. The mandate was extended multiple times until February 2010. Despite improvements, challenges like the reintegration of IDPs remain. The UNMIT mission in East Timor was extended until February 26, 2010, with Resolution 1867 (2009). Despite some improvements, challenges such as reintegration of IDPs, poverty, underdevelopment, and high unemployment persist in a fragile political environment. The Secretary General emphasized the need for long-term commitment from the international community for stability and democratic governance. The Secretary General emphasized the need for long-term commitment by the international community to achieve stability, development, and democratic governance in East Timor. He highlighted three main areas of focus: Political Developments, Restoration and Maintenance of Public Security, and Support for the 'Compact'. The Secretary General's report in early January 2009 focused on political and security developments in East Timor, emphasizing the need for dialogue, reconciliation, democratic governance, public security, and human rights promotion.

Additionally, there is a focus on a comprehensive review of the security sector, promotion of human rights and administration of justice, increased socio-economic development and humanitarian assistance through various initiatives. The U.N. peace operations in East Timor have evolved since 1999, with the establishment of the United Nations Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) to oversee a national referendum. After violent post-referendum events, a medium-term strategy is being prepared for East Timor with specific benchmarks. The United Nations Transitional Authority for East Timor (UNTAET) was established on October 25, 1999, to oversee the transition period after the violent post-referendum events in East Timor. The United Nations Transitional Authority for East Timor (UNTAET) was established in 1999 to administer East Timor's transition to independence, providing humanitarian aid, reconstruction assistance, and government establishment. UNTAET's mandate also included aiding East Timorese refugees in Indonesia. In September 2000, three U.N. humanitarian workers were killed in East Timor. In September 2000, three U.N. humanitarian workers were killed by East Timorese militia groups, leading to the temporary suspension of U.N. humanitarian activities in West Timor. Security Council Resolution 1410 (2002) established the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET) as a successor to UNTAET. Subsequent resolutions extended UNMISET's mandate until May 20, 2005, when Resolution 1599 (2005) established the United Nations Office in Timor-Leste (UNOTIL). On April 28, 2005, the U.N. Security Council adopted Resolution 1599 (2005) establishing the United Nations Office in Timor-Leste (UNOTIL) for peace-building activities until May 19, 2006. UNOTIL supported state institutions, strengthened democratic governance, and developed a national police force, including the Border Patrol Unit. Special Representative Sukehiro Hasegawa addressed the U.N. Security Council on January 23, 2006, providing a summary of UNOTIL's activities. In his address to the U.N. Security Council on January 23, 2006, Sukehiro Hasegawa summarized UNOTIL's efforts in Timor-Leste, focusing on progress in building state institutions, training national judges, and developing expertise in the finance sector. Progress was also noted in drafting a strategic plan, establishing a complaint handling system, and promoting democratic governance and human rights. Progress was made in the finance sector, drafting a strategic plan, developing a complaint handling system, and working on international legal obligations. Border Patrol Unit assessments and training were progressing, but concerns were raised about weaknesses in capacity building in justice and finance sectors. International advisory support was deemed critical, especially regarding roughly 3,000 pending civil and criminal cases. Mr. Hasegawa highlighted the need for international advisory support in the justice and finance sectors, particularly concerning 3,000 pending civil and criminal cases. Human rights activities required outside supervision, and additional training was necessary for the Border Patrol Unit to prevent border incidents. Despite progress, the situation was described as \"fragile\" and stability was crucial for confidence in the political system. Mr. Hasegawa emphasized the need for international advisory support in justice and finance sectors, with a focus on pending cases and human rights activities. He described the situation as \"fragile\" and stressed the importance of stability for confidence in the political system. The UNOTIL mandate was extended multiple times due to escalating violence in 2006. The U.N. Security Council extended the mandate for UNOTIL multiple times in 2006 due to escalating violence. The U.S. has provided bilateral assistance to East Timor for economic and political development, focusing on building a self-sufficient economy, basic public services, and good governance. The U.S. has provided assistance to East Timor for economic and political development, focusing on good governance through a democratic political system and post-conflict democracy initiatives. U.S. support includes independent media, civil society organizations, political parties, electoral process, judicial institutions, and governmental capacity. Experts believe East Timor still requires sustained bilateral, multilateral, and regional support. According to a 2010 State Department budget document, the U.S. needs to focus on re-establishing government functions, including security services. The U.S. will need to focus on re-establishing government functions, including security services, in East Timor. The Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) provides non-food humanitarian assistance during crises and disasters through grants to implementing partners like U.N. agencies and international organizations. In East Timor, USAID provides assistance through grants to implementing partners like U.N. agencies and international organizations. OFDA and FFP are utilized for humanitarian efforts, funding tasks such as humanitarian coordination, shelter, water, sanitation, peacebuilding, and psychosocial support. In East Timor, USAID provides humanitarian assistance through grants to partners for tasks including coordination, shelter, water, sanitation, peacebuilding, and psychosocial services. In FY2008, OFDA, FFP, and CMM collectively provided over $3.1 million in aid, with similar amounts in previous years. In FY2008, OFDA, FFP, and CMM collectively provided over $3.1 million in aid for humanitarian assistance in East Timor. The events of 2006 highlighted the need for improved security services, judiciary, institutional transparency, and rule of law to prevent destabilization upon the U.N.'s departure. The U.N.'s presence in East Timor needs to be carefully considered to prevent destabilization upon its departure. The U.S.'s relations with East Timor are linked to its relations with Indonesia and past human rights abuses in East Timor. Congress has restricted military contact between the U.S. and Indonesia due to these concerns. The East Timorese government is looking towards a productive future by moving past its troubled history. The East Timorese government is ready to move past its troubled history and establish a productive relationship with Indonesia. The United States considers human rights concerns in its policies towards both East Timor and Indonesia. Legislation has been proposed to include Timor-Leste in tariff relief assistance for developing economies. The proposed legislation aims to provide tariff relief assistance to Timor-Leste and other eligible states for promoting economic growth. Timor-Leste seeks to strengthen relations with various countries including Australia, New Zealand, Portugal, Indonesia, and China, and aspires to join ASEAN. Timor-Leste seeks to strengthen relations with Australia, New Zealand, Portugal, Indonesia, and China.

Australia has 650 soldiers and New Zealand has 150 troops in the International Stabilization Force (ISF) in Timor-Leste. Australia also has police working with 20 other countries in Dili as part of the United Nations Police Force. Australia has a strategic interest in Timor-Leste, providing support through the International Stabilization Force (ISF) and recognizing Indonesian control of the province. They have historical ties, including fighting Japanese forces in World War II and blockading Timor in 1975. Australia also has economic interests in hydrocarbon resources in the region. Australia recognized Indonesian control of the province as part of the Timor Gap Treaty in 1989, which covered joint development of hydrocarbon resources in the maritime area. The treaty was replaced by the Timor Sea Treaty in 2003 with Timor-Leste. Despite disagreements on sovereignty, Australia and Timor-Leste have a working relationship for joint development of resources in the maritime space. Australia and Timor-Leste have a working relationship for joint development of hydrocarbon resources in the maritime space, despite disagreements on sovereignty. Timor-Leste hopes for a processing facility in Timor, while Australia supports one in Darwin. Commercial concerns favor Darwin due to the seabed geography and political security situation in Timor. Key participants in the greater Sunrise project include Woodside, ConocoPhillips, Shell, and Osaka Gas. Participants in the greater Sunrise project include Woodside, ConocoPhillips, Shell, and Osaka Gas. Timor-Leste has a strong historical connection with Portugal, with Portuguese colonial influence lasting from 1640 to 1975. The nation is predominantly Catholic and Portuguese is one of its official languages. Portugal continues to provide foreign assistance to Timor-Leste. Portugal has historical ties with Timor-Leste and remains a key provider of foreign assistance. After gaining independence from Portugal in 1975, Timor-Leste was invaded by Indonesia, leading to a guerilla movement and significant loss of life. Indonesian military-backed militias further devastated the country after a 1999 referendum for independence. After gaining independence from Portugal in 1975, Timor-Leste was invaded by Indonesia, leading to significant loss of life. Indonesian military-backed militias further devastated the country after a 1999 referendum for independence. Elements within the Indonesian military wanted to send a message to other provinces with secessionist movements. President Ramos-Horta has called on the people to move on from the atrocities of 1999 for the nation to move forward. President Ramos-Horta believes it is necessary for the nation to move forward, despite the fact that those responsible for the atrocities of 1999 will never be tried. A truth commission found that the Indonesian army armed and funded pro-Indonesian Timorese militias in 1999, leading to rape, murder, torture, and forced deportation. Former Indonesian General Wiranto, responsible for human rights abuses in East Timor in 1999, ran for vice president in the 2009 Indonesian elections. China has been increasing its investment in Timor-Leste since 2005. China has been rapidly increasing its investment in Timor-Leste since 2005 for various reasons, including balancing U.S. influence in Southeast Asia, accessing Timor's hydrocarbon resources, and preventing Timor from aligning with Taiwan on the One-China policy. This rise of Chinese influence in Timor may concern Australian strategic planners. China's increasing investment in Timor-Leste includes projects like assisting in building government buildings and selling patrol vessels to Timor for $30 million. Timor's Foreign Minister supports a One-China policy and China's support for Timor's ASEAN membership. Timor supports a One-China policy and China supports Timor's efforts to join ASEAN. Plans to purchase second-hand oil burning power stations from China for $381 million faced criticism in June 2009 for being unnecessary and polluting. Fretilin opposes the proposal and is preparing a legal challenge. Timor became a member of the ASEAN Regional Forum in July 2005 and is interested in full ASEAN membership. East Timor, a member of the ASEAN Regional Forum since July 2005, is interested in full ASEAN membership. The country's extensive off-shore energy resources could provide financial resources for development. Disputes with Australia over maritime boundaries have been partially resolved through revenue sharing agreements. In January 2006, Australia and East Timor signed a treaty on Certain Maritime Agreements in the Timor Sea (CMATS). In January 2006, Australia and East Timor signed a treaty increasing East Timor's share of hydrocarbon revenues from 18% to 50% for the Greater Sunrise field. East Timor earned an estimated $360 million in hydrocarbon revenues in 2005-2006. Additionally, East Timor has a 90%-10% revenue sharing agreement for the Bayu-Udan field, containing 400 million barrels of oil and 3.4 trillion cubic feet of gas. Greater Sunrise is believed to hold 300 million barrels of light oil and 2.53 trillion cubic meters of natural gas. The Greater Sunrise field contains an estimated 300 million barrels of light oil and 2.53 trillion cubic meters of natural gas. Industry favors Darwin for processing centers due to seabed configuration and lack of infrastructure in East Timor. ConocoPhillips has built a new LNG plant near Darwin, while Timor-Leste prefers a plant on its southern coast as an alternative. The government of Timor-Leste prefers a liquid natural gas plant on its southern coast as an alternative to facilities in Darwin. The Bayu-Udan field is expected to be depleted by 2023. East Timor has banked billions in energy revenues since 2005, mostly placed in a Petroleum Fund. Criticism was directed at Prime Minister Gusmao for spending from the fund meant for future generations. Timor's top export destinations are Australia, Germany, Portugal, and Brazil. The aim of the fund is to save oil and gas revenues for future generations. Timor's top export destinations are Australia, Germany, Portugal, and Brazil. East Timor is the poorest country in Asia with a dual economy and infrastructure devastated by violence in 1999. Poverty is widespread with many areas lacking basic amenities. East Timor faces challenges in infrastructure, job creation, health, and literacy rates. Indonesian is more widely used than Tetun or Portuguese. Economic development is crucial for improving living standards. External assistance will be needed post-independence for governance capacity building. Experts predict continued external assistance will be crucial post-independence for capacity building in governance, despite increased revenue from oil and gas. Economic activities include coffee, tourism, and fisheries. The UNDAF provides a roadmap for UN agencies, while challenges include strengthening democratic institutions, education and training, rule of law implementation, and infrastructure rebuilding. East Timor is focused on developing its workforce, institutions, and economy, as well as rebuilding infrastructure. It is a member of the World Bank, IMF, and has shown interest in joining ASEAN. In 2000, an international tribunal was recommended for crimes related to the 1999 violence, but Indonesia conducted its own investigation, leading to dissatisfaction from the US and its allies. The Indonesian investigation into crimes related to the 1999 violence in East Timor led to dissatisfaction from the US and its allies. The Serious Crimes Unit (SCU) of UNMISET indicted over 380 individuals, convicted 55, and acquitted three for their role in the crimes. Only one person has been imprisoned as a result of the Indonesian process. The Indonesian process has resulted in the imprisonment of only one individual for crimes related to the 1999 referendum in East Timor. President Gusmao supports a joint East Timor-Indonesia Commission of Truth and Friendship to address past atrocities, with public hearings held in Bali in February 2007. Gusmao has faced criticism for not holding Indonesia accountable for documented atrocities such as executions, torture, mutilations, and rape. Indonesia accountable for atrocities in East Timor documented in the CAVR report of 2005. Gusmao's potential as prime minister may not change the approach to addressing past human rights abuses by Indonesians. The 2009 State Department report highlighted ongoing human rights issues in Timor-Leste. Serious human rights problems in Timor-Leste include police abuse, arbitrary arrest, inefficient judiciary, and poor conditions in displacement camps. Government control over security forces is maintained, but discipline and accountability issues persist. Questions arose when the UNOTIL mission's mandate was set to end in 2006. The UNOTIL mission in East Timor faced challenges with discipline and accountability within the Defense Forces. There were debates about extending the U.N. presence due to concerns about the country's fragile state institutions. Improvements were needed in security services, the judiciary, institutional transparency, and the rule of law. East Timor requested U.N. assistance for institutional transparency, security, electoral aid, and advisors in justice and finance sectors. The U.S. suggested reducing reliance on direct U.N. aid but continuing support in political, economic, and security sectors. Assistance from the international community was also recommended. The debate surrounds the timing of the United Nations' departure from fragile states like East Timor, with questions about the length of their stay and the continued support needed from the international community. Assistance can come from various sources such as the UNDP, World Bank, bilateral donors, and expert advisors, without infringing on East Timor's sovereignty. The debate surrounds the timing of the United Nations' departure from fragile states like East Timor, with questions about the length of their stay and the continued support needed from the international community. Donor fatigue and limited budgets for humanitarian crises and development assistance add pressure for aid, complicating the decision-making process."
