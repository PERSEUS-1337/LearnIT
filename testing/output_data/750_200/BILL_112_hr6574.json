    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Servicemember Mental Health Review Act\". Since September 11, 2001, around 30,000 veterans have been discharged from the Armed Forces due to personality or adjustment disorders. These veterans are then unable to access disability compensation, severance pay, or retirement pay. Additionally, many of them struggle to find employment due to the stigma associated with their discharge label. The Government Accountability Office found that Department of Defense compliance in separating Armed Forces members with personality or adjustment disorders was as low as 40% between 2001 and 2007. A Mental Health Discharge Board of Review was established to review the separation of veterans based on these disorders. A review is needed to ensure veterans separated based on personality or adjustment disorders can access disability benefits and employment opportunities. The Department of Defense will review military separations based on mental conditions that do not amount to disability. The Department of Defense will establish Mental Health Discharge Boards of Review to review separations based on mental conditions not amounting to disability for covered individuals previously separated from the armed forces. The Department of Defense will establish the `Mental Health Discharge Board of Review' consisting of at least five members, including a licensed psychologist and psychiatrist. Each board will be equipped with necessary staff support. Covered individuals will be reviewed for separations based on mental conditions not amounting to disability. The Department of Defense will establish the 'Mental Health Discharge Board of Review' for members separated from the armed forces since September 11, 2001, due to mental conditions. Covered individuals will receive notification of their right to review by the appropriate Mental Health Discharge Board. The covered individual receives notification of the right to review by the Mental Health Discharge Board of Review upon separation from the armed forces. The Secretary of the military department is responsible for providing this notification, and the Secretary of Defense monitors compliance and reports any failures to Congress. The Secretary of Defense monitors compliance with notification requirements and reports failures to Congress. Covered individuals can request a review by the Mental Health Discharge Board of Review if they do not receive notification. Legal counsel must inform individuals of their right to obtain representation before the Board. The Mental Health Discharge Board of Review informs covered individuals of their right to obtain private counsel for representation. The Board reviews the findings of the Department of Defense psychologist or psychiatrist, as well as the decisions of the separation authority. The Mental Health Discharge Board of Review evaluates the mental condition diagnosed by the Department of Defense, reviews the separation authority's decisions, and ensures compliance with separation processes. The review includes records from the Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs, along with other evidence presented to the Board. The Mental Health Discharge Board of Review considers all evidence, including private mental health records, for individuals undergoing review. If the Board initiates a review, consent must be obtained from the individual or their representative before proceeding. After completing the review, the Mental Health Discharge Board must provide a statement of reasons to the claimant. The individual can request a reconsideration if new evidence is available. The Board is authorized to make recommendations. The Mental Health Discharge Board can recommend no negative recharacterization of separation or modification of disability rating, or recharacterization to retirement for disability, based on its findings in a review. The Mental Health Discharge Board can recommend recharacterization of separation to retirement for disability, separation for disability with severance pay, separation upon expiration of service term, or separation for convenience of the Government, and issuance of a new disability rating for individuals, in compliance with Administrative Procedure Act transparency. The Mental Health Discharge Board of Review can recommend different types of separation for covered individuals, including retirement for disability, and must provide a brief statement if a recharacterization recommendation is not made. The recommendation and statement will be sent to the individual or their representative. The Secretary of the military department corrects the military records of a covered individual based on the recommendation of the Mental Health Discharge Board of Review. Corrections are effective as of the separation date. The covered individual's pay or benefits may be reduced if they received a lump-sum payment at separation. The Secretary of Defense will establish regulations for implementing this section. The Secretary of Defense will establish regulations with reasonable deadlines for reviews required by this section. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections in the chapter. The Secretary of Defense will establish Mental Health Discharge Boards of Review within 90 days of the enactment of the Act, as required by section 1554b of title 10, United States Code."
