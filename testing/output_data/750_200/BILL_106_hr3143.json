    "content": "The Act titled \"High Performance Schools Act of 1999\" is established for the purpose of improving school performance. The Congress finds that American K-12 schools spend over $6 billion annually on energy costs, more than on books and computers combined. Educators and students perform best in a comfortable, healthy, naturally lit environment, with studies showing higher achievement and attendance. Over half of K-12 schools are over 40 years old and need renovation for efficiency and comfort, with 6,000 new schools needed. Over 6,000 new schools will be needed in the next 10 years to accommodate the growing number of students. Poor ventilation, lighting, and temperature control in schools can hinder students' ability to focus and succeed. Older schools often have inefficient water usage. A holistic approach to designing and renovating schools is recommended for better efficiency and comfort. Adopting a whole building approach in school design and renovation leads to high performance buildings, improved student and teacher performance, and lower life-cycle costs compared to conventional methods. Adopting a whole building approach in school design and renovation leads to lower life-cycle costs compared to conventional methods. Energy conservation in construction projects can save money for teachers and educational materials. Using renewable energy sources in low-energy buildings can meet energy needs without added emissions. Using geothermal, hydropower, and biomass power in low-energy buildings can meet energy needs without emissions. Implementing environmentally preferable products and ensuring fresh air supply improves indoor air quality in school buildings. Many school districts lack knowledge of cutting-edge design and technologies for efficient new construction or renovations. Congress is considering legislation to aid school districts in building new schools and renovating existing ones. Congress is considering legislation to assist school districts in building new high-performance, energy-efficient, and environmentally sound schools. The legislation aims to establish and administer a program to help school districts construct new high-performance, energy-efficient, and environmentally sound schools. The High Performance Schools Program is established in the Department of Education to provide grants to school districts for energy efficiency and assistance in implementing the program. Grants under the High Performance Schools Program shall be used to achieve energy efficiency performance not less than 30 percent beyond the levels prescribed in the 1998 International Energy Conservation Code for school districts in need of funding for increasing enrollments or renovation of facilities. The High Performance Schools Program provides grants for school districts facing increased enrollments or facility renovations, demonstrating a lack of funds to address these needs without assistance. Grant funds must be used to develop high-performance school buildings in line with an approved plan. Grants may also be used for evaluating compliance with program requirements. The High Performance Schools Program grants are used to evaluate compliance with program requirements and may also be used for distributing information, organizing programs, and obtaining technical services to promote high performance school buildings. The High Performance Schools Program grants support the advancement of high performance school buildings through technical services, data collection, and promotional activities. The High Performance Schools Program grants support promotional and marketing activities for energy efficiency, including working with school administrations, students, and communities. Grants are provided to school districts with feasible plans developed in consultation with State offices of energy and education. The State agency designated by the Governor determines feasible and appropriate actions to achieve grant purposes. The agency encourages school districts to supplement grant funds with other sources for plan implementation. SEC. 4. ALLOCATION OF FUNDS. Governors of the States will receive funds for implementing the Act and will determine the State agency to administer assistance to school districts. Funds allocated under section 5 will be divided as follows: 70% for grants under section 3(b)(1), 15% for grants under section 3(b)(2), and 15% for grants under section 3(b)(3). The Secretary of Education may retain up to $300,000 per year to assist State agencies in coordinating and implementing the Program established under section 3(a). These funds can be used to develop reference materials for high-performance school buildings. SEC. 5. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. $200,000,000 authorized for fiscal year 2001, increasing annually. SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines \"elementary school\" and \"secondary school\" as per the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. It also defines a \"high performance school building\" as one that maximizes renewable energy use and is cost-effective. A high performance school building maximizes renewable energy use, is cost-effective, uses durable materials, enhances indoor environmental quality, conserves water, and optimizes site potential. Renewable energy includes solar, wind, geothermal, hydropower, and biomass power."
