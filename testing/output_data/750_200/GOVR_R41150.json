    "content": "Energy and Water Development funding for FY2010 was provided in H.R. 3183, which became P.L. 111-85 when signed by President Obama on October 28, 2009. Appropriations totaled $33.5 billion in P.L. 111-85, with additional funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (P.L. 111-5) for programs in the Corps of Engineers, Bureau of Reclamation, and Department of Energy. President Obama's FY2011 budget proposed $35.3 billion for Energy and Water Development programs. On July 15, 2010, the House Appropriations Subcommittee approved a bill for funding these programs. The House Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development approved a bill to fund programs at $34.7 billion, while the Senate approved a bill with a total of $35.0 billion. A continuing resolution was passed to fund government programs at the FY2010 level until December 3. The Senate and House passed a continuing resolution (H.R. 3081, P.L. 111-242) funding government programs at FY2010 levels until December 3. Later, funding was extended through March 4, 2011, and then further extended to March 18, 2011, with reduced funding levels for Energy and Water Development programs. H.R. 1 was introduced to continue funding for the rest of FY2011 at FY2010 levels, with specified exceptions for reduced funding. The House Appropriations Committee announced that the Energy and Water Development funding level in H.R. 1 was $29.9 billion, which was passed by the House on February 19. The Senate offered S.Amdt. 149 as a substitute for H.R. 1 with fewer funding reductions totaling approximately $32.4 billion. However, on March 9, the Senate rejected both versions. After short-term extensions, H.R. 1473 was passed by both the House and Senate on April 14 and signed by the President on April 15. The Energy and Water Development bill, H.R. 1473, was passed on April 14 and signed into law on April 15 (P.L. 112-10), funding programs at approximately $32.2 billion. It includes funding for various projects under the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Department of Energy, Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and other agencies. The Energy and Water Development bill, H.R. 1473, was passed on April 14 and signed into law on April 15 (P.L. 112-10), funding programs at approximately $32.2 billion. It includes funding for projects under the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Department of Energy, Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and other agencies. Budget details for energy and water development appropriations enacted for FY2004 to FY2011 are provided in tables, along with totals for each of the bill's four titles and key issues involved in major programs. Funding information for Title I (Corps of Engineers), Title II (Department of the Interior), Title III (Department of Energy), and Title IV (independent agencies) for FY2010-FY2011 is also included. The Energy and Water Development bill, H.R. 1473 (P.L. 112-10), funded programs at approximately $32.2 billion, including projects for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Department of Energy, Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and other agencies. Budget details for FY2004 to FY2011 are provided in tables for Title I (Corps of Engineers), Title II (Department of the Interior), Title III (Department of Energy), and Title IV (independent agencies). The FY2011 President's request for the Army Corps of Engineers was $4.88 billion, $564 million below the FY2010 appropriation. The Senate Appropriations Committee provided $5.32 billion for the Corps in the FY2011 spending bill, an increase of $381 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee provided the Corps with $5.32 billion for FY2011, an increase of $381 million over the Administration's request but slightly below the appropriation for FY2010. The House Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development marked up its version of the bill with $5.28 billion. The House-passed Continuing Resolution would have reduced overall funding for the Corps to approximately $4.8 billion, $641 million below the FY2010 enacted level. The Continuing Resolution as passed provided $5.05 billion for the Corps. The Corps' funding for FY2011 was reduced to approximately $4.8 billion, below the FY2010 enacted level. Unlike other infrastructure programs, federal funds for the Corps are not distributed based on a formula or competitive program. About 85% of the appropriations for the Corps' civil works activities are directed to specific projects. The Corps' civil works activities are funded through specific projects identified in the budget request or added during congressional deliberations. Funding debates often involve earmarks, with appropriations typically tied to previously authorized projects under the Water Resources Development Act. The backlog of authorized projects ranges from $11 billion to over $80 billion, depending on various criteria. The Corps' Civil Works program has a backlog of authorized projects ranging from $11 billion to over $80 billion. This backlog raises policy questions about the disconnect between authorization and appropriations processes and how to prioritize among authorized activities. Since Hurricane Katrina, the Corps has received approximately $18.7 billion in supplemental appropriations, including $15 billion from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The Corps has received $18.7 billion in supplemental appropriations since 2005, including $15 billion for post-hurricane emergency repairs in Louisiana and the Gulf Coast region. In 2008, they received $5.76 billion for Louisiana hurricane protection, and in 2009, $797 million for flood control and coastal emergencies, with $439 million for barrier island and ecosystem restoration in Mississippi. The Corps received $18.7 billion in supplemental appropriations since 2005, including $15 billion for post-hurricane repairs in Louisiana and the Gulf Coast. In 2009, $797 million was allocated for flood control and coastal emergencies, with $439 million specifically for barrier island and ecosystem restoration in Mississippi. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provided an additional $4.6 billion for the Corps for FY2009 and FY2010. The FY2011 Obama Administration request included $1.69 billion for construction, a reduction of $341 million from the previous year. The Obama Administration's FY2011 request for construction funding was $1.69 billion, a decrease of $341 million from the previous year. The request limited new construction starts, with only two new starts included. The Senate Appropriations Committee proposed $1.9 billion for construction, utilizing $120 million from prior year appropriations. The Senate Appropriations Committee proposed $1.9 billion for construction, using $120 million from prior year appropriations for the Continuing Authorities Program. The enacted bill provided $1.78 billion for construction, slightly more than the Administration's request, and included a provision barring the Corps from new starts. The Inland Waterway Trust Fund (IWTF) is facing a deficit as funding for ongoing work exceeds incoming collections. Current law states that federal funds cover construction and rehabilitation costs for inland waterways, with 50% coming from IWTF and 50% from the federal general revenue fund, which is fueled by a non-inflation indexed fuel tax. The IWTF receives federal funding from a fuel tax on vessels, with 50% from IWTF and 50% from the federal general revenue fund. Additional federal funding was provided in FY2009 and FY2010 to maintain IWTF solvency. Previous administrations proposed increasing revenues by replacing the fuel tax with a lock user fee, which Congress has criticized. The Administration's FY2011 Budget proposed limiting IWTF spending to current fuel tax revenues, rejecting the user fee approach. The Senate Appropriations Committee also agreed to budget only current year fuel tax revenues, warning of potential action if a solution is not reached soon. The committee supports budgeting only current year fuel tax revenues, warning of potential action if a solution is not reached soon. The Corps plays a significant role in coordinating the restoration of the Central and Southern Florida ecosystem, with funding from Energy and Water Development and Department of the Interior appropriations. Concerns about appropriations levels and progress in the restoration effort are discussed in CRS Report RS22048. The FY2011 Obama Administration request for the Corps' component of south Florida Everglades restoration work totals $180 million, the same as FY2010. The Senate Appropriations Committee bill proposed reducing this to $155 million due to Corps' inability to utilize the original amount. The Senate Appropriations Committee proposed reducing the FY2011 Obama Administration request for the Corps' south Florida Everglades restoration work from $180 million to $155 million due to the Corps' inability to utilize the original amount. This reduction is needed for the Central and Southern Florida restoration element. In FY2011, Congress stopped applying an S&S rate to decrease the need for reprogramming allocations among Corps projects. The FY2011 Senate Appropriations Committee markup included reductions for Investigations (-$16 million) and Construction. The FY2011 Senate Appropriations Committee markup for the Corps included reductions for Investigations (-$16 million), Construction (-$88 million), Operations and Maintenance (-$57 million), and Mississippi Rivers & Tributaries (-$11 million). The Obama Administration requested $43.0 million for the Central Utah Project (CUP) Completion Account in FY2011, $1 million more than FY2010. The FY2011 request for the Bureau of Reclamation totaled $1.064 billion, $22 million less than FY2010. The FY2011 request for the Bureau of Reclamation is $22 million less than FY2010, with a net discretionary authority of $1.015 billion. An additional $167 million is estimated from other funds, bringing the total to $1.182 billion. The total discretionary budget request for Title II funding was approximately $1.107 billion, slightly lower than the 2010 enacted bill of $1.129 billion. The Senate bill, S. 3635, would have made further adjustments. The FY2011 request for the Bureau of Reclamation is $22 million less than FY2010, with a net discretionary authority of $1.015 billion. The total discretionary budget request for Title II funding was approximately $1.107 billion. The Senate bill, S. 3635, would have appropriated $1.133 billion for Title II programs; the House subcommittee's bill would have appropriated $1.108 billion. Reclamation's largest account, Water and Related Resources, includes construction, operations, Dam Safety Program, Water and Energy Management Development, and Fish and Wildlife Management. The Obama Administration requested $913.6 million for the Water. The Obama Administration requested $913.6 million for the Water and Related Resources Account for FY2011, a reduction of $37.6 million from FY2010. H.R. 1 proposed funding the account at $911.6 million, $39 million below the FY2010 level. The bill included amendments with potential policy impacts, such as eliminating funding for a dam removal study in the Klamath basin. Section 4028 of H.R. 1 would eliminate funding for a dam removal study in the Klamath basin. Section 4075 would bar funding for the implementation of biological opinions related to the Central Valley Project and the California State Project, as well as the San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement Act. The Bureau of Reclamation, not the Army Corps of Engineers, built dams and water diversion structures in the West for irrigation purposes. Today, Reclamation manages over 300 storage reservoirs in 17 western states. Reclamation manages hundreds of dams and diversion projects in 17 western states, providing water to 10 million acres of farmland and 31 million people. They are the largest wholesale water supplier in the region and the second-largest hydroelectric power producer in the nation, also offering flood control, recreation, and wildlife benefits. Operations can be controversial due to impacts on fish, wildlife, and conflicts among water users. The House Committee on Appropriations criticized Reclamation for not providing leadership in water supply and infrastructure maintenance despite past achievements. Balancing competing needs, increasing demand for water supply, and changing hydrology will require active leadership. The House Committee on Appropriations criticized Reclamation for not providing leadership in water supply infrastructure. Balancing competing needs, increasing demand for water supply, and changing hydrology will require active leadership in western water resource management. The CVP in California is one of Reclamation's largest and most complex water projects, facing challenges like limited water deliveries and pumping due to drought and environmental restrictions. In FY2010 appropriations, amendments were made to prevent Reclamation from implementing new Biological Opinions on project operations affecting fish species like Delta Smelt and salmon in California. These species are protected under the federal Endangered Species Act and the California. The OCAP plan, which allowed increased pumping from the Delta, has raised concerns about the survival of Delta Smelt and salmon in California. These species are protected under the federal Endangered Species Act and the California Endangered Species Act. Factors such as invasive species, pollution, and water withdrawals from the Delta have also contributed to the decline in fish populations. Recent court-imposed limits on pumping and a review of project operations highlight the critical situation facing Delta Smelt. The critically low numbers of Delta Smelt have led to court-imposed limits on pumping and a review of project operations. Low water deliveries to certain districts are worsening unemployment in an already struggling economy. Proposed FY2010 amendments to prevent BiOps implementation were not passed, but a bill included a two-year authorization for water transfers in the CVP. The FY2010 bill included an amendment allowing water transfers among certain CVP contractors without meeting specific conditions from the Central Valley Project Improvement Act. The Administration requested $40.0 million for the California Bay-Delta Restoration Account for FY2011, with funds allocated to water use efficiency, water quality, water storage, conveyance, and ecosystem restoration. The FY2010 bill allocated funding for various program areas including water use efficiency, water quality, water storage, conveyance, and ecosystem restoration. Funding for CALFED subaccounts varied, with some areas seeing increases while others declined. The Continuing Resolution provided the same amount as the President's FY2011 budget request. Reclamation proposed a $72.1 million allocation for the San Joaquin River Restoration Fund for FY2011, a significant increase from FY2010. The Fund was authorized by the San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement Act and is used for fisheries restoration and water management as part of a settlement agreement. The San Joaquin River Restoration Fund for FY2011 will be funded through a reallocation of $5.6 million annually from the Friant Division water users and other sources. Additional authorization is needed for allocations exceeding $88 million. Planned actions include releasing interim flows from Friant Dam and completing planning and environmental compliance. The San Joaquin River Restoration Fund for FY2011 will exceed the authorized $88 million. Planned actions include releasing interim flows from Friant Dam and completing planning, environmental compliance, and design for initial channel and structural improvements to restore salmon migration and reduce water supply impacts. The Senate Appropriations Committee markup included an additional $8 million for San Joaquin River restoration, in addition to the $72 million already allocated. The House-passed CR (H.R. 1) includes a provision withholding funding for the settlement agreement in FY2011. Reclamation has not commented on the potential impact of this provision. P.L. 112-10 did not specify funding levels for the settlement. Reclamation proposed funding for a new program for FY2011\u2014the WaterSMART. Reclamation proposed funding for the WaterSMART Program in FY2011, focusing on water conservation, re-use, and planning. The program includes WaterSMART Grants, Basin Studies, and Title XVI Projects, with an increase of $27.4 million. In FY2011, Reclamation proposed $62 million for WaterSMART programs, including $27 million for Challenge Grants, $6 million for Basin Studies, and $29 million for Title XVI Projects. The Senate Appropriations Committee reduced funding to $20 million for Challenge Grants, $4 million for Basin Studies, and $7.7 million for Title XVI projects. P.L. 112-10 did not specify programmatic funding levels. The Energy and Water Development bill has historically funded DOE programs such as renewable energy, nuclear power, environmental cleanup, and nuclear weapons. It now includes programs for fossil fuels, energy efficiency, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and energy statistics. Funding levels for WaterSMART programs were not specified in P.L. 112-10. The Energy and Water Development bill now includes programs for fossil fuels, energy efficiency, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and energy statistics. The FY2010 appropriations funded DOE programs at $27.1 billion, with some ARRA funds remaining unexpended. The Obama Administration requested $29.6 billion for DOE programs in FY2011. The House-passed H.R. 1 Continuing Resolution would have funded DOE programs at $24.6 billion. In FY2010, DOE programs were funded at $27.1 billion with some ARRA funds remaining unexpended. The Obama Administration requested $29.6 billion for FY2011, but the final legislation appropriated $26.3 billion. DOE administers various programs with different functions and missions. The FY2011 request sought $2,355.5 million for EERE programs, with a $85.6 million increase compared to FY2010. P.L. 112-10 provided $1,825.6 million for EERE in FY2011. The FY2011 request for EERE programs sought an $85.6 million increase compared to FY2010, but P.L. 112-10 provided a reduction of $416.9 million. Additionally, DOE requested $189.5 million for EDER programs, with an increase of $13.9 million from FY2010, but P.L. 112-10 cut $27.3 million. The DOE also sought $50 million for a new science and engineering education program, RE-ENERGYSE.

It also supports the development of training programs at community colleges, K-12 education activities, and initiatives to engage students and educators in addressing long-term environment and energy challenges. The DOE proposed a RE-ENERGYSE program in FY2010 with $115 million in funding to educate and inspire students and educators to pursue clean energy careers and adopt sustainable energy practices. Congress did not fund the program, citing concerns about its breadth. The House Committee on Appropriations did not fund the DOE's proposed RE-ENERGYSE program in FY2010, citing concerns about its alignment with other departments and lack of sufficient details. Instead, they recommended $7.5 million for a study on education and workforce needs. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended zero funding for the FY2010 RE-ENERGYSE proposal, with the conference report also providing no funding for the program in FY2010. The committee suggested $7.5 million for a study to define education and workforce needs and assess program alignment with other federal agencies. They expressed interest in further dialogue with the Department of Energy to clarify the proposal's intentions and the department's role in an educational initiative. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended zero funding for the FY2010 RE-ENERGYSE proposal and again for FY2011. The Solar Program would have received a $55.4 million increase in funding for FY2011, with the majority going to the Concentrating Solar Power subprogram for a demonstration project in the desert Southwest. This project aims to accelerate CSP deployment by two to three years, adding about 1,000 megawatts of new capacity.

The Hub aims to create a computer model of a reactor for better understanding of nuclear technology, with potential benefits for other energy technologies. The Obama Administration requested $586.6 million for Fossil Energy Research and Development in FY2011, a 12.7% decrease from the previous year's appropriation due to funding cuts for Natural Gas. The DOE Office of Fossil Energy proposed a new budget structure for the FY2012 Coal subprogram, focusing on carbon capture and storage technologies. Funding for Natural Gas Technologies and Unconventional Fossil Energy Technologies was cut, resulting in a 12.7% decrease in the FY2011 appropriation. In FY2009, the House Appropriations Committee directed DOE to merge FutureGen and the Clean Coal Power Initiative into a single solicitation for a Carbon Capture Demonstration Initiative funded at $1.52 billion. The FutureGen project aimed to demonstrate clean coal-based power generation with CO2 capture and sequestration. The FY2011 request had no funding for the Carbon Capture Initiative, and DOE abandoned the FutureGen project concept, opting to use $1 billion to refit an existing plant for CO2 capture through the Futuregen Alliance, Ameren Energy. The DOE abandoned the FutureGen project concept and will use $1 billion to refit an existing plant for CO2 capture. The money will go to the Futuregen Alliance, Ameren Energy Resources, Babcock & Wilcox, and Air Liquide Process & Construction to install new equipment at an Ameren 200-MW unit in Meredosia, IL. The Clean Coal Technology program has only project-closeout activities remaining, with no further funding requested in FY2011. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended a 24% increase in the Fossil Energy budget, bringing it up to $725.95 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended a 24% increase in the Fossil Energy budget to $725.95 million. This would increase funding for Fuels and Power Systems by $48.15 million, restore the Natural Gas Technologies program, and fund a new Unconventional Fossil Energy program. The committee supports research projects to produce high-quality fuels from coal/biomass feedstocks, despite higher carbon emissions than conventional fuels. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve consists of caverns made from naturally occurring salt. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was authorized in 1975 to provide an emergency source of crude oil in case of supply interruptions. It consists of caverns in Louisiana and Texas with a capacity of 727 million barrels. The Northeast Heating Oil Reserve (NHOR) stores 2 million barrels of home heating oil. The Northeast Heating Oil Reserve (NHOR) stores 2 million barrels of refined home heating oil in above-ground facilities in Connecticut, New Jersey, and Rhode Island. The federal government has not purchased oil for the SPR since 1994, instead acquiring additions with royalty-in-kind (RIK) oil. Acquisition procedures include direct purchase, transfer of royalty oil, and receipt of premium barrels. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve acquires crude oil through direct purchase, transfer of royalty oil, and receipt of premium barrels. In 2008, Congress ordered a suspension of RIK fill unless oil prices dropped below $75/barrel. However, due to a sharp decline in prices, fill of the SPR resumed. In January 2009, the Bush Administration announced plans to purchase nearly 10.7 million barrels to replace oil. In 2008, the Bush Administration resumed filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) with nearly 10.7 million barrels to replace oil sold after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005. By May 2009, RIK fill was resumed at 26,000 barrels per day, totaling over 6.1 million barrels to be delivered by January 2010. The SPR reached capacity, and a transitional phasing out of the RIK Program was announced in September 2009. The RIK Program is being phased out as oil and natural gas contracts expire, reverting properties to in-value status. Natural gas sales in Gulf of Mexico and Wyoming are canceled. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 required SPR expansion to 1 billion barrels, with Richton, MS as a possible site for 160 million barrels. The Administration proposed suspending spending on SPR expansion in FY2011, redirecting $71 million from previously allocated funds. The Administration proposed redirecting $71 million from previously allocated funds for SPR expansion in FY2011 to fund non-expansion operations and maintenance activities. This decision was based on EIA projections of declining U.S. petroleum consumption and dependence on imports. As a result, the FY2011 request for the SPR was reduced to $138.9 million, a significant decrease from the previous year's appropriation of $243.8 million. Congress approved $11.3 million for the NHOR in FY2010. The FY2011 request for the SPR was reduced to $138.9 million from the previous year's $243.8 million. Congress approved $11.3 million for the NHOR in FY2010. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $209.9 million for the SPR and did not support canceling $71 million for the Richton, MS, SPR site expansion. P.L. 112-10 set the SPR spending level at $209.9 million but rescinded $86.8 million from prior year appropriations. The DOE Office of Science conducts basic research in six program areas and is a major federal funder of research in the physical sciences. For FY2011, DOE requested $5.121 billion for the Office of Science, an increase of 4.4% from the previous year. In the 111th Congress, the House Appropriations Subcommittee recommended $4.900 billion for the Office of Science.

The requested funding for the largest Office of Science program, basic energy sciences, was $1.835 billion, up 12.1% from $1.636 billion in FY2010. Funding for Energy Frontier Research Centers (EFRCs) would have increased by $40 million, with a new energy innovation hub on materials for batteries and energy storage receiving $34 million. The existing hub on fuels from sunlight would have received $24 million. The Administration proposed to initiate a total of eight energy innovation hubs in FY2010, but Congress funded only three. The aim of the hubs is to address basic science and technology hindering the nation's secure and sustainable energy future by assembling multidisciplinary teams of researchers focused on a single critical national need identified by the Department. In the 111th Congress, the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $1.739 billion for basic energy sciences. In the 111th Congress, the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $1.739 billion for basic energy sciences, but did not provide the requested increase for new EFRCs. It allocated about two-thirds of the requested funding for the two energy innovation hubs and proposed increases for high-energy physics projects. In the 111th Congress, the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $84 million for the Large Hadron Collider at Fermilab, $627 million for biological and environmental research, including $16 million for climate modeling and $11 million for genomic science.

The FY2011 request for ARPA-E was $300 million, with an appropriation of $179.6 million in P.L. 112-10. President Obama's FY2011 budget called for termination of DOE's Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM), which was established by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982. OCRWM had been developing a permanent nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, NV. DOE filed a license application with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for the proposed Yucca Mountain repository in June. The Obama Administration decided that developing the Yucca Mountain repository for nuclear waste disposal is not feasible, leading to no funding being requested for the project in FY2011. DOE filed a motion to withdraw the license application in 2010, which was rejected by an NRC licensing panel. The DOE filed a motion to withdraw the Yucca Mountain license application in 2010, but it was rejected by an NRC licensing panel. The full NRC commission is now considering the withdrawal, which is opposed by states with defense-related waste. Alternatives to Yucca Mountain are being evaluated by the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future, established by DOE in March 2010 with a $5 million budget from Congress. The Commission, established by DOE in 2010 with a $5 million budget from Congress, is tasked with studying options for nuclear waste storage, treatment, and disposal. A draft report is due in 18 months, with a final report in two years. DOE's Office of Nuclear Energy will lead future waste management activities with substantial funding for research on nuclear waste. The Office of Nuclear Energy will lead all future waste management activities with substantial funding for research on nuclear waste disposal technologies. DOE has faced legal challenges from nuclear utilities for failing to meet waste disposal deadlines. DOE estimates that liability payments could reach $11 billion if waste removal from reactor sites does not begin by 2020. Utilities have won cases in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims regarding compensation for damages. The DOE Innovative Technology Loan Guarantee Program, established by Congress with the Energy Policy Act of 2005, authorizes loan guarantees for energy projects using new technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Subsidy costs, ranging from 1% to 10% of the loan guarantee amount, must be paid upfront by each project. The DOE's loan guarantee program requires subsidy costs upfront, ranging from 1% to 10% of the loan amount. In FY2009, $47 billion was allocated for loan guarantees, with specific amounts earmarked for nuclear power, energy efficiency, renewables, coal, carbon capture, sequestration, and uranium enrichment. President Obama's FY2011 budget proposed nearly tripling the loan guarantee ceiling. President Obama's FY2011 budget proposed increasing the loan guarantee ceiling for nuclear power plants to $54.5 billion. The first preliminary nuclear loan guarantee was announced by the DOE on February 16, 2010, for a project to add two reactors to the Vogtle nuclear power plant in Georgia. The conditional guarantee agreement for the Vogtle nuclear power plant in Georgia would provide $8.33 billion in financing for two reactors, contingent on NRC licensing. Critics argue that the proposed tripling of nuclear loan guarantees to $54.5 billion could divert resources from cleaner energy technologies. Nuclear critics oppose the tripling of nuclear loan guarantees, calling it a \"taxpayer bailout\" that would shift funds from cleaner energy technologies. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act created a loan guarantee program for renewables, but $2 billion of the $6 billion appropriation was redirected to the \"cash for clunkers\" program. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act allocated $6 billion for loan guarantees for renewables, with $2 billion redirected to the \"cash for clunkers\" program. Another $1.5 billion was used for the Education Jobs and Medicaid Assistance Act. The remaining $2.5 billion should support loan guarantees totaling $25 billion, with an additional $500 million requested for energy efficiency and renewable energy loan guarantees. President Obama requested a $500 million appropriation for energy efficiency and renewable energy loan guarantees under the Sec. 1703 program. The DOE estimates this funding would support loan guarantees totaling $3 billion-$5 billion. Additionally, $58 million was requested for administrative costs, offset by receipts. P.L. 112-10 reduced the loan guarantee authority for non-nuclear technologies to $7.3 billion. P.L. 112-10 reduced the loan guarantee authority for Section 1703 non-nuclear technologies to $7.3 billion, with a total ceiling of about $9.3 billion. Nuclear loan guarantees remain at $18.5 billion, and uranium enrichment totals $4 billion. Remaining appropriations for subsidy cost payments under the Section 1705 loan guarantee program are set to expire at the end of FY2011. However, P.L. 112-10 provides $170 million with no expiration to pay subsidy costs for renewable energy and efficiency projects under the Section 1703 program, along with authority for up to $1.183 billion in loans. P.L. 112-10 provides $170 million with no expiration for subsidy costs for renewable energy and efficiency projects under the Section 1703 program. Additionally, it offers up to $1.183 billion in loan guarantees for these projects. The funding is available to projects that applied under the expiring Section 1705 before February 24, 2011. The Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, established in 2007, received $7.5 billion in FY2009 to issue up to $25 billion in direct loans for automobile manufacturers and parts suppliers to invest in plant capacity for fuel-efficient vehicles. In FY2011, $10 million was requested for administrative expenses, mostly covered by P.L. 112-10. The Stockpile Stewardship Program, established by Congress, ensures the preservation of US nuclear weapons' core competencies and the safety of the stockpile. Funding for administrative expenses was mostly covered by P.L. 112-10. The Stockpile Stewardship Program, operated by the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), ensures the safety, security, and reliability of the nuclear weapons stockpile without underground testing. Funding for administrative expenses is covered by P.L. 112-10. The Stockpile Stewardship Program, managed by NNSA, ensures the safety and reliability of the nuclear weapons stockpile. Funding for administrative expenses is covered by P.L. 112-10. Additionally, P.L. 111-84 established a \"stockpile management\" program to enhance the effectiveness of the nuclear weapons stockpile by increasing reliability, safety, and security, and reducing the likelihood of nuclear testing. The stockpile management program aims to enhance the nuclear weapons stockpile by increasing reliability, safety, and security, and reducing the likelihood of nuclear testing. Changes to the stockpile must align with program objectives and design parameters to avoid the need for underground nuclear weapons testing. Stewardship activities primarily occur at the nuclear weapons complex, which includes three laboratories. The nuclear weapons complex includes three laboratories and four production sites managed by NNSA. The FY2011 request document includes data from NNSA's Future Years Nuclear Security Program for FY2012-FY2015. The complex currently consists of eight sites. The Defense Department's nuclear weapons complex, consisting of eight sites, has undergone changes since the Cold War. Congress has pushed for further transformation, including reducing personnel and costs, increasing efficiency and security, and shrinking the footprint at each site. In response, NNSA presented the \"Complex 2030\" plan in 2007, which was met with criticism from the House Appropriations Committee in FY2008. The House Appropriations Committee criticized the NNSA's plan for Complex 2030, demanding a comprehensive nuclear defense strategy, detailed stockpile description, and long-term expenditure plan before considering further funding for the program. They accused NNSA of rebuilding and modernizing the complex without a sensible long-term efficiency strategy. The Senate Appropriations Committee rejected the premature deployment of the NNSA Complex 2030 consolidation effort, calling for a comprehensive nuclear weapons strategy for the 21st century. NNSA's plan to rebuild and modernize the complex without a long-term efficiency strategy was criticized. The NNSA announced its plan, Complex Transformation, to reduce the weapons program footprint, close structures, reduce weapons workers, dismantle weapons faster, and build new facilities like the Uranium Processing Facility at Y-12 Plant. The NNSA announced its plan, Complex Transformation, to reduce the weapons program footprint, close structures, reduce weapons workers, dismantle weapons faster, and build new facilities like the Uranium Processing Facility at Y-12 Plant. The House Appropriations Committee reiterated its FY2008 views in its FY2009 report, insisting on completion of specific sequences before considering funding for new programs or changes to the nuclear weapons complex. The House Appropriations Committee emphasized the need for a modern nuclear deterrent strategy focused on current and future threats, determining the size of the nuclear stockpile and weapons complex to support it. They recommended eliminating funds for the Reliable Replacement Warhead program. The House Appropriations Committee recommended eliminating funds for the Reliable Replacement Warhead program in order to support a modern nuclear deterrent strategy focused on current and future threats. The Senate Appropriations Committee also recommended eliminating RRW funds in the FY2009 report, with no RRW funds provided in the FY2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act. The FY2010 and FY2011 budgets did not request RRW funds, and the Administration proposed to cancel development of the RRW. The FY2010 budget document proposed canceling the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) program due to inconsistency with nuclear disarmament commitments. The FY2011 budget request for Weapons Activities was $7,008.8 million, an increase from FY2010 appropriations. The Department of Defense submitted its Nuclear Posture Review Report in April 2010 outlining plans for sustaining the nuclear arsenal. The President provided Congress with a classified report on U.S. nuclear forces in May 2010. The White House provided Congress with a classified report in May 2010 on plans to maintain and modernize the U.S. nuclear arsenal, including investing $80 billion in the next decade for this purpose. The White House plans to invest $80 billion in the next decade to sustain and modernize the nuclear weapons complex. The projections for weapons stockpile and infrastructure costs show a gradual increase from FY2011 to FY2020. In the 112th Congress, there was a contentious reduction in the requested increase for Weapons Activities funding, which was part of a compromise to gain Senate Republicans' support for the New START treaty. The White House plans to invest $80 billion over the next decade to modernize the nuclear weapons complex. Funding for Weapons Activities would increase substantially from FY2010-FY2020 to maintain and modernize the nuclear weapons production capabilities. The New START resolution of ratification emphasized the commitment to a robust stockpile stewardship program. The President's FY2012 budget requested an increase in funding for Weapons Activities to $7,629.7 million, raising concerns about Congress's approval. The FY2011 budget provided $6,946.4 million for Weapons Activities, a reduction from the initial request. This program involves direct work on nuclear weapons in the stockpile to ensure safety, reliability, and performance. The FY2011 budget allocated $6,946.4 million for Weapons Activities, a reduction from the initial request. This program involves direct work on nuclear weapons in the stockpile, including monitoring their condition, maintenance, R&D, and dismantlement. Specific items under DSW include Life Extension Programs (LEPs) to extend the life of existing warheads. The Life Extension Programs (LEPs) for B61 mods 7 and 11 bombs and W76 warhead for Trident II submarine-launched ballistic missile are ongoing. The FY2010 appropriation was $223.2 million, and the FY2011 request was $249.5 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended the requested amount and required NNSA to submit reports on the LEP for the B61 bomb. The program involves routine maintenance and replacement of limited-life components. The FY2010 appropriation for Stockpile Systems was $357.8 million, with a requested amount of $649.4 million for FY2011.

The Readiness Campaign focuses on improving manufacturing safety and efficiency, with a current appropriation of $100.0 million in FY2010 and a request of $112.1 million in FY2011. Stockpile Readiness sees the largest dollar increase within the campaign. The largest dollar increase in the Readiness Campaign is for Stockpile Readiness, with $5.7 million for FY2010 and $18.9 million requested for FY2011. This increase is for manufacturing lithium parts at the Y-12 National Security Complex and ensuring capability at the Savannah River Site. The largest dollar decrease is for Tritium Readiness, with $68.2 million for FY2010 and $50.2 million requested for FY2011, attributed to the cyclical nature of the program. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended reducing Tritium Readiness funding from $50.2 million to $30.2 million for FY2011 due to technical challenges faced by NNSA in tritium production efforts. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended reducing Tritium Readiness funding to $30.2 million for FY2011, citing technical challenges in tritium production at the Watts Bar reactor and slow progress in increasing production capacity. The program funds infrastructure and operations at Complex sites, with the largest subprogram being Operations of Facilities. The FY2011 budget request includes funding for Program Readiness, Material Recycle and Recovery, and Construction. Institutional Site Support funding decreased significantly from FY2010 to the requested FY2011 budget. The FY2011 budget request for NNSA dropped from $120.1 million in FY2010 to $41.0 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended increasing funds by $71.0 million to avoid layoffs and disruptions at Pantex and Y-12 facilities. The committee also restored funding for the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended increasing funds by $71.0 million to avoid layoffs and disruptions at Pantex and Y-12 facilities. They also restored funding for the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center and expressed concern about NNSA's use of funds for a replacement facility for the Kansas City Plant. The most costly item in Construction, and among the most controversial in the Weapons Activities account, is the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Facility Replacement (CMRR) at Los Alamos National Laboratory. It would replace the over 50-year-old Chemistry and Metallurgy Research (CMR) building, which houses research into plutonium and supports pit production at Los Alamos. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees expressed concerns about the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Facility Replacement (CMRR) at Los Alamos National Laboratory, stating that it lacks a coherent mission unless there is a decision to start new nuclear warhead design and pit production. The current authorization for the existing CMR facility only lasts through 2010 and does not provide adequate worker safety. The Senate and House Appropriations Committees raised concerns about the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Facility Replacement (CMRR) at Los Alamos National Laboratory, citing inadequate worker safety and containment precautions. Deep spending cuts may lead to delays, requiring continued operations in the existing CMR facility. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $125.0 million for the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Facility Replacement (CMRR) at Los Alamos National Laboratory, citing funding shortfalls. The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) stated that current capabilities at CMR are restricted, hindering required operations. The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) requested an increase for CMRR for FY2011 due to restricted capabilities at the CMR, hindering required operations. Some suggest modifying Plutonium Facility 4 (PF-4) at Los Alamos to fulfill some of CMRR's work, stating CMRR's capacity is excessive. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended the requested amount for Weapons Activities, including Secure Transportation Asset for safe transport of nuclear weapons. Secure Transportation Asset ensures safe transport of nuclear weapons, components, and materials with special vehicles, infrastructure, and threat response. FY2010 had $234.9 million, FY2011 requested $248.0 million. Nuclear Counterterrorism Incident Response mitigates nuclear incidents globally and defends against nuclear terrorism. FY2010 had $221.9 million, FY2011 requested $233.1 million. Senate Appropriations Committee supported the requested amounts. The FY2010 appropriation for the Nation's nuclear security was $221.9 million, with a requested increase to $233.1 million in FY2011. The Facilities and Infrastructure Recapitalization Program (FIRP) focuses on infrastructure restoration and received $93.9 million in FY2010, with a requested increase to $94.0 million in FY2011. Site Stewardship aims to ensure environmental compliance and energy efficiency in the nuclear security enterprise. The House Appropriations Committee supported the Site Stewardship program but reduced the requested amount due to budget limitations. The Senate bill denied funding for the stewardship planning initiative citing poorly defined mission priorities. The FY2010 appropriation was $61.3 million, and the FY2011 request was $105.5 million, with a recommended reduction by the Senate Appropriations Committee. The FY2011 request for Safeguards and Security was $105.5 million, with a recommended reduction by the Senate Appropriations Committee. The reduction was mainly due to efficiencies achieved through risk-informed decisions regarding staffing levels and common procurement of equipment. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended reducing the Defense Nuclear Security operations and maintenance budget by $9.0 million to $43.0 million, citing the need to align funding with the size of the CMRR project's nuclear facility. Cyber Security aims to implement IT and information management security safeguards. The FY2010 appropriation for the CMRR project's nuclear facility was $122.5 million, with a $124.3 million request for FY2011. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended the requested amount. DOE's nonproliferation and national security programs support U.S. efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons worldwide. Funding for these programs is included in the National Nuclear Security Administration. The National Nuclear Security Administration funds nonproliferation and national security programs to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons. Funding for these programs increased to $2.137 billion in FY2010 from $1.482 billion in FY2009, mainly due to returning major construction projects to the Fissile Materials Disposition program. The Obama Administration requested a further increase for FY2011. The Nonproliferation and Verification R&D program received $317.3 million in funding. The Nonproliferation and International Security programs, including international safeguards, export controls, and treaties, received a funding request of $155.9 million for FY2011, compared to $187.2 million in FY2010. International Materials Protection, Control, and Accounting (MPC&A) aimed at securing Russian weapons and materials, received $572.1 million in FY2010, with a request of $590.1 million for FY2011. The International Materials Protection, Control, and Accounting (MPC&A) program received $572.1 million in FY2010 and a request of $590.1 million for FY2011. The Elimination of Weapons-Grade Plutonium Production aims to persuade Russia to shut down three nuclear reactors producing weapons-grade plutonium. Two reactors were shut down in 2008, with their power replaced by a fossil-fueled facility. The third reactor, scheduled to be shut down in December 2010, will be replaced by another fossil-fueled facility. The program was funded at $24.5 million for FY2010. The third reactor, scheduled to be shut down in December 2010, will be replaced by construction of another fossil-fueled facility. The Fissile Materials Disposition program aims to dispose of U.S. surplus weapons plutonium by converting it into fuel for commercial power reactors, including a facility to convert the plutonium to \"mixed-oxide\" (MOX) reactor fuel at Savannah River, SC. Funding for the program was controversial due to lack of progress on disposing of Russian plutonium, but the Obama Administration requested and received funding for FY2010. The Obama Administration requested and received funding for the Fissile Materials Disposition program in FY2010 and FY2011, totaling $701.9 million and $1,030.7 million respectively. The program aims to dispose of Russian surplus weapon-grade plutonium by using Russian fast reactors under nonproliferation restrictions. The FY2011 budget request was $1,030.7 million, including funding for the Savannah River project and research on a gas-turbine modular helium reactor in Russia. The Global Threat Reduction Initiative received a $558.8 million request to convert research reactors to use low-enriched uranium and protect nuclear materials. The Office of Environmental Management was established by the DOE in 1989 to consolidate cleanup of former nuclear weapons production facilities. It involves disposal of radioactive and hazardous wastes, managing surplus nuclear materials, remediation of soil and groundwater contamination, and decontamination of excess buildings. The Office of Environmental Management oversees the cleanup of federal nuclear energy research laboratories and weapons production facilities across the United States. Cleanup actions are mostly complete at many facilities, but larger and more complex sites with high-level radioactive waste will require ongoing cleanup for years or even decades. As of FY2010, 18 facilities still required cleanup. The Office of Environmental Management oversees cleanup of federal nuclear facilities. As of FY2010, 18 facilities still need cleanup, with estimated costs ranging from $192.8 billion to $247.2 billion. Additional funds may be needed for long-term maintenance and monitoring of radioactive waste containment. The Office of Environmental Management oversees cleanup of federal nuclear facilities, with some sites requiring long-term activities for radioactive waste containment. Responsibility for smaller, less contaminated facilities has been transferred to other offices within DOE and the Army Corps of Engineers. The cleanup of smaller, less contaminated facilities under the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program (FUSRAP) is transferred to the Army Corps of Engineers, funded within their civil works budget. Once cleanup is complete, the Corps handles activities for the first two years before jurisdiction is transferred back to DOE. The Department's Office of Legacy Management manages any long-term operation, maintenance, and monitoring at FUSRAP sites. The Office of Legacy Management oversees long-term operation, maintenance, and monitoring at FUSRAP sites and facilities cleaned up under the Office of Environmental Management. Funding for the Office of Environmental Management comes from three appropriations accounts: Defense Environmental Cleanup, Non-Defense Environmental Cleanup, and the Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund. The majority of funding comes from the Defense Environmental Cleanup Account, with a total of $5.69 billion allocated in P.L. 112-10. The Office of Environmental Management received a total of $5.69 billion in funding from three appropriations accounts in FY2011, which was a decrease from the President's request. The funding comes from the Defense Environmental Cleanup, Non-Defense Environmental Cleanup, and Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund accounts. In FY2011, the Office of Environmental Management received $5.69 billion in funding from three accounts, which was lower than the President's request. P.L. 112-10 also rescinded $22.7 million in unobligated balances from previous fiscal years for cleanup activities at DOE's nuclear weapons production facilities. The pace of cleanup at DOE's largest nuclear weapons production facilities, including Hanford, Savannah River Site, and Idaho National Laboratory, has been a concern due to high-level radioactive waste storage. These facilities have complex cleanup challenges from years of weapons production, requiring significant funding from the Office of Environmental Management. Funding for DOE's largest nuclear weapons production facilities, including Hanford, Savannah River Site, and Idaho National Laboratory, has represented over half of the total funding for the Office of Environmental Management. Cleanup at these facilities is expected to continue for decades, with completion estimated as late as 2062 for Hanford, 2040 for Savannah River Site, and 2044 for Idaho National Laboratory due to the substantial volumes of high-level radioactive wastes stored at these sites. The DOE estimates that there are significant volumes of high-level radioactive wastes stored at Hanford, Savannah River Site, and Idaho National Laboratory. These wastes are intended for permanent disposal in a geologic repository, but technical challenges and delays in waste treatment facilities construction pose environmental risks. The lack of availability of a geologic repository poses challenges for the cleanup of radioactive wastes at Hanford. Concerns have been raised about environmental risks from untreated wastes stored in tanks leaking into groundwater. The DOE monitors water quality in the Columbia River for contaminants. Funding sources for cleanup of uranium enrichment facilities are also being scrutinized. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 established the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund to finance the cleanup of three uranium enrichment facilities in Paducah, KY; Portsmouth, OH; and Oak Ridge, TN. Congress authorized the collection of funds for this purpose. The Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund was established by the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to clean up uranium enrichment facilities. Congress authorized special assessments from nuclear utilities and payments from the federal government to finance the fund. The Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund was created to clean up uranium enrichment facilities, with contributions from both the federal government and nuclear utilities. The authority to collect utility assessments and federal payments expired in 2007, but Congress has continued funding through annual appropriations without separate reauthorizing legislation. The Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund has insufficient funds for future cleanup costs, with $4.5 billion available as of FY2010, far below DOE's estimated range of $13.9 billion to $27.7 billion. Reauthorization of utility assessments and federal payments is an ongoing issue. The President proposed reinstating nuclear utility assessments in FY2011 to increase resources for cleanup, with OMB estimating $200 million in assessments for that year and a total of $2.2 billion over a 10-year period. Congress needs to enact reauthorizing legislation for the federal government to resume collection of the assessments. In the 111th Congress, bills were introduced but not enacted to reauthorize nuclear utility assessments. The Senate Appropriations Committee questioned the need for reinstatement of assessments due to the existing balance of the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund. The President requested $730.5 million from the fund for cleanup in FY2011, assuming $200 million in offsetting receipts. In FY2011, P.L. 112-10 allocated $507.0 million from the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund, a $223.5 million decrease from the President's request. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $550.0 million but noted the lack of legislation to reauthorize nuclear utility assessments for the $200 million in offsetting receipts. The Senate Appropriations Committee allocated $33.6 million for the federal payment to the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund in FY2011, significantly less than the President's request of $496.7 million. Legislation to reauthorize nuclear utility assessments for $200 million in offsetting receipts has not been enacted. The existing balance available for appropriation from the fund exceeds the request by billions of dollars. The Senate Appropriations Committee allocated $33.6 million for the federal payment to the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund in FY2011, much less than the requested $496.7 million. Additional federal funds may still be needed in the future under existing law. The Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund may require additional federal funds in the future for cleanup of facilities. Responsibility for long-term operation and maintenance is transferred to the DOE's Office of Legacy Management, funded within the Other Defense Activities Account. The Office of Legacy Management, funded within the Other Defense Activities Account, manages pensions and benefits for former contractor personnel. Funding for the office in FY2011 was $788.4 million, with the Senate Appropriations Committee recommending $188.6 million, slightly less than the previous year. Funding needs are expected to increase over time due to the larger and more complex operations. Funding for the Office of Legacy Management in FY2011 was $788.4 million, slightly less than the previous year. The Office's funding needs are expected to rise as nuclear weapons production facilities are cleaned up and transferred for long-term operation. The Department of Energy's Power Marketing Administrations sell power generated by dams operated by other agencies. The Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs) were established to sell power generated by dams operated by the Bureau of Reclamation and the Army Corps of Engineers. PMAs prioritize \"preference customers\" like municipal utilities and cooperatives, selling power at the lowest possible rates. The Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs) sell power to municipal utilities and cooperatives at low rates to cover expenses and repay debt. The FY2011 budget request for PMAs was $118.5 million, a decrease of $4 million from FY2010. Receipts from PMAs were reclassified from mandatory to discretionary to offset expenses. In FY2010, receipts from the PMAs were reclassified from mandatory to discretionary, offsetting expenses for WAPA, SWPA, and SEPA. SWPA requested $12.7 million and WAPA requested $105.5 million in discretionary funding. SEPA's receipts are expected to cover all operating costs in FY2011. Additionally, $220,000 was requested for Falcon and Amistad operations and maintenance, with $23 million in collections from Colorado River basins as an offset. P.L. 112-10 appropriated the requested amount with a 0.2% rescission. In FY2010, receipts from PMAs were reclassified from mandatory to discretionary, offsetting expenses for WAPA, SWPA, and SEPA. SWPA requested $12.7 million and WAPA requested $105.5 million in discretionary funding. SEPA's receipts are expected to cover all operating costs in FY2011. $220,000 was requested for Falcon and Amistad operations and maintenance, with $23 million in collections from Colorado River basins as an offset towards the net discretionary appropriation. BPA is a self-funded agency under authority granted by P.L. 93-454, the Federal Columbia River Transmission System Act of 1974, and receives no appropriations. However, it funds some activities from permanent borrowing authority, which was increased in FY2003 from $3.75 billion to $4.45 billion. ARRA further increased the borrowing amount under the Transmission System Act by $3.25 billion to the current authority for $7.7 billion in bonds outstanding to the Treasury. The FY2011 budget proposed Bonneville accrue expenditures of $3.763 billion for operating expenses, $77 million for Projects Funded in Advance, $758 million for capital investments, and $387 million for capital transfers. ARRA provided $10 million in non-reimbursable appropriations to WAPA to support implementation of activities authorized in section 402 of the act. The ARRA provided $10 million in non-reimbursable appropriations to WAPA for activities authorized in section 402 of the act. It also granted WAPA borrowing authority up to $3.25 billion for building new electric power transmission lines to deliver renewable energy resources. This borrowing authority was previously unavailable to WAPA and is now available on a permanent basis. WAPA has established a new Transmission Infrastructure Program with a borrowing authority not to exceed $3.25 billion. Independent agencies funded by the Energy and Water Development bill include the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC), and the Denali Commission. The NRC requested $1.053 billion for FY2011, a decrease from the previous year. Major activities of the NRC include safety regulation and licensing of commercial nuclear reactors. P.L. 112-10 provides $1.052.3 billion for the NRC. The NRC budget request for FY2011 includes $272.5 million for new reactor activities, with an increase of $7.8 million from FY2010. Electric utilities and generating companies have applied for licenses for 30 reactors since September 2007 due to volatile fossil fuel prices and incentives from the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 and volatile fossil fuel prices led to electric utilities and generating companies applying for licenses for 30 reactors since September 2007. However, some license applicants have suspended work on their projects. The NRC's proposed FY2011 budget included $10 million from the Nuclear Waste Fund for licensing DOE's Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository, which the Obama Administration wants to cancel. The NRC filed a motion to withdraw the license application on March 3, 2010. The NRC's funding request would cover costs related to adjudicating the license withdrawal motion and activities for an orderly closure of Yucca Mountain licensing support. The requested amount was included in P.L. 112-10. NRC's FY2011 budget request for regulating operating reactors included $531.6 million, $10.5 million below the FY2010 level. The NRC's FY2011 budget request included $531.6 million, $10.5 million below the FY2010 level. Activities covered reactor safety inspections, license renewals, data analysis, and security oversight. Homeland security spending within NRC is set to increase by $3.8 million to $26.1 million. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 requires 90% of NRC's budget to be offset by licensee fees, with expenditures from the Nuclear Waste Fund exempt from this offset. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 requires 90% of NRC's budget to be offset by licensee fees, with exceptions for certain expenditures. The FY2011 budget request would result in a net appropriation of $138.3 million, a decrease from FY2010. P.L. 112-10 provides for a net appropriation of $138.1 million, including the inspector general's office."
