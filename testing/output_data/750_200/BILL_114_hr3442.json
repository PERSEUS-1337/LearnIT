The Secretary of the Treasury is required to submit a debt report to Congress, including historical levels of debt, current amount, composition, and future projections. This is mandated by the \"Debt Management and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2015.\" The Secretary of the Treasury must report to Congress on various aspects related to the national debt, such as income taxes as a percentage of GDP, future debt drivers, meeting debt obligations, and reduction measures if the debt limit is not raised.
