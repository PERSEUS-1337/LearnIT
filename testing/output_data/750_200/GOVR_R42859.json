The Navy is collaborating with other agencies to promote domestic advanced biofuel production. The services have collectively spent around $48 million on these efforts. The Department of Defense aims to boost domestic advanced biofuel production on a commercial scale using the Defense Production Act. The services have invested $48 million in alternative fuels, with the Navy planning a $170 million investment. DOD's purchases of petroleum fuels in FY2011 totaled $17.3 billion. This report provides an overview of DOD's alternative fuels policy, purchases, testing platforms, and certification of alternative fuel blends. The report discusses the current status of the Navy's biofuel production initiative under the Defense Production Act, along with the Department of Energy and Agriculture. It also provides information on legislative actions related to DOD's alternative fuels efforts. The Navy's biofuel production efforts under the Defense Production Act are discussed in CRS Report R42568. The Department of Defense's operational energy efforts, including biofuels, are covered in CRS Report R42558. Section 314 of the FY2012 National Defense Authorization Act assigned oversight of DOD's alternative fuels initiatives to the Assistant Secretary of Defense. Section 314 of the FY2012 National Defense Authorization Act assigned responsibility for DOD's alternative fuels initiatives and policy to the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Operational Energy Plans and Programs, providing oversight and leadership in developing alternative fuels within the military departments and the Office of the Secretary of Defense. The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Operational Energy Plans and Programs is responsible for developing alternative fuels within the military departments and the Office of the Secretary of Defense. Recommendations include issuing guidelines to streamline alternative fuels investments and collaborating with other federal agencies for the benefit of DOD. Sharon Burke's memorandum outlines the goals of DOD alternative fuels policy to ensure operational military readiness and improve battlespace effectiveness. The DOD alternative fuels policy aims to enhance military readiness, battlespace effectiveness, and fuel source diversity. Investments in alternative fuels seek to increase resilience, reduce price volatility effects, provide more fuel options, and enhance expeditionary effectiveness. Alternative fuels for DOD use must be drop-in and cost-competitive with conventional petroleum. DOD officials require alternative fuels for operational use to be \"drop-in,\" cost-competitive, and available in sufficient quantities. Other desired characteristics include production from non-food crop feedstock and lower lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions. DOD investments in alternative fuel activities must be certified as part of the annual operational energy budget process. The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Operational Energy Plans and Programs reviews proposed budgets to ensure adequacy for implementation. The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Operational Energy Plans and Programs reviews proposed budgets to certify adequacy for implementing the operational energy strategy. The annual operational energy report now includes alternative fuels initiatives, with future investments subject to a rigorous evaluation process. DOD alternative fuels development follows three phases, starting with a certification phase involving a cross-services fuels working group. Phase 1: Certification involves a cross-services fuels working group submitting an annual plan for alternative fuels. Phase 2: Field Demonstration may be proposed for a new fuel, reviewed by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Operational Energy Plans and Programs. Phase 3: Ongoing. Phase 3 involves ongoing purchases of alternative fuels, competing with petroleum products based on best value to the government. Each military service has set goals for alternative fuels, with the Army aiming to increase the use of renewable/alternative energy according to the Army Energy Security Implementation Strategy. The Army aims to increase the use of renewable/alternative energy, with goals set out in the Army Energy Security Implementation Strategy. By 2028, they aim for 25% of energy for tactical power generation to come from renewable sources and 50% of fuel for the training base fleet to be alternative fuel blends. The Air Force aims to competitively acquire 50% of its domestic aviation fuel. The Air Force aims to acquire 50% of its domestic aviation fuel from alternative fuel blends by 2016, derived from greener domestic sources. They also plan to test and certify all aircraft on a 50:50 alternative fuel blend by 2012. The Navy has set ambitious goals for alternative fuels, including deploying a \"Great Green Fleet\" by 2016 and aiming to meet 50% of energy consumption from alternative sources by 2020. This fleet consists of ships and aircraft running on biofuel blends. The Navy aims to meet 50% of its energy consumption from alternative sources by 2020, with plans to reduce liquid fuel usage afloat. Approximately 8 million barrels of petroleum used afloat would need to be replaced by unblended alternative fuels to achieve this goal. Since 2007, DLA Energy has procured approximately 1.9 million gallons of various types of alternative fuels on behalf of the Army, Navy, and Air Force using funds provided by the services. DOD purchases of alternative fuels for testing engine performance and certification have totaled about $48 million. Table 1 provides an overview of each service's alternative fuels purchases from 2007 to present, including Fischer-Tropsch fuels and biofuels. The services have purchased various types of alternative fuels, including Fischer-Tropsch fuels derived from coal and natural gas, biofuels such as hydrotreated jet and diesel biofuels, alcohol-to-jet fuels, and direct-sugar-to-hydrocarbons fuels. The Air Force and Navy have procured these alternative fuels, with the Air Force also purchasing fuels created via the Fischer-Tropsch process. The Air Force has purchased fuels created via the Fischer-Tropsch process from coal and natural gas. Section 526 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 prohibits federal agencies, including DOD, from entering into contracts for alternative fuels with high greenhouse gas emissions. The Department of Defense (DOD) excludes coal-to-liquid fuels with high greenhouse gas emissions from alternative fuel purchases. DOD's position is that EISA section 526 does not apply to fuel purchases where the source is unspecified in the contract. The Army, Navy, and Air Force are testing alternative fuel blends for potential fleet-wide use. The Army, Navy, and Air Force are testing alternative fuel blends for potential fleet-wide use. The Army is currently testing 50:50 blends of Fischer-Tropsch synthetic paraffinic kerosene and hydrotreated renewable jet with JP-8 for use in all Army ground systems and field generators, with the goal of certifying these fuels by 2014. The Army is also working to obtain Air Force certification for H-60 Black Hawk helicopters to fly on the 50:50 FT-SPK: JP-8 blend. The Army and Air Force are testing alternative fuel blends for their ground equipment and aviation systems. The Army aims to complete testing by the end of FY2014, while the Air Force has certified Fischer-Tropsch fuel blends for its fleets and is testing biofuels for fleet-wide certification. The Air Force has completed testing on biofuels for its manned and unmanned fleets, including alcohol-to-jet fuels. The Navy has also tested biofuel blends for its aircraft and ships. The Navy has completed testing on HEFA 50:50 biofuel blends for aircraft and ships, with certification expected in early 2013. Fischer-Tropsch fuels testing and certification is set to be finished by the end of 2013. Other alternative fuels like alcohol-to-jet and pyrolysis oils will continue to be tested in the future. In June 2011, the Navy, Energy, and Agriculture signed a MOU to support the development of a sustainable biofuels industry. The MOU highlights the need for government investment to achieve domestic production capacity of advanced biofuels in a timely manner. The Navy, Energy, and Agriculture aim to support biofuel plants and refineries to produce military-grade biofuels that are price competitive. The Navy, Energy, and Agriculture plan to fund advanced biofuel plants and refineries with $340 million in federal funds for capital investment and production, with additional support from industry and the Department of Agriculture. Total government funding for this initiative is $511 million. The Department of Agriculture will provide an additional $171 million through the Commodity Credit Corporation to support biofuel feedstocks. Total government funding for this project is anticipated at $510 million over three years, with $170 million each from the Navy, the Department of Energy, and the Department of Agriculture. Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA-12-15-PKM) for this biofuels production initiative was released on June 27, 2012. The Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA-12-15-PKM) for a biofuels production initiative was released on June 27, 2012, with a government funding amount of $210 million. Awards for biofuels production facilities will be given in two phases: Phase 1 includes planning and preliminary designs with up to $6 million each, while Phase 2 involves construction, commissioning, and performance testing with awards of up to $70 million each. Successful proposals require at least a 50% cost share. The Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA-12-15-PKM) for a biofuels production initiative includes awards of up to $70 million each for construction, commissioning, and performance testing of biofuel production facilities. Successful proposals must have at least a 50% cost share for both Phase 1 and Phase 2, domestic production of advanced biofuels, compliance with Section 526 of the Energy Security and Independence Act of 2007, use of an acceptable renewable feedstock, production of a drop-in fuel, projected cost-competitiveness with conventional petroleum-based fuels, and a production capacity of at least 10 million gallons a year. The FOA funding level of $210 million includes $100 million from DOD. The FOA funding level of $210 million includes $100 million from DOD, $70 million for the Navy's biofuels production initiative, and $40 million from DOE. The DOE Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy funds are being used to support an MOU between the Navy, DOE, and USDA. The USDA is providing $171 million through the Commodity Credit Corporation for bio-based jet fuel production. The Corporation has the authority to borrow up to $30 billion without specific congressional appropriations. Legislative activity in 2012 focused on DOD's alternative fuels efforts, including proposals to expand or limit DOD's ability to purchase alternative fuels and invest in production capability. H.R. 4310 contained provisions exempting DOD from EISA requirements for alternative fuels purchased for operational use. The Senate passed S. 3254 without restrictions on DOD's ability to purchase alternative fuels or invest in biofuels production. Amendments added restrictive provisions (Section 314 and Section 2823) during the Senate Armed Services Committee markup. The Senate passed S. 3254 without restrictions on DOD's ability to purchase alternative fuels or invest in biofuels production. Amendments added restrictive provisions during the Senate Armed Services Committee markup were later removed during floor debate. Amounts for biofuels production in the FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act may not be used for a biofuel refinery construction until matching contributions are received from the Department of Energy. The Department of Defense must receive matching contributions from the Department of Energy and equivalent contributions from the Department of Agriculture before funds for biofuels production can be used for a biofuel refinery construction. The Departments of Defense and Energy have requested appropriations for a joint biofuels production initiative in FY2013. The Navy, Department of Energy, and Department of Agriculture are working together to develop a domestic advanced biofuel industry with appropriated funds. The Department of Energy and Department of Agriculture are collaborating on a biofuels production initiative in FY2013. The Navy requested $70 million for advanced biofuels production, but the House Appropriations Committee declined to fund this initiative. The House Appropriations Committee declined to fund the $70 million requested for the joint biofuel production initiative as part of the DPA Fund. H.R. 5856 contains $63.5 million in DPA funding, while the Senate Appropriations Committee recommends funding the DPA Fund at $189 million with no specific mention of biofuel production. The Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 (H.R. 933 / P.L. 113-6) includes $223,531,000 for the Defense Production Act Fund, an increase of $134.3 million. Funding for advanced drop-in biofuels was reduced by $10 million to $60 million. Additionally, $20 million was allocated for research on reducing emissions from coal to liquid fuels. The Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 (H.R. 933 / P.L. 113-6) allocated $20 million for research into lowering emissions from coal to liquid fuels in the Air Force's Research & Development. The conferees did not include a provision proposed by the House regarding the Energy Independence and Security Act. The Air Force allocated $20 million for research to improve emissions of coal to liquid fuel as an alternative energy resource. The Secretary of the Air Force must inform congressional defense committees before any funds are spent. DOE requested $40 million transfer for FY2013. The DOE requested a $40 million transfer for FY2013, with the House-passed version of the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act not including authorization for the transfer. The Senate version allows for up to $100 million transfer from Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy funds into the Defense Production Act Fund. The Department of Energy requested a $40 million transfer for FY2013, with the Senate version allowing up to $100 million transfer from Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy funds into the Defense Production Act Fund. The Department of Energy's Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy was funded at approximately $1.8 billion under the Department of Defense, Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013. The alternative fuels initiatives of DOD and the services raise oversight questions for Congress regarding the benefits of alternative fuels over conventional petroleum fuels. The alternative fuels initiatives of DOD and the services raise oversight questions for Congress regarding the benefits of alternative fuels over conventional petroleum fuels, funding allocation, coordination efforts, and supporting analysis. The Navy, DOE, and USDA are coordinating efforts to prevent duplication in alternative fuels testing and certification. Analysis supports the Navy's $510 million investment in the domestic advanced biofuel industry. Questions arise about whether biofuel investment should be left to private industry or other government agencies. The DOD's effort to jumpstart the biofuels industry is led by the Navy, raising questions about coordination with military services' alternative fuel goals. The ASD(OEPP) is evaluating the coordination of alternative fuel goals among military services and overseeing investments in alternative fuels testing. Questions are raised about the adequacy of ASD(OEPP)'s oversight authority and its impact on military services' alternative fuel initiatives. Additionally, concerns about overlap with alternative fuel initiatives of other federal agencies are being addressed.

Questions are raised about oversight authority and impact on military services' initiatives. Concerns about overlap with alternative fuel initiatives of other federal agencies are being addressed. The DOD is examining changes in alternative fuel initiatives and coordination with other federal agencies. The FY2012 Department of Defense Appropriations Act included $150 million for DPA Title III funding, supporting biofuels initiatives without specific allocation. Senate reports encouraged longer contract terms for biofuels procurement. The Senate and House Appropriations Committees encouraged longer contract terms for biofuels procurement to ensure adequate production and efficiency. The House Appropriations Committee report emphasized the importance of long-term contracts for biofuels procurement to maximize efficiencies and take advantage of expected breakthroughs in alternative energy. The Department of Energy is encouraged to pursue extended multi-year contracts for biofuel products to maximize efficiencies and purchase price. The FY2013 Congressional Budget Request includes transferring funds to the DPA Fund to support pilot-scale demonstration projects for larger-scale production. The House-passed Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act for FY2013 did not authorize DOE to transfer money into the Defense Production Act Fund. The House Appropriations Committee declined to fund the Department of Energy's portion of the Biomass and Biorefinery Systems R&D initiative, recommending $203 million for the project. The House Appropriations Committee recommends $203 million for Biomass and Biorefinery Systems R&D, $3 million above FY2012 and $67 million below the budget request. The Department is directed to focus on research and development activities for producing fuels and electricity from biomass and non-food crops. There are concerns about funding a joint initiative with the Navy and Department of Agriculture for biofuels production for defense purposes. The Department of Energy has not adequately justified funding a Defense initiative for biofuels production for defense purposes. The recommendation includes no funding for the proposed initiative and does not include the requested legislative language. (p. 85-86) The Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act allows the Secretary to transfer funds for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy to the Defense Production Act Fund. The accompanying report supports a joint biofuel production initiative by the DOD, DOE, and USDA, emphasizing the importance of quality and reliability in biofuel supplies for acceptance into the supply chain. The report highlights the importance of quality and reliability in biofuel supplies for acceptance into the supply chain, emphasizing collaboration between the Navy, Department of Agriculture, and DOE to develop innovative technologies for jet and diesel fuels for military uses. The Department of Defense's early adoption of alternative fuels is expected to encourage wider marketplace acceptance. The FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act (H.R. 4310 / S. 3254) includes provisions exempting the Department of Defense from alternative fuel procurement requirements and limiting funds for alternative fuel procurement. SEC. 314 of the FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act limits funds for Department of Defense procurement of alternative fuels if their cost exceeds that of traditional fossil fuels for the same purpose. The Secretary of Defense may purchase limited quantities of alternative fuels as needed. The FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act limits Department of Defense procurement of alternative fuels if their cost exceeds traditional fossil fuels for the same purpose. The Secretary of Defense may purchase limited quantities of alternative fuels as needed for fleet certification. S. 3254 does not restrict the Department of Defense's ability to procure or produce biofuels. The Senate passed an amendment sponsored by Senator Mark Udall that removed a provision limiting the Department of Defense's ability to purchase alternative fuels in the FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act. The Senate passed an amendment sponsored by Senator Mark Udall that removed a provision limiting the Department of Defense's ability to purchase alternative fuels in the FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act. Another amendment, sponsored by Senator Hagan and co-sponsored by several senators, struck a section that would have prohibited the Department of Defense from entering into contracts for biofuels refinery infrastructure. Section 2823, adopted by the Senate Armed Services Committee, would have restricted the Department of Defense from engaging in biofuels refinery projects without specific authorization. Sponsored by Senators Inhofe and McCain, the amendments were approved by narrow votes. Another amendment by Senator Inhofe, aiming to exempt the Department of Defense from a specific energy act provision, failed in a tie vote. The curr_chunk discusses an amendment that would exempt the Department of Defense from a provision in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 regarding the purchase of alternative fuels. This is similar to a section in H.R. 4310 and was included in the version of S. 3254 reported by the Senate Armed Services Committee. The Armed Services Committee on June 4, 2012, set limitations on funds for procurement of alternative fuel by the Department of Defense in fiscal year 2013. The Secretary of Defense may purchase limited quantities of alternative fuels despite the cost restrictions. The Secretary of Defense may purchase limited quantities of alternative fuels for engine or fleet certification for 50/50 blends using competitive procedures and ensuring the best purchase price. Prohibition on biofuel refinery construction is also in place. The Secretary of Defense is limited in purchasing alternative fuels for engine certification. Construction of biofuels refineries or related facilities by the Department of Defense is prohibited unless specifically authorized by law. The Department of Defense is restricted from using funds in fiscal year 2013 for alternative fuels that cost more than traditional fossil fuels, except for testing. In December 2011, the Defense Logistics Agency bought 450,000 gallons of biofuels for $12.0 million, the largest government purchase of biofuel to showcase Carrier Strike Group capabilities. The Department of the Navy made the largest government purchase of biofuel in history to demonstrate the Carrier Strike Group's ability to use alternative fuels. Despite using operation and maintenance funds, the purchase was considered a research initiative. The Vice Chief of Naval Operations testified about the impact of rising fuel prices on readiness accounts. The Subcommittee on Readiness and Management Support discussed the impact of increased fuel prices on readiness accounts, with every $1 increase in fuel price resulting in $31M of additional cost annually. The committee supports DoD initiatives to reduce fuel demand through new technologies but is concerned about the pressure on defense budgets. The committee is concerned about the use of operation and maintenance funds for significantly higher costs of biofuels used in RDTE efforts. They direct the Secretary of Defense to develop guidance on the difference between operational use of alternative fuels and RDTE initiatives. Section 315 of the FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act limits Department of Defense funds for biofuel refinery construction until matching contributions are received from the Department of Energy and Department of Agriculture. The Department of Defense's funding for biofuel refinery construction in FY2013 is limited until matching contributions are received from the Department of Energy and Department of Agriculture. The House Appropriations Committee allocated $70 million for advanced drop-in biofuel production in the 2013 fiscal year. The Committee recommends no funding for the advanced drop-in biofuel plants and refineries in fiscal year 2013, as $70 million allocated for this effort may not be executed until fiscal year 2014. The Committee urges the Secretary of Defense to request funding when needed. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommends no funding for advanced drop-in biofuel plants and refineries in FY2013, as funds may not be executed until FY2014. However, an additional $100 million is provided for the Defense Production Act (DPA) fund in FY2013 to strengthen the U.S. defense industrial base. The Committee urges the Secretary of Defense to request funding for this effort in future years when it can be executed in a timely manner. The Committee increases funding for the Defense Production Act (DPA) by $100,000,000 over the budget request to support new initiatives and prioritize completion of DPA projects. The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics must inform congressional defense committees 30 days before any expenditure of these funds. The Department of Defense must inform congressional defense committees 30 days before using funds from the Defense Production Act. The FY2013 DOD appropriations include $223,531,000 for the Defense Production Act Fund, an increase of $134.3 million. However, funding for advanced drop-in biofuels was reduced by $10 million as \"ahead of need.\" The Senate and House reduced funding for advanced drop-in biofuels by $10 million, citing it as \"ahead of need.\" H.R. 933 / P.L. 113-6 allocated $20 million for research on reducing emissions from coal to liquid fuels in the Air Force's Research & Development. The conferees did not include a provision from the House on the Energy Independence and Security Act, but allocated $20 million for Research, Development, Test and Evaluation in the Air Force. The conferees allocated $20 million for research on improving emissions from coal to liquid fuel in the Air Force, aiming to make it a competitive alternative energy resource. The Secretary of the Air Force must inform congressional defense committees 30 days before using these funds. The Department of Energy received approximately $1.8 billion in funding under the Department of Defense, Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013. The Secretary of Defense for Operational Energy Plans and Programs must inform congressional defense committees 30 days before any obligation or expenditure of these funds."
