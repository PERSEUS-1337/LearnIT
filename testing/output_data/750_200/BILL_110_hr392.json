    "content": "The Act is titled the \"District of Columbia and United States Territories Circulating Quarter Dollar Program Act\" and it authorizes the issuance of redesigned quarter dollars honoring the District of Columbia and each of the territories. Section 5112 of title 31, United States Code, is amended to include a new subsection for the redesign and issuance of circulating quarter dollars honoring the District of Columbia and the territories in 2009. The redesign and issuance of circulating quarter dollars in 2009 will honor the District of Columbia and the territories, with flexibility in design and placement of inscriptions. The reverse side of quarter dollars issued in 2009 will feature designs emblematic of the District of Columbia and territories like Puerto Rico, Guam, and others. The reverse side of quarter dollars issued in 2009 will feature designs representing Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the United States Virgin Islands, and the Northern Mariana Islands. The Secretary will select 6 designs for the quarter dollars after consulting with the chief executive of the District of Columbia or the territory being honored. The designs for quarter dollars issued in 2009 representing various territories will be selected by the Secretary after consultation with designated officials and reviewed by the Commission of Fine Arts and Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee. Designs for quarter dollars can be submitted through a selection process developed by the Secretary, which may involve District or territorial officials, artists, engravers, and the general public. The Secretary shall not select any frivolous or inappropriate design for any quarter dollar minted under this subsection, ensuring dignified designs for the Nation's coinage and currency. No head and shoulders portrait or bust of any person is allowed. No head and shoulders portrait or bust of any person, living or dead, and no portrait of a living person may be included in the design of any quarter dollar minted under this subsection. All coins minted under this subsection are considered numismatic items. The Secretary may mint and issue quarter dollars of each design. The Secretary has the authority to mint and issue quarter dollars of each design in uncirculated and proof qualities, as well as silver coins with a 90 percent silver content. The Secretary can mint coins with 90 percent silver and 10 percent copper, honoring the District of Columbia and territories in 2009 in a specific order. The legislation applies to the District of Columbia and territories, including the Virgin Islands and the Northern Mariana Islands. If a territory becomes a state or gains independence within 10 years, different provisions will apply. If a territory becomes independent or ceases to be a territory of the United States before quarter dollars with designs emblematic of that territory are minted, this subsection will no longer apply to that territory. The term \"territory\" refers to Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the US Virgin Islands, and the Northern Mariana Islands. The House of Representatives passed the bill on January 23, 2007. Karen L. Haas attested to it as the Clerk."
