    "content": "Title X of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include a new section called \"Physical Education for Progress Act.\" This part aims to provide grants and contracts to local educational agencies to enhance physical education programs for students from kindergarten to 12th grade. \"Congress finds that physical education is crucial for children's development, improving their health, self-esteem, relationships, behavior, and independence.\" Children who participate in high quality daily physical education programs tend to be healthier and more physically fit. The percentage of overweight young people has more than doubled in the 30 years before 1999, with low activity levels contributing to obesity. Obesity-related diseases cost the US economy over $100 billion annually, and inactivity and poor diet lead to at least 300,000 deaths in the US each year. Physically fit adults have reduced risk factors for heart attacks and stroke. Children are not as active as they should be, with fewer than 1 in 4 getting enough vigorous activity daily. Surgeon General's 1996 Report recommends daily physical education for all students from kindergarten to grade 12. The Surgeon General's 1996 Report and the Centers for Disease Control recommend daily physical education for all students in kindergarten through grade 12, but little progress has been made in implementing this recommendation. Little progress has been made in implementing the recommendation for daily physical education for all students from kindergarten through grade 12. Every student should have the opportunity to participate in quality physical education to develop health-related fitness, physical competence, and cognitive understanding about physical activity. \"SEC. 10999D. PROGRAM AUTHORIZED.\" The Secretary can award grants to local educational agencies for physical education programs for K-12 students, including equipment, curriculum development, and teacher training. \"SEC. 10999E. APPLICATIONS; PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS.\" Each local educational agency must submit an application to the Secretary outlining a plan to enhance physical education programs in schools to meet specific requirements. These requirements include providing elementary, middle, and high school students with a minimum of 150 minutes of physical education curriculum. The curriculum of the programs must provide elementary, middle, and secondary school students with at least 150 minutes per week of instructional physical education, along with fitness education, assessment, and instruction in various motor skills to enhance overall development. The curriculum must include instruction in motor skills to enhance physical, mental, and social development, cognitive concepts supporting lifelong healthy lifestyle, opportunities for social and cooperative skills development, and appropriate physical activity for all children. Teachers of physical education must have baccalaureate degrees and receive professional development to stay updated on the latest research and trends in the field. Additionally, children should be involved in activities that promote physical activity and be taught healthy eating habits and nutrition. The latest research, issues, and trends in physical education are discussed. Extracurricular activities like team sports and ROTC are not considered part of the curriculum for physical education programs under this part. The Secretary ensures equitable distribution of grants and contracts between urban and rural local educational agencies, as well as between those serving large and small student populations. Additionally, provisions are made for private school and home-schooled students. Private school and home-schooled students can participate in activities funded under this part, based on the number of students in the school district. A report is required for continued funding. To continue receiving grant or contract funding after the first year, the local educational agency must submit an annual report showing progress towards program requirements. Additionally, a report to Congress is required. The Secretary must submit a report to Congress by June 1, 2003, detailing the programs assisted under this part, their success in improving physical fitness, and recommendations for their continuation and improvement. Additionally, not more than 7 percent of grant funds can be used for administrative costs, and the federal share should supplement, not supplant, existing funds. The Federal share for projects under this part is capped at 90% for the first year and 75% for subsequent years. Funds must supplement, not replace, other Federal, State, and local funds for physical education activities. Authorization of appropriations is also included. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2000 to 2004 totaling $30,000,000, $70,000,000, and $100,000,000 respectively, to support physical education activities."
