    "content": "End-to-end neural models have advanced question answering, but they assume answers and evidence are close in a single document. The Coarse-grain Fine-grain Coattention Network (CFC) is a new model that combines evidence from multiple documents. It includes a coarse-grain module for interpreting documents with respect to the query and finding relevant answers, and a fine-grain module that scores candidate answers by comparing their occurrences across all documents with the query. These modules use hierarchies of coattention and self-attention to learn. The CFC model achieves a new state-of-the-art result of 70.6% on the Qangaroo WikiHop task, outperforming previous best by 3% accuracy. It uses hierarchies of coattention and self-attention to combine information from multiple documents for question answering. The focus of this work is on multi-evidence question answering, which involves aggregating evidence from multiple documents to answer questions. Existing datasets mainly concentrate on reasoning over localized sections of a single document, while this model aims to address the challenge of combining information from multiple sources for more accurate answers. The Coarse-grain Fine-grain Coattention Network (CFC) is a multi-evidence QA model that selects answers from support documents based on coarse-grain and fine-grain reasoning. It aggregates evidence from multiple sources to provide accurate answers. The Coarse-grain Fine-grain Coattention Network (CFC) uses hierarchical attention to combine information from support documents for multi-evidence QA. It achieves a new state-of-the-art result on the blind Qangaroo WikiHop test set with 70.6% accuracy, surpassing previous best by 3%. The CFC achieves a new state-of-the-art result on the blind Qangaroo WikiHop test set with 70.6% accuracy, beating the previous best by 3%. It also improves accuracy on the TriviaQA multi-paragraph question answering task. The attention hierarchies of the coarse and fine-grain modules focus on distinct parts of the input, enabling more effective representation. The coarse and fine-grain modules in the CFC focus on distinct parts of the input, allowing for more effective representation of long documents. Common errors in the CFC are caused by challenges in aggregating references, noise in supervision, and complex relation types. The coarse-grain and fine-grain modules correspond to different reasoning strategies in summarizing support documents and queries. The CFC model utilizes coarse-grain and fine-grain modules to effectively summarize support documents and queries. The coarse-grain module builds codependent representations using coattention and self-attention, while the fine-grain module retrieves specific contexts of each candidate through coreferent mentions and coattention. This division of labor allows for better representation of long documents by focusing on different parts of the input. The CFC model utilizes coarse-grain and fine-grain modules to effectively summarize support documents and queries by focusing on different parts of the input. This enables the model to represent a large number of potentially long support documents. The word embeddings of the query, support documents, and candidate answers are encoded using a bidirectional Gated Recurrent network. The CFC model uses bidirectional GRUs to encode word embeddings of queries, support documents, and candidates. It employs coattention to build codependent representations of support documents and queries, followed by self-attention to compare them to candidates. The CFC model utilizes coattention to create interdependent representations of support documents and queries, followed by self-attention to compare them to candidates. Coattention is essential for single-document question answering models and involves computing affinity matrices between the document and query. The coattention context is obtained through feature-wise concatenation of the document context and summary vectors. The coattention context is obtained through feature-wise concatenation of the document context and summary vectors. It is then summarized using hierarchical self-attention to create a fixed-length summary vector. The coattention context is summarized using hierarchical self-attention to create a fixed-length summary vector. A score is computed for each position using a multi-layer perceptron, normalized, and used to compute a weighted sum over the context. Parameters for the MLP scorer are utilized in this process. The coattention context is summarized hierarchically using self-attention to create a fixed-length summary vector. This summary is then multiplied with the candidate answer summary to produce a coarse-grain score. The DISPLAYFORM7 model uses encoding and self-attention summaries for candidates, with a fixed-length summary vector of support documents. A projection layer reduces support document summaries, while the fine-grain module identifies specific contexts using coreference resolution. Mention representations are formed using self-attention, and coattention is computed between mention representations and the query. The coattention context is a codependent encoding. The DISPLAYFORM7 model utilizes self-attention for mention representations and coattention between mentions and the query to create a codependent encoding. This process helps in producing fine-grain summaries for scoring candidates in the support documents. The model uses self-attention for mention representations and coattention between mentions and the query to create a codependent encoding for scoring candidates in support documents. The model combines fine-grain and coarse-grain scores to determine candidate scores, which are then used to form a final score vector. It is trained using cross-entropy loss and evaluated on multi-evidence question answering tasks. The CFC achieves state-of-the-art results on the WikiHop dataset and significantly improves performance on the TriviaQA task by reranking outputs of a span-extraction model. The WikiHop task facilitates multi-evidence question answering by linking entities in a document corpus with a knowledge base. The dataset is created by connecting entities in a document corpus with a knowledge base, forming a bipartite graph. Each knowledge base fact triplet corresponds to a path in the graph, with support documents along the path. The Qangaroo WikiHop task involves providing plausible candidate objects for a given query. The Qangaroo WikiHop task involves selecting the correct candidate answer from a set of plausible objects based on support documents. The dataset connects entities in a document corpus with a knowledge base, forming a bipartite graph. Official blind test evaluation is done using unmasked candidate answers. Tokenization is done using Stanford CoreNLP, and GloVe embeddings are used for data processing. The CFC achieves state-of-the-art results on both masked and unmasked versions of WikiHop, with a new best accuracy of 70.6% on the blind, held-out test set. The CFC achieves a new best accuracy of 70.6% on the blind, held-out WikiHop test set, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art result by 3% without using pretrained contextual encoders. The division of labour between the coarse-grain module and the fine-grain module allows for more effective modeling of potentially long documents. The CFC achieves a new best accuracy of 70.6% on the blind, held-out WikiHop test set, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art result by 3% without using pretrained contextual encoders. The attention hierarchies of each module focus on different parts of the input, enabling more effective modeling of long documents. Experimentation on TriviaQA involves proposing candidate answers and reranking them. The ablation study on the WikiHop dev set involved removing modules and replacing components in the question answering model. BiDAF++ was used for span extraction, and CFC was used for reranking candidate answers. Top 50 answer candidates were obtained from BiDAF++ for training. During training, the top 50 answer candidates from BiDAF++ are used for reranking with the CFC. Reranking with the CFC consistently improves performance over using only the span extraction question answering model. Overall, using the CFC results in a 3.1% EM and 3.0% F1 gain on the TriviaQA dev set, indicating its effectiveness in refining outputs from question answering models. The CFC results in a 3.1% EM and 3.0% F1 gain, refining outputs from question answering models. Table 3 shows performance contributions of modules and model decisions. Coarse-grain and fine-grain modules significantly improve model performance. Replacing self-attention and bidirectional GRUs with mean-pooling and unidirectional GRUs results in less performance degradation. Replacing the encoder with word embeddings projection leads to a significant performance drop. Replacing the encoder with a projection over word embeddings results in a significant performance drop, indicating the importance of contextual encodings that capture positional information. The fine-grain-only model consistently under-performs the coarse-grain-only model across various dataset lengths, likely due to the difficulty of coreference resolution. The technique of exact lexical matching produces high precision and low recall due to coreference resolution difficulties. The fine-grain-only model outperforms the coarse-grain-only model on examples with many support documents or long support documents, capturing dependencies more precisely. Examining hierarchical attention maps from the CFC on WikiHop examples reveals that coattention layers focus on similar phrases between documents. The CFC attention maps focus on similar phrases between documents, with coattention layers aligning the relation part of the query to the context. Fine-grain coattention and self-attention scores are provided in the Appendix for the query about the administrative territorial entity Hampton Wick War Memorial. The coattention aligns the relation part of the query to the context in which the mention occurs. It describes Hampton Wicks, Hampton Hills, and Teddington in Richmond upon Thames. The summary self-attention focuses on relevant documents for the query, with top support documents providing information about the United Kingdom. The summary selfattention focuses on relevant documents for the query, with the top three support documents presenting information about the literary work The Troll, its author Julia Donaldson, and Old Norse. Coarse-grain summary self-attention tends to focus on support documents relevant to the object in the query, while fine-grain coattention over mention representations focuses on the relation part of the query. The Troll, its author Julia Donaldson, and Old Norse are key details highlighted in the text. Coattention in equation 19 focuses on the relationship between mentions and phrases. Errors in the CFC model are categorized into four types, with the first type resulting from aggregating the wrong reference. The errors in the CFC model are categorized into two types, with the first type (42% of errors) resulting from aggregating the wrong reference. For example, focusing on the wrong word in a document instead of the correct answer. Ways to reduce this error include using more robust pretrained contextual encoders and coreference resolution. The second type (28% of errors) results from unanswerable questions. The errors in the CFC model are categorized into two types. The first type (42% of errors) results from aggregating the wrong reference, such as focusing on the wrong word in a document. Ways to reduce this error include using more robust pretrained contextual encoders and coreference resolution. The second type (28% of errors) results from unanswerable questions. Additionally, there are two more types of errors: queries that do not provide answerable information and queries that yield multiple correct answers. These errors highlight the challenges of using distant supervision to create large-scale datasets like WikiHop. The errors in the CFC model are categorized into two types: wrong reference aggregation (42% of errors) and unanswerable questions (28% of errors). Other errors include queries with unanswerable information and queries with multiple correct answers. Using distant supervision for large-scale datasets like WikiHop presents challenges, especially with complex relation types. Alleviating errors can involve embedding relations with tunable symbolic embeddings and fixed word embeddings. QA tasks involve various sources like Wikipedia and news articles. The Qangaroo WikiHop dataset requires reasoning over multiple pieces of evidence across documents, unlike most QA tasks that typically involve coreference resolution within a single document. This task involves aggregating information from sources like Wikipedia and news articles. The recent development of large-scale QA datasets has led to the creation of end-to-end QA models, including document attention models, multi-hop memory networks, and cross-sequence attention models for span-extraction QA. These models aggregate information from multiple documents and are used for query-focused multi-document summarization tasks. Recent advances in QA models include the use of reinforcement learning for exploring close answers, convolutions and self-attention for modeling interactions, and reranking models for refining span-extraction output. Various cross-sequence attention models have been developed, such as match-LSTM, coattention, bidirectional attention, and query-context attention. Our work builds upon prior research on single-document QA and extends to multi-evidence QA. Attention mechanisms, such as convolutions, self-attention, and reranking models, have been used to model interactions and refine span-extraction output in various tasks like machine translation, relation extraction, summarization, and semantic parsing. Attention mechanisms have been utilized in various tasks such as machine translation, relation extraction, summarization, and semantic parsing. Coattention and self-attention have also been successful in tasks like visual question answering, textual entailment, coreference resolution, dialogue state-tracking, and semantic parsing. In the CFC, a novel approach combines self-attention and coattention hierarchically to create effective representations of long documents. Hierarchical coarse-to-fine modeling, gradually increasing complexity, is effective for modeling lengthy documents. Neural coarse-to-fine modeling has also been explored in various tasks. Petrov (2009) discusses the effectiveness of neural coarse-to-fine modeling in various tasks such as parsing, speech recognition, and machine translation. The CFC model combines coarse and fine-grain reasoning for multi-evidence question answering, inspired by hierarchical modeling. The CFC model, inspired by hierarchical modeling, achieves 70.6% test accuracy on the WikiHop question answering task, outperforming previous methods by 3%. The integration of full-scale coreference resolution systems remains a direction for future work.
