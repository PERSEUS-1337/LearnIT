Section 402 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 is amended to extend the time period from \"ten years\" to \"20 years\" for grazing allotments, permits, or leases. Additionally, requirements for initial environmental analysis under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 are specified. The time period for grazing allotments, permits, or leases under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 is extended from \"ten years\" to \"20 years\" and includes requirements for initial environmental analysis under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. SEC. 405 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 amends the renewal, transfer, and reissuance process for grazing permits and leases. In this section, \"current grazing management\" refers to grazing in accordance with existing permits or leases, including modifications consistent with resource management plans. \"Secretary concerned\" is defined as the Secretary of Agriculture for National Forest System land and the Secretary of the Interior for other lands. The Secretary of Agriculture oversees National Forest System land, while the Secretary of the Interior manages land under their jurisdiction. Grazing permits issued by these departments that expire or are transferred must be renewed or reissued according to specific sections of the law. Grazing permits issued by the Secretary of Agriculture or the Secretary of the Interior must be renewed or reissued under specific sections of the law, with terms and conditions continuing until the expiration date under the renewed or reissued permit or lease. The renewed or reissued permit or lease described in subsection (b) remains in effect until processing is completed by the Secretary concerned, in compliance with applicable law. The permit or lease may be cancelled, suspended, or modified according to the law. After processing, the Secretary concerned may renew or reissue a permit or lease for 20 years. The renewal, reissuance, or transfer may be exempt from environmental assessment requirements at their discretion. The Secretary concerned may be exempt from preparing an environmental assessment or impact statement if the decision involves renewing, reissuing, or transferring grazing management that meets objectives in the land use plan or is consistent with policy. The Secretary concerned has the discretion to prioritize and determine the timing for completing environmental analyses for grazing allotments based on environmental significance and available funding. The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 does not apply to certain activities related to grazing allotments, permits, or leases, such as crossing authorizations and grazing preference transfers.
