    "content": "Some Members of Congress have long been interested in the rules governing patentable subject matter. The term refers to the requirement that an invention must consist of a \"process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter\" to be patented. The Leahy-Smith America Invents Act of 2011 restricted patents on human organisms and tax avoidance strategies. The courts and USPTO have historically interpreted Section 101 broadly for patentable subject matter. The courts have historically allowed a wide range of patentable subject matter under Section 101, but exceptions exist for laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas. Recent Supreme Court decisions have made Section 101 a more significant filter for invalidating patents. Since 2010, the Supreme Court has issued four opinions on patentable subject matter, leading to increased use of Section 101 to invalidate patents and reject patent applications at the USPTO. Many patents granted under earlier standards may now be deemed invalid under the new scrutiny. The recent prominence of Section 101 in the U.S. patent system has sparked debate, with concerns raised about the \"state of crisis\" and \"confusing\" legal standards established by the Supreme Court. The former Chief Judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit criticized the Supreme Court decisions for creating \"total chaos\" and deviating from sensible patent policy. The recent Supreme Court decisions on patent appeals have been criticized for creating \"total chaos\" and departing from sensible patent policy. However, some believe these decisions could lead to patents of appropriate scope, reduce abusive patent litigation, and encourage higher quality patents. This report reviews current patent law and proposals for reform, starting with an overview of the patent system and principles of patentable subject matter, followed by an analysis of key Supreme Court decisions on Section 101 of the Patent Act. The report discusses the patent system, Supreme Court decisions on patentable subject matter, implications in IT and life sciences industries, and legislative reform options. Applicants must submit detailed applications to the USPTO for patent protection under the Patent Act of 1952. USPTO examiners evaluate applications for patent eligibility based on the invention's description. The patent application process under the Patent Act of 1952 requires a detailed specification and at least one claim that distinctly defines the invention. Examiners assess applications for novelty and nonobviousness to determine patentability. The patent application process requires a detailed specification and distinct claims to assess novelty and nonobviousness for patentability. Novelty is determined by the prior art, while nonobviousness requires the invention to be beyond ordinary skills and provide a tangible benefit. The invention must be useful, operable, and provide a tangible benefit to be patentable under Section 101 of the Patent Act, which defines patentable subject matter as new and useful processes, machines, manufactures, compositions of matter, or improvements thereof. The statute defines a \"process\" as a series of steps to achieve a specific result, typically related to methods of manufacture or use. Process patents may claim methods of making products or using chemical compounds. The other patentable subject matter categories pertain to products, with the term \"machine\" including mechanical devices to perform functions. The Supreme Court has defined \"machine\" as any mechanical device to perform a function, \"manufacture\" as the production of articles from raw materials, and \"composition of matter\" as compositions of substances. Section 101 of patent law covers the patentability of various substances and articles, including gases, fluids, powders, and solids. Courts have set limits on patentable processes, excluding laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas. These types of inventions are considered essential tools of scientific and technological work and are meant to be freely available to all. The USPTO allows patent applications to issue as granted patents if they meet Section 101 requirements. The patent holder gains the right to exclude others from using the claimed invention in the United States. A patent grants the right to exclude others from using, selling, or importing the claimed invention in the United States for a period of twenty years. This exclusivity allows inventors to practice their inventions or license them to others, enabling them to recoup their investment by charging higher prices. Patent holders are responsible for monitoring competitors' use of the patented invention. Patent owners must monitor competitors for infringement and may need to litigate in federal courts. Issued patents are presumed valid, but accused infringers can challenge validity. The Federal Circuit handles most patent appeals, with the Supreme Court having discretionary review authority. The Supreme Court has discretionary authority to review cases from the Federal Circuit, with recent decisions marking the first time patentable subject matter has been addressed in nearly four decades. Previous landmark cases in 1980 and 1981 established broad patentable subject matter for information technologies and life sciences. The Supreme Court revisited patentable subject matter in a series of decisions from 2010 to 2014, holding each invention considered to be unpatentable under Section 101. This has had a significant impact on the patent system. In its 2010 decision Bilski v. Kappos, the Supreme Court considered the patentability of a method of hedging risk in commodities trading. The patent application claimed a method for managing consumption risk costs of a commodity sold at a fixed price through transactions between a commodity provider and consumers. The patent application involved initiating transactions between a commodity provider and consumers at a fixed rate based on historical averages, with market participants balancing the risk position through transactions at a second fixed rate. The USPTO rejected the application for patenting. The USPTO rejected the patent application for claiming ineligible subject matter under Section 101. The Federal Circuit determined that the application did not claim patentable subject matter as it did not meet the criteria of being tied to a particular machine or transforming an article into a different state. The Federal Circuit concluded that Bilski's patent application did not claim patentable subject matter as it did not satisfy the criteria of being tied to a specific machine or achieving a physical transformation. The USPTO decision to deny Bilski's patent application was affirmed by the Supreme Court, which issued three opinions, including a plurality opinion authored by Justice Kennedy. The Court agreed that Bilski's invention could not be patented as it did not involve physical objects or substances. The Supreme Court, in a majority decision authored by Justice Kennedy, ruled that Bilski's invention could not be patented as it involved an abstract idea of risk hedging, which is not eligible for patent protection. The Court rejected the machine or transformation test as the sole standard for patentable processes, instead emphasizing that abstract ideas are not patentable subject matter. The Supreme Court ruled that Bilski's risk hedging invention could not be patented as it involved an abstract idea, rejecting the machine or transformation test as the sole standard for patentable processes. Justice Stevens concurred, stating that methods of doing business should not be covered by patents. The Supreme Court ruled against Bilski's risk hedging invention, stating that methods of doing business are not covered by patents. Justice Breyer emphasized the need to limit patentable subject matter and acknowledged the machine-or-transformation test's usefulness but not as the sole standard for process patentability. In Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc., the Supreme Court shifted focus to life sciences, ruling that not everything achieving a \"useful, concrete, and tangible result\" qualifies as patentable subject matter. Prometheus Laboratories held patents for methods of determining optimal dosages of thiopurine drugs for autoimmune diseases. The Supreme Court ruled in Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc. that not all methods achieving a \"useful, concrete, and tangible result\" are patentable. Prometheus Laboratories had patents for determining optimal dosages of thiopurine drugs for autoimmune diseases, involving administering the drug and measuring metabolite levels in red blood cells to adjust dosage for efficacy and reduced toxicity. The `623 patent claims a method to optimize therapeutic efficacy for immune-mediated gastrointestinal disorders by administering 6-thioguanine and monitoring its levels in the patient's red blood cells to adjust drug dosage accordingly. The Supreme Court ruled that claims related to adjusting drug dosage based on 6-thioguanine levels in red blood cells were unpatentable as they were directed towards natural laws. The Supreme Court ruled that natural phenomena and abstract concepts could not be patented as it may hinder innovation. However, processes that apply natural laws in a useful way are eligible for patenting. In the case at hand, the Court recognized that the claims involved relationships between thiopurine metabolite concentrations and the effectiveness or harm of a drug dosage. The Supreme Court ruled that processes applying natural laws in a useful way are eligible for patenting. The case involved relationships between thiopurine metabolite concentrations and drug dosage effectiveness or harm. Justice Breyer questioned if the claims added enough to qualify as patent-eligible processes. The Supreme Court ruled that processes applying natural laws in a useful way are eligible for patenting. Justice Breyer explained that the additional claimed steps did not make the inventions patentable subject matter. The \"administering\" step referred to physicians treating patients with thiopurine drugs, and the \"determining\" step advised measuring metabolite levels in a patient's blood. Merely limiting the use of a natural law to a specific technological environment does not make it patentable. The Supreme Court ruled that processes applying natural laws in a useful way are eligible for patenting. Justice Breyer stated that conventional or obvious pre-solution activity did not convert an unpatentable law of nature into a patent-eligible application. The \"administering\" step referred to physicians treating patients with thiopurine drugs, and the \"determining\" step advised measuring metabolite levels in a patient's blood. Simply advising individuals to use a law of nature does not make it patentable. The Supreme Court, in Mayo v. Prometheus, ruled that advising individuals to use a law of nature does not make it patentable. Justice Breyer stated that the three steps in the claim did not transform unpatentable natural correlations into patentable applications. The Court rejected the argument that the Prometheus patents satisfied the machine-or-transformation test. The Supreme Court in Mayo v. Prometheus ruled that advising individuals to use a law of nature does not make it patentable. Justice Breyer countered the Circuit's reasoning that the patents-in-suit transformed human blood and the human body, stating that the claims only required measuring metabolite levels. The Court also addressed the argument that any step beyond stating a law of nature should fulfill Section 101 standards. The Supreme Court in Mayo v. Prometheus ruled that advising individuals to use a law of nature does not make it patentable. Justice Breyer rejected the idea that any step beyond stating a law of nature should fulfill Section 101 standards, emphasizing that policy concerns underlying Section 101 are distinct from other patentability requirements. He also addressed concerns that rejecting the Prometheus patents would discourage diagnostic research. In a June 2013 decision, the Supreme Court ruled in Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc., that genomic DNA was ineligible for patenting under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7101 due to the \"product of nature\" doctrine. The Court responded to concerns about limiting physician access to scientific data by denying patents on natural laws. The Supreme Court ruled in Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc., that genomic DNA cannot be patented under the \"product of nature\" doctrine. However, isolated and purified genomic DNA can be patented if significant artificial changes are made. This exception led to over 50,000 patents being issued by the USPTO. The USPTO issued over 50,000 patents related to DNA, including human genes, based on the exception that isolated and purified genomic DNA could be patented if significant artificial changes were made. However, experts argued that isolating a gene was a \"technicality\" and genes should not be patentable. The Supreme Court decision in Myriad reflected this view, with a lawsuit filed against the USPTO by the Association for Molecular Pathology and other plaintiffs in 2009. The lawsuit against the USPTO, Myriad Genetics, and University of Utah Research Foundation was filed in 2009 by the Association for Molecular Pathology and other plaintiffs. They challenged Myriad's patents on isolated human genes BRCA1 and BRCA2, associated with breast and ovarian cancers. Myriad held exclusive rights to genetic testing for these genes. The plaintiffs challenged Myriad's gene patent claims on BRCA1 and BRCA2, arguing that human genes are naturally occurring and not patentable. The U.S. District Court invalidated Myriad's gene patents, but the Federal Circuit later reversed this decision. The Federal Circuit reversed the decision that human genes are not patentable, stating that isolated DNA has been chemically manipulated to be markedly different from natural DNA. The Supreme Court vacated the judgment in the Myriad case and remanded it back to the Federal Circuit for reconsideration. The Supreme Court vacated the judgment in the Myriad case and remanded it back to the Federal Circuit with instructions to reconsider the appeal. Justice Thomas stated that Myriad had discovered the genetic sequence of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, not created them, and separating the gene from its surrounding material was not an act of invention. The Supreme Court found that Myriad did not create anything by isolating genes from the human genome, stating that it was not an act of invention. Justice Thomas noted that Myriad's claims did not rely on chemical composition or changes resulting from gene isolation. However, the Court viewed claims related to \"complementary DNA\" more favorably. The Court viewed claims related to \"complementary DNA\" more favorably, as it is synthetic DNA with a sequence complementary to naturally-occurring DNA. Justice Thomas concluded that cDNA did not constitute a \"product of nature\" and could be patented. The Myriad opinion did not involve an innovative method of manipulating genes while searching for the BRCA1 gene. Justice Thomas emphasized that the Myriad opinion did not address the patentability of DNA with altered nucleotide sequences. The Court ruled that genes and their encoded information are not patent-eligible simply because they have been isolated. Seven colleagues joined Justice Thomas in this opinion. Justice Thomas, joined by seven colleagues, ruled that isolated genes are not patent-eligible. Justice Scalia concurred but disagreed on molecular biology details, stating cDNA can be patented as it is synthetic. The Supreme Court's recent decision considered Section 101. In a recent Supreme Court decision, the patentability of a computer-implemented financial exchange system was considered. The inventions in question aimed to reduce \"settlement risk\" in financial transactions. The patents involved a method for exchanging financial obligations, a computer system to carry out the methods, and a computer-readable medium containing the program. The district court found the inventions unpatentable as they were considered a basic business or financial concept. The Federal Circuit and Supreme Court upheld this decision, focusing on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions. The Supreme Court upheld the Federal Circuit's decision that the patents were directed to a patent-ineligible abstract idea. Justice Thomas explained the two-part test for identifying patents claiming excluded subject matter under Section 101. The Supreme Court upheld the Federal Circuit's decision that patents claiming laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas are ineligible. Justice Thomas outlined a two-part test to determine patent eligibility, focusing on whether the claim includes an \"inventive concept\" beyond just applying the excluded subject matter to a specific technological environment. The Supreme Court established a framework for determining patent eligibility, focusing on whether a claim involves an \"inventive concept\" beyond applying excluded subject matter to a specific technological environment. In a specific case, the Court found that method claims were drawn to an abstract idea of intermediated settlement, lacking an inventive concept to transform it into a patent-eligible application. The Supreme Court found that the patented claims were merely implementing an abstract idea on a computer, which did not transform it into a patent-eligible invention. The Court rejected the claims involving generic computer hardware as they failed to do more than generally link the invention. The Supreme Court decisions in Bilski, Mayo v. Prometheus, Myriad, and Alice establish the current law on patent eligibility. The court found that claims involving generic computer hardware failed to sufficiently link the invention to a specific technological environment, making them unpatentable. The two-part test developed from case law is used by the courts and USPTO to determine patent eligibility. The courts and USPTO use a two-part test to determine patent eligibility, based on whether a claim recites a law of nature, natural phenomenon, or abstract idea, and if the claim includes additional inventive elements. The Court will analyze if a patent claim preempts a field of activity, and if it covers every practical application of a fundamental concept, it cannot be patented under Section 101. The Court considers if a claim preempts a field of activity and covers every practical application of a fundamental concept, which can affect patent eligibility under Section 101. Routine hardware like a general-purpose computer does not alleviate concerns. The machine-or-transformation test is a useful guidepost in decision-making. Section 101 determinations can be resolved early in litigation, often at the pleading stage or through summary judgment motions. Courts have found that Section 101 challenges can be resolved early in litigation, often without a formal construction of patent claims. Statistical analysis shows a high probability of invalidating challenged claims, with an average invalidation rate of 66.5% based on a study of 568 patents examined by courts as of June 19, 2016. The study found that 66.5% of challenged patents were invalidated under \u00a7101 motions citing Alice, with the Federal Circuit upholding 3 patents and invalidating 34 patents. The USPTO rejected over 36,000 published patent applications under Alice, indicating that a significant number of patents may not comply with Section 101. Recent statistics suggest that asserting a patent claim's invalidity based on patentable subject matter laws or proposing modifications to these laws has a good chance of success. This trend is particularly notable in information technologies and life sciences, indicating a growing interest from the Supreme Court in patentable subject matter. The Supreme Court's recent focus on patentable subject matter laws has had significant implications for information technologies. Patent claims that lack specific solutions or improvements in technology are vulnerable to challenges under Section 101, leading to the invalidation of numerous computer-related patents. The recent focus on patentable subject matter laws by the Supreme Court has led to the invalidation of numerous computer-related patents. Patents lacking specific technological solutions are vulnerable to challenges under Section 101. Some invalidated patent claims include a computer system for generating menus, a method for collecting and analyzing information on an electric power grid, and a method for extracting data from hard copy documents using automated digitizing units. The recent focus on patentable subject matter laws has led to the invalidation of computer-related patents, including systems for generating menus, analyzing electric power grids, and extracting data from hard copy documents using digitizing units. Other invalidated patents involve administering life insurance policies, processing credit applications over electronic networks, and a broadcast system for cellular phones to receive content from regional broadcasters. The Federal Circuit applied the Supreme Court's two-part test for patentable subject matter to a case involving out-of-region access to local broadcasts. Judge Bryson deemed the concept abstract, stating it has been used in various forms of media distribution. The Federal Circuit applied the Supreme Court's two-part test for patentable subject matter to a case involving out-of-region access to local broadcasts. Judge Bryson deemed the concept abstract, stating it has been used in various forms of media distribution. The patent did not describe how the invention accomplished the claimed functions, confining the idea to cellular telephones, which did not satisfy Section 101. The Federal Circuit did not accept a Section 101 challenge in a case involving out-of-region access to local broadcasts, as the idea was deemed abstract and confined to cellular telephones. Patents directed towards various technologies have been upheld by the court, including e-commerce systems, information management systems, Internet content filtering systems, and methods for animating characters. Claims are more likely to survive Section 101 if they avoid broad functional language and recite specific structures. The Supreme Court decisions in Mayo v. Prometheus and Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics have had consequences for the life sciences industry, particularly in the patenting of predictive diagnostic methods and isolated bodily substances like genes and proteins. The Myriad case has raised doubts on the patentability of isolated bodily substances, including genes and proteins. Fewer judicial opinions have addressed Section 101 in the life sciences compared to information technologies. The 2015 ruling in Ariosa Diagnostics, Inc. v. Sequenom, Inc. has sparked significant discussion in the patent community regarding non-invasive prenatal diagnostic methods. Sequenom, Inc. was involved in a case regarding a non-invasive prenatal diagnostic method for determining fetal gender, blood type, and genetic disorders. They held the exclusive license for U.S. Patent No. 6,258,540, which involved detecting paternally inherited nucleic acid in maternal serum or plasma samples. The Federal Circuit ruled that the method involving amplifying paternally inherited nucleic acid from maternal serum or plasma samples to detect fetal DNA failed the patentable subject matter test as it was directed to a naturally occurring phenomenon, cell-free fetal DNA. The Federal Circuit ruled that the invention failed the patentable subject matter test because it was directed to a naturally occurring phenomenon, cffDNA, and involved conventional techniques. Judge Linn expressed dissatisfaction with the decision, highlighting the breakthrough nature of the invention in prenatal diagnosis. Judge Linn disagreed with the ruling that the invention was not patentable, stating that there was no reason why it should be deemed ineligible. Congress has options to address patentable subject matter laws, with no current bills introduced since 2011. Industry associations have suggested modifications to Section 101. The enactment of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act in 2011 led to suggestions for modifications to Section 101 by industry associations like the AIPLA and IPO. They proposed replacing the existing Section 101 with new language regarding patentable inventions. Section 101 of the U.S. patent law outlines the eligibility criteria for patents, stating that inventions must be useful processes, machines, manufactures, compositions of matter, or improvements thereof. The only exceptions are inventions that exist in nature independent of human activity or can only be performed in the human mind. Eligibility is determined without regard to other requirements or conditions. The eligibility of a claimed invention under Section 101 of U.S. patent law is determined without regard to other patent requirements or conditions. The IPO and ABA have proposed similar amendments to clarify eligible subject matter for patents. The ABA proposal aims to amend Section 101 to specify conditions for patentability of eligible subject matter, allowing patents for useful inventions or discoveries unless certain requirements are not met. There is an exception where a claim may be denied if it overly restricts others' practical use. The ABA proposal seeks to amend Section 101 to establish conditions for patent eligibility, allowing patents for useful inventions unless they preempt all practical applications of a law of nature, natural phenomenon, or abstract idea. Eligibility shall not be negated based on patentability considerations defined in other sections. The AIPLA and ABA propose amendments to Section 101 for patent eligibility, emphasizing that eligibility should not be based on patentability considerations. They argue that recent Supreme Court decisions have introduced ambiguity into the eligibility determination process. The AIPLA and ABA propose amendments to Section 101 for patent eligibility, arguing recent Supreme Court decisions have introduced ambiguity by requiring criteria like 'well known' and 'routine' to render claims ineligible. The IPO criticizes the Court's analysis as contrary to congressional intent and unsound from a policy standpoint. Some believe legislative reform is unnecessary. Some commentators argue against legislative reform for patent eligibility, stating that more restrictive rules have not impacted innovation or investment significantly. They believe proposed amendments would remove limits on software patenting and subject matter eligibility. The AIPLA proposal would also change the current statutory phrase regarding patent entitlement. The AIPLA proposal aims to change the current statutory phrase regarding patent entitlement, potentially eliminating common law patentability standards. This could impact patents in software and life sciences, which have been controversial due to recent Supreme Court interest in patentable subject matter. The debate over patentable subject matter has sparked interest from the court, making it harder to obtain patents in certain fields. Some experts believe that Section 101 maintains a balance between innovation and patent rights, while others fear that limited patent rights will hinder innovation and investment in the US. These discussions may lead to further examination of what types of inventions should be eligible for patents."
