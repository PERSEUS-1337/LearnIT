    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Faster Access to Specialized Treatments Act\" or \"FAST Act\". Congress finds that the FDA plays a crucial role in ensuring the safety and efficacy of new medicines. Regulatory innovation is key to addressing serious diseases by promoting investment in innovative treatments. Advances in medical sciences have led to a better understanding of diseases over the past two decades. Advances in medical sciences, including genomics, molecular biology, and bioinformatics, have led to a new generation of targeted medicines under development for serious diseases. These medicines utilize biomarkers, pharmacogenomics, predictive toxicology, and adaptive clinical trial designs. FDA should implement more effective processes for expedited development and review of innovative medicines for serious or life-threatening diseases, including rare conditions, using a range of endpoints and modern scientific tools earlier in the drug development cycle. FDA should implement more effective processes for expedited development and review of innovative medicines for serious or life-threatening diseases, including rare conditions. This may lead to fewer, smaller, or shorter clinical trials for the intended patient population without compromising FDA's high standards for drug approval. Patients benefit from quicker access to safe and effective therapies for unmet medical needs. The existing statutory authority governing expedited approval of drugs for serious or life-threatening conditions should be amended to enhance FDA's authority in considering scientific data and expediting access to novel treatments. Congress supports FDA's use of accelerated approval and fast track provisions for drug development. The FDA should utilize accelerated approval and fast track provisions to expedite the development and availability of treatments for serious or life-threatening diseases, while maintaining safety and effectiveness standards. SEC. 3. EXPEDITED APPROVAL OF DRUGS FOR SERIOUS OR LIFE-THREATENING DISEASES OR CONDITIONS. Amendment to Section 506 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to expedite approval of drugs for serious or life-threatening diseases. The Secretary will expedite the review of new drugs intended for serious or life-threatening diseases if they address unmet medical needs. The Secretary can designate a new drug as a fast track product if it addresses unmet medical needs for serious or life-threatening diseases. The sponsor can request this designation concurrently with or after submitting an application for drug investigation. Within 60 days of the request, the Secretary will determine if the drug qualifies for fast track status. The Secretary can designate a drug as a fast track product if it meets specific criteria, expediting the development and review process for approval. Additionally, the Secretary may approve an application for a drug addressing serious or life-threatening diseases. The Secretary may approve a product for a serious or life-threatening disease, including a fast track product, based on its effect on a surrogate endpoint predicting clinical benefit. The Secretary may approve a product for a serious or life-threatening disease based on its effect on a surrogate endpoint or a clinical endpoint that predicts clinical benefit or other clinical outcomes. Evidence supporting the prediction of clinical benefit may include various scientific methods such as biomarkers. The Secretary may approve a product for a serious or life-threatening disease based on evidence developed using biomarkers or other scientific methods. Approval may be subject to post-approval studies and submission of promotional materials. The Secretary may expedite withdrawal of approval for a product approved for a serious or life-threatening disease based on biomarkers or scientific methods. Approval may require post-approval studies and submission of promotional materials. The Secretary can withdraw approval of a product using expedited procedures if the sponsor fails to conduct required post-approval studies diligently, if a study fails to verify predicted effects, or if other evidence shows issues with the product. The Secretary can withdraw approval of a product if the sponsor fails to verify predicted effects, if other evidence shows issues with the product, or if false promotional materials are disseminated. If the Secretary determines a fast track product may be effective, a review of incomplete applications will be conducted. If the Secretary determines a fast track product may be effective, they can evaluate and commence review of portions of the application before it is complete, provided the applicant provides a submission schedule and pays any required fees. The Secretary can evaluate and review parts of a fast track product application before it is complete if the applicant provides a submission schedule and pays any required fees. Time periods for review agreed upon by the Secretary do not apply until the application is complete. The Secretary shall develop and disseminate information on accelerated approval and fast track products to relevant parties and establish a program to encourage the development of scientific methods for endpoints and biomarkers. The Secretary will utilize scientific methods, biomarkers, and other tools to determine if evidence in an application can predict clinical benefit for serious or life-threatening conditions with unmet medical needs. SEC. 4. GUIDANCE; AMENDED REGULATIONS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must issue draft guidance within one year of the enactment of the Act, followed by final guidance after public comment. Regulations governing accelerated approval will be amended to align with the amendments made by section 3. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will amend regulations to align with amendments made by section 3, considering issues related to accelerated approval and fast track processes for drugs designated for rare diseases. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will amend regulations to align with amendments made by section 3, focusing on incorporating novel approaches to the review of surrogate endpoints for rare diseases. No delay in review or approval is allowed for designation requests or approval applications. The amendment made by section 3 focuses on incorporating novel approaches to the review of surrogate endpoints for rare diseases. The review or action on designation requests or approval applications submitted under section 506 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is not precluded. SEC. 5. INDEPENDENT REVIEW. The Secretary will contract with an independent entity to evaluate the FDA's application of new drug review processes and their impact on innovative treatments for serious conditions. Patients with serious or life-threatening conditions will undergo evaluation, including consultation with various stakeholders such as regulated industries, patient advocacy groups, disease research foundations, and academic medical centers. The amendments to section 506(b) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act encourage innovative approaches for product assessment under accelerated approval, while maintaining safety and effectiveness standards."
