The \"Child Care Quality Incentive Act of 2001\" highlights findings on early brain development, emphasizing the importance of quality early care and education for children's cognitive abilities, classroom behavior, and long-term success. Approximately 13,000,000 children, including 6,000,000 infants and toddlers, receive child care daily, but a study in 4 States found that only 1 in 7. Only 1 in 7 child care centers promote healthy development, while 1 in 8 threaten children's safety. Full-day child care costs $4,000 to $10,000 per year. Federal assistance is limited, making child care unaffordable for many families with a monthly income under $1,200. Many families struggle to afford child care, with costs consuming 25% of income for those earning under $1,200 monthly. Low payment rates for child care providers impact the quality of care and accessibility for families. Low payment rates for child care providers affect the quality of care for children, leading to reduced staff, lack of training, and fewer educational activities. Children in low-quality child care may experience delays in reading and language skills, as well as show more aggression. Increasing payment rates can improve the quality of child care by allowing providers to attract and retain staff. Increasing payment rates for child care providers can lead to higher quality care, attracting qualified staff, providing salary increases and professional training, maintaining a safe environment, and purchasing necessary supplies. The purpose of this Act is to enhance the quality and accessibility of child care by raising payment rates. Incentive grants are provided to improve the quality of child care. Funding for improving the quality of child care is authorized with $500,000,000 appropriated for fiscal year 2002. Funding of $500,000,000 is appropriated for fiscal year 2002 for grants under section 658H of the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act. Amendments are made to the use of block grant funds under section 658E(c)(3) and the establishment of the program under section 658G(a). Amendments are made to the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 to exclude section 658H from certain provisions and establish a program to improve the quality of child care. \"Grants are provided to enhance child care quality under section 658H.\" The Secretary will use funds to make grants to eligible States for child care services based on market rates surveys conducted within the past 2 years. To be eligible for a grant under this section, a State must have conducted a market rates survey for child care services within the past 2 years and submit an application as specified. To apply for a grant under this section, a State must submit an application to the Secretary with required information, including details of the market rates survey and the State's plan. The State must submit an application with market rates survey details and a plan to increase payment rates in accordance with survey results to be eligible for an annual payment under this section. To receive an annual payment under this section, a State must show progress in maintaining increased payment rates through assisted activities and conduct a survey update every two years. Additionally, the State must agree to provide matching funds to be eligible for a grant under this section. To be eligible for a grant under this section, a State must agree to contribute at least 25 percent of the costs from State sources towards the activities outlined in subsection (d).

The State must contribute at least 25 percent of the costs in cash for the grant, excluding Federal Government funds. The allotted amount for eligible States will follow the same distribution as specified in section 658O(b). Funds received must be used to increase child care assistance payment rates. The State can significantly increase child care assistance payment rates up to the 100th percentile of the market rate survey. If the State achieves this rate, they can use grant funds for activities that enhance the quality of child care services. The State can use grant funds to enhance the quality of child care services without supplanting other funds. Each eligible State must submit evaluations to the Secretary as required. The Secretary requires information from States on efforts to increase payment rates for child care and their impact on quality and accessibility. Biennial reports to Congress will include data on State progress in maintaining increased payment rates.
