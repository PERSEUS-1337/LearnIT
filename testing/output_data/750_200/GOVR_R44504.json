    "content": "Under the OCSLA, the DOI must create five-year programs for oil and gas lease sales in U.S. waters, balancing energy supply and environmental protection. BOEM leads the program development process, which involves multiple drafts for public review and comment. The program development process for oil and gas lease sales in U.S. waters involves examining all available leasing areas, narrowing down selections based on economic and environmental analysis, and submitting the final program to the President and Congress for approval. The planning process includes a programmatic environmental impact statement (PEIS) as required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The planning process for oil and gas lease sales in U.S. waters includes a programmatic environmental impact statement (PEIS) required by NEPA. Public comments from stakeholders are addressed in both the PEIS and the five-year program itself. The Administration cannot revise a finalized program without restarting the process. The Administration cannot revise a finalized program without restarting the process. BOEM released the final version of its oil and gas leasing program for 2017-2022 on November 18, 2016, which was approved by former Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell on January 17, 2017. Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell approved the final program on January 17, 2017, which includes 11 lease sales on the OCS. The program was revised from earlier versions, with no lease sales in the Atlantic or Pacific regions. Leasing decisions in BOEM's five-year programs can impact coastal states and the nation's economy and environment. The leasing decisions in BOEM's five-year programs, approved by Secretary of the Interior, can impact the economy and environment of coastal states and the nation. Congress plays an active role in the planning process, with Members influencing the program through public comments, oversight hearings, and potential legislation. The 114th Congress influenced the proposed program for 2017-2022 through public comments, oversight hearings, and potential legislation. The report discusses the history, legal framework, development process, and analysis of BOEM's offshore oil and gas leasing programs. Congress's role in oversight and legislation related to the 2017-2022 program is also highlighted. The report discusses Congress's role in oversight and legislation related to the 2017-2022 offshore oil and gas leasing program. In 1953, Congress enacted laws addressing jurisdiction and rights off the coasts of the United States. The Submerged Lands Act grants coastal states rights to regulate subsurface oil and gas exploration within 3 geographical miles. The Submerged Lands Act and the OCSLA define coastal states' rights and jurisdiction over offshore oil and gas exploration. The OCSLA aims for orderly development of OCS resources while maintaining environmental safeguards and competition. Congress expanded offshore activities post-OCSLA adoption. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act Amendments of 1978 added new provisions to the OCSLA, including Section 18 mandating the creation of an OCS leasing program to meet national energy goals while ensuring environmental protection and competitive bidding. The Lands Act Amendments of 1978 added Section 18 to the OCSLA, requiring the creation of a leasing program to meet national energy needs for a five-year period. This program has guided offshore oil and gas exploration since 1980. Congress has made additional changes to offshore exploration, such as the Deep Water Royalty Relief Act of 1995. Congress has taken actions to alter offshore oil and gas exploration, including the Deep Water Royalty Relief Act of 1995 and the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006. These measures aimed to encourage exploration in deep water and certain regions of the Gulf of Mexico while sharing revenues with Gulf states. Starting in 2008, Congress made further changes. The statutory framework governing BOEM's development of a five-year offshore oil and gas leasing program includes the OCSLA, NEPA, and the Coastal Zone Management Act. Section 18 of the OCSLA mandates the Secretary of the Interior to prepare and periodically revise the leasing program. Section 18 of the OCSLA requires the Secretary of the Interior to prepare and periodically revise an oil and gas leasing program to meet national energy needs for a five-year period, considering economic, social, and environmental values of the OCS resources. Section 18 of the OCSLA mandates the Secretary of the Interior to manage the OCS in a way that considers economic, social, and environmental values, including the impact of oil and gas exploration on marine, coastal, and human environments. This involves scheduling exploration and production based on various factors like geographical, geological, and ecological characteristics, environmental considerations, industry interest, and relevant laws and goals. The OCSLA mandates the Secretary of the Interior to manage the OCS considering economic, social, and environmental values. This involves scheduling exploration and production based on factors like geographical, geological, and ecological characteristics, industry interest, and relevant laws and goals. The five-year program must strike a balance between environmental considerations, industry interest, and state laws. It must also assure fair market value for leased lands and rights conveyed by the Federal Government, and include estimates on appropriations and staffing needs. The OCSLA mandates consultation requirements during the preparation of the five-year program, including input from federal agencies, the Attorney General, the Federal Trade Commission, and state governors. The Secretary of the Interior may also consult with local government officials in affected states before finalizing the proposed program. The OCSLA mandates consultation with federal agencies, state governors, and local government officials in affected states during the preparation of the five-year program. The Secretary must submit the proposed program to governors for comments at least 60 days before publication in the Federal Register. Additionally, the Attorney General and the Federal Trade Commission can provide input on potential competition effects. The proposed program must also be submitted to Congress and the President at least 60 days before approval, with an explanation for any specific recommendations. The Secretary must submit the proposed program to Congress and the President at least 60 days before approval, along with an explanation for any specific recommendations. The Secretary can approve a final five-year program after completing these steps. The OCSLA allows for revisions to the program at any time, with significant revisions requiring a process similar to the initial approval. The Secretary's responsibilities under the OCSLA are carried out by BOEM. The Secretary of the Interior's responsibilities for the five-year program under the OCSLA are carried out by BOEM. BOEM follows regulations for consultation requirements, including requesting input from governors of affected states. The proposed program is published in the Federal Register as part of the planning process. The OCSLA and applicable regulations guide the five-year planning process, with other federal statutes like NEPA and CZMA also playing a role. NEPA requires federal agencies to assess environmental impacts of major actions, often through an environmental assessment. The process for compliance with environmental requirements includes an environmental assessment (EA) to determine if an action significantly affects the environment. If a proposed action is deemed a major federal action without an EA, an environmental impact statement (EIS) is prepared. BOEM assumes the significance of the impact of its five-year programs and prepares a programmatic EIS (PEIS) concurrently. BOEM prepares a programmatic EIS (PEIS) alongside its five-year programs to assess environmental impact. States under the CZMA are encouraged to enact coastal zone management plans for habitat and resource protection. Approved state programs can receive federal assistance. State coastal zone management programs approved by the Secretary of Commerce are eligible for federal assistance. These programs designate conservation measures, permissible land and water uses, and address water pollution sources. The CZMA also mandates federal compliance with state programs, with BOEM regulations considering state coastal management in leasing program development. The regulations require BOEM to consider the relationship between a state's coastal zone management program and OCS oil and gas activity. BOEM's development of a five-year program involves multiple drafts for review by state governors, federal agencies, Congress, and the President. The development of a five-year program for OCS oil and gas activity involves multiple drafts for review by state governors, federal agencies, Congress, and the President. Each step of the process includes public comment and environmental review, leading to individual lease sales and exploration plans. The development of a five-year program for OCS oil and gas activity involves multiple drafts for review, public input, and environmental analysis. The initial draft proposes lease sales in planning areas, which are then narrowed down in the next version for further review by BOEM. The proposed program (PP) undergoes targeted analysis by BOEM, with potential removal of proposed sales but no addition of new sales. The final plan may also see removal of proposed sales without new additions, following specific steps starting with a Request for Information (RFI) published in the Federal Register. BOEM initiates development of a new five-year program by publishing a Request for Information (RFI) in the Federal Register to gather input on energy needs, leasing interests, environmental concerns, and public feedback. The RFI for the 2017-2022 leasing program was published on June 16, 2014, and received over half a million comments. BOEM published a draft proposed program (DPP) for lease sales in the upcoming five-year period, analyzing all OCS planning areas and identifying areas proposed for lease sales. The DPP for 2017-2022 was released on January 29, 2015, with a comment period closing on March 30, 2015. BOEM published a draft proposed program (DPP) for lease sales in the 2017-2022 period, with a comment period closing on March 30, 2015. The DPP received over 1 million comments and a notice of intent (NOI) for a programmatic environmental impact statement (PEIS) was also issued. BOEM published a proposed program (PP) for lease sales in the 2017-2022 period, refining locations and timing based on OCSLA factors and public comments. The PP was submitted to Congress, state governors, and federal agencies for review and public comment. A draft PEIS analyzing OCS areas was also released. The BOEM published the Proposed Program (PP) for lease sales in the 2017-2022 period, accompanied by a draft PEIS. The final document, Proposed Final Program (PFP), is based on analysis of OCSLA factors and public comments, submitted to the President and Congress for a 60-day review period. The Proposed Final Program (PFP) for lease sales in the 2017-2022 period is announced in the Federal Register and submitted to the President and Congress for a 60-day review period. Congress does not have an approval role, but the review period could allow for legislation that may influence the program. The final PEIS is also published, analyzing the proposed leasing areas, and submitted to the President and Congress. The final PEIS for the 2017-2022 program was released on November 18, 2016. The final PEIS for the 2017-2022 program was released on November 18, 2016. The Secretary of the Interior may approve the PFP, which then becomes final. Former Secretary Sally Jewell approved the final program on January 17, 2017. The 2012-2017 five-year program was submitted to Congress by the Obama Administration under Secretary Ken Salazar's direction, reflecting their policies on offshore energy development. Previous submissions dating back to 1980 have also been discussed, showing the evolution of offshore oil and gas leasing policies under different presidential administrations. The 2012-2017 five-year program submitted to Congress under Secretary Ken Salazar reflected Obama Administration policies on offshore energy development post-Deepwater Horizon oil spill. It included 15 proposed lease sales, with 11 held by late November 2016. The 2007-2012 program was prepared under Secretary Dirk Kempthorne during the George W. Bush Administration. The George W. Bush Administration submitted the 2007-2012 five-year program to Congress under Secretary Dirk Kempthorne's direction. It reflected policies on energy production and environmental protection, with a schedule of 21 sales. The Obama Administration later resubmitted the program in 2010 with a revised schedule of 16 sales, approving the leasing program after a review period. Eleven of the 16 sales were conducted before the program expired. The 2002-2007 OCS oil and gas leasing plan was submitted to Congress in 2002 under former Secretary of the Interior Gale Norton. It consisted of a schedule of 20 lease sales, 15 of which were held before the program expired in June 2007. The 1997-2002 OCS oil and gas leasing program was submitted to Congress in 1996 under former Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt, listing 16 sales, with 12 held before the program expired in June 2002. The 1992-1997 program was presented in 1992 under former Secretary of the Interior Manuel Lujan, with a schedule of 18 sales, and 12 held before the program expired in June 1997. The 1982-1987 OCS oil and gas leasing program, presented in 1982 under former Secretary of the Interior James Watt, aligned with Reagan Administration's energy policies. It included 41 sales, with 23 held before the program expired. The 1980-1982 OCS oil and gas leasing program was proposed under former Secretary of the Interior Cecil D. Andrus, aligning with President Carter's energy policies. It consisted of 36 sales, with 12 held before the program expired in June 1980. The 1980-1982 OCS oil and gas leasing program was proposed under former Secretary of the Interior Cecil D. Andrus, with 36 sales planned, 12 of which were held before the program expired in June 1980. Prior to 1980, the domestic program for oil and gas leasing spanned almost 30 years, with over 3,000 tracts leased from October 1954 to September 1980. In November 2016, BOEM released the final version of its offshore oil and gas leasing program for 2017-2022, scheduling 11 lease sales in specific regions of the OCS. The final 2017-2022 oil and gas leasing program schedules 11 lease sales in specific regions of the OCS, including the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska. U.S. offshore crude oil production accounted for 16% of total production in FY2015. In FY2015, U.S. offshore crude oil production represented 16% of total production, a decrease from FY2010 when it accounted for 31%. Offshore production volumes declined by 12% during this period, while total U.S. crude production increased by 73% to 9.4 million barrels per day. Offshore natural gas production also decreased, accounting for 4% of total production in FY2015 compared to 9.5% in FY2010. Offshore natural gas production volumes fell by nearly 50% between FY2010 and FY2015, while U.S. total annual natural gas production rose by more than 30%. The surge in total U.S. crude oil and natural gas production is due to increased production of shale gas and shale oil in various unconventional onshore formations. Increased U.S. oil production has reduced imports, primarily from OPEC countries. The increased U.S. oil production from onshore shale oil plays has reduced imports, particularly from OPEC countries. As of November 1, 2016, there were 917 producing offshore oil and natural gas leases on 4.5 million acres of the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). The Central Gulf of Mexico accounted for the majority of these leases. In a low oil and natural gas price environment, the demand for new offshore leases may be impacted. In a low oil and natural gas price environment, the demand for new offshore leases in the Central Gulf of Mexico may be soft, impacting future production levels. The Energy Information Administration anticipates lower domestic investment in oil and gas projects over the 2015-2020 period. ONRR estimates show a decrease in bonus bid revenues from offshore leasing in the next five fiscal years compared to previous periods. For example, FY2015-FY2019 bonus bid revenues were estimated at around $1 billion annually, but recent estimates are lower. The Office of Management and Budget's crude oil price estimates decreased from $80-$90 per barrel in FY2015 to $50-$60 per barrel in FY2017. Despite the impact of low oil prices on new investment, offshore crude oil production on federal lands is expected to continue contributing significantly to the U.S energy supply. The EIA projects that offshore crude oil production will remain important. Offshore crude oil production in the Gulf of Mexico is expected to reach record levels of 1.91 mbd in 2017 due to new deepwater oil projects. Energy diversification, including oil and gas production in the Gulf of Mexico, remains vital for meeting the country's energy needs. Oil and gas exploration and production are ongoing. Oil and gas exploration and production in the Gulf of Mexico are vital for meeting the country's energy needs. The process involves stages of data collection to determine the volume of resources present. Once oil or gas is discovered, it is measured within pools or fields and reported as reserves to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Reserves have been reported for U.S. OCS areas that have been developed. The U.S. OCS has 4.3 billion barrels of proven oil reserves and 16 Tcf of dry gas, mainly in the Central and Western Gulf of Mexico. No reserves have been reported along the Atlantic OCS, and only modest oil reserves are found on the Alaska OCS. The U.S. OCS has estimated undiscovered technically recoverable resources (UTRR) of 89.9 billion barrels of oil and 327.5 Tcf of natural gas, with the Gulf of Mexico holding the majority of these resources. Alaska's UTRR estimates are concentrated in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas. BOEM considers resource potential when preparing its five-year programs under the OCSLA. BOEM must consider resource potential, environmental, and socioeconomic impacts when preparing five-year programs under the OCSLA. Some U.S. OCS areas were unavailable for leasing in the 2017-2022 program due to presidential withdrawals, congressional moratoriums, or protected status. These areas included parts of the Eastern and Central Gulf of Mexico. Areas in the Eastern and Central Gulf of Mexico and certain ocean areas in the Alaska region were unavailable for oil and gas leasing in the 2017-2022 program due to presidential withdrawals and congressional moratoriums. In the Alaska region, areas like the North Aleutian Basin, Hanna Shoal in the Chukchi Sea, and Barrow and Kaktovik whaling areas in the Beaufort Sea were affected by withdrawals from future oil and gas leasing activities. National marine sanctuaries and monuments in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Gulf of Mexico were also protected from leasing. President Obama made additional withdrawals under the OCSLA in December 2016. In December 2016, President Obama made additional withdrawals under the OCSLA, including much of the U.S. Arctic from leasing disposition for an indefinite time period and certain areas of the Atlantic Ocean associated with major canyons. These withdrawals did not directly affect the 2017-2022 program. The President's December 2016 withdrawals under the OCSLA included the U.S. Arctic and certain areas of the Atlantic Ocean. These withdrawals did not impact the 2017-2022 leasing program directly but would affect future leasing considerations. BOEM's tailored leasing strategy evaluates each U.S. ocean region based on various criteria such as resource potential, infrastructure, environmental concerns, and state interests. BOEM considered factors like oil and gas potential, infrastructure, environmental issues, and state interests when planning lease sales. The final program includes 11 lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska regions, with no sales in the Atlantic or Pacific regions. Previous proposals for an Atlantic sale and two Alaska sales were not included in the program. The final program includes 11 lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska regions, with no sales in the Atlantic or Pacific regions. The Gulf of Mexico is the most mature region with abundant oil and gas resources, accounting for 97% of all U.S. offshore production. The program offers almost half of the undiscovered oil and gas resources on the U.S. OCS. The Gulf region, including Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, and Alabama, accounts for 97% of U.S. offshore oil and gas production. Majority of lease sales in the 2017-2022 program are scheduled in the Gulf region, with 10 out of 11 proposed sales. The region includes three BOEM planning areas: Western Gulf, Central Gulf, and Eastern Gulf, with some areas closed to leasing due to congressional moratorium. For the 2017-2022 program, BOEM has replaced area-specific sales in the Gulf with region-wide sales to provide greater flexibility to industry. This change allows for more frequent opportunities to bid on lease blocks and better planning for exploring resources that may straddle the U.S.-Mexico border. The 2017-2022 program by BOEM includes fewer lease sales in the Gulf, with some Members of Congress expressing concerns about the decrease. BOEM attributes this to the consolidation of area-specific sales in the Gulf, providing more flexibility to industry. Interest in exploring for offshore oil and gas in the Alaska region of the U.S. OCS has grown due to decreased summer polar ice, allowing for longer drilling seasons, and estimates of substantial undiscovered resources in Arctic waters. Interest in exploring for offshore oil and gas in the Alaska region of the U.S. OCS has increased due to decreased summer polar ice, allowing for a longer drilling season. Estimates of substantial undiscovered resources in Arctic waters have also fueled this interest. Challenges such as severe weather, perennial sea ice, and lack of infrastructure for extraction and transportation continue to hinder new exploration efforts. Stakeholders, including the State of Alaska and some Members of Congress, are pushing to expand offshore oil and gas activities in the region. Stakeholders, including the State of Alaska and some Members of Congress, are divided on expanding offshore oil and gas drilling in the Arctic. The Obama Administration supported exploration while also implementing safety regulations to prevent oil spills. BOEM included lease sales in three planning areas of the Alaska region in the 2012-2017 program. In the 2012-2017 program, BOEM planned lease sales in the Beaufort Sea, Chukchi Sea, and Cook Inlet regions of Alaska. However, due to market conditions and low industry interest, Chukchi and Beaufort Sea lease sales for 2016 and 2017 were canceled. Subsequent drafts for 2017-2022 initially included sales in all three regions but were later revised to only include a sale in Cook Inlet. BOEM initially planned lease sales in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas but ultimately decided to only retain the sale for Cook Inlet. Factors considered included significant hydrocarbon resources, state support, existing lease opportunities, unique Arctic ecosystem, industry interest, and market conditions. BOEM noted a declining industry interest in Arctic OCS due to low oil prices and Shell's unsuccessful drilling in the Chukchi Sea in 2015. Active leases on the Arctic OCS decreased by over 90% between February and November 2016 as companies gave up leases rather than incur costs. Leases on the Arctic OCS declined by over 90% between February and November 2016 as companies relinquished acquired leases to avoid continued investment costs. BOEM stated that industry interest in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas may increase post-2017-2022. The two Arctic lease sales were deemed unnecessary due to the current strength of the domestic energy supply. President Obama later withdrew portions of the Arctic OCS from future leasing consideration. President Obama withdrew large portions of the Arctic OCS from future leasing consideration for an indefinite time period, excluding areas not overlapping with scheduled Alaska lease sales. The final program for 2017-2022 also excluded a lease sale in the Atlantic region, which would have been the first since 1983 due to congressional bans on Atlantic leasing. Since 1983, there has been a lack of oil and gas activity in the Atlantic region due to congressional bans and presidential moratoria on offshore leasing. Changes in 2009 allowed for potential lease sales, but as of December 2016, no Atlantic lease sale has occurred. As of December 2016, no Atlantic lease sale has taken place despite changes in regulations allowing for potential sales. Certain parts of the Atlantic are under presidential moratorium, while other areas in the region are available for leasing. BOEM analyzed various factors for the Atlantic region in the 2017-2022 program, including resource potential, infrastructure needs, ecological and safety concerns, and competing uses by the Department of Defense. The BOEM analyzed factors for the Atlantic region in the 2017-2022 program, including resource potential, infrastructure needs, ecological and safety concerns, and competing uses by the Department of Defense. Initially, a lease sale was planned for a portion of the Mid- and South Atlantic planning areas in 2021, but it was later removed due to strong local opposition, conflicts with other ocean uses, and current market dynamics. BOEM removed the Atlantic sale in the PP due to strong local opposition, conflicts with other ocean uses, current market dynamics, and careful consideration of comments from affected states' Governors. Conflicts with existing uses like tourism, fishing, shipping, and Department of Defense and NASA activities were cited. The lack of offshore mineral production history in the Atlantic raised concerns about drilling. The Gulf of Mexico has a history of offshore mineral production, while the Atlantic has little history, causing concerns about drilling. BOEM decided not to hold an Atlantic lease sale in 2017-2022 due to increased onshore oil and gas production meeting national energy needs. The 2017-2022 program does not include lease sales for the Pacific region, where no federal oil and gas lease sales have been held since 1984. Despite lifting leasing restrictions in FY2009, California, Oregon, and Washington governors still oppose offshore oil and gas leasing in the Pacific region. The governors of California, Oregon, and Washington continue to oppose offshore oil and gas leasing in the Pacific region. Congress can influence the Administration's development of a five-year program through public comments, oversight hearings, and introducing legislation. Congress reviews each finalized program under the OCSLA, but direct approval is not required. Congress can influence the Administration's five-year program through public comments, oversight hearings, and legislation. The 114th Congress pursued influence over the 2017-2022 program, and the 115th Congress may also address it. Stakeholders can submit comments on draft programs, with BOEM receiving 15 for the 2017-2022 program. Members of Congress, state governors, agencies, and the public can submit comments on draft five-year programs. For the 2017-2022 program, BOEM received comments opposing or supporting lease sales and addressing issues like seismic testing in the Atlantic. The public comments on draft five-year oil and gas leasing programs can include support for proposed lease sales, requests for expanded lease areas and more sales. BOEM considers these comments when developing successive drafts, with each version including a summary of previous comments and BOEM's responses. The House or Senate may hold oversight hearings to review the proposed program. After BOEM releases a draft five-year oil and gas leasing program, the House or Senate may hold oversight hearings to evaluate it. These hearings inform legislative decision-making and allow Members to express their views. For example, the House held a hearing on the 2017-2022 program in April 2015, discussing issues like lease sales, Arctic and Atlantic leasing, and seismic surveying. The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee also held a hearing on the program in May 2016. On May 19, 2016, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee discussed the PP version of the program, focusing on targeted lease sales in Alaska and the removal of the Atlantic lease sale from the 2017-2022 program. Congress can modify upcoming programs through legislation, such as adding or removing lease sales or making broader changes. Legislation in the 114th Congress aimed to impact the 2017-2022 oil and gas leasing program, with bills like H.R. 1487 and S. 791 proposing to use an earlier draft program for 2010-2015. This draft program would have included 31 lease sales, but the bills specified that 3 of them would not be part of the program. The proposed legislation in the 114th Congress aimed to impact the 2017-2022 oil and gas leasing program by using an earlier draft program for FY2015-FY2020. The bills would have required BOEM to conduct lease sales, including one in the Atlantic region, and declared the program approved under NEPA without further environmental review. The bills in the 114th Congress aimed to impact the 2017-2022 oil and gas leasing program by deeming the FY2015-FY2020 program approved under NEPA. H.R. 1663 would have added lease sales for various regions and declared the final program approved under NEPA. The bill, H.R. 3682, aimed to amend the OCSLA by requiring BOEM five-year programs to make at least 50% of available unleased acreage in OCS planning areas with significant oil and gas resources available for leasing. It also included state revenue-sharing provisions and required the inclusion of OCS planning areas with substantial oil and gas reserves in the programs. The bill, H.R. 3682, aimed to amend the OCSLA by requiring BOEM five-year programs to make at least 50% of available unleased acreage in OCS planning areas with significant oil and gas resources available for leasing. It also included state revenue-sharing provisions and required the inclusion of OCS planning areas with substantial oil and gas reserves in the programs. Additionally, the bill would have mandated BOEM to develop five-year programs with the goal of increasing oil and gas production by 2032. The bill, H.R. 4749, would have required BOEM to finalize a leasing program for 2016-2021, including lease sales in the Atlantic region, South Carolina, and Southern California. It also included provisions for revenue sharing with states and the organization of DOI ocean energy agencies. Additionally, the bill directed the Secretary to conduct a lease sale off of North Carolina within two years of enactment, with subsequent annual lease sales in the area for the following five years. The bill directed the Secretary to conduct a lease sale off of North Carolina within two years of enactment, with subsequent annual lease sales in the area for the following five years. S. 1276 and S. 2011 would have amended the OCSLA for BOEM to lease areas with the largest undiscovered technically recoverable resources, including certain oil and gas areas. Additionally, the bills would have reduced the Eastern Gulf of Mexico leasing moratorium and added Eastern Gulf lease sales to the 2017-2022 program. The bills aimed to reduce the Eastern Gulf of Mexico leasing moratorium, add Eastern Gulf lease sales to the 2017-2022 program, and include state revenue-sharing and other offshore energy provisions. S. 1278 would have required BOEM to conduct lease sales in Alaska's Cook Inlet and a portion of the Beaufort Sea planning area annually. The bill aimed to include the South Atlantic planning area in the 2017-2022 program, with lease sales scheduled for FY2021 and FY2022. It also required extending existing leases in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas to 20 years and revenue sharing with Alaska. The bill required the Secretary to include the South Atlantic planning area in the 2017-2022 program and conduct lease sales in FY2021 and FY2022. It also addressed conflicts with military operations, consultations with state governors, and surveys of resources. The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources held a hearing on the bill. Another bill would have included lease sales in the Beaufort, Chukchi, and Cook Inlet planning areas for FY2017 through FY2023. The bill proposed lease sales in the Beaufort, Chukchi, and Cook Inlet planning areas for FY2017 through FY2023, with increased revenue sharing for Alaska and changes to lease terms. The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources held a hearing on the bill in September 2016. The final version of each five-year program must be submitted to Congress for a 60-day review period before approval by the Secretary of the Interior. During the 60-day review period, Congress can introduce legislation to alter the program, as seen in the 112th Congress with H.R. 6082 proposing additional lease sales in various regions. The 114th Congress considered legislation to change the lease sale schedule for the 2017-2022 program, with potential for further changes in the 115th Congress."
