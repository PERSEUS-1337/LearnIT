    "content": "The EPA believes there should be a higher rate of NSR permits for new or expanded facilities. The CAA requires preconstruction review and permits for major modifications or new sources of air pollution. States with EPA-approved SIPs must approve construction or modifications to ensure compliance with NAAQS. Applicants must demonstrate that the project will not violate NAAQS to receive a \"Permit to Construct.\" The \"Permit to Construct\" is required from the state agency to ensure compliance with NAAQS. The New Source Review (NSR) process is triggered for any new source emitting 100 tons annually of any criteria air pollutant or less in some areas. The NSR process is triggered for new sources emitting 100 tons annually of any criteria air pollutant or less in some areas. NSR requirements depend on whether the sources are subject to PSD or non-attainment provisions. PSD sources must install Best Available Control Technology (BACT) determined on a case-by-case basis, while non-attainment sources have specific requirements. The NSR process requires new sources emitting 100 tons annually of any criteria air pollutant to comply with PSD or non-attainment provisions. PSD sources must install BACT, while non-attainment sources need to meet LAER requirements. Few preconstruction permits have been issued to coal-fired power plants under NSR, despite the program's broad coverage. The lack of permits for new construction in the U.S. coal-fired electric generating capacity of 300,000 MW has remained steady for the last ten years. Emissions trends for electric utilities show NOx emissions from coal-fired facilities have remained constant over the same period. Emissions of NOx from coal-fired electric generating facilities have remained constant over the last ten years. In contrast, SO2 emissions dropped significantly in 1995 due to the acid rain control program under title IV of the 1990 CAA Amendments. 111 powerplants were required to reduce emissions by about 30% from baseline levels, resulting in a reduction from 10 million tons to 5.3 million tons of SO2 emissions in 1995. Additionally, many units installed Low-NOx burners to reduce NOx emissions. The acid rain control program under title IV of the 1990 CAA Amendments led to significant reductions in SO2 emissions from powerplants, with emissions decreasing from 10 million tons to 5.3 million tons in 1995. Low-NOx burners were also installed to reduce NOx emissions. However, some of the reductions achieved under title IV were offset by increases in emissions from other plants, as indicated by emissions data. The acid rain control program led to a 4.7 million ton reduction in SO2 emissions by 1995, but overall emissions only decreased by 3.6 million tons. Similarly, NOx emissions were reduced by 0.4 million tons by 1996, but the overall reduction was only about 0.1 million tons. This discrepancy is due to phase 1 not covering all coal-fired facilities, leading to some sources of increasing emissions despite relatively flat trends in coal-fired capacity and air emissions. The operation of existing coal-fired facilities continues to drive coal-fired generation. Despite the lack of new plant construction, coal-fired electricity generation and coal consumption have increased over the past decade due to utilities optimizing performance of existing facilities. Contrary to expectations, utilization of coal-fired capacity has risen, and the efficiency of units has not decreased. The increase in coal-fired electricity generation over the past decade has led to utilities spending more on maintaining their coal-fired capacity. This raises questions about whether these efforts constitute routine maintenance or major modifications under the CAA. The restructuring of the electric utility industry has led to a focus on plant economics, raising questions about whether maintenance on coal-fired facilities constitutes routine maintenance or major modifications under the CAA. Utilities may avoid using the term \"life extension\" for spending on old power plants, despite the goal of extending their operational life. Many utilities avoid using the term \"life extension\" for spending on old power plants due to the Clean Air Act of 1970, which can impact emissions regulations for grandfathered plants. The Clean Air Act of 1970 can impact emissions regulations for grandfathered plants, as they can lose their exemption if modified or reconstructed in a major way. There is considerable regulatory activity related to electricity generation and air quality, including the Ozone Transport Rule, Section 126 Petitions, Regional Haze Rule, new NAAQS for Fine Particulates, revised Ozone NAAQS, NSPS for NOx for electric utilities, initiatives by the Ozone Transport Commission, and legislative initiatives. Adding NSR enforcement to the list is important as NSR is the primary permitting vehicle for stationary sources. The Department of Justice/EPA lawsuits under NSR are aimed at enforcing existing laws and regulations, separate from regulatory development activities. EPA has clarified that NSR enforcement is not connected to other regulatory initiatives mentioned earlier. The enforcement action under NSR is not linked to other regulatory activities. It stems from an examination of coal-fired utilities starting in late 1996. NSR allows EPA to impose penalties and require affected sources to install the latest pollution control technology, such as flue-gas desulfurization units. The EPA enforcement actions under NSR involve meeting reduction requirements by installing FGD units on coal-fired boilers and SCR units for NOx emissions. These control devices could reduce emissions by 70-90%, leading to substantial reductions in SO2 and NOx emissions. The powerplants named in the lawsuits would emit 2.2 million tons of SO2 and 0.66 million tons of NOx. Administrator Browner highlighted the potential for significant reductions in SO2 and NOx emissions from powerplants through EPA controls. These reductions could amount to an 85 to 95 percent decrease in pollutants, equivalent to removing 26 million cars from the road and reducing acid rain by 15 percent. The focus on NSR reflects a belief in the long-term impact of aging coal-fired plants. The focus on NSR reflects the belief that extending the life of aging coal-fired plants is a cost-effective alternative to building new capacity in the restructured electric utility industry. Requiring BACT on these facilities through NSR could mitigate environmental effects, with the EPA taking legal actions against utilities. The EPA is taking legal actions against utilities for maintenance activities approved for decades, aiming to enforce NSR on existing coal-fired electric generating facilities. This trend of renovating coal-fired capacity has been increasing for almost two decades, with potential emissions impacts recognized early on. The EPA faced challenges enforcing NSR on existing coal-fired electric generating facilities due to budget constraints and the definition of a major modification. The term \"modification\" was first used in the 1970 CAA Amendments with respect to the NSPS program. The EPA defined modification as any physical or operational change that increased the emission of air pollutants from a stationary source. Replacing existing components exceeding 50% of the fixed capital costs of a new facility also triggered NSPS regulations. The EPA defined modification as any change increasing emissions from a stationary source. NSR regulations focus on compliance with NAAQS and PSD, with thresholds set at 40 tons for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. Enforcement of these thresholds has proven challenging. Enforcing EPA's NSR thresholds for the NSPS program has been challenging. Most life extension efforts by utilities do not exceed these thresholds as they mainly improve availability and reliability, not capacity. NSR review is triggered by an increase in pollutant output, which is likely with life extension projects. The EPA enforced NSR thresholds for life extension projects due to potential increases in emissions compared to pre-project levels. The 1988 ruling against Wisconsin Electric Power Company highlighted the challenge of measuring these changes. The EPA modified NSR regulations in 1992 for electric utilities, changing the emissions trigger from \"actual to potential\" to \"actual to future actual\" comparison. Actual emissions are based on a 2-year average before the modification, while future actual emissions are projected after the change. The EPA modified NSR regulations in 1992 for electric utilities, changing the emissions trigger from \"actual to potential\" to \"actual to future actual\" comparison. Emissions equal the facility's average emission rate during a 2-year period out of the preceding 5 years before the proposed change. Future actual is the product of the facility's projected emission rate after the change and its projected actual utilization based on historical and other data. Utilities responded to EPA's interest in their life extension activities by adjusting their practices to meet the new regulations. Utilities have adjusted their practices in response to EPA regulations on life extension activities, with a shift towards integrating these efforts into routine maintenance schedules. The term \"life extension\" has been replaced with terms like capital improvement and rehabilitation program. The distinction between \"modification\" and \"routine maintenance\" in facilities' operation and maintenance schedules is blurred by integrating life extension efforts. The Justice Department's lawsuits aim to enforce Clean Air Act requirements for coal-fired capacity construction and modifications by investor-owned utilities. EPA has issued a \"Compliance Order\" regarding modifications by Tennessee Valley Authority's coal-fired power plants that should have triggered new source reviews. Tables identify facilities violating NSR requirements and types of rehabilitations considered modifications by EPA. The EPA has identified violations of NSR requirements at investor-owned facilities, seeking injunctive relief and civil penalties. Complaints may be modified to add new allegations, with penalties of up to $25,000 per day of violation. Defendants are required to comply with CAA requirements, remedy past NSR violations by installing BACT, and apply for permits. The EPA's enforcement action requires defendants to comply with CAA requirements, remedy past NSR violations by installing BACT, and audit operations for NSR compliance. TVA is asked to develop a schedule for meeting requirements, audit coal-fired power plants for NSR compliance, and retire SO2 allowances. The industry's response has focused on an exemption under NSR. The industry's response to EPA's enforcement action has focused on an exemption under NSR for \"routine maintenance.\" Industry argues that EPA has never explicitly defined this phase, and activities triggering NSR were well-publicized in journal articles and government reports. Industry accuses EPA of changing the rules. Industry argues that EPA is changing the rules by citing routine maintenance activities as violating NSR, claiming these activities are necessary for plant operation and should not trigger major modification criteria. The EPA Administrator announced that controlling sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides from power plants could lead to an 85 to 95 percent reduction in these pollutants. This reduction would amount to 1.87 million tons of SO2 emissions. The EPA Administrator announced that controlling sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides from power plants could lead to an 85 to 95 percent reduction in these pollutants. This would result in a reduction of 1.87 million tons of SO2 emissions and 0.63 million tons of NOx emissions. The cuts in emissions would more than compensate for the erosion in the original reductions, with SO2 reduced by 50% more than the slippage and NOx reduced by double the slippage. Further reductions are expected as more utilities install BACT or retire offending facilities. At first glance, substantial emission reductions could be achieved by EPA's NSR action. However, the CAA is complex, and reductions under NSR would interact with reduction requirements under title IV for SO2 emissions. Title IV limits total SO2 emissions from utilities to 8.9 million tons, enforced through tonnage limitations at individual existing facilities. The EPA's title IV program limits total SO2 emissions from utilities to 8.9 million tons through tonnage limitations at individual facilities. Allowances are issued by the EPA for emitting a ton of SO2. The EPA created a emissions allowance system for SO2, where allowances are authorized to emit a ton of SO2. These allowances can be used at the allocated plant, traded, or banked. The program has 100% compliance but does not integrate well with the NSR program from the 1977 CAA Amendments. The NSR program focuses on existing facilities and SO2, while Title IV is a program to reduce aggregate SO2 emissions with flexibility for utilities. NSR ensures compliance with individual plant standards, while Title IV compliance is based on a cap. The current SO2 NSPS sets the \"floor\" for BACT or LAER determination. The current SO2 NSPS sets a percentage reduction requirement for SO2 emissions, which can be met with low-sulfur coal under Title IV. Facilities installing BACT under NSR may have excess allowances available for sale due to overcontrol of SO2 under Title IV. The current SO2 NSPS sets a percentage reduction requirement for SO2 emissions, which can be met with low-sulfur coal under Title IV. Facilities installing BACT under NSR may have excess allowances available for sale due to overcontrol of SO2 under Title IV. Any reductions achieved through NSR enforcement could be negated if the affected plant sells its SO2 reduction to a facility not covered by NSR. Title IV does not allow for adjustments in allowance allocations based on NSR enforcement, as allocations are determined by historical data. To avoid this issue, Congress would need to change the law or utilities would have to voluntarily surrender excess allowances created by NSR. The interaction between NSR and the NOx NSPS is complex. The NOx NSPS historically lagged behind in technology development until the new standard was set in 1998. The standard set in 1979 could be met with simple combustion modifications or low-NOx burners. Congress or utilities would need to address the issue of excess allowances created by NSR to prevent negating reductions achieved through enforcement. In 1998, EPA set a new NOx NSPS for coal-fired facilities at 0.15 lb. of NOx per million Btu, a standard more aligned with available technology. However, this standard was challenged in court, leading to the D.C. Court of Appeals vacating the new NOx NSPS for modified utility boilers in September 1999. The D.C. Court of Appeals vacated the new NOx NSPS for modified utility boilers in September 1999, returning the standard to the 1979 level. The uncertainty surrounding the floor for BACT or LAER for modified coal-fired sources could lead to less significant reductions than anticipated by the EPA. The confusion surrounding the NOx reduction programs under title IV and NSPS standards could result in less significant reductions than expected by the EPA. The title IV NOx program is based on emission rates for existing facilities, with more stringent limitations compared to the NSPS program. The rate limitation for most boilers under title IV is 0.45 to 0.5 lb. per million Btu, more stringent than the 1979 NOx NSPS. Existing coal-fired facilities have emission controls since 1995 that are stricter than the existing NSPS. BACT determinations from 1991-1995 show permitted emission rates ranged from 0.15 to 0.5 lb. per million Btu, making it difficult to project current NOx reduction. EPA is enforcing NSR requirements to reduce emissions, believing some sources are evading statutory rules. However, concerns arise about whether this will lead to emission reductions or just costly litigation. The Clean Air Act's NSR provisions aim to control emissions from existing sources, but newer methods like title IV have proven more efficient in reducing SO2 and NOx emissions from utility plants. Title IV, implemented in 1990, significantly reduced SO2 and NOx emissions from utility plants. The program had 100% compliance and outperformed NSR in its first year. EPA lawsuits suggest NSR compliance has been low, while title IV started without delays. One alternative is to expand title IV's successful cap and trade program. One alternative to address NSR enforcement issues is to lower the cap on SO2 emissions from coal-fired powerplants, building on the success of title IV's cap and trade program. Lowering the existing cap by about two-thirds could achieve similar emission reductions as all existing powerplants meeting the 1978 standards. EPA lawsuits may take years to resolve with uncertain outcomes. Lowering the existing cap on SO2 emissions from coal-fired powerplants by about two-thirds could achieve similar emission reductions as all existing powerplants meeting the 1978 standards. Utilities would have flexibility in achieving reductions, potentially through a new \"cap and trade\" program for NOx to eliminate uncertainties in EPA initiatives. This would require new legislation and could offer administrative and cost advantages over current enforcement methods. Implementing a regional cap and trade program for NOx emissions could address uncertainties in EPA initiatives and compliance plans, offering administrative and cost advantages over current enforcement methods. EPA is urging states to consider this approach as part of its proposed Federal Implementation Plan. Implementing a regionwide cap and trade program for NOx emissions may require extraordinary cooperation between affected states or new EPA authority. Alternative approaches include focusing on SO2 and NOx emissions through other regulatory initiatives such as the OTR, Section 126 petitions, fine particulate NAAQS, and regional haze rule. The EPA has implemented regulations like the fine particulate NAAQS and regional haze rule to reduce SO2 and NOx emissions, but their long implementation schedules delay significant reductions until after 2010. Another option is to control pollutants like mercury and carbon dioxide from coal-fired power plants without needing additional legislative authority. Initiating controls on pollutants from coal-fired power plants, such as mercury and carbon dioxide, could also reduce emissions of SO2 and NOx. Currently, CO2 is not classified as an air pollutant under the CAA, while regulation of mercury emissions is slow due to EPA's determination process. EPA claims authority to regulate CO2 under the CAA, but this is controversial. EPA has authority to regulate CO2 under the CAA, but it's controversial. CO2 reductions may come from voluntary initiatives or ratification of the Kyoto Protocol. Reforming NSR could involve defining \"modification\" based on plant age, simplifying the trigger. New legislation could classify any electric utility facility over 40 years old as a modification. Reforming NSR may involve defining \"modification\" based on plant age, including electric utility facilities over 40 years old. EPA has been considering reforms for years, including proposed \"off-ramps\" like the \"Clean Unit Exclusion\" for units with state-of-the-art pollution control technology. The EPA is proposing a \"Clean Unit Exclusion\" for units with state-of-the-art pollution control technology, defining a \"clean unit\" as one that has installed BACT or LAER within the last 10 years. However, the effectiveness of this proposal is debatable due to the need for legislative or regulatory finalization, which could be time-consuming and problematic. The EPA is considering cap and trade programs for pollutants as an alternative to the problematic NSR regulations. Replacing NSR with a cap could offer the same environmental protection at a lower cost and greater benefit. The debate on NSR has focused on \"grandfathered\" power plants. The Clean Air Act of 1970, as amended in 1977 and 1990, has a loophole that allows older coal-burning power plants to emit significantly more pollution than new plants. Industry lobbyists argued that requiring expensive retrofits for these older plants would be wasteful as they were expected to retire soon, but many are still operating decades later. Many older coal-burning power plants are still operating without environmental controls, despite being built in the 30s, 40s, 50s, and 60s. The term \"grandfathered powerplant\" is used in debates on emissions, indicating if a plant is covered under Section 111 of the Clean Air Act, which requires minimum controls for new sources. Section 111 of the Clean Air Act, passed with the 1970 Clean Air Act Amendments, mandates the EPA to establish New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for new sources like power plants. These standards require major new sources to use the best emission reduction technology proven by the EPA. NSPS regulations currently cover sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter. \"Grandfathered\" refers to older coal-fired power plants built before NSPS regulations took effect. The term \"grandfathered\" refers to older coal-fired power plants built before NSPS regulations took effect in 1971 and revised in 1979. These plants are not subject to NSPS requirements but must meet emission rate limits established by a State Implementation Plan (SIP). However, the term \"grandfathered\" becomes ambiguous when considering pollutants like carbon dioxide (CO2) and mercury (Hg) that are not criteria air pollutants. The term \"grandfathered\" in the context of NSPS regulations is ambiguous and potentially meaningless for certain pollutants like carbon dioxide and mercury. EPA reviews NSPS every eight years, leading to increased stringency for covered pollutants as technology advances. This ambiguity arises because there is no set baseline for what power plants are considered \"grandfathered.\" The term \"grandfathered\" in NSPS regulations is ambiguous due to the lack of a set baseline. For example, most coal-fired power plants are considered \"grandfathered\" for NOx emissions. Title IV of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments changed regulations for existing power plants regarding SO2 and NOx, sometimes imposing stricter requirements than NSPS. The regulations under title IV for existing sources are more stringent than some existing NSPS. For example, \"grandfathered\" power plants had to meet stricter NOx standards in 1995 than new power plants. Similarly, in 2000, \"grandfathered\" coal-fired power plants had to meet SO2 standards equivalent to or more stringent than the 1971 NSPS for SO2. The term \"grandfathered\" becomes meaningless in these cases as the focus should be on fuel source rather than plant age. If the focus of debate about \"grandfathered\" powerplants is NOx emissions, then age of plant is not relevant \u2013 fuel source is. Coal-fired facilities, regardless of age, are the focus for increasing NOx controls. For SO2 emissions, the title IV emissions cap is the key consideration, with age factoring into allocation of emission credits. NSPS for SO2 for new powerplants is different in some aspects. The NSPS for SO2 for new powerplants is effectively nil as all new sources must offset their emissions under the cap. Shrinking the current cap on SO2 is the most logical approach for reducing emissions from electric generating facilities. A cap on NOx emissions is also a logical extension to address transported pollution programs in the Northeast. EPA favors this approach. The EPA favors reducing NOx emissions from electric generating facilities to address transported pollution programs in the Northeast. The WEPCO decision sparked public debate and congressional oversight, similar to the DOJ/EPA actions on NSR. Interpretations of CAA provisions and the need for new legislation to bring consistency to NSR provisions are key issues raised. Many alternatives for addressing NSR issues would require new legislation amending the Clean Air Act to bring consistency to the provisions and update the regulation of the electric utility industry's environmental impact."
