Congress found that in 1995, the Senate voted to impose a moratorium on US use of anti-personnel landmines, and in 1996, senior retired US military officers urged the President to ban the production and use of these landmines, stating it would be humane and militarily responsible. In Vietnam, 7,318 US military personnel were killed and 56,783 injured by landmines. In Bosnia, at least 204 soldiers under UN command and 55 soldiers under NATO command were injured or killed by landmines. The Department of State estimates the impact on civilians. Soldiers under NATO command have been injured and 9 killed by landmines. The Department of State estimates that a person is killed or injured by a landmine every 22 minutes. President Clinton declared aggressive pursuit of an international agreement to ban anti-personnel landmines. The Organization of American States declared the goal of a Western Hemisphere landmine free zone. On June 4, 1997, the Organization of African Unity adopted the goal of establishing Africa as an anti-personnel landmine free zone.

On December 10, 1996, the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution to vigorously pursue a ban on landmines. The United States-sponsored resolution passed by a vote of 156-0 (with 10 abstentions) to pursue a treaty banning anti-personnel landmines.
