    "content": "The Administration requested $39.510 billion for DHS in FY2013, a slight decrease from the previous year. The overall estimated DHS budget for FY2013 is $681 million below the budget for FY2012. The Senate Committee on Appropriations reported its version of the FY2013 DHS Appropriations bill on May 22, 2012. The Senate Committee on Appropriations reported its version of the FY2013 DHS Appropriations bill on May 22, 2012 by a vote of 27-3. The bill would have provided a net discretionary appropriation of $39,514 million for DHS for FY2013, excluding funds for overseas contingency operations and disaster relief. This amount was slightly above the Administration's request and $87 million below the previous year's funding. The Senate-reported bill for FY2013 DHS Appropriations provided slightly above the Administration's request, with a net discretionary appropriation of $39,514 million. The House passed H.R. 5855 with amendments, resulting in a net discretionary appropriation of $39,114 million for DHS. Funding for certain activities was 27% below the requested level due to offsets from management accounts. The floor amendments reduced funding for DHS activities by 27% below the requested level. Increases were proposed for Customs and Border Protection, Coast Guard, FEMA, and grant programs. The President signed a continuing resolution into law on September 28, 2012, allowing the federal government to continue operations through March 27, 2013, at an annualized rate of $1.047 trillion. The continuing resolution (CR) passed in September 2012 allowed the federal government to operate until March 27, 2013, at a rate of $1.047 trillion annually. It was signed into law as the FY2013 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, including $39.646 billion for the Department of Homeland Security. The FY2013 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act provided $39.646 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority for DHS. Two across-the-board cuts reduced the discretionary budget authority by $52.4 million. After sequestration, $38.348 billion was available for DHS to use according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Fiscal Year 2013 Post-Sequestration Operating Plan. Data for FY2012 amounts are from the President's Budget Documents and H.Rept. 112-492. The FY2013 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act provided $39.646 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority for DHS, with $38.348 billion available after sequestration according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Fiscal Year 2013 Post-Sequestration Operating Plan. Data for FY2012 amounts are from the President's Budget Documents and H.Rept. 112-492, while information on FY2013 is from various sources including the President's Budget Documents, Congressional Budget Justifications, and Appropriations bills. The FY2013 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act provided $39.646 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority for DHS, with $38.348 billion available after sequestration. Information on the continuing resolution and final resolution of FY2013 appropriations for the department comes from various sources including H.J.Res. 117, P.L. 113-6, and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Fiscal Year 2013 Post-Sequestration Operating Plan. Historical funding data used in the appendices are taken from the Analytical Perspectives volume of the FY2006-FY2014 President's Budget request documents. All amounts in this report are in budget authority and rounded to the nearest million. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred functions, funding, and personnel to the Department of Homeland Security. Appropriations for DHS are typically organized into five titles, including funding for various offices and departments within the agency. All amounts in budget request documents are in budget authority and rounded to the nearest million. Title II of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 contains appropriations for various departments including Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Transportation Security Administration, Coast Guard, and Secret Service. Title III includes funding for National Protection and Programs Directorate, Office of Health Affairs, and Federal Emergency Management Agency. Title IV covers U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and Science and Technology. Title IV of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 includes appropriations for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), the Science and Technology Directorate (S&T), and the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC). Title V contains general provisions providing congressional direction to the department, with additional titles sometimes added for special issues like emergency appropriations for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF). The structure of the bill may not be symmetrical between House and Senate versions. The FY2012 House full committee mark-up added a sixth title for a $1 billion emergency appropriation for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF). The Senate version had no additional titles. Differences in the structure of subcomponents and accounts were noted in the proposed FY2013 appropriations bills. The maximum budget authority for annual appropriations, including DHS, is determined through a two-stage congressional budget process. The congressional budget process determines maximum budget authority for annual appropriations, including DHS, through a two-stage process. Congress sets overall spending totals in the first stage, known as 302(a) allocations, which are then allocated among appropriations committees for enactment in annual appropriations bills. In the second stage, appropriations committees allocate the discretionary funds among subcommittees for each bill. In the second stage of the budget process, appropriations committees allocate 302(a) discretionary funds among subcommittees for each appropriations bill. These allocations, known as 302(b) allocations, must not exceed the 302(a) allocation to enforce budget discipline. Adjustments to 302(b) allocations can be made during the year by the Appropriations Committee as appropriations bills progress towards final enactment. The Budget Control Act established discretionary spending caps for FY2012 and FY2013, including a separate cap of $686 billion for security spending. The Appropriations Committee adjusts suballocations as appropriations bills progress towards final enactment. The Budget Control Act set spending caps for various programs, including Defense, Veterans Affairs, international affairs, nuclear security, and intelligence. Other spending was limited to $361 billion out of a total of $1.047 trillion. Adjustments were allowed for overseas operations, emergency spending, disaster relief, and healthcare fraud control. The Budget Control Act set spending caps for various programs, including Defense, Veterans Affairs, international affairs, nuclear security, and intelligence. Other spending was limited to $361 billion out of a total of $1.047 trillion. Adjustments were allowed for overseas operations, emergency spending, disaster relief, and healthcare fraud control. In the absence of a budget resolution for FY2013, these levels became the basis for enforcement in the Senate and the House. The Budget Control Act also established a Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to develop a federal deficit reduction plan, but automatic spending reductions were triggered when legislation was not enacted by the deadline. The Budget Control Act of 2011 set spending caps for various programs, including Defense, Veterans Affairs, international affairs, nuclear security, and intelligence. An automatic spending reduction process was triggered when deficit reduction legislation was not enacted by January 15, 2012, leading to across-the-board spending cuts at the account and program level to achieve equal budget reductions from both defense and nondefense funding. The Budget Control Act of 2011 set spending caps for various programs, triggering automatic spending cuts when deficit reduction legislation was not enacted by January 15, 2012. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2013 made changes to the procedures in the BCA, delaying the joint committee sequester implementation and adjusting the dollar amount of the sequester. The joint committee sequester implementation was delayed until March 1, 2013, with a $24 billion reduction in the dollar amount. President Obama ordered the sequester to be implemented as per the Budget Control Act, resulting in discretionary spending caps being lowered for FY2013 and FY2014. Sequestration was applied at the program, project, and activity level within each account. Sequestration was implemented at the program, project, and activity level within each account, with reductions calculated on an annualized basis. The post-sequestration numbers in the report are derived from the FY2013 DHS operating plan, which only includes resources provided through P.L. 113-6. The report does not address the sequestration of resources provided in P.L. 113-2. The report discusses the sequestration of resources provided in P.L. 113-6 to eliminate any excess budget authority. Section 3001 of the act includes across-the-board rescissions for \"nonsecurity\" and \"security\" budget authority at the program level. DHS falls under the \"security\" category. Section 3004 of the act includes across-the-board rescissions for \"nonsecurity\" and \"security\" budget authority at the program level. DHS falls under the \"security\" category and receives a 0.1% across-the-board cut to align with FY2013 discretionary spending limits. The Office of Management and Budget has the final say on exceeding spending limits. Section 3004 of the act includes across-the-board rescissions for \"nonsecurity\" and \"security\" budget authority at the program level. OMB calculated additional rescissions of 0.032% of \"security\" budget authority and 0.2% of \"nonsecurity\" budget authority would be required to avoid exceeding limits. These cuts aim to reduce discretionary budget authority in the bill. The across-the-board cuts in the bill aim to reduce discretionary budget authority, excluding funding for Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terror and disaster relief under the Budget Control Act. DHS's initial 302(b) allocations for FY2013 are shown in Table 2. The DHS's appropriations process for FY2013 includes adjustments based on three justifications outlined in the BCA: emergency spending, overseas contingency operations, and disaster relief. The allowable adjustment for disaster relief is determined by OMB using a specific formula. The DHS's appropriations process for FY2013 includes adjustments based on three justifications outlined in the BCA: emergency spending, overseas contingency operations, and disaster relief. The allowable adjustment for disaster relief is determined by OMB using a specific formula. For FY2013, OMB determined the allowable adjustment for disaster relief to be $11,779 million, which was fully exercised, including $6,400 million in pre-sequestration resources through the FEMA Disaster Relief Fund in P.L. 113-6. The FY2013 DHS appropriations process included adjustments based on three justifications outlined in the BCA. OMB determined the allowable adjustment for disaster relief to be $11,779 million, with $6,400 million utilized from the FEMA Disaster Relief Fund in P.L. 113-6. The Administration proposed a 0.5% pay increase for all civilian federal employees in its budget request. The House rejected the proposed 0.5% pay increase for civilian federal employees, resulting in a slight reduction in appropriations for civilian salaries in DHS. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding the pay raise, but current appropriations bills do not provide resources for it. The DHS bill does not offer transparency on where resources are allocated. Table 4 and Figure 1 display DHS's budget breakdown for FY 2013 by component size. The data includes adjustments for disaster relief and overseas operations under the Budget Control Act. The DHS bill includes adjustments for disaster relief and overseas operations under the Budget Control Act, impacting the budget allocation. The bill's general provisions include rescissions of prior-year budget authority, reducing the net budget authority in the act. The discretionary budget authority provided in P.L. 113-6 is scored against the bill's budget allocation, with additional resources available under adjustments to the discretionary budget cap. The DHS bill includes adjustments for disaster relief and overseas operations under the Budget Control Act, impacting the budget allocation. The right column shows additional resources available under adjustments to the discretionary budget cap, including funding provided in P.L. 113-2, the Supplemental Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013. It is important to note that much of DHS's budget is not derived from discretionary appropriations, with some components relying on fee income or offsetting collections. The DHS budget is not primarily funded through discretionary appropriations, with some components relying on fee income or offsetting collections. Less than 4% of CIS's budget comes from direct appropriations, with the rest from fee income. Figure 2 compares the Administration's FY2013 budget request with the enacted budget, showing discretionary appropriations, mandatory appropriations, and adjustments under the Budget Control Act. The FY2013 DHS budget includes discretionary and mandatory appropriations, as well as adjustments under the Budget Control Act. The funding also includes amounts from the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013. Table 5 presents DHS appropriations for FY2003 through FY2013. Table 5 presents DHS appropriations for FY2003 through FY2013 in current dollars, not adjusted for inflation or sequestration. The amounts represent enacted amounts at the start of the next fiscal year's appropriation cycle, with exceptions noted for FY2009 and FY2011. Alternative sources are used when previous year's data are not reflected in the report. The House and Senate marked up DHS appropriations bills early in 2012, with P.L. 113-6 being enacted later than usual. Figure 3 illustrates the timing of the bills through various stages. The DHS appropriations bills for FY2013 went through various stages in the legislative process. The House-passed bill proposed a decrease in funding for management activities, A&O account, and OIG, while the Senate-reported bill suggested a lower amount compared to the Administration's request. The DHS appropriations bill for FY2013 proposed a decrease in funding, with the enacted amount being $1,086 million, reduced further to $1,026 million due to sequestration. The enacted amounts for individual components of Title I for FY2012, the Administration's request for FY2013, House-passed and Senate-reported appropriations, and post-sequester level of available resources from P.L. 113-6 reported by DHS are listed in Table 6. The departmental management accounts cover general administrative expenses of DHS, including the Office of the Secretary and Executive Management (OSEM) and the Under Secretary for Management. The Office of the Secretary and Executive Management (OSEM) includes 12 entities reporting directly to the Secretary, along with the Under Secretary for Management (USM) and its components. The Administration typically requests funding for headquarters consolidation. A graphic representation of discretionary appropriation follows in each section. The discretionary appropriation provided to each element of DHS is represented graphically for quick reference. FY2013 requests compared to FY2012 enacted appropriations show changes in funding for OSEM, USM, and OCFO. The FY2012 enacted appropriations for departmental management activities in Title I included $134 million for OSEM, $222 million for USM (a decrease of $14 million), $55 million for OCFO (an increase of $5 million), and $313 million for OCIO (an increase of $55 million). The total request was $724 million, excluding $89 million for the consolidation of DHS headquarters at St. Elizabeths. The Administration's budget proposed $134 million for OSEM, with separate line items for the Office of International Affairs and the Office of State and Local Law Enforcement. The Administration requested $134 million for OSEM, with separate line items for three offices currently funded under the Office of Policy. Two program changes funded through this request were for the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman: $135,000 for a training program and over a million dollars for policy advice, investigations, and training related to ICE Secure Communities and 287(g) programs. The Administration requested over a million dollars for the Immediate Office of the Under Secretary for Management (OUSM) to provide policy advice, investigations, and training related to ICE Secure Communities and 287(g) programs. This includes an increase of $441,000 for the transfer of the Directives function. The Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer (OCHCO) includes $26 million for salaries and expenses and $10 million for Human Resources Information Technology, with a requested increase of almost $2 million for realigning the Safety function. The Administration requested $55 million for the Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO), including $6.7 million for the Financial Systems Modernization effort to implement a new core financial system at the Federal Emergency Management Agency in FY2013. This new system is necessary to accurately account for, track, and report on FEMA resources. The Administration requested $313 million for the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) in FY2013, with $122 million allocated for Infrastructure and Security Activities, including $65 million for data center migration activities for CBP, TSA, and USCIS. This migration is crucial for achieving the Department's consolidation to two data centers. The House Appropriations committee recommended decreased funding for management activities under Title I in H.R. 5855 compared to the President's request, with a total funding of $627 million, representing a decrease of $97 million or 13.4%. This would enable continued closures of major Component data centers and achieve the Department's consolidation to two data centers. The House Appropriations committee recommended reduced funding of $627 million for management activities under Title I in H.R. 5855, a decrease of $97 million or 13.4% from the President's request. The reductions were justified by the committee due to the need to cover unrealized funding proposals and failure to comply with statutory requirements. Amendments were offered during floor consideration of the bill to use departmental management accounts as offsets. During floor consideration of the bill on June 6, 2013, several amendments were passed to reduce the budget for departmental management by almost $33 million. The largest amendments included decreasing funds for the Office of the Under Secretary for Management and increasing funds for the Federal Emergency Management Agency Urban Search and Rescue Response System and State and Local Programs. During the bill's floor consideration on June 6, 2013, amendments were passed to reduce the budget for departmental management by $33 million. This included decreasing funds for the Office of the Under Secretary for Management and increasing funds for various programs such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency State and Local Programs, U.S. Customs and Border Protection Security Fencing, Infrastructure, and Technology, and Firefighter Assistance Grants. During the bill's floor consideration on June 6, 2013, amendments were passed to reduce the budget for departmental management by $33 million. This included decreasing funds for the Office of the Under Secretary for Management by $5 million and increasing funds for Firefighter Assistance Grants by $5 million, agreed to by voice vote. The amendments would have left the USM with an appropriation of $180 million, $41 million (18.6%) less than the requested level. See Table 7 for additional detail. Within OSEM, funding of up to $45,000 was recommended for official reception and representation expenses, of which $17,000 was for international programs within the Office of Policy and activities related to the visa waiver program. These reception and representation expenses were the target of an amendment offered by Representative Flake, who proposed using the funds to increase U.S. Customs and Border Protection Salaries. During the bill's floor consideration on June 6, 2013, amendments were passed to reduce the budget for departmental management by $33 million. This included decreasing funds for the Office of the Under Secretary for Management by $5 million and increasing funds for Firefighter Assistance Grants by $5 million, agreed to by voice vote. The amendments would have left the USM with an appropriation of $180 million, $41 million (18.6%) less than the requested level. Representative Flake proposed using funds from official reception and representation expenses to increase U.S. Customs and Border Protection Salaries by $43,000. Additionally, provisions withheld $71 million from obligation until all required reports for the FY2014 budget request were submitted, and a general provision proposed to bar the use of Coast Guard-operated fixed wing aircraft by the Secretary of DHS. The committee received requests, including a provision to restrict the use of Coast Guard-operated aircraft by certain officials until key reports are submitted. $5 million in funding for the Office of General Counsel was proposed to be withheld until a security regulation is published. Over $124 million in funding would be withheld until all required reports are submitted for the USM appropriation. Under the USM appropriation, more than $124 million would have been withheld from obligation until all required reports are submitted. The House Appropriations Committee recommended a reduction of $7 million for OCPO and over $29 million for OCFO for failure to comply with statutory requirements. The House Appropriations Committee recommended withholding funds until all required reports are submitted. They also stated that appropriations liaisons in OCFO should not serve as intermediaries between committees and department components. The House-recommended appropriation for the Office of the Chief Information Officer is $242 million. The House Appropriations Committee recommended a $242 million appropriation for the Office of the Chief Information Officer, with $117 million for salaries and expenses and $125 million for development and acquisition of IT equipment. Additionally, $27 million was allocated for Information Technology Services and $55 million for Security Activities. The committee supported the migration of resources to the Department's data centers but did not approve the proposed $65 million. The House report supported the migration of resources to the Department's data centers but did not approve the proposed $65 million for the migration due to budget shortfalls. The Senate-reported bill would have provided slightly less funding for various departments compared to the President's request. The Senate-reported bill would have provided $655 million for departmental management, a decrease of $69 million (9.5%) from the President's request. The bill included a programmatic increase for the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties to ensure compliance with civil rights statutes and constitutional requirements. The Senate committee-recommended budget for the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (OCRCL) was decreased by roughly $1 million (3.5%) from FY2012 levels, despite an increase in funding to ensure compliance with civil rights statutes and constitutional requirements. The committee report also highlighted the discontinuation of funding for the DHS historian and recommended filling the position again using funds provided in FY2013. Funding for reception and representation expenses was reduced by 15% for FY2012. The committee report recommended reducing funding for reception and representation expenses by 15% for FY2012 and proposed a further 10% reduction for FY2013 due to budget constraints. The report also suggested filling the position of the DHS historian using funds provided in FY2013 for robust oversight of major acquisitions, workforce development, and security measures. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended reducing funding for various DHS offices due to budget constraints, focusing resources on critical operational missions. The OCHCO would receive $35 million, $1 million below the request, with a reduction in the Salaries and Expenses account. The OCIO would receive $248 million, with $121 million for salaries and expenses and $127 million available through FY2015. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended an appropriation of $248 million for the OCIO, with $121 million for salaries and expenses and $127 million for technology investments through FY2015. This includes $57 million for IT equipment, software, and services, and $65 million for data center migration. The committee report highlighted that data center consolidation investment is expected to save nearly $3 billion by 2030. The committee report highlighted that investment in data center consolidation is expected to save nearly $3 billion by 2030. The law provides appropriations for OSEM, USM, OCFO, and OCIO, with funding totaling $643 million, a decrease of $170 million or 21% from the President's request. OCIO was the only management account subject to funding according to the DHS Operating Plan. The DHS Operating Plan allocated $643 million for management accounts, with OCIO facing a funding reduction due to sequestration. The reduction was based on a part-year appropriation under P.L. 112-175, with a crediting mechanism outlined in 2 USC 903 to mitigate sequestration impact. P.L. 113-6 included directives for the DHS CIO. See Table 7 for more funding details. The DHS Operating Plan allocated $643 million for management accounts, with OCIO facing a funding reduction due to sequestration. P.L. 113-6 included directives for the DHS CIO to submit a multi-year investment and management plan for information technology acquisition projects funded under the CIO. The Senate's explanatory statement also directs the Secretary to provide a report on travel costs for trips taken by the Secretary and Deputy Secretary from FY2008 to present. The Secretary must report all costs of official and nonofficial travel for trips taken by the Secretary and Deputy Secretary from FY2008 to present. The Secretary also needs to submit a contingency plan to address gaps in user fee collections as mandated in the FY2010 DHS appropriations conference report. Additionally, the USM must provide a Comprehensive Acquisition Status Report (CASR) with the President's FY2014 budget proposal. The FY2014 budget proposal requires DHS to submit a Comprehensive Acquisition Status Report (CASR) and quarterly updates to appropriations committees. A detailed report on the balanced workforce strategy and justification for insourcing or outsourcing initiatives must be included in the President's annual budget request. The CFO will continue providing semiannual briefings on financial systems modernization efforts. Funding levels for existing management accounts are outlined in Table 7. The CFO will continue providing semiannual briefings on financial systems modernization efforts, with funding levels outlined in Table 7. Funding numbers for P.L. 113-6 reflect spending cuts, but the \"DHS Plan\" column shows budgetary resources after sequestration. The department may undertake transfers and reprogramming to mitigate sequestration impacts. The department is likely to undertake transfers and reprogramming to mitigate the impact of sequestration. Issues identified include the Administration's proposal for separate line items under OSEM for three offices, new revenue assumptions in the budget, chronic lateness in submitting required plans and reports, and conference spending. The Administration's budget proposed separate line items for three offices - the Office of International Affairs (OIA), the Office of State and Local Law Enforcement (SLLE), and the Private Sector Office (PSO) - currently funded under the Office of Policy. The proposal to have these offices report directly to the OSEM was rejected during the legislative process, with concerns raised about lack of Senate-confirmed heads and the impact on departmental streamlining efforts. The House committee report opposes a proposal to have international affairs, state and local law enforcement, and private sector offices report directly to the Office of the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. They suggest considering the establishment of an external affairs office to consolidate these functions. The Senate committee report highlights concerns about the lack of Senate-confirmed heads in these offices. The Senate committee report questioned the need for standalone offices of Legislative Affairs, Intergovernmental Affairs, and Public Affairs within the Department of Homeland Security, suggesting that these functions could be adequately performed within the Office of Policy. The Administration's budget proposed three legislative measures to increase the Department's budgetary resources, but the House rejected all three proposals. The House rejected three proposals related to customs fee revenues and CBP authority, while the Senate included them. The House committee report highlighted a budget shortfall of $115 million in the DHS budget due to assumptions dependent on new legislative authority. The House committee report highlighted a budget shortfall of $115 million in the DHS budget due to assumptions dependent on new legislative authority. The Committee rejects such budgetary legerdemain and warns of additional reductions to Department requests. The House committee report expressed concerns about budget shortfall in the DHS budget and warned of additional reductions to Department requests. P.L. 113-6 allowed CBP to initiate pilot projects for reimbursable agreements for customs services, but did not include other revenue provisions. The Committee will consider proposals enacted into law for drafting legislation, but until then, they will not be relevant to appropriations work. The committee report expressed concern about the Department of Homeland Security's late submission of required plans and reports to Congress, leading to a withholding of funding. The report criticized the Department for failing to comply with statutory requirements and emphasized the importance of investment and expenditure plans for better protection of the American people. The Committee expressed concern over the Department of Homeland Security's delayed submission of essential plans and reports, impacting funding. Delays in submitting expenditure plans have hindered the Department's ability to align program priorities with resources, compromising fiscal responsibility and oversight work. The Committee expects the Department of Homeland Security to comply with statutory requirements for timely submission of reports and plans. The Senate-reported bill proposed withholding 59% of budgets for OSEM, USM, and CFO until all required reports are submitted on time. The House provision in P.L. 113-6 withholds 20% of the budgets of OSEM, USM, and CFO until all required reports and plans are submitted on time. House floor action reduced the USM budget significantly, with 70% of the budget being withheld if provisions were to become law for FY2013. The House committee report requires the Department's Office of Inspector General to report on compliance with federal laws and regulations on travel, conferences, and employee awards programs within 30 days of the act's enactment. New provisions on conference spending were included in both House and Senate bills. The House and Senate bills included new provisions on conference spending. Both bills required a quarterly report to the DHS OIG on events costing over $20,000. The Senate also restricted the use of grants or contracts for unrelated conferences and non-compliant travel or conference activities. The House and Senate bills included provisions to limit funding for conferences unrelated to the original purpose of the grant or contract award, and to restrict travel or conference activities that do not comply with government-wide spending directives. Reporting on conference costs to departmental inspectors general or senior ethics officials was also required. The bills aimed to limit the number of employees attending overseas conferences to 50. The House and Senate bills aimed to limit the number of employees attending overseas conferences to 50, unless it is a training or operation conference for law enforcement. The Department of Homeland Security's headquarters occupies over 7 million square feet of office space. The Department of Homeland Security's headquarters occupies over 7 million square feet of office space in about 45 separate locations in the greater Washington, DC, area, which is a legacy of its rapid assembly from 22 federal agencies. This fragmentation is cited as a major contributor to inefficiencies, including time lost shuttling staff between elements, additional costs, and reduced cohesion among department components. The Department of Homeland Security's headquarters is spread across 45 locations in Washington, DC, leading to inefficiencies like lost time shuttling staff and increased costs. To address this, a $3.4 billion master plan was approved to create a new DHS headquarters at St Elizabeths in Anacostia, with $1.4 billion funded through DHS and $2 billion through GSA. $1,366 million has been invested in the project so far. The DHS headquarters project at St. Elizabeths in Anacostia is funded by $3.4 billion, with $1.4 billion from DHS and $2 billion from GSA. $1,366 million has been invested in the project so far through FY2012. Phase 1A, a new Coast Guard headquarters facility, is nearing operational status with funding from Congress. The Administration seeks funding for consolidating other DHS offices in the DC area to save on lease costs. The Administration requested $89 million for activities related to the St. Elizabeths DHS headquarters project, including funding for a highway interchange to handle increased traffic. This infrastructure element is not traditionally funded through Homeland Security appropriations but through the General Services Administration or Department of Transportation budgets. Additionally, $24.5 million was requested for the project. The Administration requested $24.5 million under the Coast Guard operating expenses budget for moving into its new facility in FY2013. No other funding requests for the DHS consolidated headquarters project were included in the budget submission to Congress. The House Appropriations Committee recommended no funding for the highway interchange or any part of the St. Elizabeths project through the management accounts. The House Appropriations Committee recommended no new construction funding for the Departmental Headquarters Consolidation expansion, which is $89 million below the request. Funding for the Coast Guard's move to the new facility was included in the bill, with an additional $10 million provided through the Coast Guard's construction budget. The bill does not include new construction funding for the Departmental Headquarters Consolidation expansion, $89 million below the request. Funding for the Coast Guard's move to St. Elizabeths is included in the bill, with additional funding for current project completion and site improvements. The Department is exploring options to modify or consolidate current leases. The Department is actively exploring options to modify or consolidate current leases in light of delays in headquarters construction. The Committee encourages continued efforts and requests progress updates within 90 days. $10,000,000 is allocated for Phase 1 construction to ensure the Coast Guard's ability to move in. The Committee allocates $10,000,000 for Phase 1 of construction for the Coast Guard to ensure timely completion and smooth access to the site. Minority views express concern over the lack of funding for necessary road and interchange improvements for DHS personnel to access the new headquarters. The new DHS headquarters project has faced delays and increased costs, with funding only allocated for the Coast Guard relocation. Phase 2 construction for DHS central headquarters and FEMA has no funding. No amendments were made for DHS headquarters consolidation. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $89 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $89 million for the highway interchange, funded under the Under Secretary for Management's office. Full funding was also recommended for the Coast Guard's move, but no funding was provided through the Coast Guard construction budget. An attempt to use the $89 million for the highway interchange as an offset for an unrelated amendment was made during full committee markup. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $89 million for the highway interchange, funded under the Under Secretary for Management's office. An attempt to use the $89 million for an unrelated amendment in full committee markup failed, and the funding remained in the reported version of the legislation. The committee noted that the Under Secretary must submit an expenditure plan within 90 days detailing how the funds will be allocated. The Under Secretary must submit an expenditure plan within 90 days detailing how funds for headquarters consolidation will be allocated. Quarterly briefings are required on consolidation activities, with an updated plan being developed to complete the project in smaller, more manageable segments. The Department is working on a consolidation project for headquarters in smaller, more manageable segments. An updated plan is expected to be completed by the end of summer 2012, detailing construction segments, resource requirements, and funding timelines. No funding was provided in P.L. 113-6 for this project. The Department of Homeland Security is allocated $29 million for necessary expenses related to the department headquarters project and mission support consolidation. The funds support the Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I&A) and the Office of Operations Coordination and Planning (OPS) for managing the DHS intelligence enterprise. The Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I&A) manages the DHS intelligence enterprise, collects, analyzes, and shares intelligence information with all DHS components, state, local, tribal, and private sector partners. It is part of the intelligence community and receives budget from the National Intelligence Program. The Office of Operations Coordination and Planning (OPS) develops and coordinates departmental and interagency operations plans, manages the National Operations Center for domestic incident management, operations coordination, and situational awareness. The Analysis and Operations account manages domestic incident management, operations coordination, and situational awareness by integrating various sources of information. The FY2013 budget request was $322 million, a decrease of $16 million from FY2012. H.R. 5855 proposed $317 million for the account, $4.5 million below the President's request. The recommendation was $21 million less than the FY2012 enacted amount. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended denying proposed increases in executive service salaries and funding for the Air Domain Intelligence Integration Element, while restoring funding for Cybersecurity Analysis. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $324 million for the Analysis and Operations account, a decrease of $14 million from FY2012. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $324 million for the Analysis and Operations account, a decrease of $14 million from FY2012. The Committee required DHS's Chief Intelligence Officer to submit an expenditure plan for FY2013 within 60 days of the appropriations bill enactment. The Committee directed DHS to focus the plan on I&A's functions that provide unique expertise or serve intelligence customers not supported by other components of the intelligence community. P.L. 113-6 provides $322 million for the Analysis and Operations account, the same as the President's FY2013 request and 4.7% below FY2012. The explanatory statement reiterated the House's rejection of increases for executive service salaries and the Air Domain. The FY2013 budget for DHS was $322 million, the same as the President's request and 4.7% lower than FY2012. The House rejected increases for executive service salaries and the Air Domain Intelligence Integration Element. Sequestration reduced the budget to $306 million, with concerns raised by some Members of Congress about I&A's mission. Some Members of Congress have raised concerns about I&A's mission, citing a lack of focus and vague authorities. Representative Sue Myrick highlighted these issues during a House hearing on DHS's role in the intelligence community. The Aspen Institute report suggested that DHS's intelligence activities should focus on specific homeward-focused areas to avoid duplication of efforts by other agencies. This includes directing the intelligence mission towards areas where DHS has inherent strengths and unique value that align with its legislative mandate. The DHS should focus its intelligence activities on areas where it has unique strengths and value that align with its legislative mandate, particularly in serving state/local partners not covered by other federal agencies. Concerns have been raised about potential duplication of intelligence efforts by other agencies, as highlighted in the requirement for DHS to provide an expenditure plan centered around I&A's functions. The DHS Office of the Inspector General is meant to be an independent body conducting audits. The DHS Office of the Inspector General (OIG) is an independent body that conducts audits and investigations to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse within the department. It ensures information technology security and makes recommendations on legislation. The OIG requested $144 million with an additional $2.6 million for fulfilling directives. The DHS Office of the Inspector General (OIG) requested $144 million, including $2.6 million for audits of states receiving FEMA grant funds. The House-passed bill allocated $109 million for the OIG, expressing dissatisfaction. The House-passed bill allocated $109 million for the DHS OIG, with a $10 million reduction due to dissatisfaction with communication on border corruption investigations. $24 million of the OIG's budget will be funded through a transfer from FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund for disaster-related audits and investigations. No changes were made to these provisions. The Senate-reported bill included $123 million for the DHS OIG, with $24 million to be funded from FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund for investigating corruption at CBP and ICE. This provided a net $3 million increase above the President's request. The committee report recommended additional funding for investigating corruption and criminal conduct at CBP and ICE, as well as completing audits mandated under P.L. 110-53 and grants under the Urban Area Security Initiative grants by August 20, 2014. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2013 provided $121 million in net budget authority for the OIG for FY2013, a $4 million increase from the previous year's appropriation. The FY2013 budget for the OIG saw a $4 million increase from the previous year's appropriation, totaling $121 million in net budget authority. Sequestration reduced the budget by $7 million, but a $24 million transfer from the Disaster Relief Fund aligned the resources with the President's request. The projected gross total resources for the OIG in FY2013 were $138 million, $3 million less than the FY2012 enacted levels. Both House and Senate bills required the OIG to conduct reviews and provide reports. The OIG's FY2013 budget was $138 million, $3 million less than FY2012. Both House and Senate bills required reviews and reports on various matters, including DHS expenditures, non-competitive contracts, and local law enforcement operations under 287(g) agreements. The House directed the OIG to report on DHS compliance with federal laws. The House directed the OIG to report on DHS compliance with federal laws, including procedures for travel, conferences, and employee awards programs, TSA screening inspections, adjudication fraud detection reforms, and FEMA's public assistance program delays. The Senate requested a review of FEMA's application of its own rules for awarding public assistance. The Senate directed the OIG to review FEMA's application of its rules for awarding public assistance funds for debris removal, as stated in Section 565 of Division D of P.L. 113-6. The House also requested reports on DHS compliance with federal laws, TSA screening inspections, and FEMA's public assistance program delays. The Senate directed the OIG to review FEMA's application of rules for awarding public assistance funds for debris removal in P.L. 113-6. The OIG's tasks represent new work, with no additional funding allocated except for integrity investigations of ICE and CBP officers. The Senate and House appropriations committees expressed concerns about the OIG's independence and timeliness in reporting results, directing GAO to review its organizational structure. The Senate directed the OIG to review its organizational structure and reporting functions to ensure independence and timely reporting. Concerns were raised about the OIG's large number of senior positions filled by officials in acting roles, potentially hindering its duties. The bill allocates funding for various agencies including U.S. Customs and Border Protection, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Transportation Security Administration, U.S. Coast Guard, and U.S. Secret Service. The requested budget for these accounts in FY2013 was $30,759 million, with the House-passed bill proposing $30,946 million and the Senate-reported bill suggesting $30,974 million. The enacted appropriations for Title II in FY2013 were $31,267 million, which was 1.7% higher than the requested level and 0.8% lower than FY2012. Sequestration reduced this amount to $30,184 million according to the operating plan for DHS. CBP is responsible for security at ports of entry, inspecting people and goods to prevent entry of terrorists. The enacted appropriations for Title II in FY2013 were $31,267 million, 1.7% higher than requested and 0.8% lower than FY2012, reduced to $30,184 million post-sequester. CBP officers at ports of entry inspect people and goods to prevent illegal entries into the United States. They enforce over 400 laws and regulations to ensure border security, including programs like Border Security Inspections and Trade Facilitation, Border Security and Control between Ports of Entry, Air and Marine Interdiction, Automation Modernization, and Border Security Fencing, Infrastructure, and Technology. The Border Patrol and Air and Marine Interdiction are part of the CBP's efforts to enhance border security through various programs and technologies. Funding for these initiatives in FY2012-FY2013 was affected by across-the-board spending cuts, but additional cuts required by sequestration were not reflected in the numbers. The DHS Plan column assesses post-sequester resources provided by P.L. 113-6 as of April 26, 2013, for CBP. The Administration requested $10,345 million in net budget authority for CBP for FY2013, an increase of $190 million over FY2012. The Administration requested $10,345 million in net budget authority for CBP for FY2013, an increase of $190 million over FY2012. The total request included $1,626 million in fees, mandatory spending, and trust funds, for a gross budget request of $11,971 million, which is a $320 million increase from FY2012. Program changes included transferring the US-VISIT program to CBP with a $261.5 million increase and a $31 million increase for the Automated Targeting System. Increase of $31 million for the operation and maintenance of the Automated Targeting System (ATS), $38.7 million for the Office of Intelligence and Investigative Liaison, $8 million for the National Targeting Center, $13 million for the Container Security Initiative, $10 million for intellectual property rights enforcement, and $3 million to expand CBP's Centers for. The curr_chunk discusses budget changes within CBP, including increases for intellectual property rights enforcement and Centers for Excellence and Expertise, and decreases in funding for Office of Air and Marine Interdictions and management and administration staffing. The curr_chunk outlines significant budget decreases in various areas within CBP, including staffing and services in management and administration, fleet acquisition and management, information technology infrastructure and support, and nonintrusive inspection operations and maintenance. The curr_chunk highlights budget decreases in CBP, including reductions in NII operations, officer overtime expenses, training expenses, and transportation program costs. The House approved $10,172 in net budget authority for CBP for FY2013, an increase of $17 million (0.2%) from last year's appropriation and a decrease of $173 million (1.7%) from the President's request. CBP would have received $11,689 in gross budget authority under the House-passed bill, a $37 million (0.3%) increase over last year's level and a $283 million (2.4%) decrease from the President's request. Amendments included adding $43,000 to CBP salaries and expenses. The Senate Appropriations Committee proposed $10,454 million in net budget authority for CBP for FY2013, with amendments including adding $43,000 to CBP salaries and expenses, $10 million to the BSFIT account for communications infrastructure in border communities, and cutting $3 million from the BSFIT appropriation. The Senate Appropriations Committee proposed $10,454 million in net budget authority for CBP for FY2013, with amendments including adding $43,000 to CBP salaries and expenses, $10 million to the BSFIT account for communications infrastructure in border communities, and cutting $3 million from the BSFIT appropriation. This would result in an increase of $299 million (3.0%) from last year's appropriation and of $109 million (1.1%) from the President's request. The Act of 2013 (P.L. 113-6) provides $10,356 million in net budget authority for CBP for FY2013, with a decrease in gross budget authority compared to the previous year. Sequestration further reduced CBP budget authority by approximately $575 million. Policy issues related to CBP were also discussed. The FY2013 budget plan for CBP projected total spending to be $11,298 million, $353 million less than FY2012. Policy issues included US-VISIT program, CBP staffing, customs user fees, border surveillance technology, and cargo security. Congress mandated an automated entry and exit data system for aliens. The Automated Entry and Exit Data System implemented by INS tracks the arrival and departure of foreign visitors to the United States, collecting biographic and biometric identification information. Biographic data is stored in the Arrival and Departure Information System (ADIS) database, while biometric data is stored in the Automated Biometric Identification System (IDENT) database. The DHS's entry-exit system stores entry-exit data in the ADIS database and biometric data in the IDENT database. This information is shared with various government agencies to identify potential risks. Non-citizens entering the US through air and seaports are required to provide biometric data. The system does not collect biometric data from non-citizens. Most non-citizens entering the United States through land ports are subject to secondary inspection and required to provide biometric data. However, the biometric exit system does not collect data from non-citizens exiting the US, with a focus instead on an enhanced biographic exit program and a U.S.-Canadian entry-exit system. The President's FY2013 budget did not include funding for a biometric exit system. The enhanced biographic exit program and integrated U.S.-Canadian entry-exit system involve sharing passenger manifest data with DHS to identify overstays and high-priority individuals for follow-up investigations. Citizenship and Immigration Canada provides biometric records of third country nationals entering Canada through land ports to DHS for monitoring. The U.S. entry-exit system involves sharing biometric records of third country nationals entering Canada with DHS for monitoring. Some Members of Congress are frustrated with the lack of a biometric exit system implementation. The system's place in the DHS organizational structure has changed multiple times since its creation in 2003. The U.S. entry-exit system, known as the US-VISIT Program, has undergone structural changes since its creation in 2003. Initially coordinated by DHS' Directorate of Border and Transportation Security, it was later proposed to be placed within a Screening Coordination Office that never received funding. Eventually, US-VISIT became a stand-alone office within the DHS appropriation in FY2006. The US-VISIT program was initially under the Directorate of Border and Transportation Security but later became a stand-alone office within DHS in FY2006. In FY2008, it was transferred to the National Protection and Programs Directorate. A proposed move in FY2013 to divide its work between CBP and ICE was not fully supported by Congress. In FY2013, Congress did not fully support the proposed move to divide the US-VISIT program's work between CBP and ICE. The House-passed bill would transfer $73 million to CBP and ICE offices, while leaving $191 million for a new Office of Biometric Identity Management. The Senate-reported bill recommended transferring US-VISIT to CBP as a stand-alone appropriation. P.L. 113-6 replaced the US-VISIT Program entirely with a new Office of Biometric Identity. The President's FY2013 budget requested funding for 21,186 CBP officers and 21,370 U.S. Border Patrol agents. Both chambers' budget proposals supported the staffing levels but raised questions about how DHS sets them. The Senate report warned of adverse consequences if DHS maintains high staffing levels during budget tightening and expressed concern about stagnant inspection fees. The House report raised concerns about high staffing levels during budget tightening and stagnant inspection fees, limiting funds for CBP officer salaries. It encouraged CBP to consider changes such as reengineering processes, improving risk-based targeting, managing staffing demand surges, exploring public-private partnerships, expanding trusted trade programs, and using technology to increase officer efficiency. The House report raised concerns about high staffing levels during budget tightening and stagnant inspection fees, limiting funds for CBP officer salaries. It encouraged CBP to consider changes such as reengineering processes, improving risk-based targeting, managing staffing demand surges, exploring public-private partnerships, expanding trusted trade programs, and using technology to increase officer efficiency. Efforts to reduce CBP staffing or slow its growth may face opposition from some Members. Some Members may disagree with efforts to reduce CBP staffing or slow its growth. Border patrol staffing has increased significantly since FY2005, while OFO staffing at POEs has only seen a modest increase. Increased enforcement between ports of entry may have unintended consequences, with some arguing that it encourages illegal migrants and drug smugglers to enter through POEs. Supporters of increased OFO staffing believe that officers enhance security and facilitate legal admissions. Increased OFO staffing is supported to enhance security and facilitate legal admissions, as officers are more effective at identifying and apprehending bad actors than automated systems. Sequestration in 2013 led to warnings of furloughs for CBP personnel, reduced overtime hours, and decreased hiring, equivalent to cuts in Border Patrol agents and CBP officers. DHS plans to reduce overtime hours, decrease hiring, and implement cost-saving measures to mitigate the impact of budget cuts on frontline operations for Border Patrol and CBP. This includes eliminating performance awards, reducing outside contracts, and working with Congress to reprogram funds. CBP aims to avoid employee furloughs by relying on overtime reductions and hiring freezes. CBP plans to rely on reductions to overtime and hiring freezes to avoid employee furloughs. The administration also looks to public-private partnerships for funding. The administration plans to rely on public-private partnerships for funding enhanced services at ports of entry, despite restrictions on CBP providing services on a fee-for-service basis. Section 560 of P.L. 113-6 allows CBP to enter into up to five partnerships in FY2013 for reimbursing costs and providing additional services at POEs. The administration plans to rely on public-private partnerships for funding enhanced services at ports of entry. CBP collects user fees to reimburse for additional services and expansion at land ports of entry, as mandated by the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986. The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 (COBRA, P.L. 99-272) mandates CBP to collect user fees to fund customs functions, including overtime compensation, benefits, and premium pay for officers. These fees are divided into mandatory spending for certain functions and discretionary appropriations for additional customs revenue functions. Section 521 of the NAFTA Implementation Act of 1993 temporarily increased fees for all passengers entering the United States, drawing Congressional interest due to the collection of certain COBRA passenger fees without corresponding appropriations for customs functions. The NAFTA Implementation Act of 1993 temporarily increased fees for passengers entering the US, including those from Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean islands. This resulted in the collection of $639 million from FY1994-FY1997. The United States-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement Implementation Act of 2011 eliminated a passenger fee exemption for travelers from Mexico, Canada, and other Western Hemisphere states, leading to an estimated increase in COBRA fees of $83 million in FY2012 and $110 million in FY2013 and beyond. These funds were directed to the Customs User Fee Account. Some Members of Congress have raised questions about the disposition of $639 million in fees collected from FY1994-FY1997 and an additional $83 million in FY2012 and $110 million in FY2013 onwards. The House Appropriations Committee directed CBP to report on the availability of these funds and how they will be eliminated from the department's books. CBP will report to the committee on the availability of $639 million identified by GAO and how to remove it from the Department's books. The House proposed shifting $70 million from CBP headquarters to officer salaries to address a funding shortfall, while the Senate awaited a resolution for the remaining gap. The Senate report awaited a resolution for the funding gap in CBP officer salaries. P.L. 113-6 appropriates an additional $110 million to address the shortfall and directs CBP and OMB to include COBRA fees in future budget requests. DHS' strategy for controlling the Southwest Border involves technology to monitor and detect illegal entries. Since 1998, DHS has tried to develop technology to monitor the border and detect illegal entries, but initiatives have failed to deliver desired surveillance levels. The last two major programs, America's Shield Initiative and SBI net, faced criticism for contracting practices and oversight issues. The America's Shield Initiative and SBI net faced criticism for non-competitive contracting practices, inadequate oversight, and cost overruns. SBI net was cancelled in January 2011 and replaced with the Arizona Border Technology Plan, which emphasizes rapid deployment of existing technology for border surveillance. House and Senate appropriations reports expressed frustration with DHS' implementation of the new plan. The House and Senate appropriations reports criticized DHS for not procuring and implementing new surveillance equipment for the Arizona Border Technology Plan. Both chambers recommended fully funding the President's request for the border surveillance mission but also suggested rescinding unobligated balances. The House and Senate recommended fully funding the President's request for the BSFIT account for border surveillance, with differing amounts for rescissions. P.L. 113-6 included $73,232,000 in rescissions. CBP uses manned and unmanned aircraft for surveillance, with the President's FY2013 budget supporting 277 aircraft for drug interdiction and border surveillance. The Office of Air and Marine Interdiction (OAM) supported 277 aircraft for drug interdiction and border surveillance activities, including funding for the \"Big Pipe\" project. OAM reported 81,045 flight hours in FY2012, projected 65,000 hours in FY2013. CBP operated 10 unmanned aerial systems (UAS) as of November 2012, with UAS accounting for 5,737 flight hours in FY2012. The use of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) for border surveillance is supported by some Members of Congress, but remains controversial due to privacy concerns and questions about cost effectiveness. A DHS Inspector General report in May 2012 criticized CBP's UAS program for lacking adequate support resources and potentially under-utilizing UAS assets. The appropriations committees recommended increases to the OAM budget for upgrading the fleet, increasing flight hours, and supporting UAS operations. P.L. 113-6 appropriated about $799 million for Air and Marine Operations, including a shift of $284 million from CBP's Salaries and Expenses account. P.L. 113-6 allocated $799 million for Air and Marine Operations, with $284 million shifted from CBP's Salaries and Expenses account. CBP is directed to restore overall and UAS flight hours to 2011 levels and ensure maritime cargo is scanned for contraband and dangerous materials before being loaded on ships bound for the U.S. The 9/11 Act requires CBP to scan all maritime cargo for radiation and inspection imaging before loading on ships bound for the US. The deadline for this 100% scanning was initially set for July 1, 2012, but was extended by Homeland Security Secretary Napolitano in May 2012. This requirement has raised concerns about balancing security benefits. Homeland Security Secretary Napolitano extended the 100% scanning deadline for maritime cargo bound for the US. There are concerns about balancing security benefits with the costs of scanning, including paperwork, technology maintenance, and longer wait times for importers. Some suggest focusing on high-risk cargo and a random sample of lower-risk cargo to cut costs and make better use of resources. The FY2013 budget request included a $13 million increase to the Container Security Initiative (CSI) and a total of $78 million in proposed increases to the Automated Targeting System for security screening of incoming goods and travelers. House and Senate Appropriations Committee reports supported these program increases. ICE focuses on enforcing immigration and customs laws in the United States, developing intelligence to reduce illegal entry, investigating violations such as alien smuggling, and locating unauthorized alien workers. House and Senate Appropriations Committee reports supported the President's request for security screening programs, acknowledging DHS' concerns about costs and calling for alternative scanning plans. ICE is responsible for investigating and enforcing violations of immigration laws, including alien smuggling and unauthorized worker hiring. They also locate and remove overstayed visa holders, illegal entrants, and deportable aliens. ICE develops intelligence to combat terrorist financing, money laundering, and enforce export laws. Funding details can be found in Table 8 for agency-level information and Table 10 for sub-account level details. ICE is responsible for enforcing immigration laws and investigating violations. Funding details for ICE can be found in Table 10, including appropriations for FY2012 and FY2013. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 reflect spending cuts compared to FY2012 enacted amounts. The Administration requested $5,332 million for ICE in FY2013, a decrease of $218 million from the enacted budget. The Administration requested $5,332 million for ICE in FY2013, a decrease of $218 million from the enacted budget. The budget request included increases for the Alternatives to Detention program, personnel and operations consolidation, and video conferencing expansion in detention facilities and EOIR. The FY2013 budget for ICE included increases for personnel and operations consolidation, video conferencing expansion, and transferring the US-VISIT Program function to ICE. Reductions were made for the 287(g) program, Office of Principle Legal Advisor, detention beds, and Secure Communities. The House-passed H.R. 5855 would have provided $5,474 million in net budget authority for FY2013. The House-passed H.R. 5855 proposed a reduction of $53 million for detention beds and $41 million for Secure Communities. It would have given ICE a total funding authority of $5,786 million for FY2013, representing a decrease of $77 million (1.3%) from the FY2012 enacted level and an increase of $142 million (2.5%) over the Administration's request. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended ICE receive $5,330 million in net budget. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended ICE receive $5,330 million in net budget authority for FY2013, a decrease of $2 million from the Administration's request and a decrease of $220 million from the FY2012 enacted amount. Senate-reported S. 3216 would have provided ICE with gross funding authority of $5,642 million, a decrease from the Administration's request and the FY2012 enacted level. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2013 (P.L. 113-6) provides $5,426 million in net budget authority for ICE for FY2013, a decrease of $125 million (2.3%) from last year's appropriation and an increase of $94 million (1.8%) from the President's request. P.L. 113-6 includes $5,738 million in gross budget authority, which is a $125 million (2.1%) decrease below last year's appropriation and a $94 million increase (1.5%) over the President's request. Sequestration further reduced ICE budget authority. The FY2013 budget for ICE saw a $125 million decrease from the previous year's appropriation and a $94 million increase over the President's request. Sequestration further reduced ICE's budget authority by approximately $200 million. ICE's allocation of resources to achieve its mission remains a debated issue in Congress due to its diverse responsibilities in handling civil and criminal violations of law. ICE's allocation of resources to achieve its mission is a debated issue in Congress. Part of ICE's mission involves locating and removing deportable aliens, including those who have committed crimes. There are an estimated 10.8 million unauthorized aliens and 1.9 million criminal aliens in the United States. There are approximately 10.8 million unauthorized aliens and 1.9 million criminal aliens in the United States. ICE can remove 400,000 aliens annually. Debate surrounds ICE's prioritization of removable aliens, with amendments in H.R. 5855 directing enforcement priorities. P.L. 113-6 allocates $1.6 billion to identify and remove criminal aliens. The act allocates $1,600 million to identify and remove aliens convicted of a crime, prioritizing by severity. ICE's ERO manages custody and ensures removal of ordered aliens, but faces challenges with detention space. Some policymakers advocate for alternatives to detention programs for noncriminal alien detainees due to concerns about ERO's limited detention space and potential inequities in release decisions.ICE maintains a number of detention beds. ICE maintains detention bed spaces for noncriminal alien detainees, with a budget request for a reduction in bed space. In 2013, ICE released detainees due to funding constraints and upcoming reductions required by sequestration. ICE Director John Morton explained the release was necessary despite the funded 34,000 beds. ICE Director John Morton stated that despite funding for 34,000 beds, ICE's daily detention population exceeded 35,000 individuals, including those not required to be detained by law. Critics viewed the release of detainees as a political move to pressure Congress to avoid sequestration reductions. P.L. 113-6 mandates ICE to maintain 34,000 detention beds for FY2013, prompting interest in alternative detention options for certain aliens. ICE's Alternatives to Detention (ATD) program offers less restrictive monitoring options, such as electronic devices and home visits, for non-detained aliens with final removal orders. The Administration sought to reduce detention bed space while expanding the ATD program with an additional $40 million in funding. The Administration requested a decrease in detention bed space and an additional $40 million to expand the ATD program. H.R. 5855 maintained current bed levels and increased ATD funding by $20 million. Senate-reported S. 3216 reduced detention space by 600 beds and increased ATD funding by $24 million. P.L. 113-6 funds 34,000 detention beds and increases ATD funding by $19 million. The Administration's request included $139 million for Secure Communities, an information sharing program between DHS and the Department of Justice to check fingerprints of arrestees against DHS immigration records. ICE has deployed Secure Communities to 89% of all jurisdictions nationally and is seeking resources to expand the system nationwide by the end of FY2013, confirming the identification of more removable aliens, including Level 1 offenders. In FY2013, ICE confirmed the identification of 282,000 more removable aliens than in FY2010, including 73,000 Level 1 offenders. Both House and Senate appropriators supported the expansion of Secure Communities. The enforcement of immigration laws by state and local law enforcement agents through agreements like the \u00a7287(g) program has sparked debate about their role. The debate over the role of state and local law enforcement in enforcing immigration laws, particularly through programs like the \u00a7287(g) program and Secure Communities, has raised concerns about training, resources, civil rights violations, and community impact. The Administration requested $51 million for 287(g) agreements, a decrease of $17 million from the previous year, citing limited federal resources for immigration enforcement. The Administration requested $51 million for 287(g) agreements, a decrease of $17 million from the previous year. ICE plans to discontinue least productive 287(g) task force agreements in jurisdictions where Secure Communities is active. Senate-reported S. 3216 would have appropriated $51 million for 287(g) agreements while H.R. 5855 would have funded the program at the FY2012 level of $68 million. The House passed H.R. 5855 to fund the 287(g) program at $68 million, with an amendment to prevent termination of existing agreements. ICE established the Public Advocate Office in 2012 to address concerns about agency operations. The Public Advocate Office was created by ICE in 2012 to address concerns about agency operations. Some argue that the program is not productive and is a misuse of resources. P.L. 113-6 prohibits funding for the Public Advocate position within ICE. TSA, established in 2001, is responsible for protecting transportation systems in the US. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA), established in 2001, is responsible for protecting air, land, and rail transportation systems in the US. It was transferred to the Department of Homeland Security in 2002. TSA's duties include safeguarding the aviation system from terrorist threats and deploying security technologies for passenger and baggage screening. They also assess the risk of terrorist attacks for non-aviation transportation modes. The TSA is responsible for protecting air, land, and rail transportation systems in the US, including assessing the risk of terrorist attacks for non-aviation modes. They issue regulations to improve security and enforce them to protect transportation systems. The TSA budget is a complex component of the DHS Appropriations bill. The TSA's budget is a complex component of the DHS Appropriations bill. The agency has additional budgetary resources from non-appropriated sources, including airline security fees and other fees for transportation threat assessment. These resources are not reflected in the direct discretionary appropriations shown in the graphic. Table 11 breaks down TSA's total budget resources from non-appropriated sources and direct appropriations. The President's request included $7,645 million in gross budget authority for TSA, offset by $2,515 million in proposed collections and fees, resulting in a net direct discretionary appropriation of $5,130 million. This represents a 2.5% decrease in gross funding from FY2012, but a 7.1% drop in net appropriations. $5,099 million of the request was for aviation security, a 3.0% decrease from FY2012. The President's request proposed a decrease in funding for aviation security and Surface Transportation Security. This included reductions in procurement for baggage and passenger checkpoint technologies, screening technology maintenance costs, and the Federal Flight Deck Officer program. The President's request includes reductions in funding for baggage and passenger checkpoint technologies, screening technology maintenance costs, and the Federal Flight Deck Officer program. Funding for transportation threat assessment and credentialing would increase by $68 million, including a one-time increase for infrastructure modernization and adjustments to the Transportation Worker Identification Credential fees. The requested funding levels for Transportation Security Support and the Federal Air Marshals Service were decreased in the FY2012 budget. The House-passed H.R. 5855 included a gross budget authority of $7,498 million for TSA, offset by $2,400 million in collections and fees. The House-passed H.R. 5855 included a net direct discretionary appropriation of $5,098 million for TSA, representing a decrease from the administration's request. The bill specified $5,041 million for aviation security, rejecting proposed increases in passenger security fees. Appropriations for aviation security actually rose $58 million above the request. The House-passed bill included cuts to screening operations and specified funding for surface transportation security and TTAC in line with the request. The House-passed bill included cuts to transportation security support and FAMS, with reductions made to offset a budget shortfall from proposed passenger security fee increases. The Senate-reported bill specified $7,633 million in gross budget authority for TSA. The Senate-reported bill specified a net discretionary appropriation of $4,919 million for TSA, with a $211 million reduction in net appropriations compared to the Administration's request. This included $5,087 million for aviation security, with offsetting passenger security fee increases accepted to generate $315 million in revenue. The appropriations proposed in the bill for aviation security dropped $211 million (7.3%) from the Administration's request, with reductions in checkpoint equipment procurement, explosives detection systems procurement, and screener staffing. The cuts were attributed to unobligated prior-year balances and delayed fielding of checkpoint body scanners. The appropriations bill for aviation security included reductions in checkpoint equipment procurement, explosives detection systems procurement, and screener staffing. The bill provided $24 million for the FFDO program, $12 million above the request. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding surface transportation security, TTAC, transportation security support, and FAMS at requested levels. TSA received $7,551 million in total gross budget authority, $290 million less than the FY2012 enacted level, with sequestration further reducing the budget authority by $339 million. The DHS FY2013 expenditure plan projected a total spending of $7,212 million for TSA in FY2013, which was $629 million less than the previous year. Sequestration further reduced TSA's budget authority by $339 million. Passenger security fees under ATSA are set at $2.50 per flight segment, not exceeding $5.00 per segment. The funding levels for existing TSA program functions are outlined in Table 12 of the plan, with the department likely to undertake transfers and reprogramming to mitigate the impact of sequestration. In FY2013, the Administration proposed changing the passenger security fee structure to a flat fee of $5.00 per one-way trip, as concerns were raised that the current per-segment fee does not accurately reflect passenger usage. Airlines have opposed fee increases, citing potential negative impacts on air travel. The Administration proposed changing the passenger security fee structure to a flat fee of $5.00 per one-way trip in the FY2013 budget submission, aiming to increase revenue collections by $317 million. Both the George W. Bush and Obama administrations have previously suggested increasing passenger security fees. The Senate Appropriations Committee supported a proposal to increase passenger security fees to $5.00 per one-way trip in FY2013, allocating all fee collections to aviation security. This proposal aimed to generate additional revenue for deficit reduction. The Senate committee proposed increasing passenger security fees to $5.00 per one-way trip in FY2013, allocating all collections to aviation security. However, the House Appropriations Committee did not include the proposal, citing jurisdictional issues. P.L. 113-6 did not change passenger security fees despite TSA identifying over $100 million in savings from improved management. TSA identified over $100 million in savings from improved management efficiencies, including reductions in travel, conferences, and overtime pay. This raised oversight questions about why inefficiencies were not corrected sooner. Efficiency improvements at TSA have raised oversight questions about why inefficiencies were not corrected sooner. TSA has implemented risk-based screening initiatives such as the PreCheck program and modified screening procedures for children and flight crew members. The TSA has implemented risk-based screening initiatives, including the PreCheck program for trusted travelers. Trial programs are also in place for modified screening of children, elderly passengers, and flight crew members. These programs aim to improve screening efficiencies and potential savings. The PreCheck program, part of a trusted traveler program, is modeled after CBP programs like Global Entry, SENTRI, and NEXUS. Currently on trial for members of these programs, frequent flyer program members, and military service members at select airports. TSA plans to expand PreCheck in FY2013, supported by House and Senate committees for its risk-based screening approach to increase efficiency and reduce workforce requirements. TSA directed to report on expansion plans for PreCheck. The Senate committee supports TSA's plans to expand the PreCheck program and directed TSA to report on its expansion plans, success indicators, public awareness efforts, time savings, and security measures for PreCheck enrollees. Concern was expressed about the limited scope of TSA's known crew member pilot program and included language to expand it to include flight attendants. The House committee expressed concern about TSA's known crew member pilot program being limited to pilots and proposed expanding it to include flight attendants. They questioned the effectiveness of TSA's Behavior Detection Officers program and called for a cost-benefit analysis. The committee called for a cost-benefit analysis of the Behavior Detection Officers program and a risk-based strategy for their deployment. TSA is required to provide semiannual briefings on progress with trusted traveler approaches and any obstacles to their implementation. The budget justification includes a significant cut in funds for the Federal Flight Deck Officer program and crew member self-defense training. The House Appropriations Committee recommended keeping the Federal Flight Deck Officer (FFDO) program at the FY2012 level. The House also passed an amendment to increase FFDO funding by an additional $10 million to $36 million, offset by reductions in other areas. The Senate Appropriations Committee has not adopted this proposal. The House recommended maintaining FFDO program funding at the FY2012 level, with an additional $10 million increase to $36 million offset by reductions in other areas. The Senate Appropriations Committee disagreed with the reduction in FFDO funding and recommended $24 million for FFDO and crew member training programs. The Coast Guard, as the lead federal agency for maritime homeland security, received $24 million for FFDO and crew member training programs in FY2013, a slight decrease from FY2012 due to budget constraints and sequestration cuts. They are responsible for securing U.S. ports, coastal and inland waterways, and territorial waters, as well as conducting missions like search and rescue and marine environmental protection. The Coast Guard, responsible for maritime homeland security, also conducts missions like search and rescue, marine environmental protection, and aids to navigation. It was transferred to the DHS in 2003. The President requested $8,377 million in appropriations for the Coast Guard, with $257 million less than FY2012. The House proposed $212 million more than the President's request, mainly for capital acquisitions. The House and Senate proposed additional funding for capital acquisitions for the Coast Guard, with differences from the President's request. The Senate recommended funding overseas operations directly under the Coast Guard. Vessel procurement was a major point of contention. The USCG budget received $10,400 million in total gross budget authority, $68 million more than FY2012. Sequestration reduced funding by $268 million, with projected spending at $10,132 million for FY2013. Vessel procurement was a key point of contention. Total spending for USCG in FY2013 is $10,132 million, $200 million less than FY2012. Funding levels for operating expenses and acquisition functions are outlined in Table 13. The President's request and House and Senate bills differed mainly in vessel and aircraft acquisition. In FY2013, funding differences between the President's request and House and Senate bills were notable in vessel and aircraft acquisition. The President asked for $139 million for two fast response cutters, while the House funded four ($224 million) and the Senate funded six ($335 million). The President did not request funds for additional Response Boat Medium vessels, but the Senate allocated $8 million for four more. In terms of aircraft, the House provided $90 million for one long-range fixed wing aircraft and $28 million for two MH-60 helicopters, while the President requested $64 million for the long-range aircraft. The House allocated $90 million for one long-range fixed wing aircraft and $28 million for two MH-60 helicopters. The President requested $64 million for the long-range aircraft but did not request funds for the MH-60 helicopters. The Senate did not request funds for either aircraft. P.L. 113-6 requires a capital investment plan for FY2014-FY2018 to be submitted with the President's budget. DHS's sequestration operating plan includes $1,030 million for vessel acquisitions, with $646 million for one national security vessel. The DHS's sequestration operating plan includes $1,030 million for vessel acquisitions, with $646 million for one national security cutter, $319 million for six fast response cutters, and $8 million for a new icebreaker. For aircraft, there is a reduction in funding from $191 million to $181 million for all aircraft acquisitions, with $86 million specifically for long-range aircraft. The Coast Guard's fleet modernization has been a major concern for Congress, with the House bill allocating $56 million for housing and aids to navigation. The House bill allocated $56 million for Coast Guard housing and aids to navigation, $41 million more than requested by the President and recommended by the Senate committee. This included $31 million for shore facilities backlog and $10 million for the Coast Guard's new headquarters. The final funding was reduced to $29 million due to DHS's sequestration plan. The House bill allocated $56 million for Coast Guard housing and aids to navigation, $41 million more than requested by the President and recommended by the Senate committee. This included $31 million for shore facilities backlog and $10 million for the Coast Guard's new headquarters. P.L. 113-6 provided $30 million for housing and aids to navigation, reduced to $29 million according to DHS's sequestration plan. The House Appropriations Committee Report called for implementing card readers at ports and vessels for TWIC. The Senate Committee on Appropriations requested a Coast Guard briefing on Interagency Operations Centers at ports. The House bill allocated $56 million for Coast Guard housing and aids to navigation, $41 million more than requested by the President and recommended by the Senate committee. P.L. 113-6 provided $30 million for housing and aids to navigation. The Senate Committee on Appropriations requested a Coast Guard briefing on Interagency Operations Centers at ports in light of a GAO report critical of the agency's development of these centers. The U.S. Secret Service (USSS) has two broad missions, criminal investigations and protection. The U.S. Secret Service (USSS) has two main missions: criminal investigations involving financial crimes, identity theft, and computer fraud, and protection duties covering the President, Vice President, their families, candidates for office, and designated individuals. The U.S. Secret Service (USSS) has two main missions: criminal investigations and protection duties for high-profile individuals. They are responsible for security at National Special Security Events (NSSE) and have the authority to coordinate security arrangements with other law enforcement units. The Administration requested $1,601 million for FY2013. The Administration requested $1,601 million for the USSS in FY2013, with $988 million for protection and $324 million for investigation. The House-passed DHS appropriations bill recommended $1,613 million, a decrease from FY2012. The House-passed DHS appropriations bill recommended an appropriation of $1,613 million for the USSS in FY2013, which was a decrease of $54 million (3.2%) from the previous year. This amount was $12 million (0.8%) higher than the Administration's FY2013 request. The decrease in funding was due to the conclusion of the 2012 Presidential campaign season and reduced demand for candidate protection. The budget cut was partially offset by restoring $8 million for USSS support for the Center for Missing and Exploited Children and an $8 million increase for Electronic Crimes Special Agent Program. The Senate-reported version of the DHS appropriations bill for FY2013 recommended an appropriation of $1,613 million for the USSS, reflecting a total decrease of $54 million (3.2%) from the previous year. This amount was $12 million (0.8%) higher than the Administration's request. The Senate also proposed restoring $8 million in specific funding for USSS support for the Center for Missing and Exploited Children. The Senate recommended an appropriation of $1.613 million for the USSS in FY2013, which was $54 million less than the previous year. They also proposed restoring $8 million in funding for the Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Additionally, the Senate approved of the USSS Director's actions to address improper behavior involving Secret Service agents in Colombia in 2012. Congress appropriated $1.611 billion for USSS in FY2013, $56 million less than the previous year. Following the sequester, the Service plans to expend $1.527 billion, $84 million less than the appropriated amount. Following the sequester, the Secret Service plans to spend $1.527 billion in FY2013, which is $84 million less than the appropriated amount. This reduction primarily affects the Service's protection and investigation mission. The DHS Plan column in Table 14 outlines the budgetary resources available after sequestration, as of April 26, 2013, but final funding levels may change due to potential transfers and reprogramming. The Secret Service plans to spend $1.527 billion in FY2013, $84 million less than appropriated, with potential transfers and reprogramming to mitigate sequestration impact. Congress is concerned about balancing the Service's investigative and protective missions, with a focus on recent agent misconduct related to the protection mission. The Secret Service's budget for FY2013 is $1.527 billion, with potential transfers to mitigate sequestration impact. Congressional focus is on recent agent misconduct related to the protection mission, while advocates suggest enhancing protection through better threat investigation efforts. Congressional action primarily addresses the Service's protection mission due to potential terrorist threats and attacks. The DHS appropriations bill contains funding for various agencies like NPPD, OHA, and FEMA. The requested budget for FY2013 was $5,911 million, with slight increases proposed by the House and Senate bills. The Senate-reported bill for the DHS appropriations included $5,971 million, 1% above the request and 5.1% above FY2012. Both House-passed and Senate-reported versions also allocated $5,481 million for disaster relief, offset by a BCA adjustment. P.L. 113-6 provided $5,920 million, a 0.2% increase from the request and 4.3% above FY2012, with an additional $6,400 million for disaster relief. The enacted DHS appropriations for FY2013 included $5,920 million, a 0.2% increase from the requested level and 4.3% above FY2012. Additionally, $6,400 million was allocated for disaster relief, offset by a BCA adjustment. The National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD) was established in response to the Post-Katrina Emergency Management. The National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD) was formed by the Secretary for Homeland Security in response to the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006. It includes the Office of the Under Secretary for NPPD, Office of Infrastructure Protection, and Office of Cybersecurity and Communications. The Administration has proposed moving the US-VISIT program activities from NPPD to other locations within the Department. The Administration has proposed relocating the US-VISIT program activities from NPPD to other Department locations. The House suggests keeping some functions within a new Office of Biometric Identify Management. The Office of the Under Secretary is supported by the Management and Administration Program, while the Office of Infrastructure Protection and Office of Cybersecurity and Communications are backed by the Infrastructure Protection and Information Security Program (IPIS). The Administration requested $1,217 million for NPPD activities in FY2013, $29 million less than FY2012. The FY2013 Management and Administration budget request was $50 million, reflecting a transfer of functions to the DHS Office of Policy. The FY2013 request for IPIS was $1,167 million, an increase. The FY2013 request for IPIS was $1,167 million, a 31.3% increase from FY2012, with a focus on securing federal information systems. This included a $202 million initiative for Federal Network Security and a $116 million increase for compliance with FISMA requirements. The $116 million increase is for expanding the Network Security Deployment project, which supports the deployment of the National Cybersecurity Protection System (NCPS). The NCPS is an intrusion detection system using digital signatures from the National Security Agency. The funding will expand deployment of the 3.0 version for active defenses and develop version 2.2 for threat visualization and information. The FY2013 budget includes an increase in funding for the deployment of the 3.0 version of the National Cybersecurity Protection System (NCPS) and development of version 2.2 to enhance threat visualization and information sharing capabilities across federal agencies. Additionally, there is $15 million allocated for US-CERT to analyze additional data from NCPS and $5 million for the Multi-State Information Security and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) to support state and local cybersecurity efforts. The FY2013 budget increased funding for cybersecurity efforts, including the deployment of the National Cybersecurity Protection System (NCPS) 3.0 and development of version 2.2. Infrastructure protection funding was reduced, with a significant cut in the budget for the Infrastructure Security Compliance project. The Administration reduced funding for incident planning exercises by $8 million, transferring activities and personnel to other projects. The House allocated $1,347 million for NPPD, with $45 million for Management and Administration, $1,110 million for IPIS, and $191 million for the Office of Biometric Identity. The House allocated $1,347 million for NPPD, with $45 million for Management and Administration, $1,110 million for IPIS, and $191 million for the Office of Biometric Identity Management. The House provided $5 million less than requested for Management and Administration, citing unauthorized TSA fee increases and flaws in the treatment of CBP fee revenues. The reduction in the IPIS request was mainly in the Security Compliance project due to major implementation problems. The House reduced funding for the Security Compliance project in the IPIS request due to major implementation problems and unobligated funds. They also decreased funding for the deployment of the NCPS by $17 million, expressing concerns about NPPD's ability to use the funds effectively. Additionally, the House directed NPPD to collaborate with the Coast Guard on program implementation and consider alternative security programs for approving security plans under CFATS. The House reduced funding for various security projects, including the Global Cybersecurity Management and Telecommunications programs. They directed NPPD to use funds for developing security capabilities, such as continuous monitoring. The House directed NPPD to use funds for developing security capabilities, including continuous monitoring. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $1,220 million for NPPD, with specific allocations for Management and Administration, IPIS, and Security Compliance projects. The Committee provided $12 million more funding than requested for the Security Compliance project, acknowledging unobligated funds and internal deliberations. They recommended $18 million less for the Federal Network Security project and suggested withholding $120 million until NPPD's approval. The Committee recommended withholding $120 million of the proposed $184 million for security measures until NPPD produces an expenditure plan. They also suggested funding above the requested amount for cybersecurity projects and emphasized the importance of cybersecurity education. The Committee recommended funding cybersecurity projects, including the Global Cybersecurity Management and Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity and Awareness projects. They also highlighted the importance of improving cybersecurity posture for state, local, territorial, and tribal governments. Additionally, they mentioned the first National Cyber Security Review conducted by NPPD and recommended increases for emergency communication-related projects. The Committee recommended annual progress tracking for cybersecurity projects, including increases for emergency communication-related projects like the Next Generation Telecommunications project. P.L. 113-6 provides $1,439 million for NPPD/IPIS and OBIM, with $50 million for Management and Administration, $1,157 million for the IPIS program, and $232 million for Biometric Identity Management. After sequestration, NPPD/IPIS and OBIM would receive $1,337 million. Identity Management funding for NPPD/IPIS and OBIM in FY2014 is $1,337 million after sequestration. The breakdown includes $48 million for Management and Administration, $1,065 million for IPIS, and $224 million for Biometric Identity Management. Specific allocations for IPIS include $13.5 million for the Office of Bombing Prevention and $20.6 million for vulnerability assessments. In FY2014, funding allocations include $16.9 million for cybersecurity education, $77.9 million for CFATS, with $20.0 million on hold pending an expenditure plan, and $202 million for Federal Network Security program to assist federal agencies with monitoring and diagnostic equipment. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act allocated funds for agencies to acquire and operate continuous monitoring and diagnostic equipment and software for the CFATS program. GAO and the Coast Guard will continue to examine DHS progress in developing the program, including reviewing how inspections were conducted and identifying barriers to compliance. NPPD was directed to provide semiannual reports on the compliance program. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act directed NPPD to provide semiannual reports on the compliance program and to identify barriers to managing compliance. Agencies were also required to submit expenditure plans to improve cybersecurity, with quarterly reports sent to OMB. OMB would then provide an annual summary of these reports to Congress. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act mandated NPPD to report semiannually on compliance programs and identify barriers. OMB was tasked with summarizing these reports annually to Congress. Table 16 details FY2012 and FY2013 funding levels for each PPA in the IPIS program, with the DHS Plan column showing post-sequester resources assessment. An internal review identified issues with CFATS compliance implementation. Issues with implementing the CFATS compliance program were identified in an internal review by NPPD. Congress has a continued interest in ensuring compliance with CFATS and may oversee the program's development to address the problems identified. Additionally, cybersecurity has been a focus for Congress during the 112th Congress, with attention on various bills related to information sharing, education, workforce development, and clarifying roles and responsibilities. The focus of Congress during the 112th Congress has been on cybersecurity, with attention on various bills related to information sharing, education, workforce development, and clarifying roles and responsibilities. Legislation expanding DHS's role in protecting critical infrastructure may require additional resources. The Federal Protective Service (FPS), under NPPD, is responsible for protecting federal property and personnel. FPS operations focus on security measures to reduce criminal and terrorist threats, including risk assessments, countermeasures, law enforcement response, and assistance to federal agencies. The Federal Protective Service (FPS) is responsible for protecting federal property and personnel through security measures such as vehicle barriers, closed-circuit cameras, and law enforcement response. FPS also assists federal agencies like the U.S. Secret Service at National Special Security Events and is the lead agency for the National Infrastructure Protection Plan. FPS employs approximately 1,225 law enforcement officers and administers the services of 13,000 contract security guards. The President's FY2013 budget request for the Federal Protective Service (FPS) included 1,279 FTEs and $1,302 million, $40 million more than FY2012. FPS's budget is offset by security fees from GSA building tenants. $272 million for basic security operations, $509 million for building-specific security, and $521 million for Security Work Authorizations were projected in the request. House-passed H.R. 5855 for FY2013 showed no specific changes. The FY2013 budget for the Federal Protective Service (FPS) included $1,302 million for 1,279 FTEs, with $272 million for basic security operations, $509 million for building-specific security, and $521 million for Security Work Authorizations. House-passed H.R. 5855 for FY2013 did not propose any specific changes to the FPS budget. The Senate Appropriations Committee also did not recommend any specific changes but required a briefing on FPS management and budget improvement efforts. The FPS budget in FY2013 did not see any specific changes recommended in legislation. However, Congress directed FPS to update appropriations committees on progress implementing GAO recommendations. Despite sequestration, FPS resource levels were unaffected due to its budget structure. Congress remains concerned about aspects of FPS mission and funding, with interest in enhancing training for contract guards and potentially federalizing them. Appropriators are interested in improving training for contract guards, federalizing them, setting standards for checkpoint detection technologies, and coordinating with the Interagency Security Committee. Legislation introduced in the 112th Congress aimed to enhance federal building security and strengthen FPS's ability to protect buildings and personnel, but none were enacted. In the 113th Congress, H.R. 735, the Federal Protective Service Improvement and Accountability Act of 2013, aims to set staffing levels in the FPS inspector force and pilot the use of federal employees instead of contract guards. The Office of Health Affairs oversees programs like BioWatch, NBIC, and occupational health and safety. The Office of Health Affairs (OHA) oversees programs such as the BioWatch program, the National Biosurveillance Integration Center (NBIC), and occupational health and safety programs. OHA received $167 million in FY2012 appropriations, with a requested $166 million for FY2013 to support 101 FTEs. The proposed allocation includes $125 million for BioWatch and $8 million for NBIC. The requested funding level for FY2013 would support 101 FTEs, with allocations of $125 million for the BioWatch program, $8 million for NBIC, $1 million for the Chemical Defense Program, $5 million for Planning and Coordination, and $28 million for Salaries and Expenses. The House-passed bill proposed $132 million for FY2013, $35 million less than FY2012, largely due to a decrease in funding for the BioWatch program. The Senate-reported bill for FY2013 allocated $168 million, $1 million more than FY2012 and $2 million more than the President's request. The committee recommended amounts requested for BioWatch, with small increases for Planning and Coordination and Salaries and Expenses, and $2 million for the Chemical Defense Program. After across-the-board cuts, P.L. 113-6 provided $132 million. After across-the-board cuts, P.L. 113-6 provides $132 million for the Office of Health Affairs (OHA), $35 million less than FY2012 and $34 million less than the President's request. The reduction in OHA's budget did not face further cuts in FY2013 due to sequestration. The total enacted budget authority for FY2013 reflects decreased funding for BioWatch as recommended by the House. Table 17 shows funding amounts for OHA components for FY2012 and FY2013 under P.L. 113-6, including the Administration's request, House-passed and Senate-reported amounts, and post-sequester resources. The House Appropriations Committee recommended decreased funding for BioWatch in FY2013. The House Appropriations Committee recommended consolidating the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) and the Office of Health Affairs (OHA) into an Office of Weapons of Mass Destruction Defense to mitigate the impact of sequestration in FY2013. The Committee directed the Secretary to submit a consolidation plan to Congress for FY2014, with the GAO tasked to review the plan. Neither the Senate report nor the House explanatory statement addressed this consolidation. The House Appropriations Committee recommended merging DNDO and OHA into an Office of Weapons of Mass Destruction Defense for FY2014. The Senate called for a comprehensive review of WMD operations and a possible merger, with a deadline of September 1, 2013. The BioWatch program detects aerosol threats in over 30 U.S. cities. The BioWatch program, which detects aerosol threats in over 30 U.S. cities, is a significant part of OHA's budget. Efforts to deploy more advanced sensors have faced technical and management challenges according to GAO. The BioWatch Gen-3 program has faced technical and management challenges, with a life cycle cost of $5.8 billion. Congressional appropriators have limited funding for program expansion, hindering the development and deployment of Gen-3 capability. The decreased funding for FY2013 hinders the development of Gen-3 capability for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which aims to reduce loss of life and property from all hazards through various emergency management activities. FEMA executes its mission through incident response, recovery, and mitigation activities, primarily funded by the Disaster Relief Fund and Pre-Disaster Mitigation Fund. The Administration requested a $4,528 million discretionary appropriation for FEMA in FY2013, a 6.1% increase from FY2012. Additionally, an extra $5,481 million was requested for the Disaster Relief Fund. The Administration requested a $4,528 million discretionary appropriation for FEMA in FY2013, a 6.1% increase from FY2012. An additional $5,481 million was requested for the Disaster Relief Fund, with adjustments to the discretionary budget cap under the Budget Control Act. House-passed H.R. 5855 proposed a total discretionary appropriation of $4,451 million for FEMA in FY2013, including $23 million added through floor amendments. The House proposed a total discretionary appropriation of $4,451 million for FEMA in FY2013, with an increase of $76 million (1.7%) from the President's request and $185 million (4.3%) from FY2012. The Senate's S. 3216 would have provided $4,582 million for FEMA, an increase of $55 million (1.2%) from the President's request and $316 million (7.4%) from FY2012. After cuts, P.L. 113-6 allocated $4,351 million for FEMA, $84 million (2%) more than FY2012. After across-the-board cuts, P.L. 113-6 provides $4,351 million for FEMA in FY2013, $84 million more than FY2012. The bill includes $1 million less than requested for the DRF due to impacts of cuts. Additionally, $6,400 is allocated for the DRF for disaster costs under the Stafford Act, paid for by the disaster relief cap adjustment under the BCA. FEMA would receive $4,150 million from Title III provisions after sequestration. After sequestration, FEMA would receive $4,150 million from Title III provisions and $6,076 million from the disaster relief cap adjustment under the BCA in FY2013. The impact of transfers or reprogrammings on the sequester's effects is uncertain. The numbers do not reflect the full range of FEMA's appropriated resources, as the DRF received significant funding from P.L. 113-2. No authoritative statement on post-sequester funding levels has been released by DHS or the Administration. State and local governments bear primary responsibility for most domestic public services. The Administration has issued a statement on post-sequester funding levels provided by P.L. 113-2. State and local governments may reduce resources for public safety and homeland security preparedness due to budget constraints. This could significantly impact national preparedness levels. President Obama issued a directive on March 30, 2011. President Obama issued a directive on March 30, 2011, directing the Secretary of DHS to develop a national preparedness goal in coordination with various levels of government. This goal should be informed by specific threats and vulnerabilities, include measurable objectives, and define core capabilities to mitigate risks. The national preparedness goal, informed by specific threats and vulnerabilities, defines core capabilities to mitigate risks, superseding a previous directive after 9/11. The National Preparedness Goal (NPG) was established to address domestic terrorist attacks, disasters, and emergencies by setting core capabilities and targets for a secure and resilient nation. Success is defined as having the necessary capabilities to prevent, protect against, mitigate, respond to, and recover from the greatest threats and hazards. Since before 9/11, there were only three federal grant programs for state and local governments to address homeland security. Additional grant programs have been added since then to enhance state and local preparedness. Several homeland security grant programs have been added since the establishment of the MMRS program by the Department of Health and Human Services, including SHSGP, CCP, UASI, REAL ID, Stonegarden, RCPG, Transit Grants, Port Security, Over-the-Road, BZPP, and Interoperable Emergency. The federal government provides assistance grants for various security programs such as Transit Grants, Port Security Grants, Over-the-Road Bus Security Assistance, Buffer Zone Protection Program, Interoperable Emergency Communications Grant Program, and Emergency Operations Center Grant Program. State and local governments also allocate significant funds for public safety, with total expenditures averaging $218 billion annually. The federal government provides grants for security programs like Transit Grants and Port Security Grants. State and local governments spend $218 billion annually on public safety, including police, fire protection, and corrections. Federal grants for state and local preparedness make up less than one percent of public safety expenditures. The President requested $1.8 billion for homeland security grants in FY2013, an increase from the previous year. This funding would support the National Preparedness Grant Program. The House Appropriations Committee denied the Administration's request to consolidate state and local preparedness grant programs under a National Preparedness Grant Program for FY2013 due to lack of congressional authorization, implementation details, and stakeholder participation. The Senate Appropriations Committee expressed concerns about the lack of details and stakeholder participation in the proposed consolidation of state and local preparedness grants. The House recommended $1.7 billion for State and Local Programs, which was $300 million more than FY2012 and $100 million less than the President's request. The House recommended $1.7 billion for State and Local Programs, $300 million more than FY2012 and $100 million less than the President's request. Grant funding would be distributed at the discretion of the Secretary of Homeland Security under various programs. The House recommended $1.7 billion for State and Local Programs, including funding for various security initiatives such as Operation Stonegarden, high-risk areas, education, training, and exercises. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $1.6 billion for FY2013. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $1.6 billion for FY2013, with allocations of $470 million for the State Homeland Security Grant Program, $676 million for Urban Area Security Initiative, $132 million for Public Transportation Security/Bus Assistance, $132 million for Port Security Grants, and $234 million for education, training, and exercises. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $1.6 billion for FY2013, with allocations for various security and education programs. The budget included grants for Public Transportation Security/Bus Assistance, Port Security Grants, and education, training, and exercises. Despite across-the-board cuts and sequestration, funding for state and local programs decreased by 20.3% from the requested level but was 8.6% above FY2012. Sequestration further reduced budget authority for FEMA's state and local grants program by roughly $77 million. The DHS FY2013 expenditure plan projected $1,400 million for state and local programs, slightly higher than FY2012 enacted levels. The DHS FY2013 expenditure plan projected $1,400 million for state and local programs, $50 million more than FY2012. P.L. 113-6 removed a transfer from grant programs paying FEMA's administrative costs, increasing total grant funding by $132 million. Table 18 outlines FEMA state and local program funding levels as of April 26, 2013. The department's assessment of post-sequester resources provided by P.L. 113-6 as of April 26, 2013, does not represent a final funding level. The Administration's FY2013 budget proposed $670 million for firefighter assistance, with $335 million each for AFG and SAFER grants. DHS historically sets aside up to 5% of AFG funding for management. In FY2013, DHS proposed shifting grant administration to the SLP Management and Administration office. The Administration also requested legislative language to use SAFER grants for maintaining firefighter staffing levels. The House-passed bill would have funded firefighter assistance at $675 million. The House-passed bill in FY2013 funded firefighter assistance at $675 million, denying the Administration's request to shift AFG and SAFER grants. The Senate-reported bill also proposed $675 million for firefighter assistance. The Senate-reported bill proposed $675 million for firefighter assistance, with $337.5 million each for AFG and SAFER grants. It denied the Administration's request to shift AFG and SAFER into the State and Local Programs account. The bill also included SAFER waiver authority language, with DHS expected to consider economic hardship when exercising the waiver authority. Post-sequestration, P.L. 113-6 funded firefighter assistance at $642 million. Post-sequestration, P.L. 113-6 funds firefighter assistance at $642 million, with administrative costs derived from the FEMA Salaries and Expense account. DHS is granted SAFER waiver authority for FY2013. The DRF is the main account used for emergency and disaster assistance, funded yearly through regular appropriations. The Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) provides assistance to states, local governments, nonprofits, and individuals affected by disasters. The DRF is funded annually through regular appropriations but often runs out of funds before the end of the fiscal year due to high demand for assistance. This reliance on supplemental funding has been attributed to underfunding the DRF, with average monthly expenditures exceeding the average regular appropriation between 2005 and 2011. Between 2005 and 2011, the average regular appropriation for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) was $1,749 million, with average monthly expenditures of $383 million. The Administration requested $6,088 million for the DRF in FY2013, a decrease from the previous year. $608 million was requested for activities not directly tied to major disasters under the Stafford Act. The FY2013 request for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) included $608 million for non-major disaster activities and $5,481 million for major disaster relief costs under the Stafford Act. This funding structure was influenced by the Budget Control Act, allowing disaster costs to be paid through an \"allowable adjustment\" to discretionary spending caps. The FY2013 request for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) included a significant increase from the previous year, with funding based on past declared catastrophic events and a reserve to prevent shortfalls. Both the House-passed and Senate-reported bills matched the Administration's funding request for FY2013. The House-passed and Senate-reported bills for FY2013 matched the Administration's funding request for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF). Both bills included a $24 million transfer to the DHS Office of Inspector General for audits and investigations on disaster-related spending. P.L. 113-6 allocated $7,007 million to the DRF, with $24 million earmarked for audits on public assistance projects exceeding $10 million and FEMA's debris removal decisions after the across-the-board cuts. P.L. 113-6 allocated $918 million more than the Administration's initial request for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) in FY2013. Sequestration reduced the DHS operating plan by 5%, resulting in a total of $6,653 million. The Budget Control Act (BCA) included provisions for OMB to calculate an \"allowable adjustment\" for disaster relief within discretionary spending caps. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) annually calculates an \"allowable adjustment\" for disaster relief to the Budget Control Act's (BCA) discretionary spending caps. This adjustment provides additional budget authority for federal costs incurred by major disasters declared under the Stafford Act, preventing sequestration from exceeding the regular discretionary budget allocation. It's important to differentiate between \"disaster relief\" funding under the BCA and the Disaster Relief Fund. The BCA defines \"disaster relief\" funding as activities for major disaster declarations under the Stafford Act, sourced from various federal accounts. The DRF had $7.3 billion during Hurricane Sandy in 2012 due to a continuing resolution. In October 2012, the DRF had access to $7.3 billion from P.L. 112-175, a continuing resolution. Congress approved an additional $11,485 million for the fund through P.L. 113-2, the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013, due to high anticipated demand. In FY 2013, the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) received emergency funding designations to cover relief exceeding the allowable adjustment under the Stafford Act. This marked the first time the DRF received all available funding under the Budget Control Act's allowable adjustment for disaster relief. In FY2013, the DRF received full funding under the BCA's allowable adjustment for disaster relief. The Administration proposed eliminating the PDM program, stating it duplicated the HMGP. PDM awards funds before disasters, unlike HMGP. The PDM program, unlike HMGP, awards funds before disasters and addresses all types of hazards. The Administration noted $174 million in unobligated balances for PDM grants. The House-passed and Senate-reported bills did not include language ending the program, with proposed appropriations of $14.3 million and $35 million respectively. The House-passed bill and Senate-reported bill did not include language to end the PDM program. Proposed appropriations were $14.3 million and $35 million respectively, indicating concerns about slow award pace and unobligated balances. Funding for PDM in FY2013 post-sequester is around $25 million, presenting challenges. The DHS operating plan for FY2013 shows that PDM funding is just under $25 million post-sequester, posing challenges for program administration. Reduced award amounts make it difficult to fund state minimum awards and conduct new rounds of applications. FEMA may use existing, unfunded applications to continue the funding cycle. The Administration has consistently proposed reduced funding for the EFS program, with FY2013 requesting $100 million, a reduction from previous years. The Administration has proposed reduced funding for the EFS program, with FY2013 requesting $100 million, a reduction of $20 million from the previous year. The House has maintained funding at $120 million, while the Senate suggested increasing it to $150 million. The post-sequester funding level for FY2013 is just under $114 million according to the DHS operating plan. The EFS program funding is proposed to be reduced to $100 million for FY2013, with the Senate suggesting an increase to $150 million. The post-sequester funding level is just under $114 million, the lowest since FY2000. Concerns include delayed distribution of funds in FY2012, taking nine months to begin distributing assistance. Title IV of the DHS appropriations bill includes funding for USCIS, FLETC, S&T, and the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office. The Administration requested $1,561 million for these accounts in FY2013, with the House-passed bill providing $1,510 million and the Senate-reported bill providing $1,535 million. P.L. 113-6 ultimately allocated $1,520 million before sequestration. The DHS appropriations bill provides $1,535 million for USCIS, 1.7% below the request and 15.2% above FY2012. P.L. 113-6 allocated $1,520 million before sequestration, a decrease of 0.5% from the requested level and 2.2% above FY2012. USCIS focuses on adjudication of immigration petitions. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) receives resources from P.L. 113-6 reported by DHS for adjudication of immigration petitions, naturalization petitions, and refugee/asylum claims. The direct appropriations for USCIS do not include fee income. The USCIS receives direct appropriations for processing immigration petitions, naturalization petitions, and refugee/asylum claims. Fee income is not included in these appropriations, as it is largely funded through the Examinations Fee Account. The agency has transformed its revenue structure over the last decade to focus on specific projects. The USCIS has transformed its revenue structure over the last decade, focusing on specific projects like reducing backlogs and the E-Verify program. The agency receives most of its revenue from adjudication fees. The requested USCIS gross budget authority for FY2013 was $3,005 million, with $143 million from direct appropriations and $2,862 million from fee collections. The requested direct appropriation of $143 million for FY2013 includes funding for the E-Verify program, Immigrant Integration Initiative, and the Systematic Alien Verification Entitlements (SAVE) Program. The remaining budget authority of $2,862 million is expected to be funded by fee collections, with allocations for USCIS adjudication services, information and customer services, and administration expenses. The House-passed H.R. 5855 proposed USCIS budget authority for FY2013 at $3,004 million, with $112 million from direct appropriations and $2,892 million from fee collections. The recommended level did not include funds for the requested pay increase and directed USCIS to use fee revenues for all costs except E-Verify. The House Appropriations Committee recommended USCIS to use fee revenues for all costs except E-Verify. They allocated $20 million for the SAVE program and $29 million for digital conversion of immigration records. The Committee did not provide funding for military naturalizations, suggesting it should be funded by the Department of Defense. The House Committee recommended USCIS to use fee revenues for all costs except E-Verify. They allocated $29 million for digital conversion of immigration records and did not provide funding for military naturalizations, suggesting it should be funded by the Department of Defense. The Committee expressed concerns about USCIS adjudication procedures and fraud detection, directing USCIS to provide a progress report on corrective actions and OIG to brief on its assessment. The Senate-reported S. 3216 proposed USCIS budget authority for FY2013 at $2,999 million. The Senate-reported S. 3216 proposed USCIS budget authority for FY2013 at $2,999 million, with $117 million from direct appropriations and $2,882 million from fee collections. The Committee recommended allocating $20 million for the SAVE program from user fee revenues and $112 million for the E-Verify program. Additionally, $5 million was recommended for Immigrant Integration grants. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $112 million for the E-Verify program and $5 million for Immigrant Integration grants, with an additional $5 million to be funded via fees. They directed that no appropriations be used for the Office of Citizenship Services and expressed concern about the costs of administering the grant program. They limited the use of grant funding to no more than 5% of the total amount. The Integration grant program funding was reduced to $109 million in FY2013 due to sequestration, which was a decrease from the requested level of $143 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee limited the use of grant funding to no more than 5% of the total amount. The DHS FY2013 operating plan indicates sequestration would reduce USCIS funding to $109 million from the enacted level of $102 million. Potential issues for Congress included concerns about fee-generated funding of the agency. For the FY2013 budget cycle, potential issues for Congress included concerns about fee-generated funding of USCIS, immigrant integration grants, USCIS Transformation program, E-Verify operability, paper record digitization, and refugee processing administration. USCIS must accurately monitor fee revenues to avoid backlogs or over-budgeting projects. The House Committee directed USCIS to monitor fee revenues and obligations accurately to avoid backlogs or over-budgeting projects. USCIS should include operation costs in fee adjustments and brief the Committee quarterly. Funding for immigrant integration grants remains an issue, with Congress requiring USCIS to allocate $7.5 million from fee revenue. In FY2013, USCIS is required to allocate $7.5 million from fee revenue for immigrant integration grants, with an additional $2.5 million in appropriations. The House Committee expressed disappointment with the lack of progress on the USCIS Transformation program. The House Committee expressed disappointment with the lack of progress on the USCIS Transformation program, questioning the justification for continued investment in the current contract. They directed USCIS to provide updates on efforts to deliver the first application form release and to make a decision regarding contract termination if deployment is not successful. Congress continues to monitor the situation closely. The House Committee directed USCIS to provide updates on the first application form release and potential contract termination. Congress remains concerned about the operability of the E-Verify program, with the House bill extending its authorization for one year. USCIS was directed to create a review process for final non-confirmations to prevent false identifications. The Senate Committee requested a report on the cost of expanding E-Verify and recommendations for its effective use. The Senate Committee directed USCIS to report on the cost of expanding E-Verify and recommendations for its effective use in the agricultural industry. The House Committee supported efforts to increase efficiency, reduce expenses, ensure immediate access to information, and prevent loss of personal documentation during processing. The Committee directed USCIS to convert immigration records to digital format through the Enterprise Document Management System (EDMS) to reduce paper files. They also instructed USCIS and CBP to brief Congress on progress towards eliminating the paper version of USCIS Form I-94. The House Committee expressed concerns about coordinating security and non-security clearance procedures for vulnerable individuals in need of resettlement. The Committee urged DHS to review refugee processing, including security clearances, to streamline processing while maintaining security vetting. They also encouraged the use of parole authority for urgent humanitarian needs, family unity, and medical emergencies. The Committee urged the Secretary to allocate resources for addressing urgent humanitarian needs and medical emergencies following natural disasters like the Haitian earthquake in 2010. The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center provides law enforcement instruction to federal, state, and local entities. The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) provides specialized training to various law enforcement entities, promoting consistency and collaboration. FLETC administers training at four sites in the US, utilizing online and other locations as needed. The Center has approximately 1,100 personnel and a proposed budget of $258 million. The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) employs around 1,100 personnel and has a proposed budget of $258 million. The budget includes two appropriations - Salaries and Expenses at $229 million and Acquisition, Construction, Improvements, and Related Expenses at $29 million, with reductions in both categories compared to the previous year. The reduction in the Salaries and Expenses appropriation was mainly due to efficiencies, with a $4 million cut in basic training. The proposed decrease in Acquisition, Construction, Improvements, and Related Expenses was a result of deferring construction work. The House-passed bill for FLETC included $256 million, $16 million below last year's level and $2 million below the request. The House Appropriations Committee report mentioned the Administration's reliance on these reductions. The House Appropriations Committee reduced the Acquisition, Construction, Improvements, and Related Expenses appropriation by $2 million (6.8%) due to the Administration's reliance on unauthorized fee increases. Senate-reported S. 3216 allocated $258 million for FLETC, matching the President's request. Despite cuts from P.L. 113-6, the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2013 provided $257 million for FLETC, a $1 million decrease from the requested level. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2013 (P.L. 113-6) allocated $257 million for FLETC, a $1 million decrease from the requested level and $14 million below the FY2012 enacted level. Sequestration may further reduce funding to $245 million, impacting research and development activities conducted by the Directorate of Science and Technology. The Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is responsible for research and development activities. The Administration requested $831 million for S&T in FY2013, a 25% increase from FY2012. The Research, Development, and Innovation (RDI) budget saw a significant increase of $212 million (79.9%) above the FY2012 level. The FY2013 budget request for the Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was $831 million, with a significant increase of $212 million for Research, Development, and Innovation (RDI). The largest increase within RDI was for disaster resilience R&D, while there was a reduction in the request for Laboratory Facilities due to the lack of construction funding for the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF). The FY2013 budget request for the Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was $831 million, with a significant increase of $212 million for Research, Development, and Innovation (RDI). The House-passed bill would have provided $826 million for the S&T Directorate, including $72 million less than the request for RDI. The House Appropriations Committee directed DHS to determine how to allocate that reduction across the six thrust areas. The House Appropriations Committee directed DHS to determine how to allocate a reduction in funding across the six thrust areas. The bill would have provided $75 million more for Laboratory Facilities, with the increase designated for NBAF construction. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding levels consistent with the Administration's request, specifying separate amounts for each of the six thrust areas within RDI. The committee did not recommend funding for NBAF construction, citing a total cost estimate of $1.138 billion for the facility. The House Appropriations Committee recommended no funding for NBAF construction, citing a total cost estimate of $1.138 billion for the facility. P.L. 113-6 provides $834 million for the S&T Directorate, $28 million less than the request for RDI. The act includes $37 million more than the request for Laboratory Facilities, to be spent on NBAF construction. The post-sequester total for the S&T Directorate is $801 million. The post-sequester total for the S&T Directorate is $801 million, with funding levels outlined in Table 21. The DHS Plan column shows resources provided by P.L. 113-6 as of April 26, 2013, but final funding levels may change due to transfers and reprogramming. The Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) is responsible for DHS nuclear detection efforts, including research, development, testing, and operational support. See Table 22 for a breakdown of DNDO activities. The Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) is responsible for all DHS nuclear detection research, development, testing, evaluation, acquisition, and operational support. The Administration requested $328 million for DNDO for FY2013, an increase of 13% above the FY2012 appropriation. This included an increase of $44 million for Transformational R&D, with a reduction of $23 million for Systems Development. The House-passed bill for DNDO requested $316 million, $12 million less than the Administration's request. Reductions would mainly affect the Transformational R&D program. The bill also directed DHS to provide an updated implementation plan for its responsibilities under the global nuclear detection architecture. The House Appropriations Committee requested an annual implementation plan from DHS for its responsibilities under the global nuclear detection architecture. They also suggested merging DNDO with OHA to save costs and improve coordination in efforts against weapons of mass destruction. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended merging DNDO and OHA into an Office of Weapons of Mass Destruction Defense for FY2014, with funding levels matching the Administration's request. They also directed DHS to provide an updated implementation plan for its responsibilities under the global nuclear detection architecture. The Senate report did not include the House's requirement for this plan to be submitted annually. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended merging DNDO and OHA into an Office of Weapons of Mass Destruction Defense for FY2014, with funding levels matching the Administration's request. P.L. 113-6 provides $318 million for DNDO after rescissions, $9 million less than the request for Transformational R&D. The act directs DHS to provide an updated implementation plan for its responsibilities under the global nuclear detection architecture. The annual requirement for this plan was not addressed in the explanatory statement. The explanatory statement directs DHS to review its WMD programs and evaluate the potential advantages of consolidation, including merging DNDO and OHA. The post-sequester total appropriation for DNDO is $303 million, with funding levels outlined in Table 22. The \"DHS Plan\" column assesses post-sequester resources provided by P.L. 113-6. The post-sequester total appropriation for DNDO is $303 million, with funding levels outlined in Table 22 of the DHS appropriations bill. The \"DHS Plan\" column assesses post-sequester resources provided by P.L. 113-6 as of April 26, 2013. This section of the report focuses on new general provisions in the bill. The report discusses new general provisions in the DHS appropriations bill, including rescissions proposed by the Administration for FY2013. The FY2012 DHS Appropriations bill (Division D of P.L. 112-74) included various provisions, with three rescissions and eleven one-time provisions. The Administration suggested not carrying forward five permanent changes in the U.S. Code and one obsolete provision. Fifteen other provisions were considered \"restrictive\" and hindrances to the Department's operations. Additionally, the Administration proposed adding five new general provisions. The Administration proposed adding five new general provisions, including extending the termination deadline for E-Verify, allowing FEMA to use earmarked grant funds, establishing an outreach program for dam safety efforts, and making certain fees available for customs inspectors. The House-passed H.R. 5855 includes $292 million in rescissions in Title V, reducing the net scoring of the bill. The House concurred with dropping 22 general provisions but did not agree with the Administration on 13 other provisions. The House Appropriations Committee added one of the five general provisions requested by the Administration, extending the termination deadline for E-Verify, and added 13 general provisions during floor action, including prohibiting the use of funds for certain activities related to racial, ethnic, or religious profiling and enforcing a proposed ICE rule. The House Appropriations Committee added provisions to extend the termination deadline for E-Verify and prohibit funds for activities related to racial, ethnic, or religious profiling. Additionally, they proposed enforcing a rule allowing undocumented aliens with children eligible for U.S. citizenship to stay in the country while seeking a waiver of a re-entry ban. The curr_chunk discusses restrictions on the use of CBP funds, limitations on government officials sharing immigration status information, and guidelines for acquiring new light-duty vehicles in accordance with alternative-fuel policies. The curr_chunk outlines violations of current laws by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, including restrictions on vehicle acquisitions, contravention of immigration laws, and limitations on the use of armed unmanned aerial vehicles. The curr_chunk discusses the authority of the Attorney General to detain and release criminal aliens, enforce an executive order for language access, implement ICE policy memos, and terminate an agreement allowing local officials to act as immigration officers. It includes $192 million in rescissions in Title V. The Senate bill, S. 3216, includes $192 million in rescissions in Title V and provisions impacting the scoring of the bill. It offsets its cost by $68 million and drops 15 general provisions while modifying three provisions to apply to FY2013. The Senate Appropriations Committee modified three provisions in the DHS funding bill to apply to FY2013, including funding for security costs, data center migration, and headquarters consolidation. They also added a provision allowing CBP to enter into reimbursable fee agreements. The Committee added a provision allowing CBP to enter into reimbursable fee agreements for providing services in the DHS funding bill. The enacted bill included $307 million in rescissions and other provisions that offset the cost by $202 million, dropping ten general provisions sought by the Administration. The Senate-reported bill included funding for various DHS initiatives such as immigrant integration grants, security cost reimbursements, data center migration, and DHS headquarters consolidation. Federal government spending involves budget authority, obligations, and outlays. The Senate-reported bill funded various DHS initiatives such as immigrant integration grants, security cost reimbursements, data center migration, and DHS headquarters consolidation through appropriations acts. Federal government spending involves budget authority, obligations, and outlays. Budget authority determines the amounts available for federal agencies to spend, with the Antideficiency Act prohibiting agencies from obligating more funds than enacted by Congress. It can be one-year, multi-year, or indefinite, with unobligated funds at the end of the year no longer available for spending. Budget authority specifies the time frame for funds to be obligated, with obligations incurred when federal agencies engage in transactions. Outlays represent actual spending during the fiscal year, which may not always match the budget authority enacted. Budget authority allows federal agencies to incur obligations and authorize payments from the Treasury. It may be obligated over multiple years, with outlays not always matching the budget authority enacted. Discretionary and mandatory spending make up the total funds available for federal agency spending. Discretionary agencies and programs are funded annually in appropriations acts. Gross budget authority for federal agency spending includes discretionary and mandatory spending. Discretionary spending is annually appropriated by Congress, while mandatory spending is provided in laws outside of appropriations acts. Spending, also known as direct spending, includes budget authority and outlays provided in laws other than appropriation acts. Some mandatory entitlement programs require annual appropriations. Within DHS, Coast Guard retirement pay is an example of appropriated mandatory spending. Offsetting Collections are funds collected by the federal government as part of business-type transactions, not counted as revenue but as negative outlays. The Department of Homeland Security's net discretionary budget authority is determined by subtracting any fee or fund collections that offset discretionary spending. These collections can offset either discretionary or mandatory spending, with mandatory spending typically being entitlement programs. The Department of Homeland Security's budget includes entitlement programs like the Secret Service and Coast Guard retired pay accounts. Some entitlements are funded by permanent appropriations, while others are funded annually. Additionally, the DHS budget contains offsetting Trust and Public Enterprise Funds that are not appropriated. The Coast Guard retirement pay is annually appropriated along with other entitlements in the DHS budget. Offset Trust and Public Enterprise Funds, not appropriated by Congress, are included in the President's budget for gross budget authority calculation. Homeland security funding has increased since 9/11, with annual reports to Congress on combating terrorism. The Office of Management and Budget publishes an annual report to Congress on combating terrorism, which now includes homeland security analysis. The funding analysis has become more refined over the years, with increasing specificity in distinguishing between homeland and non-homeland security activities. This may affect year-to-year comparisons in Table B-1 due to the evolving analysis. The Office of Management and Budget's annual report to Congress on combating terrorism includes homeland security analysis. While the report allows for year-to-year comparisons, the increasing specificity of the analysis may impact the comparability of data. It is important to note that DHS funding does not encompass all federal spending on homeland security, with DHS accounting for 52% of total federal funding in FY2012. The Department of Defense accounted for nearly 26% of federal spending on homeland security, followed by the Department of Health and Human Services at 6%, the Department of Justice at nearly 6%, and the Department of State at over 3%. These top five agencies collectively made up about 93% of all federal spending on homeland security. It is important to note that not all DHS funding is specifically for homeland security activities, as legacy agencies within DHS also carry out non-homeland security related activities. The FY2012 budget for DHS included $35.1 billion for homeland security, but the total budget authority was $52.5 billion. The amounts in Table B-1 may not align with total amounts in the report due to inconsistencies. This discrepancy in budget authority is also seen in other agencies listed. The Administration's budget for FY2013 did not account for P.L. 113-6 or sequestration impacts. No authoritative data for FY2013 is available due to the Administration's budget not accounting for P.L. 113-6 or sequestration impacts."
