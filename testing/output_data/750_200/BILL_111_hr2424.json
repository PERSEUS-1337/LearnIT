The Congress found that in August 2007, liquidity dried up in credit and securities markets, initially affecting financial firms with interests in mortgage-backed securities. This lack of access to credit spread globally, prompting the Federal Reserve to respond to the financial crisis. The Federal Reserve responded to the financial crisis by setting a target range for the Federal funds rate at 0 to 0.25 percent in December 2008, acknowledging the severity of the crisis and using its authority to address the situation. The Federal Reserve has acted in response to \"unusual and exigent circumstances\" multiple times since the financial crisis, extending assistance to nonmember institutions for the first time since 1959. The Federal Reserve extended assistance to nonmember institutions for the first time since 1959 and purchased debt obligations from government-sponsored enterprises for the first time since 1981 to address unusual circumstances. Additionally, joint programs with the Department of the Treasury were established to aid financial markets during the crisis. The Federal Reserve established joint programs with the Department of the Treasury to aid financial markets, including guaranteeing assets of Citigroup and Bank of America, the Term Asset-Backed Securities Lending Facility, and the Public-Private Partnership Investment Program. Chairman Ben Bernanke affirmed transparency commitment in a testimony to the Committee on Financial Services. SEC. 3. REVIEWS OF SPECIAL FEDERAL RESERVE CREDIT FACILITIES.
