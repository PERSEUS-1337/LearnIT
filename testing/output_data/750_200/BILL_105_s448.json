The \"Local Government Interstate Waste Control Act\" requires formal authorization from affected local governments before accepting out-of-state municipal solid waste. Authorization must be granted at a meeting, recorded in writing, and considered final.

This information must be made available for inspection by the Governor, adjoining local governments, Indian tribes, and other interested parties. The facility owner must provide information on the anticipated waste quantities, facility site map, including buffer zones and all facility units. The owner or operator must provide details on buffer zones and facility units, environmental characteristics of the site, including groundwater resources, and environmental controls to be used on the site.
