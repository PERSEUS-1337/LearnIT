    "content": "This report, General Management Laws: Major Themes and Management Policy Options, is a companion to CRS Report RL30795, General Management Laws: A Compendium. The reports aim to identify and describe major general management laws for the executive branch, assist Congress in overseeing executive branch management, and help with potential changes to management laws and legislation. The compendium includes profiles of selected general management laws. The compendium contains profiles of selected \"general management laws\" which regulate activities and administration of executive branch agencies. The quality and implementation of these laws are crucial for maintaining accountability to Congress, the President, and the public, influencing federal agencies' effectiveness in implementing public policies. The companion report focuses on major themes and management policy options for Congress related to general management laws for federal agencies. It complements the compendium, which includes over 90 entries describing these laws for the executive branch. The compendium for the 108th Congress contains over 90 entries describing general management laws for the executive branch, organized into seven functional categories. Functions in management refer to specific business areas requiring related skills or groups of people with similar tasks. The compendium for the 108th Congress contains over 90 entries describing general management laws for the executive branch, organized into seven functional categories. Functions in management refer to specific business areas requiring related skills or groups of people with similar tasks. The report will focus on the functional orientation of these areas. Most entries profile specific laws, with the \"Human Resources Management and Ethics\" section presenting civil service laws codified in Title 5 of the United States Code. Each entry is presented by CRS analysts in a brief manner. The compendium for the 108th Congress contains over 90 entries describing general management laws for the executive branch, organized into seven functional categories. Each entry in the compendium provides a brief history of the law, major provisions, key developments, and source readings. This report also discusses the historical roles of Congress and the President in managing the executive branch, compares management in public and private sectors, and analyzes major issues. The report analyzes major themes in general management laws for the executive branch, discussing the roles of Congress and the President in managing federal agencies. Scholars debate their constitutional roles and the balance of power between the branches. The U.S. Constitution created a system where both branches manage the executive branch. The U.S. Constitution established a system of separated powers and checks and balances between Congress and the President in managing federal agencies. Justice Robert Jackson emphasized the interdependence and reciprocity of the branches in sharing power within the executive branch. The U.S. Constitution outlines the separation of powers between Congress and the President in managing federal agencies. Congress has the authority to establish administrative agencies and determine their operations. This report and compendium explore the ongoing conversation about power-sharing within the executive branch. The U.S. Constitution grants Congress the power to make laws necessary for executing government powers, while also giving the President authority to manage the executive branch. However, the President's power is limited to ensuring that officials follow Congress's instructions. The President's duty is to ensure officials obey Congress's instructions, as the 'take Care' clause in Article II does not grant excessive power to frustrate congressional intention. Article II mentions executive departments and the President's appointment powers. In 1789, Congress enacted general management laws like the Treasury Act. In September 1789, Congress enacted laws to establish the Treasury Department and set salaries for Secretaries of the Departments of Treasury, State, and War. By the end of the 18th century, only these three departments, the Navy Department, and the office of Attorney General had been created. By 1801, the Federalists had established an administrative system with an independent chief executive, effective delegation of authority, and a fiscal system for the government. After ascending to power in 1801, the Democratic-Republicans, led by Thomas Jefferson, accepted the Federalist framework for government administration. Congress became more active in dealing with the administrative system, as the country grew in size and population. By the end of the 1820s, both Presidents and department heads were overwhelmed with official work, but delegation or provision of assistance were not viable solutions. By the end of the 1820s, federal employment increased from 4,837 employees in 1816 to 36,672 in 1861, as government administration became more complex. The structure of executive departments in 1860 was significantly more intricate than in 1800. The structure of executive departments in 1860 was significantly more complex than in 1800, with the rise of the administrative state due to various historical developments post-Civil War. The rise of the administrative state post-Civil War led to Congress delegating much legislative authority to administrative agencies by 1946, shifting policy-making and budgeting initiatives to the executive branch. The rise of the administrative state post-Civil War led to Congress delegating legislative authority to agencies, which sometimes exercised legislative powers. Congress expanded general management laws to improve executive branch practices, increasing transparency through legislation like the Administrative Procedure Act (1946) and the Freedom of Information Act (1966). Congress further enhanced transparency in oversight of the executive branch by passing key legislation such as the Administrative Procedure Act (1946), the Freedom of Information Act (1966), and the Federal Advisory Committee Act (1972). Additionally, Congress established inspectors general in 1978 and enacted the Congressional Review of Regulations Act to increase executive branch accountability. Congress sought to reassert influence over the budget process with the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act (1974) and passed the Chief Financial Officers Act (1990) to improve agencies' financial management. The compendium's more than 90 entries highlight various laws aimed at bringing disciplined management to executive branch agencies through legislative action and congressional oversight. The curr_chunk discusses the debate over whether laws aimed at bringing disciplined management to executive branch agencies through legislative action and congressional oversight are beneficial or restrictive. The conclusion depends on the viewpoint of the questioner and the situation at hand, with history providing insight. Numerous controversial issues for Congress to consider are highlighted. The curr_chunk discusses the comparison between management practices in the public and private sectors, highlighting similarities and differences. Scholars and practitioners often seek to apply lessons learned from one sector to the other while recognizing key differences. Management and public administration scholars caution against applying private-sector management principles to government agencies, citing key differences that should be recognized and respected. Public administration scholar Wallace Sayre famously stated that \"public and private management are fundamentally alike in all unimportant respects.\" One significant difference is that public-sector agencies and private-sector companies operate under different sets of laws, regulating behaviors for distinct purposes. Government agencies and private-sector companies operate under different laws to regulate behaviors for distinct purposes. The Constitution and public law give the government coercive power to regulate private activity and collect taxes, with checks and balances in place to prevent abuse of power. Federal agencies must act within the authority of public law established by Congress, the President, and the courts on behalf of the American public. Government agencies and private-sector companies operate under different laws. Public law, formulated by Congress, the President, and the courts, authorizes an agency's mission and how it operates. In contrast, private companies operate under laws that regulate a functioning market economy. Private companies are primarily accountable to their owners or shareholders. Government agencies differ from private sector organizations in various ways. Unlike private companies, government agencies cannot retain earnings for private benefit, allocate resources based on administrator preferences, or choose their own goals. Control over revenues, resources, and agency goals is limited in government agencies. Government agencies are constrained by external entities such as legislatures, courts, politicians, and interest groups, which control revenues, resources, and agency goals. Agency managers must address the demands of these external entities, leading to challenges in measuring agency performance and differences in management practices between the public and private sectors. The compendium of general management laws raises public policy issues regarding management practices in the public and private sectors. Several major themes emerge when viewing the general management laws together, leading to potential management policy options for Congress regarding the discretion left for the executive branch. The debate over how much discretion to give the executive branch in determining agency actions has been ongoing. Providing flexibility to tailor laws to specific circumstances is one argument in favor, while others believe it allows for quicker responsiveness to changing circumstances. Some argue that agency discretion allows for quicker responsiveness to changing circumstances and scientific standard-setting. However, it can also lead to decisions that lack support from Congress. Granting discretion to the executive branch can lead to decisions that lack support from Congress and key stakeholders, potentially putting key decisions in the hands of unelected agency officials. This can result in a lack of transparency and political accountability, as well as limited resources or time for Congress to intervene in a timely manner. Granting discretion to the executive branch can lead to decisions made by unelected agency officials, reducing transparency and political accountability. Congress faced this tension in 2002 and 2003 when considering granting DHS and DOD the ability to determine HRM systems. Similar situations arose in 1993 with the Clinton Administration's NPR and the passage of FASA in 1994. The National Performance Review (NPR) recommended ways to streamline procurement policy, leading to the passage of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 (FASA). Congress faces tension when deciding to delegate authority to agencies, with options to balance flexibility and accountability. Congress can set conditions for delegation of authority to ensure its intentions are carried out by the executive branch and reduce adverse consequences. This can include establishing goals, sanctions, probation periods, or profit-sharing relationships to incentivize agencies to behave in ways that benefit both the agency and the government. To prevent end-of-the-year spending, Congress can set conditions for delegation of authority to incentivize agencies to perform effectively. This can involve screening mechanisms like convening hearings to assess an agency's problem analysis and organizational capacity. Congress can require agencies to report their actions taken, milestones reached, and obtained information to increase accountability and transparency. This can be done through monitoring and reporting requirements, utilizing information technology and the Web for easier access to information. The use of information technology and the Web can improve reporting to Congress by providing real-time updates. However, some argue that excessive reporting requirements can be burdensome. Institutional checks, such as involving additional agencies in decision-making, can help ensure accountability. Congress can involve other agencies in promulgating regulations, require notice and comment before agency actions, provide sequential funding with conditions, mandate independent studies, or use \"committee vetoes\" to prevent actions without approval. Should agency management laws be standardized? The tension between standardization and customization in agency management laws frequently arises for Congress in managing the executive branch. Experts debate whether laws should be standardized across agencies or customized to each agency's specific needs. Standardization in executive branch laws can improve transparency and accountability. The Administrative Procedure Act of 1946 set basic requirements for agency rulemaking. The CFO Act of 1990 mandated audited financial preparation for 24 major departments and agencies. The CFO Act of 1990, amended in 1994 and 2002, required audited financial statements from 24 major executive departments and agencies. The Accountability of Tax Dollars Act extended similar requirements to other executive agencies. Standardization promotes accountability by requiring agencies to justify exceptions, while customization can aid in effective management. Customization can help align an agency's management with its internal and external environment, while standardization promotes accountability by requiring agencies to justify exceptions. Congress uses various mechanisms to direct specific actions for agencies, including authorizing statutes and appropriations. Small agencies were not previously required to prepare audited financial statements. Congress allows for customization in general management laws, such as exempting small agencies from audited financial statement requirements. The Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Defense have been granted authority to customize certain aspects of their HRM systems. The Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) represents a mixed approach in applying general management laws to executive branch agencies, allowing for some flexibility and exceptions within the broader requirements. The Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) required executive branch agencies to develop strategic plans, with a mixed approach that allowed for flexibility and exceptions within the broader requirements. Standardization, customization, and mixed approaches each have advantages and disadvantages in promoting transparency and accountability. Customization in government agencies can sometimes hinder transparency and accountability if not reported in real-time. It can also lead to different entities working at cross-purposes, causing budget pressures. Mixed approaches may suffer from these problems as well. In addition to the three general approaches mentioned earlier, Congress has policy options to avoid problems with agency budgets. Decision-making depends on various factors, including the nature of the problem, history, stakeholders, and other considerations. Regular evaluation of the need for customization or standardization in management laws can improve transparency, accountability, efficiency, and effectiveness. Regular evaluation of the need for customization or standardization in management laws can improve transparency, accountability, efficiency, and effectiveness. Analytical support can come from various sources such as agency management, program evaluations, inspectors general, the General Accounting Office (GAO), and outside scholars. Another option is to reduce the burden on Congress by requiring the executive branch to maintain real-time descriptions of the current state of affairs. The executive branch is required to maintain real-time descriptions of the current state of affairs to assist Congress in monitoring the situation. Fragmentation of civil service laws may complicate monitoring and analyzing government-wide developments in areas like pay and performance management. Reporting requirements are needed for different agency workforces. Establishment of reporting requirements in areas like pay, performance management, and adverse actions for various agency workforces could be managed by central agencies like OMB, OPM, GSA, or FMS to reduce the burden on Congress and the public in analyzing customization and standardization. Real-time reporting on the web may be possible to track management policies. Central agencies like OMB, OPM, GSA, and FMS could be candidates to report customized management policies to enable government-wide analysis. This may incur costs for reporting agencies. General management laws are categorized into functions like financial management, human resources, and procurement, reflecting how organizations operate with functional structures. Functional structures in sectors can boost efficiency through specialization and centralized control over strategic decisions. However, if the functional orientation becomes too inward-looking, organization-wide coordination and decision-making can become problematic. When the functional orientation becomes too inward-looking, organization-wide coordination and decision-making can be hindered, leading to functional silos operating in isolation. This can impede the development of general managers and cause missed opportunities for the organization. Management literature emphasizes the importance of integrating functional perspectives within a broader general management perspective. An integrated, general management perspective is crucial to avoid functional silos and missed opportunities. Different backgrounds and experiences lead to varying viewpoints, highlighting the importance of considering diverse perspectives in decision-making. The importance of developing a general management perspective is highlighted to integrate multiple functional viewpoints for a complete understanding of problems or opportunities. This approach can help avoid functional silos and missed opportunities, as seen in efforts to use information technology for human resources and financial management improvement. A recent example of the importance of a general management perspective is using information technology to improve human resources and financial management. This integrated approach, combined with a focus on individual functions, offers options for addressing executive branch management problems through general management laws that target specific areas like agency finances, technology procurement, and human capital issues. From an integrated general management perspective, laws can provide mutual support to each other, such as through changes to agency authorizing statutes and appropriations. For example, leveraging the E-Government Act of 2002 can help achieve more timely outcomes. To enhance oversight tools, Congress could leverage the E-Government Act of 2002 for more timely financial and performance reporting by utilizing the Federal Enterprise Architecture. Appropriations could be directed to hire and retain contract oversight specialists to support congressional oversight activities. Directing appropriations to hire, train, and retain contract oversight specialists to help agencies manage contracts more effectively; restructuring budget accounts to align resources with individual programs and program evaluations for better results. Leveraging the Chief Human Capital Officers Act of 2002 to assess agencies' staff resources. Leveraging the Chief Human Capital Officers Act of 2002 to develop metrics for assessing agencies' staff resources for contract management and oversight. Other options include integrating various functional perspectives into general management laws for better agency performance. The history of federal government management reform includes efforts to improve agencies' performance and management practices through various functional perspectives such as information policy, regulation, strategic planning, and human resources management. These efforts have involved both legislative and executive branches in enhancing agency management practices. Many efforts have been made to improve federal government management practices, involving legislative and executive branches. Despite these efforts, progress has been challenging. Congress faces difficulties in overseeing executive branch management, particularly in ensuring compliance with general management laws and measuring agencies' progress. Measurement is seen as a strong motivator for action in management literature. Measurement systems can be a strong motivator for action in management practices, as they can drive organizational behavior. However, they can also create perverse incentives, such as focusing only on short-term profits at the expense of long-term sustainability. Employees may show less interest in longer-term performance if the focus is on short-term profits rather than long-term research and development. Achieving clean financial audits may not indicate good fiscal management if achieved through brute force rather than addressing deficient systems. In the last 25 years, agency inspectors general and the GAO have reported major management problems in executive branch agencies in areas like financial management, acquisition, information technology, human resources, and program implementation. GAO has identified high-risk areas and management challenges affecting specific agencies or government-wide. Progress has been made by the executive branch and Congress to address these issues. In the last 25 years, agency inspectors general and the GAO have reported major management problems in executive branch agencies. Progress has been made by the executive branch and Congress to address these issues, but much work remains. Presidential administrations have pursued management reform initiatives, and members of Congress have expressed concern about government management. In 1992, the House Committee on Government Operations recommended actions to improve government management in various areas. Nearly a decade later, Senator Fred Thompson released a report in June 2001 highlighting urgent federal government management problems faced by the administration of President George W. Bush. The House Committee on Government Operations recommended actions to improve government management in 1992. Senator Fred Thompson released a report in June 2001 highlighting urgent federal government management problems faced by the administration of President George W. Bush. The report identified issues with the federal workforce, financial management, information technology, and overlap and duplication. President George W. Bush's Office of Management and Budget released the President's Management Agenda in August 2001, which includes five government-wide initiatives. OMB leads quarterly evaluations of agencies to gauge progress under the PMA. The President's Management Agenda (PMA) includes five government-wide initiatives: Financial Performance, Expanded Electronic Government, and Budget and Performance Integration. OMB evaluates agencies quarterly based on \"stoplight scores\" to assess status and progress for each initiative. Green indicates meeting all standards for success, yellow for achieving some criteria, and red for serious flaws. The agency is evaluated by OMB quarterly based on \"stoplight scores\" - green for meeting all success standards, yellow for achieving some criteria, and red for serious flaws. OMB assesses progress on a case-by-case basis against established deliverables and timelines for the five initiatives. Green indicates implementation proceeding as planned, yellow shows some issues requiring adjustment, and red signifies serious jeopardy and unlikely to achieve objectives. The agency's initiative objectives are at risk and unlikely to be achieved without significant management intervention. The five government-wide PMA initiatives are categorized into functional areas and are meant to be mutually reinforcing. General management laws are utilized to achieve the PMA's goals, such as the Competitive Sourcing initiative leveraging the FAIR Act of 1998. The PMA's goals are achieved through general management laws. Initiatives like Competitive Sourcing leverage the FAIR Act of 1998, Improved Financial Performance leverages various acts, Expanded Electronic Government leverages the Clinger-Cohen Act, E-Government Act, and FISMA, and Strategic Management of Human Capital and Budget and Performance Integration initiatives are implemented. The PMA's goals are achieved through general management laws, including the Clinger-Cohen Act, E-Government Act of 2002, and FISMA. Some agencies have reported progress, but there are concerns about transparency in PMA evaluation practices outside the executive branch. PMA evaluation practices lack transparency outside the executive branch. OMB assessments using the PART tool were more transparent, with detailed worksheets released to show evidence used for assessments. Subjectivity may be a challenge with stoplight scoring criteria. The OMB uses stoplight scoring criteria for agency program assessments, which may introduce subjectivity. Specific success standards are required for initiatives like the Expanded Electronic Government and Strategic Management of Human Capital. Independent evaluation organizations have not verified the agency stoplight scores. The transparency of PMA evaluation practices is lacking outside the executive branch. Independent evaluation organizations have not conducted verification and validation assessments of the overall agency stoplight scores. The scope of the PMA does not cover all aspects of general management laws that outside observers might consider important, such as contract oversight and small business contracting concerns. Real property management issues are also not explicitly addressed by the PMA. The PMA does not address real property management issues or contract oversight concerns. Various entities have tried to improve agency management practices over the years by measuring compliance with general management laws. Agency IGs and GAO have focused on specific problems, while OMB and GAO have identified \"high risk\" areas. Congress has also made efforts to assess general management laws and functional areas. Some in Congress have measured agency compliance with general management laws and functional areas. Representative Stephen Horn and Adam Putnam issued letter grades for financial management and information security performance. Senator Fred Thompson also graded agency annual performance reports. This raises questions about agency evaluations. Congress has issued grades for agency compliance with general management laws and functional areas. Questions arise on how Congress can ensure agencies improve their management practices. Options include maintaining current efforts and measuring agency progress through easily understood cross-agency comparisons. Congress could measure or monitor agency improvement in management practices by maintaining current oversight tools like GAO and agency IGs or through independent verification and validation. Critics argue that Congress does not use these tools effectively enough. Congress could increase oversight of the executive branch by requesting independent verification and validation of PMA stoplight scores. This could boost congressional confidence but may be seen as micromanagement by the executive branch. Congress could enhance oversight by requesting access to final PMA stoplight worksheets from OMB or agencies, allowing for public discussion on executive branch management. Another option is to direct GAO or IGs to develop measures to compare agency progress in improving management practices. Congress could enhance oversight by requesting access to final PMA stoplight worksheets from OMB or agencies, allowing for public discussion on executive branch management. Another option is to direct GAO or IGs to develop measures to compare agency progress in improving management practices, such as amending GPRA to require agencies to address major management problems and high-risk areas in their strategic plans and reports. Congress could require agencies to address major management problems and high-risk areas in their strategic plans and reports, establishing milestones and timelines for improvement. This could be included in the government-wide performance plan, potentially increasing workload for agencies. The expanding set of agency \"chief officer\" positions and interagency councils of these officers could be made statutory or more systematic, potentially increasing workload for agency and OMB personnel. The government has established various chief officer positions within agencies, including inspectors general, chief financial officers, chief information officers, chief human capital officers, and chief acquisition officers. These positions were established by statute in different years. The government has established various chief officer positions within agencies, including inspectors general, chief financial officers, chief information officers, chief human capital officers, and chief acquisition officers. These positions were established by statute in different years. The officers have specific functions, are appointed in various ways, and report to different chief officers. Many positions within agencies can be filled by political or career employees, but CAOs and certain CFOs must be political. Three chief officers (IGs, CFOs, and CIOs) report directly to the agency head, while reporting relationships for CHCOs and CAOs are at the agency head's discretion. The creation history of these positions is not covered in this report, but they were established due to a belief that senior managers in executive branch agencies lacked attention to functional perspectives like financial management. Many observers believed that senior managers in executive branch agencies paid insufficient attention to functional perspectives like financial management. To address this issue, each functional perspective needed to be \"elevated\" within agencies' management ranks. Chief officers were placed into interagency councils by statute or executive order to ensure long-standing problems were addressed. Table 2 summarizes key information about these councils. Table 2 summarizes key information about interagency councils, including membership, chair, statutory provisions, establishment, and website details. Four councils were established by law, while two exist through executive order. The Office of Management and Budget's deputy director for management chairs or vice-chairs each council, allowing the Executive Office of the President to oversee them. The Office of Management and Budget's deputy director for management chairs or vice-chairs interagency councils, allowing the Executive Office of the President to direct their activities. President Reagan established the first council, the President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency (PCIE), in 1981 to combat fraud and waste in government programs. The PCIE was established in 1981 to combat fraud and waste in government programs. It became a source of leverage for IGs seeking resources and independence, endorsed for enhancing lobbying power and building informal networks. Standing committees were formed for sharing ideas and cooperation among IGs. The PCIE, established in 1981, was praised for promoting collaboration among IGs and providing a unique mechanism to address fraud, waste, and abuse issues across the Government. However, it was also criticized as being a \"trade union\" for IGs in the late 1980s. The PCIE, established in 1981, was praised for promoting collaboration among IGs and addressing fraud, waste, and abuse issues. In the late 1980s, it was criticized as a \"trade union\" for IGs. President George H. W. Bush later established the ECIE for IGs appointed by agency heads, along with the CFO Council created by the CFO Act of 1990. The CFO Act of 1990 established the deputy director for management (DDM) position in the President's Office of Management and Budget, giving the DDM chairperson status over the CFO Council. The DDM was responsible for establishing general management policies in various functions including financial management, procurement policy, and human resources management. The CFO Council became more active in 1994. The CFO Council, established by the CFO Act of 1990, became more active in 1994 with recommendations to broaden membership, elect officers, and set their own agenda. Similar to the PCIE, the council formed committees for special emphasis areas. OMB supported these actions, recognizing the leveraging opportunities despite modest resources available to the deputy director for management. The CFO Council, established by the CFO Act of 1990, became more active in 1994 with recommendations to broaden membership, elect officers, and set their own agenda. OMB supported these actions, recognizing the leveraging opportunities despite modest resources available to the deputy director for management. The commentator concluded that the deputy director has tremendous leveraging opportunities through the interagency councils he chairs, with the CFO Council serving as a model for other interagency efforts. Congress later established the CIO Council in 2002, the CHCO Council in 2002, and the CAO Council in 2003, which have been met with little criticism. The establishment of IGs, CFOs, and CIOs has been successful in bringing focus to agency management practices, despite facing challenges such as high turnover among CIOs and difficulties with change management. Some commentators argue for broader improvements in performance measurement. Potential difficulties with change management and performance measurement have been highlighted in agencies, even after the creation of positions like IGs, CFOs, and CIOs. Management scholars caution against functional silos that hinder a more integrated management perspective. Observers have also noted challenges with interagency councils of chief officers. Interagency councils of chief officers have been noted as beneficial for improving federal management, according to public management scholars and former OMB official testimony. The former OMB official testified that interagency councils, like the Chief Human Capital Officers Council, are crucial for sharing knowledge and best practices to improve federal management. Within the Federal Government, regular meetings among different parts are valuable for knowledge sharing and management. However, it is important to avoid a narrow functional perspective that may overlook other important aspects of agency management. Scholars and practitioners suggest re-thinking the approach to improving federal executive branch management. Some scholars and practitioners suggest re-thinking the structure and role of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) within the Executive Office of the President to improve federal executive branch management. Congress may need to consider questions about chief officers and interagency councils, such as the need for additional chief officers, the preservation of institutional memory for political appointees, and the statutory status of councils. To address the need for institutional memory and continuity in chief officer positions held by political appointees, considerations include making all councils statutory, determining funding sources, and increasing accountability to Congress. The idea of establishing agency \"chief security officers\" (CSOs) has been proposed to ensure government service availability during emergencies and heightened security risks. Establishing agency \"chief security officers\" (CSOs) is being considered due to the increasing awareness of security risks for federal agencies. A 2002 report found that many corporate CEOs have designated CSOs, who often focus on information technology. However, in some large enterprises, CSOs handle all security responsibilities, including physical security. While creating statutory CSO positions may lead to conflicts with CIOs over information security, it could enhance overall security measures. Establishing statutory CSO positions could lead to turf battles between CIOs and CSOs but may bring a more integrated approach to security and risk management at federal agencies. Some argue that requiring an additional chief officer may be excessive due to the increasing number of chief officers. Observers note that agencies often do not adequately evaluate program performance or results. Many observers believe agencies lack the capacity, management attention, and resources to adequately evaluate program performance. Congress could establish chief program evaluation officer positions in major agencies to address this issue. Evaluation methods vary across programs due to their interdisciplinary nature. Establishing chief program evaluation officer positions in major agencies could create a \"seat at the table\" for program evaluation in agency senior management teams, aiding efforts to improve performance or coordinate programs with overlapping missions. Critics argue that adding more chief officer positions would be excessive. If Congress decides to alter or establish new chief officer positions, there are various options for appointments. Table 1 outlines the appointment options for existing chief officers, with some positions mandated to be political, others career-based, and some left to agency discretion. Recent discussions have debated the benefits of political appointees versus career officials in key positions. Political appointees can provide a functional perspective at the leadership table, while career officials offer continuity and institutional memory. In enacting the CFO Act, Congress reflected both perspectives on chief officer reporting relationships. CFOs and CIOs must report directly to the agency head, while IGs report to the agency head or the official \"next in rank.\" CHCOs and CAOs have different reporting relationships. The reporting relationships of CFOs and CIOs are mandated by law to report directly to the agency head, while IGs report to the agency head or the official \"next in rank.\" However, the reporting relationships of CHCOs and CAOs are at the discretion of each agency head. The debate revolves around whether these reporting relationships are still appropriate in addressing major management problems and agency management needs. One argument for a direct reporting relationship to the agency head is to ensure that the chief officer has personal access to senior leadership, despite the challenge of agency heads having numerous direct reports. The debate revolves around the reporting relationships of agency heads and their direct reports, with a focus on the potential challenges of having too many direct reports. Congress is considering whether to make IG councils statutory or maintain them as organizations established by executive order. The debate centers on the reporting relationships of agency heads and their direct reports, focusing on the challenges of having too many direct reports. Congress is considering whether to make IG councils statutory or maintain them as organizations established by executive order. The vice chair of the PCIE believes codification would improve training, strengthen the IG-Congress relationship, and enhance coordination among IG offices in the federal government. Some argue this change could limit the President's flexibility or control. Funding for interagency councils is also being discussed by Congress. Funding for interagency councils is being discussed by Congress. The IG councils self-finance their activities via MOUs instead of appropriations or transfers. Operations are funded by different IG offices through MOUs. Funding for the CFO, CIO, and Procurement Executives Councils is done through interagency transfers or reimbursements under Title VI general provisions in the Transportation-Treasury appropriations bill. These transfers are controlled by OMB and administered after transfer. Funding for the CFO, CIO, and Procurement Executives Councils is done through interagency transfers or reimbursements under Title VI general provisions in the Transportation-Treasury appropriations bill. These transfers are under the control of OMB and administered by the General Services Administration. Congress could maintain the status quo or consider separate appropriations for each council, potentially giving Congress more control and improving institutional memory and continuity across presidential administrations. Congress could consider altering the reporting and strategic planning requirements for interagency councils to improve institutional memory and continuity. Some councils currently have no reporting or strategic planning requirements, while others only report to the President or Congress without articulating strategic plans. For example, the IG councils are required to report to the President, but the CFO, CIO, and CAO Councils lack statutory requirements to report to Congress. The CFO, CIO, and CAO Councils do not have statutory requirements to report to Congress or prepare strategic plans. Congress could require them to submit plans or reports to the President or Congress. OMB could be required to submit an overall plan for leading the interagency chief officer councils, increasing transparency and accountability to Congress. The interagency councils could benefit from planning and reporting requirements to increase transparency and accountability to Congress, but this may limit the President's discretion and raise costs for the councils or OMB."
