    "content": "The Washoe Tribe Land Conveyance is addressed in Section 1. Congress finds that the Washoe Tribe's ancestral homeland in the Lake Tahoe area was approximately 5,000 square miles, with Lake Tahoe at its heart. In 1997, the Washoe people were recognized as indigenous to the Lake Tahoe Basin through meetings convened by Federal, State, and local governments. The Washoe Tribe's ancestral homeland in the Lake Tahoe area was recognized in 1997 through meetings convened by governments. The resulting agreement includes objectives to support the Tribe's traditional land use and access to Lake Tahoe for cultural practices. The Washoe Tribe aims to reestablish traditional cultural practices at Lake Tahoe, ensuring members have opportunities for spiritual renewal, land stewardship, horticulture, subsistence gathering, and family bonds. The Secretary of Agriculture will convey approximately 24.3 acres of land in the Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit to the Secretary of the Interior for the Washoe Tribe, focusing on spiritual renewal, land stewardship, horticulture, subsistence gathering, and family bonds. The Secretary of Agriculture will convey land in the Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit to the Washoe Tribe, with a reservation of a nonexclusive easement for public and administrative access over Forest Development Road #15N67 to National Forest System land. The Secretary of Agriculture will provide a reciprocal easement to the Washoe Tribe for vehicular access to a parcel over Forest Development Road #15N67 for administrative, safety, and accessibility purposes. The Tribe and its members must limit the use of the conveyed parcel to traditional and customary uses and stewardship. The Tribe and its members must limit the use of the parcel to traditional and customary uses and conservation for the benefit of the Tribe. They are not allowed to have permanent residential, recreational, or commercial development on the parcel, and must comply with environmental requirements. The Tribe must limit the use of the parcel to traditional and customary uses for their benefit, without permanent development. They must comply with environmental requirements no less protective than those of the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency. If the Tribe violates these rules and fails to take corrective action, the Secretary of the Interior may terminate their rights to the parcel. If the Tribe violates rules for parcel use and fails to take corrective action, title to the parcel will revert to the Secretary of Agriculture. The Senate passed the bill on August 1, 2002."
