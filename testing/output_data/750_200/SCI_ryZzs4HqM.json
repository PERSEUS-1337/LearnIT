Forecasting methods for renewable generation and electric load prediction are categorized into regressive methods like AR, ARIMA, and ES models, nonlinear stationary models, and AI techniques such as ANN and k-nearest. Forecasting methods for renewable generation and electric load prediction include regressive methods like AR, ARIMA, and ES models, nonlinear stationary models, AI techniques such as ANN and k-nearest, NWP models, sensing (remote and local), and hybrid models like neuro-fuzzy systems and ANN with satellite-derived cloud indices. NWP models are based on physical laws governing weather and are useful for forecasting solar radiation in areas without ground data. NWP models are powerful tools for forecasting solar radiation in areas without ground data, but they have limitations in predicting cloud fields accurately due to coarse spatial resolution. Regional NWP models are downscaled to improve site-specific forecasts, addressing the issue of cloud prediction accuracy. Satellite-based irradiance measurement is a useful tool for areas without ground-based data, providing a way to analyze air mass evolution through image superimposition. This method helps address the limitations of NWP models in predicting cloud fields accurately. Satellite-based irradiance measurement is a valuable tool for analyzing air mass evolution through image superimposition. The radiometer on the satellite records radiance, impacted by atmospheric conditions. Limitations include accurately determining radiance values under clear sky and dense cloud conditions, and the use of empirical or statistical algorithms for solar irradiance forecasting. Forecasting solar irradiance using satellite remote sensing involves algorithms classified as empirical or statistical. These algorithms rely on statistical regression between surface measurements and satellite data, requiring ground-based solar data. Short-term solar forecasting research has shifted towards timeseries analysis using statistical models and AI techniques, such as linear stationary models. Solar forecasting research has evolved towards timeseries analysis using statistical models and AI techniques. Statistical techniques include linear stationary models, nonlinear stationary models, and linear nonstationary models. These models have advantages over NWP and sensing methods but are limited by assumptions of normality and linearity. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) offer advantages over conventional statistical techniques for solar forecasting by modeling complex non-linear relationships between exogenous variables like humidity, temperature, pressure, and Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI). Deep Neural Networks (DNN) with multiple hidden layers are able to represent these relationships effectively. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) have not been explored for solar forecasting, unlike feedforward neural networks. RNN captures sequence dynamics using cyclic feedback connections. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) capture sequence dynamics using cyclic feedback connections, unlike feedforward neural networks. RNNs exhibit dynamic temporal behavior by using internal memory to process arbitrary sequences, which can be utilized in predicting future irradiance by considering input from previous time steps. Recent advancements in parallelism, network architectures, and optimization techniques have further improved RNN capabilities. Recent advances in parallelism, network architectures, and optimization techniques have enabled successful large-scale learning with RNNs for predicting future irradiance by considering input from previous time steps. Most previous solar forecasting methods were limited to specific time horizons, and current state-of-the-art methods focus on averaged rather than instantaneous forecasting. This paper proposes two RNN-based approaches for solar forecasting that can predict solar irradiance for multiple time horizons, including 1-hour, 2-hour, 3-hour, and 4-hour intervals. The methods can handle time-series data and provide forward predictions efficiently. Our proposed RNN method efficiently predicts solar irradiance values for multiple time horizons, enabling real-time forecasts based on live data.

The RNN input consists of a sequence denoted by (x BID0 , x BID1 ,...x (T) ) with three dimensions: Mini-batch Size, Number of columns in the vector per time-step, and Number of time-steps. The input vector unfolds over time in the RNN, unlike a multilayer feedforward neural network where the input vector is fed to neurons at the input layer. The RNN input consists of a sequence with three dimensions: Mini-batch Size, Number of columns in the vector per time-step, and Number of time-steps. The input vector unfolds over time in the RNN. The net input to the neuron in the next layer is calculated using weights and bias terms, followed by an activation function to produce the output. The proposed architecture uses Rectified Linear Units (ReLU) as the activation function and unfolds the input over time using backpropagation through time (BPTT) for training. Mean Squared Loss (MSE) is used as the loss function to compute gradients for the regression problem. The author's motivation for using a RNN is to learn the complex relationship between sequences of exogenous variables impacting solar irradiance, including non-linear factors like atmospheric conditions leading to cloud formation. The RMSE is calculated for benchmarking, with gradients computed using back-propagation-through time and weights updated using stochastic gradient descent optimizer to minimize the Squared Loss (MSE) between target and predicted outputs. The algorithm in the proposed approach recognizes non-linear factors like atmospheric conditions affecting cloud formation, leading to lower prediction RMSE compared to other approaches. The algorithm was trained and tested on data from NOAA's SURFRAD BID30 sites, using various input features related to solar irradiance. Global solar, direct-normal solar, downwelling diffuse solar, downwelling thermal infrared, downwelling IR case temp, downwelling IR dome temp, upwelling thermal infrared, upwelling IR case temp, upwelling IR dome temp, global UVB, photosynthetically active radiation, net solar, net infrared, net radiation, 10-meter air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, wind direction, and station pressure are important measurements for understanding atmospheric conditions. According to Dobbs BID28, global downwelling solar measurements are the most representative. According to Dobbs BID28, global downwelling solar measurements best represent Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) at SURFRAD sites. Exploratory data analysis validated this, showing daily averages of Clear Sky GHI and global downwelling solar follow the same trend and are positively correlated. The Bird model is used to calculate clear sky GHI, denoted by , representing theoretical GHI at time t assuming zero cloud coverage. The Bird model calculates clear sky GHI using the clear sky index ( ) at time t. Mean Squared Error (MSE) measures the difference between target and neural network output during training. Root Mean Squared Error is later calculated for benchmarking. The Unified Recurrent Neural Network Architecture algorithm is divided into three main blocks: importing site-specific data, obtaining clear sky global horizontal irradiance values from the Bird Model, and merging the two datasets. The clear sky index parameter is created as the ratio of observed global downwelling solar and GHI. The data is split into train and testing sets. The clear sky index parameter is defined as the ratio of observed global downwelling solar and GHI. Missing values are replaced by mean or neighborhood values. Exploratory data analysis is conducted to identify and eliminate outliers. A Recurrent Neural Network model is defined with specified architectural parameters. Sequence length is also defined for time-steps. The Recurrent Neural Network model is trained and tested using specified architectural parameters such as input layer, hidden dimension, layer dimension, and output dimension. The model iterates through the dataset for a pre-set number of epochs, calculating RMSE to determine model performance. If RMSE is unsatisfactory, hyperparameters are adjusted and the model is retrained until a satisfactory RMSE is achieved. The algorithm is trained using data from the years 2010 and 2011 from the SURFRAD dataset.
