    "content": "TRANSFER OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE OF THE FLATHEAD IRRIGATION PROJECT, MONTANA. The purpose of this Act is to preserve family farms and ranches in Montana by transferring responsibility for the Flathead Irrigation Project without affecting water rights negotiations. Definitions include \"contract\" and \"irrigation district.\" The term \"irrigation district\" refers to one or more districts organized under the irrigation systems on the Flathead Indian Reservation in Montana. The term \"project\" specifically denotes the Irrigation Division of the Flathead Irrigation Project constructed under a specific Act. The Flathead Irrigation Project, established under specific Acts, involves the Secretary of the Interior and the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes. Within a year of this Act's enactment, the Secretary must offer a contract. The Secretary must offer a contract to the irrigation district within a year of the Act's enactment, allowing them to operate and manage the project, including all rights and powers previously held by the Secretary. The contract will include provisions identifying trust responsibilities. The contract offered to the irrigation district by the Secretary must include provisions identifying trust responsibilities related to the operation and maintenance of the Irrigation Division, ensuring the United States can fulfill those responsibilities and maintain instream flows for fisheries. The irrigation district will maintain instream flows for fisheries as established by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, ensuring obligations related to construction costs repayment are unaffected by the Act. The irrigation district can make an accelerated payment of $1,000,000 on the repayment contract with the United States by December 31, 2001. The repayment contracts will be amended to ensure that net revenues from the Power Division will not be used for the Irrigation Division's operation and maintenance costs. The project will not cover operation and maintenance costs of the Irrigation Division and allows for contract revocation if the irrigation district damages tribal trust assets knowingly. The project's operation must align with the Bureau of Indian Affairs plan to protect tribal trust assets, with changes allowed based on new information or decisions. The contract with the irrigation district cannot be revoked unless they refuse to comply with new information, policies, decisions, or negotiations. Negotiations must begin promptly to finalize a contract within a year. The Secretary must transfer ownership of equipment and supplies to the irrigation district under the contract within a year of the Act's enactment. An inventory list of all supplies and equipment must be provided to the district. The Act requires the Secretary to transfer ownership of equipment and supplies to the irrigation district within a year of enactment. The district will receive an inventory list of all items purchased with operation and maintenance funds. The contract prohibits the transfer of real property rights or water rights to the district. The Act does not impact water rights negotiations between the State of Montana, the United States, and the Tribe."
