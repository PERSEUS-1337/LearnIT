    "content": "The \"Energy Efficient Government Technology Act\" is the short title of the Act. It focuses on promoting energy-efficient and energy-saving information and communications technologies. Section 543 of the National Energy Conservation Policy Act is amended to include a Federal Implementation Strategy for Energy-Efficient and Energy-Saving Information and Communications Technologies, requiring collaboration between Federal agencies and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. The Federal agencies must collaborate with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to develop a flexible and cost-effective implementation strategy for energy-efficient information and communications technologies. The Federal agencies must collaborate with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to develop a flexible and cost-effective implementation strategy for energy-efficient information and communications technologies, based on specific operating requirements and statutory mission. In developing the strategy, each agency shall consider ICT and related infrastructure and practices, such as advanced metering infrastructure, ICT services and products, and efficient data center strategies. The agency must implement efficient data center strategies, ICT power management, building information modeling for energy management, and secure telework tools to increase efficiency and utilization and realize cost savings and rewards. The Director, in consultation with the Secretary, shall establish performance goals for evaluating Federal agencies' efforts in improving energy-efficient ICT systems within 180 days of this subsection's enactment. The Director will establish performance goals for energy-efficient data centers, including specifications and benchmarks for Federal data center operators to improve energy efficiency and cost savings. The Director will set targets for increased energy efficiency in Federal data centers, focusing on Power Usage Effectiveness, asset utilization, and best practices for achieving benchmarks through energy savings performance contracting. The administration will measure IT costs and cost savings achieved through energy-efficient solutions over a 3 to 5-year period. The Director will maintain a Governmentwide Data Center Task Force comprised of Federal data center program managers, facilities managers, and sustainability officers. The Governmentwide Data Center Task Force includes Federal data center program managers, facilities managers, and sustainability officers. Their duties involve collaborating to achieve agency and Federal energy efficiency goals, as well as sharing best practices with the private sector. Each Federal agency subject to the requirements of this subsection must include a description of their efforts and results related to energy efficiency in their agency report. Additionally, starting in October, OMB will issue government efficiency reports and scorecards. Starting October 1, 2013, OMB will include in its annual report a description of Federal agencies' efforts and results related to energy efficiency. SEC. 3. ENERGY EFFICIENT DATA CENTERS. Section 453 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 is amended to designate an information technology industry organization to coordinate the program described in subsection (b) within 30 days of the Energy Efficient Government Technology Act's enactment. The designation must be made public, including on a website. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 is amended to designate an information technology industry organization to coordinate a program and make the designation public. Additionally, a study is required to provide an update on server and data center energy efficiency by December 31, 2013. The Public Law 109-431 amendment requires a comparison of original estimates with new data from 2007 to 2012, an analysis of information technology impact, and updated projections and recommendations. The Secretary will collaborate with designated organizations to provide updated projections and recommendations for best practices in the public and private sectors. Additionally, a data center energy practitioner program will be maintained to certify energy practitioners for evaluating energy usage and efficiency in data centers. The energy practitioner program certifies individuals to evaluate energy usage and efficiency in data centers. Federal agencies must have their data centers evaluated every 4 years by certified practitioners. The Secretary will establish an open data initiative for Federal data center energy usage data to promote innovation while safeguarding national security interests. The initiative will involve collaboration with designated organizations and the Federal Chief Information Officer, and may utilize the online Data Center Maturity Model. The Secretary will consider using the online Data Center Maturity Model in establishing the initiative. Collaboration will be done to harmonize global specifications and metrics for data center energy efficiency. An efficiency metric will be developed to measure the energy efficiency of the overall data center. The Secretary will consider using the online Data Center Maturity Model to establish the initiative and collaborate on harmonizing global specifications and metrics for data center energy efficiency. An efficiency metric will be developed to measure the energy efficiency of the overall data center."
