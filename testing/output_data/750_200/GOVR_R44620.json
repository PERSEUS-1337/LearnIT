    "content": "A biologic or biological product is a therapeutic drug or vaccine made from living organisms like human, animal, yeast, or microorganisms. They consist of proteins, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, or cells used in transplantation. Biosimilars are similar but not identical to brand-name biologics. Biologics are drugs made by pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies, while most drugs are synthesized chemically. Generic drugs are identical to brand-name drugs. Chemical drugs have a simpler molecular structure compared to biologics. For example, aspirin has a small molecular structure, while Remicade, a biologic drug, has a much larger and complex structure. The drug aspirin has a simple molecular structure with nine carbon atoms, eight hydrogen atoms, and four oxygen atoms. In contrast, the biologic drug Remicade has a much larger and complex structure with over 6,000 carbon atoms, almost 10,000 hydrogen atoms, and about 2,000 oxygen atoms. Inflectra, a biosimilar to Remicade, was approved by the FDA in April 2016. The FDA regulates both biologics and chemical drugs through the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER). CBER oversees traditional biologics, gene therapy products, cellular therapy products, and human tissue used in transplantation. The FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) regulates products like allergenic extracts, gene therapy products, cellular therapy products, and human tissue used in transplantation. The FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) oversees prescription brand-name and generic drugs, over-the-counter drugs, and most therapeutic biologics. Therapeutic biologics regulated by CDER include monoclonal antibodies. Therapeutic biologics regulated by CDER include monoclonal antibodies, cytokines, and growth factors. Monoclonal antibodies bind to specific substances in the body and can carry drugs or toxins. Cytokines control the immune system and are used to fight cancer and infections. Growth factors are substances that regulate cell division and survival. Biologics and biosimilars, including interleukins, interferons, colony-stimulating factors, growth factors like somatropin, enzymes, and immunomodulators, are substances used in cancer treatment. Enzyme inhibitors may block enzymes needed for cancer cell growth. Special handling, such as refrigeration, is often required for these treatments. Biologics and biosimilars are specialized drugs that can stimulate or suppress the immune system to help fight cancer, infections, or other diseases. They require special handling, such as refrigeration, to avoid contamination and are usually administered via injection or infusion. These drugs are often referred to as specialty drugs due to their unique requirements. Specialty drugs, including biologics, are expensive and may need specialized facilities for dispensing. The term specialty drugs refers to expensive drugs that require special handling, such as biologics. Some biologic medications like Soliris and Vimizim can cost over $250,000 annually per patient. Spending on biologics in the United States reached $105.5 billion in 2016, with $3.2 billion spent on biologics subject to biosimilar competition. In 2016, $105.5 billion was spent on biologics in the US, with $3.2 billion spent on biologics subject to biosimilar competition. Spending on biologics has increased by 10% annually since 2011. Biologics accounted for 63% of prescription drug spending in 2014. In 2016, $105.5 billion was spent on biologics in the US, with $3.2 billion spent on biologics subject to biosimilar competition. Biologics spending has grown by 10% annually since 2011, accounting for 63% of prescription drug spending in 2014. Biologics are often more expensive in the US compared to Europe and Canada, where biosimilars have reduced prices significantly. Congress has taken steps to lower the price of chemical drugs through legislation like the 1984 Hatch-Waxman Act. The 1984 Hatch-Waxman Act allowed FDA approval of generic chemical drugs, lowering drug prices by 60% to 90%. Congress used a similar approach in 2010 for biologics to provide lower-cost alternatives. The 1984 Hatch-Waxman Act enabled FDA approval of generic chemical drugs, reducing prices by 60% to 90%. Generic drugs save costs by avoiding clinical trials and initial research expenses. Generic companies must prove to the FDA that their product is identical to the original before marketing approval. This \"sameness\" allows them to reference the FDA's safety and effectiveness findings for the original drug. The generic company can rely on the FDA's previous findings of safety and effectiveness for the approved drug. Generic drugs are interchangeable with brand-name drugs and other generics using the same reference drug. The sponsor must meet manufacturing standards and reporting requirements. In 1982, the FDA approved the first human biologic drug, human insulin (Humulin-R). The FDA approved the first human biologic drug, human insulin (Humulin-R), in 1982, marking the beginning of biotechnology industry's development of therapeutic agents. Subsequent biologics included human growth hormone (Protropin), alpha interferon (Intron-A), tissue plasminogen activator (Activase), and erythropoietin (Epogen). Biological products are regulated by the FDA through a biologics license application (BLA) under the Public Health Service Act (PHSA). Regulatory responsibility was transferred from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to the FDA in 1972. The FDA regulates all chemical prescription drugs through new drug applications (NDA) or abbreviated new drug applications (ANDA) under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA). The Hatch-Waxman Act allowed for the approval of generic drugs but did not include a mechanism for follow-on biologics/biosimilars under the PHSA. Companies could only submit follow-on biologics applications for FDA review for a small number of \"natural\" products. In 1941, Congress granted the FDA authority over marketing insulin, a small protein regulating sugar metabolism. Companies were limited in submitting follow-on biologics applications for therapeutic biologics licensed under the PHSA. The FDA was given authority over the marketing of insulin, a small protein regulating sugar metabolism. Insulin, along with a few other natural source biological products, was regulated as drugs under the FFDCA instead of as biologics under the PHSA. The FDA lacked clear regulatory authority to approve biosimilars for specialty biologic drug products, leading to market competition challenges as patent protection approached expiration. The Generic Pharmaceutical Association advocated for the FDA to establish a regulatory system for biosimilars approval. The Association for Accessible Medicines advocated for FDA approval of biosimilars, while the Biotechnology Industry Organization filed a petition to inhibit biosimilar approval. In contrast, Europe had fewer barriers, with the European Medicines Agency authorizing the marketing of several biosimilar products starting in 2006. In 2006, the first biosimilar product, Omnitrope, a human growth hormone, was authorized. FDA approval in the United States followed a court ruling in favor of Sandoz, the sponsor of Omnitrope. Many more biosimilar products were approved in the following years. Sandoz alleged FDA violated its obligation to approve Omnitrope within 180 days. The 505(b)(2) pathway was used for Omnitrope approval in 2006. FDA stated this approval did not establish a pathway for other follow-on biologic drugs. Congress needs to change the law for approval of other biotech products. In March 2010, Congress established a new regulatory authority for FDA to approve biosimilar and interchangeable biological products under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act. This was enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act, allowing FDA to collect user fees from industry. Congress must change the law for approval of other biotech products. Under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA) of 2009, FDA was authorized to approve biosimilar and interchangeable biological products under the Affordable Care Act. The Act allows FDA to collect user fees from industry. The terms biosimilar and interchangeable are defined by FDA, with a biosimilar product being demonstrated as highly similar to the reference product with no clinically meaningful differences in safety, purity, and potency. To meet the higher standard of interchangeability, a biosimilar product must demonstrate the same clinical results as the reference product in any patient. Interchangeable products can be substituted by a pharmacist without significant risk. The FDA released final guidance on the new biosimilars pathway in April 2015 after public meetings and feedback on draft guidance documents. The FDA released final guidance on biosimilars in April 2015 after public meetings and feedback. Companies must submit an application demonstrating biosimilarity through analytical, animal, and clinical studies. The FDA requires companies to demonstrate biosimilarity through analytical, animal, and clinical studies for biosimilar applications. Any changes to the manufacturing process must be shown to maintain product quality attributes for safety and effectiveness. The FDA requires companies to demonstrate biosimilarity through analytical, animal, and clinical studies for biosimilar applications. Changes to the manufacturing process must maintain product quality attributes for safety and effectiveness. Brand-name biologics like Remicade underwent multiple manufacturing changes, each requiring a demonstration of comparability through various assays. FDA states that variability in biological products can be effectively assessed and managed. The marketing launch of three U.S. biosimilars is being delayed by patent infringement lawsuits filed by brand-name manufacturers, impacting sales of five biosimilars approved by the FDA. Pfizer has sued Johnson & Johnson for allegedly using exclusionary contracts for their biosimilar Inflectra. Pfizer has sued Johnson & Johnson for anticompetitive tactics to prevent insurers from covering biosimilar Inflectra, impacting sales of other biosimilars. In 2017, high pharmaceutical costs, especially for biologics, have sparked interest in the government's role in developing new therapeutics. Many brand-name biologics were discovered by public-sector research institutions. FDA approved Zarxio as the first biosimilar in the US in March 2015. In March 2015, FDA approved Zarxio as the first biosimilar in the United States, followed by the approval of Inflectra in April 2016. Zarxio is biosimilar to Neupogen, while Inflectra is biosimilar to Remicade. In April 2016, FDA approved a second biosimilar, Inflectra (infliximab-dyyb), which is biosimilar to the brand-name drug Remicade (infliximab). Inflectra is made by Celltrion, Inc., in the Republic of Korea, for Pfizer, and was marketed in the United States by Pfizer at a price 15% below Remicade. In 2016, Pfizer started selling Inflectra in the US at a price 15% lower than Remicade. Pfizer sued J&J in 2017 for anticompetitive practices related to biosimilar-exclusion contracts. Another biosimilar, Renflexis, was approved by the FDA in April 2017. In 2016, Pfizer launched Inflectra in the US at a 15% lower price than Remicade. Pfizer sued J&J in 2017 for anticompetitive practices. Renflexis, another biosimilar, was FDA-approved in April 2017. The rebate offered by J&J for Remicade is a strong financial incentive for insurers to prefer the higher-priced brand over biosimilars. Brand-name manufacturers use mechanisms to maintain their preferred position against biosimilar manufacturers offering discounts. In response to biosimilar manufacturers offering price discounts, branded manufacturers can create a \"rebate trap\" by withdrawing rebates on the branded biologic, causing payer costs to double for patients continuing the branded product. If only 50% of patients switch to the biosimilar, the rebate trap ensures payer total costs remain high even with a 60% price difference between the biosimilar and branded product. The rebate trap can cause payer costs to increase if only 50% of patients switch to the biosimilar, requiring a near-complete switch to avoid increased costs. Patients new to a biological therapy are less than 20%, with the majority being stable patients on the branded product. According to Pfizer's lawsuit, providers have been reluctant to purchase Inflectra, with only about 10% of healthcare providers using infliximab having bought no Inflectra at all. Inflectra has secured less than 4% of total infliximab unit sales in the United States. Pfizer's lawsuit against J&J highlights the lack of coverage for Inflectra by national commercial health insurers and the low market share it has captured in the United States. J&J has raised the price of Remicade and increased government reimbursements, potentially stifling competition from biosimilars. If these anticompetitive practices persist, they could set a precedent for other biologic originator firms. In response to Pfizer's lawsuit against J&J for anticompetitive practices, J&J's president Scott White stated that competition is driving down the cost of Remicade. The FDA approved a third biosimilar, Erelzi, in August 2016, which is biosimilar to the brand-name drug Enbrel. In August 2016, FDA approved a third biosimilar, Erelzi (etanercept-szzs), manufactured by Sandoz, which is biosimilar to the brand-name drug Enbrel (etanercept) by Amgen. Enbrel is one of the top-selling drugs worldwide and in the United States. Erelzi is approved for all indications on the label for Enbrel. Erelzi, a biosimilar to Enbrel, was approved by the FDA in August 2016. The approval was based on comprehensive data confirming its similarity to the reference product. Clinical studies included healthy volunteers and patients with chronic plaque psoriasis. The FDA approved Erelzi, a biosimilar to Enbrel, in August 2016. A release date for marketing has not been set due to a lawsuit filed by Amgen against Sandoz and its parent company Novartis. In September 2016, FDA approved another biosimilar, Amjevita, manufactured by Amgen, which is biosimilar to Humira. Humira (adalimumab) was discovered by scientists at Rockefeller University and Scripps, licensed to Abbott Laboratories in 2002. Amjevita, a biosimilar to Humira, was approved for 7 indications compared to Humira's 10 indications. Due to patent litigation, Amjevita may not be available until 2018. Renflexis, another biosimilar, was approved by the FDA in April 2017. Renflexis, a biosimilar to Remicade, was approved by the FDA in April 2017 and is made by Samsung Bioepsis. It will be commercially available in the United States through a partnership with Merck. In August 2017, FDA approved Cyltezo, a biosimilar to Humira, manufactured by Boehringer Ingelheim. Humira was originally discovered by scientists at Rockefeller University and Scripps. Abbott Laboratories was licensed by FDA to market Humira in 2002. AbbVie filed a lawsuit against BI in August 2017 for infringing on Humira patents, delaying the launch of Cyltezo. FDA approved Mvasi, a biosimilar to Avastin, in September 2017. Genentech received FDA approval to market Avastin in 2004. Mvasi is a biosimilar to Avastin, which is a top-selling drug in the United States. The proprietary name of a drug product is the trademarked name used for marketing. The Purple Book lists licensed biological products, including biosimilars. The Purple Book lists biological products, including biosimilars and interchangeable products, licensed by FDA under the PHS Act, along with the nonproprietary names. FDA released draft guidance on nonproprietary names for drug products. The FDA released guidance on nonproprietary naming of biological products in August 2015, finalized on January 12, 2017. The guidance provides the FDA's rationale for naming biosimilars using a proper name that combines the core name and a specific identifier. The nonproprietary name for originator biological, related biological, and biosimilar products will be a combination of a core name and a four-letter suffix. The FDA is considering the appropriate suffix format for interchangeable products. For originator biological products, the core name will be the name adopted by the USAN Council. The FDA uses core names selected by the USAN Council for reference products, while in Europe, reference drugs and biosimilars use the International Nonproprietary Name (INN) system. The WHO selects INNs based on expert advice, and in 2016, released the Biological Qualifier (BQ) proposal for biosimilar naming. In January 2016, the WHO proposed the Biological Qualifier (BQ) for biosimilar naming, which is a code used with the INN to uniquely identify biological substances. The biosimilar industry supports a shared nonproprietary name, while innovator companies prefer a naming scheme that distinguishes between reference biologic products and biosimilars. The Federal Trade Commission expressed concern that the FDA's naming proposal for biosimilars could lead to physicians incorrectly believing that biosimilars differ significantly from reference biologics, potentially deterring physicians from prescribing biosimilars and hindering market competition. The FTC expressed concern about the FDA's naming proposal for biosimilars potentially impacting market competition by causing confusion among physicians about the differences between biosimilars and reference biologics. The FDA's proposal for biosimilar naming aims to use the same USAN as the reference biologic to avoid confusion among physicians about the differences between biosimilars and reference biologics. The addition of unique suffixes may lead to misconceptions about clinical differences. Participants at an FTC workshop on biosimilars argue that the term \"identical\" is misused to create fear and misunderstanding among physicians. Biosimilars are not identical to biologics, as variability is inherent in biologics. FDA's labeling for prescription drug products provides information on safety and effectiveness for healthcare providers to determine suitability for patients. The FDA's final rule in 2006 outlined the content and format of labeling for prescription drug products, including biological products. The FDA-approved labeling contains essential information for safe and effective use by healthcare practitioners. The FDA requires prescription drug labeling to provide essential information for safe and effective use by healthcare practitioners, including warnings, indications, dosage, contraindications, precautions, adverse reactions, drug interactions, and more. The FDA recommends that biosimilar labeling include a \"Biosimilarity Statement\" in the highlights section, describing the relationship to the reference product. The biosimilar product may not have the same labeling as the reference product, including differences in approved indications for use. Comparative data is also recommended by the FDA. The FDA recommends a \"Biosimilarity Statement\" in biosimilar labeling to describe the relationship to the reference product. The number of approved indications may differ between the two products. Comparative data is not included in the labeling to avoid confusion, but it is available on the FDA website. Industry feedback on labeling guidance varies, with generic companies wanting less information and brand-name companies wanting more. The brand-name industry wants FDA to require more information in biosimilar labeling, while the Generic Pharmaceutical Association believes the Biosimilarity Statement is unnecessary and confusing. BIO, representing brand-name pharmaceutical makers, prefers more information in labeling for transparency and access to relevant data. Under the BPCIA, biological products approved as drugs under the FFDCA will transition to biological licenses under the PHSA in March 2020. This provision affects a small set of biological products such as hormone insulin, hormone glucagon, human growth hormone, infertility treatment hormones, menopause and osteoporosis management hormones, and certain medical enzymes. The labeling for biosimilars should provide access to relevant nonclinical and clinical data, allowing prescribers to differentiate between studies conducted with the biosimilar or reference product. The FDA released draft guidance in March 2016 regarding the BPCIA provision for biological products. It states that a marketing application for a biological product must be submitted under the PHS Act, with an exception allowing submission under the FD&C Act until March 23, 2020. This provision impacts products like insulin, glucagon, growth hormone, infertility treatment hormones, menopause and osteoporosis management hormones, and certain medical enzymes. An application for a biological product may be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act until March 23, 2020, if a similar product was approved by that date in 2010. However, if there is already a reference product approved under section 351(a) of the PHS Act, a submission under section 505 of the FD&C Act is not allowed. As of March 23, 2020, applications for biological products approved under the FD&C Act will be replaced by approved BLAs under the PHS Act. FDA will not approve any pending applications under the FD&C Act for biological products subject to the transition provisions. It is suggested that these applications be withdrawn and resubmitted under the PHS Act. The FDA recommends withdrawing and resubmitting pending applications for biological products subject to transition provisions under the PHSA by March 23, 2020. Industry representatives express concerns about delays in approval and availability of competing biologics. The FDA's interpretation may impact exclusivity periods associated with approved NDAs. The FDA's interpretation of exclusivity periods for biological products subject to transition provisions under the PHSA may impact approved NDAs. Orphan drug exclusivity will continue after March 23, 2020, while other exclusivity periods may cease to have effect. Industry groups have raised concerns about delays in approval and availability of competing biologics. Industry groups have raised concerns about FDA policy on exclusivity for biological products licensed under section 351 of the PHS Act. Transitional biological products will not be eligible for the 12-year biologics exclusivity period if not first licensed under the PHSA, as specified by the BPCIA. FDA clarifies that biological products approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act will not receive exclusivity upon being deemed to have a license under the PHS Act to avoid impeding biosimilar or interchangeable product competition. The FD&C Act grants a period of exclusivity to biological products licensed under the PHS Act, which may impede competition until 2032. Interchangeable products must produce the same clinical result as the reference product and can be substituted by a pharmacist without intervention. Interchangeable products can be substituted by a pharmacist without the intervention of the prescribing health care provider. Generic drugs are considered interchangeable with their brand-name counterparts, allowing for cost savings. However, biosimilars, not being structurally identical to their reference biologics, pose challenges in assessing interchangeability. The FDA and EMA have different approaches to assessing interchangeability of biosimilar medicines. FDA released draft guidance on interchangeability in January 2017, with the comment period extended to May 19, 2017. FDA has not yet approved an interchangeable product. EMA evaluates biosimilar medicines for authorization but does not make recommendations on interchangeability. The FDA and EMA have different approaches to assessing interchangeability of biosimilar medicines. FDA released draft guidance on interchangeability in January 2017, with the comment period extended to May 19, 2017. EMA evaluates biosimilar medicines for authorization but does not make recommendations on interchangeability. Individual member states decide their own policy on interchangeability, with some countries allowing interchangeability unless proven otherwise. In the United States, FDA regulates the drug product while states regulate pharmacies and the practice of pharmacy. In the United States, FDA regulates drug products while states regulate pharmacies and pharmacy practice. 37 states have considered legislation on biosimilar substitution, with 27 states and Puerto Rico enacting laws. FDA gained authority to collect user fees from manufacturers in 1992 through the Prescription Drug User Fee Act. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) granted FDA the authority to collect user fees from manufacturers of brand-name prescription drugs and biological products in 1992. This agreement established performance goals for review processes and ensured that the revenue from user fees would supplement, not replace, congressional appropriations to FDA. The additional resources allowed FDA to increase staff for application reviews and reduce the median review time. User fees were authorized by the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) in 1992 to supplement congressional appropriations to FDA. This allowed FDA to increase staff for application reviews and reduce review times. The Biosimilar User Fee Act of 2012 (BsUFA I) amended the FFDCA to collect fees for biosimilar reviews until September 2017, making up 43% of the FY2016 FDA budget. The Biosimilar User Fee Act of 2012 (BsUFA I) collected fees for biosimilar reviews from October 2012 through September 2017. FDA implemented the Biosimilar Product Development (BPD) program to assist industry sponsors in developing new biosimilar products. The Biosimilar Product Development (BPD) program assists industry sponsors in developing biosimilar biological products. There were 64 BPD programs for 23 different reference products as of February 2017. Companies can choose to discontinue participation but would need to pay a reactivation fee. The biosimilar biological product application fee may be waived for the first application from a small business. FDA provides information on BsUFA fees collected each fiscal year. The FDA provides information on BsUFA fees collected each fiscal year. The Biosimilar User Fee Act (BsUFA) I fee rates for FY2017 are shown in Table 4. BsUFA II program reauthorization negotiations took place from March 2016 to May 2016, with a draft agreement posted in September 2016 for FY2018 through FY2022. The FDA posted the draft BsUFA II agreement for FY2018 through FY2022 on its website in September 2016. A final BsUFA recommendation was submitted to Congress after a 30-day comment period, leading to the reauthorization of the biosimilar user fee program via the FDARA in August 2017. FDA faced challenges in meeting BsUFA I goals for advisory meetings with industry due to a lack of additional staff. In 2017, FDA struggled to achieve BsUFA I goals for advisory meetings with industry due to a lack of staff. The agency plans to use new hiring authorities from the 21st Century Cures Act to strengthen staff capacity and modernize hiring practices. Under BsUFA II, enhancements are being made for the recruitment and retention of scientific staffing, setting clear hiring goals, and conducting continuous assessments. These changes aim to help FDA meet performance goals, save time and resources for applicants, encourage price competition, and lower healthcare costs. The supplement and establishment fees have been eliminated, while the BsUFA Program fee has a new provision limiting sponsors to five fees per fiscal year. The application fee will no longer be reduced. The BsUFA Program fee now has a provision limiting sponsors to five fees per fiscal year, with the application fee no longer being reduced by cumulative BPD fees. FDA and industry estimate a need of approximately $45 million in FY2018 to cover BsUFA program costs, with a possible adjustment of up to $9 million. The federal government, like NIH, focuses on basic research while the pharmaceutical industry funds clinical trials. Assigning credit for therapeutic advancements is challenging due to the overlap between basic and applied research. Concerns over high drug costs have prompted scrutiny of the federal role in developing new therapeutics. The high costs of pharmaceuticals, especially biologics, have sparked interest in the federal government's role in developing expensive new drugs. Studies have shown that a small percentage of new drugs approved by the FDA originated from sources other than private industry. This raises questions about the contribution of publicly funded research to innovative new drugs. A 2010 study found that 24.1% of new molecular entities (NMEs) and new biologics approved by the FDA between 1998 and 2007 originated from publicly funded work. Another study by Stevens et al. in 2011 found that 9.3% of drugs approved by the FDA from 1990 to 2007 resulted from publicly funded research. The Stevens study in 2011 found that 9.3% of drugs approved by the FDA from 1990 to 2007 resulted from publicly funded research. Of the total 1,541 drug applications, FDA granted priority review to 348 applications, and 66 of these (19%) resulted from publicly funded research. An FDA designation of priority review is for \"the evaluation of applications.\" The authors found that 20.0% of applications based on private-sector research received FDA priority review, compared to 9.3% from publicly funded research. PSRIs tend to discover drugs with significant clinical effects. Stevens study in 2011 defined PSRI participation in drug discovery. The 2011 Stevens study defined PSRI participation in drug discovery as creating intellectual property specific to a drug transferred to a company through a commercial license. The study excluded the role of PSRIs in developing platform technologies like recombinant DNA technology and bacterial production methods for recombinant DNA, which were developed with public funds. The study excluded platform technologies developed with public funds, such as recombinant DNA technology and bacterial production methods for recombinant DNA, from the evaluation. These technologies enabled the development of FDA-approved products but were not used by PSRI scientists to develop specific drug candidates. The study excluded platform technologies developed with public funds from the evaluation because PSRI scientists did not use them to develop specific drug candidates. However, these technologies played a crucial role in the development of many new drugs, as highlighted in a 2011 publication by Stevens et al. Additionally, biologic drugs discovered by PSRIs over the past 40 years have made a significant impact on the pharmaceutical industry. Laws on Biologics Regulation: Biological products are regulated under the Public Health Service Act by the FDA, while chemical drugs are regulated under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The Biologics Control Act of 1902 marked the beginning of federal regulation of biologics. The Biologics Control Act of 1902 was a groundbreaking regulation that focused on premarket approval for biological products, shifting from post-market to pre-market government review. It was passed in response to deaths from tetanus contamination in vaccines and antitoxins, setting new precedents for national regulation. The Biologics Control Act of 1902 mandated premarket approval for biological products to ensure safety, in response to deaths from tetanus contamination in vaccines. It preceded the Pure Food and Drugs Act of 1906, which lacked premarket control over new drugs and manufacturing establishments. The Pure Food and Drugs Act was replaced by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) in 1938, which required drug manufacturers to submit a new drug application (NDA) before marketing to demonstrate safety. The Biologics Control Act was revised with the Public Health Service Act in 1944, specifying that licensed biological products are subject to regulation under the FFDCA. The Public Health Service Act specifies that licensed biological products are subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), defining biological products as substances used for the prevention, treatment, or cure of human diseases. The FFDCA applies to biological products regulated under the PHSA, with exceptions for products with approved licenses. The PHSA specifies that licensed biological products are subject to regulation under the FFDCA. Most biological products regulated under the PHSA also meet the definition of a drug under the FFDCA. The FDA Modernization Act of 1997 amended the PHSA to require a single BLA for a biological product. The PHSA was amended by the FDA Modernization Act of 1997 to require a single BLA for biological products, suspending licenses immediately in case of public health danger. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 created a licensure pathway for biosimilar products. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCIA) created a licensure pathway for biosimilar products and established regulatory exclusivity periods for certain biologics. Regulatory responsibility for biologics was initially delegated to the Hygienic Laboratory after the enactment of the 1902 Biologics Act. After the 1902 Biologics Act, regulatory responsibility for biologics was initially given to the Hygienic Laboratory. In 1972, authority was transferred to the FDA's Bureau of Biologics. Subsequently, the FDA's Bureau of Drugs and Bureau of Biologics merged in 1982 to form the National Center for Drugs and Biologics. This center was later split in 1988 into the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER). CBER relocated to the new FDA headquarters in White Oak, MD in October 2014. In 1991, FDA published an Intercenter Agreement between CBER and CDER, stating that traditional biologics and most biotechnology products would be regulated by CBER. The FDA's 1991 agreement stated that traditional biologics and most biotechnology products would be regulated by CBER. In 2002, the FDA announced a reorganization, transferring responsibility for most therapeutic biologics from CBER to CDER. On June 30, 2003, responsibility for most therapeutic biologics was transferred from CBER to CDER. Biological products transferred to CDER are regulated as licensed biologics under Section 351 of the PHSA. Examples of products transferred to CDER include monoclonal antibodies, immunomodulators, growth factors, and cytokines. Remaining at CBER are traditional biologics such as vaccines, allergenic products, and blood and blood products. The curr_chunk discusses antivenins, venoms, blood products, and recombinant plasma derivatives."
