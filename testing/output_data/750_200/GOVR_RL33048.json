    "content": "Since September 11, 2001, Congress and government agencies have been focused on regulating hazardous chemicals to prevent terrorist attacks. The goal is to maintain the availability of these chemicals for commercial use while reducing the risk of exploitation by terrorists. Large quantities of hazardous chemicals are present in various transportation modes and commercial facilities. Congress has focused on regulating hazardous chemicals in transportation and commercial facilities to prevent terrorist attacks. Legislation in the 109th Congress aimed to increase penalties for criminal activities around ports and marine vessels, as well as enhance general port security. The 109th Congress focused on regulating hazardous chemicals in transportation and commercial facilities to prevent terrorist attacks. S. 1052 aims to increase penalties for criminal activities around ports and marine vessels, as well as enhance general port security, including foreign ports. Congress is likely to seek a broader understanding of hazardous chemical marine shipments and efforts to secure them. This report provides an overview of hazardous chemicals marine transportation in the United States, focusing on the risks and potential impact of terrorist attacks involving these chemicals on marine vessels. The report focuses on hazardous chemicals with potential to affect the public in a terrorist attack and marine vessels carrying these chemicals. It summarizes federal statistics on hazardous chemical marine shipments in U.S. waters, including shipment volumes and port locations. The report also discusses relevant U.S. maritime security regulations and policy issues associated with these shipments, such as risk uncertainties, security resources, and effectiveness. It concludes with a discussion on marine chemicals security as part of the nation's overall chemical security strategy. The report focuses on marine shipments of acutely hazardous chemicals that could pose a catastrophic hazard to the public. It does not address other maritime security hazards like petroleum products or biological agents. The focus is on threats from chemical releases during marine transport, not on attacks targeting economic activity or the environment. The report focuses on threats to the general public from chemical releases during marine transport, particularly hazardous chemicals that are acutely toxic or highly combustible. It does not provide detailed statistics due to legal limitations on proprietary shipping data. Marine shipments of hazardous chemical cargo are potential terrorist targets that could pose a serious threat to human life and infrastructure if released near populated areas. Hazardous chemical marine vessels are considered a serious threat if intentionally released near populated areas. They are part of critical infrastructures identified by the Bush Administration. Protecting hazardous chemical shipments passing through U.S. waterways and ports is crucial for homeland security. While experts recognize the attractiveness of these shipments as terrorist targets, no marine vessel carrying hazardous chemicals has been used in an attack on civilians. While no marine vessel carrying hazardous chemicals has been used by terrorists in an attack on civilians, accidents involving such shipments have shown their potential to impact nearby communities. Intelligence suggests that terrorists may have the interest and capability to execute hazardous chemical shipping attacks in the United States. Major accidents involving the marine transportation of hazardous chemicals are uncommon but can be deadly. Major accidents involving the marine transportation of hazardous chemicals in the United States have been deadly. The explosion of the Mont-Blanc in 1917 killed over 1,900 people in Halifax, while the 1947 Texas City disaster killed nearly 600. Improved safety practices have prevented similar disasters in the past 60 years. Serious incidents involving chemical marine shipments have occurred in the past 60 years, leading to the evacuation of coastal populations. These incidents include a 1985 fire aboard the Ariadne in Somalia, a 1987 accident aboard the Cason in Spain, and a 1999 fire aboard the Multitank Ascania in Scotland. In the past 60 years, there have been serious incidents involving chemical marine shipments leading to evacuations of coastal populations. Incidents include fires aboard ships in Somalia, Spain, and Scotland. Although terrorists have not used marine cargo vessels for chemical attacks, there have been attempts to release chemicals from land-based facilities in the 1990s, mostly in foreign war zones. During the 1990s, there were attempts to release chemicals from land-based manufacturing and storage facilities in foreign war zones and in the United States. Terrorists targeted facilities producing fertilizer, pesticides, and pharmaceuticals close to population centers. In the US, incidents involved a propane storage facility in California and a gas refinery in Texas. Terrorist attacks on marine vessels have been a concern, with incidents like the attack on the oil tanker Limburg off the Yemeni coast. Foreign governments worry about terrorist groups hijacking hazardous chemical vessels. The Department of Homeland Security in the US is also vigilant about such threats. Terrorist groups are a concern for the security of chemical tanker ships, with the Department of Homeland Security in the US being vigilant about such threats. The President's National Strategy highlights the challenge of protecting high consequence cargo in ports. The Department of Homeland Security has identified liquefied natural gas (LNG) tankers as potential terrorist targets due to the real risks associated with LNG shipments. A 2004 report by Sandia National Laboratories considered terrorist attacks on LNG tankers as credible and possible, citing vulnerabilities to various attack methods. The Sandia report identified LNG tankers as vulnerable to various terrorist attacks, including ramming, explosives, hijacking, and external actions like missile or airplane attacks. Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 focuses on preventing attacks that could cause catastrophic health effects or mass casualties. This report specifically addresses hazardous chemical cargo on commercial marine vessels. For this report, hazardous chemical cargo on commercial marine vessels poses catastrophic hazards to the public, including poisoning, asphyxiation, chemical burns, and thermal burns. Federal standards from DOT, Coast Guard, and EPA regulate transportation of these chemicals. The Department of Transportation (DOT), Coast Guard, and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulate transportation of hazardous materials. The Hazardous Materials Transportation Act of 1975 empowers the Secretary of Transportation to designate materials as \"hazardous\" if they pose risks during transportation. The DOT classifies hazardous materials in 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 172.101, including toxic, radioactive, corrosive, explosive, and flammable materials. The DOT classifies hazardous materials in 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 172.101, including toxic, radioactive, corrosive, explosive, and flammable materials. Hazardous materials are grouped by type of hazard but not necessarily by relative degree of hazard. The DOT provides a ranking of relative hazard by general class or division in 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 173.2a and requires shippers of certain \"highly hazardous\" cargo to develop security plans in 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 172.8. Highly hazardous cargo includes materials such as toxic, radioactive, corrosive, explosive, and flammable substances. The DOT requires shippers of certain \"highly hazardous\" cargo to develop security plans for materials such as radioactive, explosives, poisonous inhalation, bulk hazardous liquids, gases, solids, and packaged hazardous materials. This includes materials regulated by the CDC and those requiring placarding under other provisions. The Coast Guard enforces federal hazardous material laws for marine vessels, identifying hazardous cargo under various regulations, including the Port and Waterways Safety Act of 1972. Certain dangerous cargoes are defined in 33 C.F.R. \u00a7 160.204. The Coast Guard enforces federal hazardous material laws for marine vessels, identifying hazardous cargo under various regulations, including the Port and Waterways Safety Act of 1972. The definition of \"certain dangerous cargoes\" refers to specific hazardous materials such as liquefied gas and bulk liquid cargoes, with special requirements prescribed for vessels carrying hazardous materials. The Coast Guard enforces federal hazardous material laws for marine vessels, identifying hazardous cargo under various regulations. Hundreds of different hazardous materials are included on the Coast Guard's lists, but the relative degree of hazard among these materials is not specified. EPA regulates stationary facilities handling potentially hazardous materials. The EPA regulates stationary facilities handling potentially hazardous substances under the Clean Air Act (CAA), Section 112(r)(7). Facilities with specified threshold quantities of hazardous substances must file risk management plans (RMPs) outlining potential threats from large releases, off-site consequence analysis, and prevention/mitigation plans. The Clean Air Act requires facilities handling hazardous substances to submit risk management plans detailing off-site consequence analysis, prevention, and mitigation measures for worst-case accidents. Hazardous substances include listed chemicals like chlorine and ammonia, as well as others designated by the EPA based on health and environmental risks. EPA has identified acutely toxic substances, flammable gases, and volatile liquids for regulation. The EPA established a list of hazardous substances including acutely toxic substances, flammable gases, and volatile liquids. High explosive substances were removed from the list in 1998, and flammable substances used as fuel were excluded in 2000. The current EPA/RMP list can be found in Appendix 2. The majority of hazardous materials on DOT lists do not pose a catastrophic health hazard to the general public. The EPA list of hazardous substances identifies chemicals with the greatest potential consequences to the general public, including those considered most hazardous on land. These chemicals may also pose similar hazards if transported on water. This report uses EPA's list of hazardous substances as the basis for marine cargo hazard analysis, with most substances also found in DOT and Coast Guard lists. Notable exceptions include radioactive materials and explosives. The report uses EPA's list of hazardous substances for marine cargo analysis, excluding radioactive materials and explosives. Army Corps of Engineers statistics show these would make up less than 0.3% of U.S. hazardous marine cargo. The EPA/RMP chemicals are broadly classified as acutely toxic or flammable, with varying degrees of toxicity or flammability. Ammonia is an acutely toxic, potentially explosive gas used in various industries. It can quickly reach harmful concentrations in the air, causing skin and respiratory irritation. Ammonia can quickly reach harmful concentrations in the air, causing severe skin and respiratory irritation. Methane, used as a heating fuel and industrial feedstock, is not inherently toxic but can cause asphyxiation in high vapor concentrations. Methyloxirane is also used in industrial processes. Methyloxirane is a toxic liquid used in manufacturing various industrial products. It can irritate the eyes, skin, and respiratory tract and is highly flammable. Uncontrolled release of this chemical can have varying effects on exposed individuals. The EPA considers all RMP chemicals to be hazardous to the public when present above threshold quantities, warranting special regulatory treatment. Certain shipments of specific cargoes may be more hazardous than others. The EPA/RMP list of hazardous chemicals was developed for land facilities, but the health hazards may differ if released over water. Some chemicals dissolve or sink in water, potentially reducing the public hazard in a marine incident. Some chemicals dissolve or sink in water, reducing public hazard in a marine incident. Others float and evaporate faster on water than on land, creating a larger hazard zone more quickly in a marine release. Further research is needed to understand the relative marine hazards of specific chemicals. The Army Corps of Engineers (ACE) maintains statistics of marine commerce in U.S. waters, which can be used to estimate the marine shipping volumes of EPA/RMP chemicals. A subset of these chemicals are transported in significant quantities through U.S. waters, as shown in Table 1 with over 48 million tons of EPA/RMP chemicals being shipped. Further research and analysis are needed to better understand the relative marine hazards of specific chemicals. Table 1 summarizes the 2003 U.S. waterborne shipments of EPA/RMP hazardous chemicals, totaling over 48 million tons and accounting for 2% of total U.S. waterborne cargo tonnage. DOT Divisions are subcategories within a Class, and considering both size and number of shipments is important in analyzing marine cargo terrorism hazards. EPA/RMP hazardous materials list includes chemicals transported in significant quantities through U.S. waters. The EPA/RMP hazardous materials list includes chemicals that are hazardous to human health due to their chemical properties. The overall volume of hazardous material in a marine shipment is crucial in evaluating potential public impacts of a terrorist attack. A larger number of shipments could increase the overall terrorist risk. In 2003, over 100,000 marine shipments of EPA/RMP hazardous cargo passed through U.S. waterways. The total number of shipments and average cargo tons per shipment were summarized by the ACE. Cargo vessels may load or unload partial cargoes at multiple locations, leading to varying tonnage aboard a vessel at any time. In 2003, vessels carried EPA/RMP hazardous chemicals with varying tonnage due to loading/unloading at multiple locations. EPA regulations set minimum threshold quantities for risk planning between 500 and 20,000 pounds. The average shipment volume exceeded the EPA/RMP thresholds. The average waterborne shipment volume of hazardous chemicals in Figure 1 exceeds the EPA/RMP 20,000 pound threshold, requiring off-site risk management plans. Each category of chemicals was typically shipped hundreds to thousands of times in 2003, making it difficult to distinguish between \"low frequency\" and \"high frequency\" hazardous cargoes. In 2003, hazardous cargoes were typically shipped hundreds to thousands of times, with over 67% being shipped in tankers. Different types of marine vessels transport hazardous cargo in bulk, each with distinct construction and operating characteristics that impact security considerations. In 2003, hazardous cargoes were typically shipped in tankers, with over 67% being shipped in liquefied gas or chemical parcel tankers, self-propelled liquid chemical barges, and non-self-propelled liquid chemical barges. Container ships, dry cargo barges, and other vessels carried a smaller percentage of such cargo. Liquefied gas tankers are ships designed to carry various liquefied gas cargoes like butane, propane, LNG, and chemicals listed by the EPA/RMP. These tankers have large onboard tanks that can be pressurized, refrigerated, and insulated to meet different cargo requirements. International shipping codes set strict standards for their construction. Liquefied gas tankers have onboard tanks that can be pressurized, refrigerated, and insulated to accommodate various cargo needs. International shipping codes impose extensive standards for their construction and operation. The cargo tanks must withstand high pressures or low temperatures, making them robust and resistant to impact damage. These vessels are \"double-hulled,\" with cargo tanks located above a double bottom and inboard of the outer hull, providing a higher level of structural integrity compared to other ship classes. Liquefied gas tankers, including LNG tankers, have a high level of structural integrity due to their double-hulled design. LNG tankers exclusively carry LNG, while other liquefied gas tankers may carry a mix of different cargoes, creating unique multi-chemical hazards. LNG tankers have capacities ranging from 25,000 m3 to 147,000 m3, with plans for new construction of 200,000 m3 capacity. At the upper end of this range, LNG tankers are among the largest cargo vessels in the world. Chemical parcel tankers are versatile vessels designed to carry a wide range of liquid and chemical cargoes, including hazardous chemicals. They can carry 10 to 60 separate cargo tanks and range in total cargo capacity from 3,000 to 50,000 tons. Most are well under 50,000 tons. Chemical parcel tankers have cargo tanks lined with stainless steel or specialized coatings like epoxy, zinc silicate, or polyurethane to ensure compatibility with various chemicals. They also have double bottoms or hulls and maintain spaces between tank walls to prevent incompatible cargoes. Liquid chemical barges are shallow draft vessels designed to carry bulk liquid chemicals primarily in coastal regions and through inland waterways. These barges have multiple separate cargo tanks lined with stainless steel or special coatings and range in size from 700 tons to 3,500 tons of total cargo capacity. Liquid chemical barges are vessels with multiple separate cargo tanks lined with stainless steel or special coatings, ranging from 700 to 3,500 tons in total cargo capacity. Larger barges transporting hazardous chemicals are typically double-hulled and self-propelled, while smaller ones may rely on tugboats for movement. Inland barges travel in groups on river systems, with unpowered barges being approximately 52 to 54 feet wide and up to 300 feet long. Liquid chemical barges can travel in groups of two to eight barges per towboat, with \"linehaul\" tows sometimes consisting of over 20 barges. These barges can be refrigerated and have insulated cargo tanks capable of carrying 1,250 to 1,500 tons of ammonia, propylene, or other refrigerated chemical products. Pressurized cargo tanks are also available for pressurized liquid cargoes. Large quantities of hazardous chemicals may be transported on conventional container ships in various forms such as tank containers, drums, portable tanks, or other cargo consignments. Roll-on/roll-off vessels can also carry these chemicals in tanker trucks or conventional tractor-trailers. The Jolly Rubino is an example of a container ship that can hold large quantities of hazardous chemicals. Large quantities of hazardous chemicals can be present on container ships, including the Jolly Rubino which carried vinyl acetate and other toxic chemicals when it caught fire off South Africa in 2002. Hazardous chemicals must be shipped in designated cargo areas on various vessels, and the public hazards are proportional to the volume of EPA/RMP hazardous cargo present. Marine vessels, rail tank cars, and highway tanker trucks are all bulk transportation modes for EPA/RMP hazardous chemicals, with maximum cargo capacities ranging from 50 to 90 tons. The maximum cargo capacities for hazardous chemicals in rail tank cars range from 50 to 90 tons, while containerized tank cars on flatbed railcars can carry up to 70 tons per tank. Highway tanker trucks also transport hazardous cargoes, with a standard capacity ranging from 15 to 30 tons. Table 2 summarizes the typical range of cargo tank capacity for marine, rail, and highway tankers transporting EPA/RMP chemicals. Marine tankers generally have a much larger capacity than rail or highway tankers, often carrying partial cargoes. Multiple tanks are common on liquefied gas tankers, chemical parcel tankers, and liquid cargo barges. Comparing actual volumes shipped across marine, barge, and rail modes is challenging due to partial cargoes and multiple tank cars involved. Marine shipments of EPA/RMP hazardous material are often larger than land shipments. The EPA maintains a database of on-site chemical storage volumes for facilities required to file risk management plans. The EPA maintains a database of on-site chemical storage volumes for facilities required to file risk management plans under the Clean Air Act. These filings are used to estimate the maximum and average quantity of EPA/RMP chemicals across facilities. Marine shipping volumes are compared to land shipments, with marine shipments typically being larger. The EPA/RMP chemicals with the highest on-site quantities were compared to marine and land shipping volumes for nine chemicals. The comparison included high, medium, and low volume shipments of toxic and flammable chemicals. Detailed chemical names were not provided due to proprietary information. Table 3 summarizes the comparison of marine and chemical facility volumes for nine EPA/RMP chemicals. The average marine shipments for higher volume chemicals were larger than the volumes stored at chemical plants, reflecting the practice of shipping higher volume cargo in larger vessels. The largest marine shipments were smaller than the largest volumes stored at chemical facilities. The largest marine shipments of EPA/RMP hazardous chemicals either originate or terminate in U.S. ports, where port facilities may serve as transportation hubs for temporary storage and transfer of hazardous cargo. Some port facilities receive hazardous marine cargo directly for industrial processes like petrochemical refining, water treatment, and fertilizer production. Some port facilities handle hazardous cargo for industrial processes like petrochemical refining, water treatment, and fertilizer production. The volume and type of EPA/RMP chemicals vary across ports, so it's important to analyze the concentration of hazardous marine shipments in U.S. ports. There are over 360 commercial ports in the United States with around 3,200 cargo facilities. In 2003, EPA/RMP hazardous chemicals were shipped through 113 out of 360 commercial ports in the United States. The top 30 ports handled about 95% of the hazardous cargo tonnage, as per ACE statistics. These 30 ports are listed in Table 4, along with the categories of hazardous marine cargo shipped through each port. Additional EPA/RMP hazardous cargoes may also be shipped in large volumes through other ports. In 2003, EPA/RMP hazardous chemicals were shipped through 113 out of 360 commercial ports in the United States. The top 30 ports handled about 95% of the hazardous cargo tonnage. Additional EPA/RMP hazardous cargoes not listed in Table 4 may also be shipped in large volumes through other ports. Marine shipments of EPA/RMP hazardous chemicals in the remaining 83 ports may be no less a security concern than shipments in the top 30 ports. Cargo security concerns extend beyond the top 30 hazardous chemical ports, with potential serious consequences from an attack on a single hazardous cargo vessel. The majority of these ports are located in the Gulf of Mexico, with varying mixes of principal EPA/RMP hazardous chemicals. Great Lakes ports are not included in the top 30 list. The top 30 ports handling EPA/RMP hazardous cargo in 2003 are located on the Ohio River, with a mix of hazardous chemicals varying from port to port. The most frequently shipped hazardous cargoes are LPG and ammonia. LPG is flammable and explosive, while ammonia is toxic. The list of ports is derived from estimates by the Army Corps of Engineers, EPA, and CRS analysis. The top 30 ports in 2003 handling EPA/RMP hazardous cargo are based on estimates of hazardous cargo volumes. Key factors affecting terrorism risk in U.S. ports include DOT hazardous cargo shipments, non-chemical cargo hazards, marine passenger traffic, hazardous materials sites, proximity to populations, port configuration, and threat intelligence. DHS plays a role in assessing port vulnerabilities. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) considers various factors in its Port Security Grant Program, providing security enhancement grants to U.S. ports. For the FY2005 program, 66 ports were eligible to apply for grants based on a risk-based formula evaluation. The Coast Guard is the lead federal agency for promoting U.S. maritime security. The Coast Guard, as the lead federal agency for U.S. maritime security, oversees the safety and security of vessels and ports. They have a special focus on hazardous cargo ships and barges, with 24 of the top 30 hazardous material ports eligible for DHS port security grants. The Coast Guard has a history of special concern for ships and barges carrying hazardous cargo, with safety regulations in place for construction, operation, and cargo transfer. Compliance with these regulations could help mitigate damage from a terrorist attack and deter such attacks. Prior to 9/11, the Coast Guard had limited regulations specifically addressing terrorism. Since 9/11, the Coast Guard has expanded its maritime security regulations to distinguish between safety measures and security measures. Area maritime security committees led by local captains of the port assess port vulnerabilities and create plans to address them, including chemical sector representatives. The maritime security committees, led by local captains of the port and including chemical sector representatives, have assessed port vulnerabilities and created plans to address them. These plans evaluate the susceptibility of marine targets to terrorist activities and outline the deployment of federal, state, and local resources for prevention. The assessments focus on vessels and facilities under Coast Guard jurisdiction, as well as other vital port infrastructure like bridges, channels, and tunnels. The Coast Guard has used assessments to enhance security of key marine assets and develop new maritime security standards under the MTSA. They also played a leading role in creating the ISPS Code, which sets standards for safe ship and port operations. The ISPS Code, effective since July 1, 2004, requires ships and port facilities worldwide to create security plans approved by their government. Plans must include security measures for three threat levels and designate a security officer. Ships and ports must also deploy security equipment and monitor access of people and cargo. The Coast Guard ensures ISPS Code compliance by reviewing and approving security plans for vessels, conducting on-site inspections, and completing security assessments for economically and militarily significant ports. The Coast Guard has completed security assessments of the nation's 55 most economically and militarily strategic ports to prevent terrorist attacks on hazardous chemicals vessels. They have evaluated marine tankers' vulnerability to various types of attacks and are assessing inland barges carrying dangerous cargoes. The Coast Guard conducts security assessments of ports to prevent terrorist attacks on vessels carrying hazardous chemicals. They also assess inland barges for vulnerabilities and potential blast consequences. Vessels carrying hazardous chemicals must report information four days before arrival or departure to determine security risks. The Coast Guard may board vessels to ensure secure transit in U.S. waters, with armed sea-marshals on board. Ships carrying hazardous cargo may be escorted by patrol boats enforcing a security zone while transiting a harbor. Vessels carrying hazardous cargo may need to provide roving patrols during mooring. During mooring, vessels carrying hazardous cargo may need to provide roving patrols on deck and at the terminal. The Coast Guard maintains Maritime Safety and Security Teams nationwide for security operations at ports. Cargo and passenger vessels at U.S. ports must have Automatic Identification System transponders for maritime domain awareness. Cargo and passenger vessels at U.S. ports are required to have Automatic Identification System (AIS) transponders for vessel tracking. The Coast Guard is installing AIS receivers at all U.S. ports and developing joint harbor operations centers (JHOCs) to monitor vessel traffic similar to air traffic control towers at airports. The Coast Guard is establishing Joint Harbor Operations Centers (JHOCs) in U.S. harbors to track vessel traffic using various equipment and coordinate responses with federal security agencies and local law enforcement. They are also engaging the public through the \"Waterways Watch\" program to report suspicious activity. The Coast Guard is enlisting the public to identify and report suspicious activity. They are working with the TSA to enhance security for merchant mariners and landside workers. NOAA maintains hazardous material emergency response capabilities. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) provides hazardous material emergency response capabilities through the CAMEO program, which includes chemical dispersion software models and a database with response recommendations for over 6,000 chemicals. NOAA has also linked its operational air dispersion models to enhance support for emergency responders. NOAA partners with Coast Guard and Office of Naval Intelligence for risk assessments on hazardous chemicals at U.S. ports. NOAA and DHS coordinate federal chemicals emergency response through Interagency Modeling and Atmospheric Assessment Center. NOAA, along with the DHS, coordinates federal chemicals emergency response through the Interagency Modeling and Atmospheric Assessment Center. Industry groups also promote the security of hazardous marine cargo, with input from the Chemical Transportation Advisory Committee (CTAC) for evaluating hazardous materials regulations. CTAC formed a Subcommittee on Hazardous Cargo Transportation Security in October 2002 to assess vulnerability and promote industry security awareness. A model vessel security plan was created by the American Waterways Operators in consultation with the Coast Guard and Army Corps of Engineers to prevent terrorist attacks on the inland waterway system. The American Waterways Operators, in consultation with the Coast Guard and Army Corps of Engineers, developed a vessel security plan to prevent terrorist attacks on the inland waterway system. The plan includes a list of high consequence cargoes. Additionally, the Chemical Distribution Institute inspects and issues audit reports on chemical and LPG tankers, tank storage terminals, and container ships carrying hazardous cargo. The American Chemistry Council has also issued transportation security guidelines for the chemical industry. Securing hazardous chemicals against terrorist attacks is a priority in U.S. homeland security policy, especially for maritime vessels and ports. Despite new security measures post-9/11, policy issues like risk uncertainty and resource availability may require further Congressional attention. Since 9/11, policy issues related to hazardous marine cargo, including risk uncertainty, resource availability, and security effectiveness, may require Congressional attention. Terrorism risk is defined by threat, vulnerability, and consequence, with uncertainties existing in all three factors. The potential threat of terrorists targeting ships in U.S. waters has been debated, with some questioning the accuracy of government threat information. Some experts believe public concern about terrorist attacks on hazardous chemical shipping in U.S. waters is overstated, while others argue that terrorists have the desire and capability to target such shipping. The uncertainty of threat intelligence and the evolving tactics of attackers make the basis of these conclusions questionable. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission notes the uncertainty in estimating the probability of a terrorist attack on marine chemical hazards. The Coast Guard has approved security assessments for vessels under the MTSA and ISPS codes, partnering with NOAA for chemical risk assessments at U.S. ports. Despite these efforts, analysts remain cautious. Some analysts suggest that the vulnerabilities and consequences of a terrorist attack on hazardous marine cargo vessels are not well understood, leading to conflicting studies on LNG shipping risks. The security sensitivity of these assessments complicates evaluation efforts due to limited public information on physical vulnerabilities. The security sensitivity of vessel vulnerability assessments and security plans complicates evaluation efforts due to limited public information on physical vulnerabilities, especially regarding intentional releases of hazardous chemicals. The value and effectiveness of vessel vulnerability assessments and security plans for hazardous chemicals carriers may be limited without a full understanding of vulnerability and consequence, especially for attacks affecting the general public. Federal officials may struggle to determine the precise risk of terror attacks on hazardous marine cargoes, but reducing risk uncertainty could help prioritize maritime security activities. The Coast Guard could enhance port security efforts by ensuring timely access to relevant intelligence information from federal sources. The Coast Guard can improve port security by accessing relevant intelligence information from federal agencies. Security experts can reduce risk uncertainty through analyzing vessel vulnerabilities and chemical attack consequences using standard models and methodologies. A federal role is important for ensuring methodological consistency in security analysis. The federal role is crucial for ensuring methodological consistency in security analysis for LNG tankers and marine terminal siting applications. Concerns include the costs associated with hazardous marine cargo security and potential diversion of resources from other activities. Coast Guard officials note that maritime security expenditures are part of their general mission to protect the nation's waters and coasts. President Bush requested $8.1 billion for the Coast Guard in FY2006, with $2.2 billion allocated for port, waterway, and coastal security, a 6% increase from FY2005. Security activities grew significantly post-9/11, raising concerns about resource allocation for other missions like boating safety and drug interdiction. President Bush requested $8.1 billion for the Coast Guard in FY2006, with $2.2 billion allocated for port, waterway, and coastal security, a 6% increase from FY2005. The budget also includes an additional $11 million for general maritime security funding for new response boats and crew to enhance operational presence and response capabilities. The budget for the Coast Guard in FY2006 includes funding for increased operational presence, security enforcement, vessel monitoring, and surveillance. State and local agencies are seeking more funding to offset the costs of hazardous marine cargo security, particularly for LNG tankers which may cost up to $80,000 to secure per shipment. This cost burden may force agencies to divert limited resources. Federal officials recommend that new LNG terminal operators cover additional maritime security costs, as state and local agencies fear diverting resources from essential services due to LNG security expenses. Despite the Energy Policy Act of 2005 requiring cost-sharing for LNG tanker security, ambiguity in accounting and reliance on uncertain federal funding sources continue to raise concerns among government officials. Some government officials are concerned about the ambiguous accounting of security costs for LNG shipments, which rely on uncertain federal funding sources like DHS port security grants. While some LNG companies resist paying more for public security, others are willing to pay for \"excess\" security only if it goes beyond what is typically covered by their tax payments. The security costs for LNG shipments may not reflect the costs for securing other hazardous marine cargo. The security costs for LNG shipments may not be indicative of the costs to secure other hazardous marine cargo. New security technology and threat intelligence may help lower future security costs. Public agencies may need to review cost-sharing mechanisms for securing hazardous marine cargo from terrorist attacks. The effectiveness of Coast Guard security measures for hazardous chemicals shipping is still uncertain. The Coast Guard has security measures in place to protect hazardous chemicals shipping, but the effectiveness of these measures is questioned. Some doubt if resources are efficiently deployed, while others question the evaluation of security activities. The GAO has noted progress in enhancing security awareness but highlights the need to assess the nation's overall security level. The effectiveness of seaport security measures is questioned, with a lack of performance measures to define goals and assess progress. Concerns arise about whether Coast Guard activities adequately address terrorism risks, such as attacks on ammonia tankers versus dirty bombs on container ships. The Coast Guard's maritime security plan identifies high-risk cargos and conducts operations to address terrorism risks associated with hazardous chemical vessels. Questions have been raised about whether the level of security for these vessels reflects their relative risk, given the uncertainties and competing demands for Coast Guard resources. Coast Guard port captains have discretion in deploying security resources within their ports. Some observers question if similar chemical shipments receive different levels of protection from one port to another, leading to potential security disparities. Congress may need to assess the effectiveness of the Coast Guard's security activities for hazardous marine cargoes in the context of overall maritime security. The oversight of the Coast Guard's security activities includes assessing the effectiveness of hazardous marine cargo activities in the context of maritime security responsibilities. Concerns also exist about emergency response to marine chemical attacks, with potential high casualties that could overwhelm emergency agencies. An attack in shipping channels near densely populated areas could overwhelm emergency agencies and medical facilities due to potential high casualties. Toxic chemicals in the attack would complicate emergency response and require specialized medical treatment. Salvage of a damaged vessel may be challenging due to chemical hazards and limitations among U.S. marine salvage companies. Due to the hazardous cargo terrorism risk, emergency and medical authorities near potentially affected waterways should develop specific measures for dealing with chemical cargo releases. Federal or private sector assistance, such as funding from the DOT's Hazardous Materials Emergency Preparedness Fund and the DHS's Homeland Security Grant Program, could support communities with insufficient capabilities to develop emergency response plans. The Materials Emergency Preparedness Fund and the Homeland Security Grant Program are potential funding sources for marine chemicals emergency response plans. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 provides a legislative model for coastal LNG terminals and tankers. Marine shipments of EPA/RMP hazardous chemicals are comparable in volume to large chemical plants. Marine vessels carrying hazardous chemicals, comparable in volume to large chemical plants, pass near populated areas and major U.S. ports. These shipments are potential terrorist targets, posing a risk of catastrophic injuries. Government and industry have taken steps to enhance maritime security for hazardous chemical cargo under the MTSA. The MTSA grants the Coast Guard authority over hazardous marine shipping security. As the Coast Guard evolves its security efforts, Congress may question terrorism risk uncertainty and resource sufficiency for securing hazardous chemical cargo. Congressional policymakers may analyze the resources and effectiveness of security measures for hazardous chemical cargo, including evaluating emergency response capabilities of coastal communities. Additionally, Congress may assess how U.S. hazardous chemicals marine security fits into the nation's overall strategy to protect the public from chemical hazards. The U.S. hazardous chemicals marine security is a part of the nation's strategy to protect the public from chemical hazards. Hazardous chemicals are present in marine vessels, rail and highway tankers, and chemical facilities on land, posing a policy challenge due to different homeland security regulations. Limited information on vulnerability and consequences, especially in marine transportation, complicates resource allocation. Limited vulnerability and consequence information for marine transportation complicates comparing terrorism risks across sectors. Without a comprehensive perspective on hazardous chemical risks, security analysts may struggle to prioritize assets for protection and allocate security resources effectively. Diverting resources from safety to enhance security in the marine sector could reduce terror risk but increase overall risk if safety programs become less effective as a result. Diverting marine resources from safety to enhance security may reduce terror risk but increase overall risk if safety programs are compromised. Congress may face challenges in aligning security priorities and activities to achieve common goals. The Army Corps of Engineers collects marine commerce statistics to plan and manage projects effectively. The Army Corps of Engineers collects marine commerce statistics through its Waterborne Commerce Statistics Center (WCSC) to plan and manage capital projects. Separate databases track domestic and foreign vessel trips, tonnages, and commodities for U.S. ports and waterways. Vessel types include dry cargo ships, tankers, barges, fishing vessels, towboats, tugboats, crew boats, and supply boats. The ACE collects data on various types of vessels, including ships, tankers, barges, fishing vessels, towboats, tugboats, crew boats, and supply boats. Vessel operators are required to report domestic waterborne commercial movements to the ACE. The ACE databases may have limitations but can be used for chemical-specific analysis with caution. The ACE databases provide estimates of EPA/RMP cargo statistics, using standardized commodity codes. These estimates are considered accurate by CRS but should be viewed strictly as estimates with limitations and caveats. The ACE databases provide estimates of EPA/RMP cargo statistics using standardized commodity codes, including internal WCSC and UN codes. Inconsistencies may arise between these codes and the CAS registry numbers for hazardous chemicals, which CRS has attempted to address through comparisons and consultations with experts. For example, LNG and LPG are classified under the same 5-digit code in the WCSC system. The WCSC system classifies LNG and LPG under the same 5-digit code (34000). CRS separated LNG and LPG volumes using trade data from the Department of Energy. Shipment estimates for other EPA/RMP chemicals may include some volume of other chemicals not on the list. Alternatively, shipments of certain EPA/RMP chemicals may be included in the totals for a similar chemical. Cargo vessels may load or unload partial cargoes at multiple locations. The ACE data report cargo movements at loading and unloading points but cannot provide total tonnage carried aboard vessels. Data errors may occur in the ACE waterborne commerce databases due to the size of the database and new queries. The ACE employs a rigorous internal review process for data analysis. The ACE databases may have data quality errors despite rigorous internal review processes. Inconsistencies in estimates were identified and corrected by the ACE. The waterborne commerce databases contain detailed commercial information. This report provides summary estimates of chemicals shipping data without associating it with specific vessels. The report provides summary estimates of chemicals shipping data for private companies, without linking specific chemicals to named vessels or operating companies. ACE data at the individual shipment, vessel, or operator level is considered privileged information and not for public release."
