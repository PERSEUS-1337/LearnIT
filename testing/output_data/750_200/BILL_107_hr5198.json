The Premier Certified Lenders Program (PCLP) has successfully helped small businesses expand. Increasing the number of premier certified lenders will provide more resources to small businesses as the Small Business Administration downsizes. However, the PCLP requires lenders to set aside large amounts in loss reserve accounts. Premier certified lenders should maintain loss reserve accounts in amounts reflecting the risk of loss associated with the PCLP loan portfolio. Changing the PCLP to require premier certified lenders to maintain loss reserve accounts reflecting loan risks will protect taxpayers and enhance the program's support for small business development.
