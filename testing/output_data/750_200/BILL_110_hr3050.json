    "content": "The consent of Congress is given to an interstate forest fire protection compact known as \"THE GREAT PLAINS WILDLAND FIRE PROTECTION AGREEMENT\" between State, Provincial, and Territorial wildland fire protection agencies. The compact aims to prevent and control forest fires in the Great Plains region by maintaining fire fighting services and providing mutual aid among member states like South Dakota, North Dakota, Wyoming, and Colorado. It becomes effective once ratified by two or more states. The compact aims to prevent and control forest fires in the Great Plains region by maintaining fire fighting services and providing mutual aid among member states. Each state's forester or equivalent officer can act as compact administrator, consult with officials from other states, and coordinate forest fire prevention and control efforts. Member states can organize to integrate services and implement forest fire plans. \"Member states can provide aid to each other's forest fire control agencies upon request, while ensuring protection within their own state.\" \"If member states provide aid to another state's forest fire control agencies, employees rendering aid have similar powers, duties, and immunities. States and their employees are not liable for any actions or equipment used during the aid.\" The compact states that liability for any actions or equipment used during outside aid will be assumed and borne by the requesting state. The aiding state will be reimbursed for any loss or damage incurred during the operation of equipment. Each member state receiving aid must reimburse the assisting state for any loss, damage, or expenses incurred during the operation of equipment. The assisting state can also choose to assume these costs or provide services without charge. Additionally, each member state must ensure that workers receive compensation benefits in accordance with state laws. The compact ensures that workers compensation benefits are available to all employees and contract firefighters sent to a requesting state. The term \"employee\" includes volunteers and auxiliaries within the forest fire fighting forces. Compact administrators may establish procedures for claims and reimbursement in accordance with state laws. \"ARTICLE VI outlines the procedures for claims and reimbursement for workers compensation benefits under the compact.\" \"Ratification of this compact does not authorize any member state to reduce its forest fire fighting forces, equipment, services, or facilities. Each state must maintain adequate resources for forest fire protection as if the compact were not in effect. The compact does not limit a state's power to prevent and control forest fires.\" The compact does not restrict states from preventing, controlling, and extinguishing forest fires or enacting laws for this purpose. It also does not impact cooperative relationships between the US Forest Service and member states. \"ARTICLE VII\n\nRepresentatives of the United States Forest Service may attend meetings of the compact administrators.\n\nARTICLE VIII\n\nProvisions of Articles IV and V related to reciprocal aid in combating forest fires apply between states party to this compact and other regional compacts if the other state's Legislature assents to mutual aid.\n\nARTICLE IX\" \"ARTICLE IX of the compact states that it will remain in effect until a state's Legislature or Governor takes action to withdraw, with a six-month notice period required for withdrawal to be effective.\""
