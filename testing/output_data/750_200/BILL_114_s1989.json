Beginning in the second year of the model, adjustments are made based on performance. In the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act model, a primary care medical home practice that meets or exceeds the performance benchmark for the year will receive a 5 percent increase in the periodic fee paid for each enrolled individual. Practices that do not meet the performance benchmark will not receive this increase. The Secretary may terminate a qualified direct primary care medical home practice's participation in the model if the practice fails to meet the performance benchmark for two consecutive years.
