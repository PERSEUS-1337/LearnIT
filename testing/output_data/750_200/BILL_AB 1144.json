    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 399.16 of the Public Utilities Code is amended to allow electricity products from eligible renewable energy resources within the WECC transmission network to comply with renewables portfolio standard procurement requirements. These products can be differentiated based on their grid operation impacts and meeting article requirements. The amended Section 399.16 of the Public Utilities Code allows for the procurement of a balanced portfolio of eligible renewable energy resources based on project viability principles and benefits criteria. The amended Section 399.16 of the Public Utilities Code allows for the procurement of eligible renewable energy resources based on project viability principles and benefits criteria. Eligible resources must have a first point of interconnection with a California balancing authority or distribution facilities used to serve end users within a California balancing authority area. Scheduled energy into a California balancing authority must come from the eligible renewable energy resource without substituting electricity from another source. Unbundled renewable energy credits can be earned by electricity generated by an entity excluded from the definition of an electrical corporation. The electricity must be used at a wastewater treatment facility owned by a public entity and meet specific criteria. The renewable energy credit requirements include the generating facility meeting specific criteria and the electricity being used at a public entity's wastewater treatment facility. The renewable energy credit is earned by electricity generated at a wastewater treatment facility owned by a public entity, with the generating capability of the facility being put into service on or after January 1, 2016. This includes new generation or incremental increases resulting from capital investment or operational changes made to the facility. Retail sellers must meet specific requirements for all procurement credited towards each compliance period, including firmed and shaped eligible renewable energy resource electricity products scheduled into a California balancing authority. Additionally, any electricity generated that does not qualify under the mentioned criteria is also considered. The wastewater treatment facility in question does not participate in the small-scale bioenergy feed-in tariff program established by the commission. Retail sellers must meet requirements for procurement credited towards each compliance period, with a minimum percentage of eligible renewable energy resource electricity products meeting product content requirements. Retail sellers must meet procurement requirements for eligible renewable energy resources, with specific percentage limits for product content based on contract execution dates. For electric service providers, restrictions on crediting renewable energy products apply to contracts executed after January 13, 2011. Contracts executed before June 1, 2010, count towards procurement requirements if the renewable energy was eligible at the time of contract execution and approved by the commission. (2) The commission approves contracts for electrical corporations, even if it's after June 1, 2010. (3) Contract amendments after June 1, 2010, cannot increase capacity or change renewable energy sources, but can be extended if the original contract was for 15 years or more. A retail seller can request a reduction in procurement content requirements from the commission if they cannot comply due to uncontrollable conditions. The commission can lower the requirement but not below 65 percent after December 31, 2016. A public entity selling renewable energy credits cannot make marketing claims about the renewable attributes of the electricity that earned the credit. All renewable attributes are transferred to the purchaser of the credit. For calculating renewables portfolio standard procurement obligations, electricity generated and sold by a public entity with renewable energy credits must be added to the total retail sales of the buyer."
