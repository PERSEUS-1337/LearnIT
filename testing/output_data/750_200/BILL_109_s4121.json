    "content": "The curr_chunk is a section titled \"TREATMENT OF LIABILITY FOR CERTAIN MULTIPLE EMPLOYER PLANS.\" The curr_chunk discusses the election process for an eligible employer regarding the determination of liability for an applicable pension plan. If the employer elects subsection (b), liability will be determined under that subsection, otherwise, it will be determined under subsection (c). If an eligible employer elects within 180 days of the enactment of this Act, the applicable pension plan will be treated as having spun off assets and liabilities to an eligible spunoff plan, with the employer's liability determined by the spunoff plan. The employer's liability for an eligible spunoff plan will be determined by the plan itself, in lieu of any other liability to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation or the applicable pension plan. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 amendments will not apply to ongoing funding liability for eligible spunoff plans. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 amendments do not apply to ongoing funding liability for eligible spunoff plans, with the employer being liable for contributions to the plan until it ceases to be eligible or January 1, 2017. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 amendments do not apply to ongoing funding liability for eligible spunoff plans, with the employer being liable for contributions to the plan until it ceases to be eligible or January 1, 2017. The liability for the spunoff plan is subject to the same conditions as under ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code, in lieu of any other liability to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation or the applicable pension plan. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 amendments do not apply to ongoing funding liability for eligible spunoff plans. The employer is responsible for contributions to the plan until it ceases to be eligible or January 1, 2017. The liability for the spunoff plan follows ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code, instead of any other liability to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation or the applicable pension plan. For plan years starting after December 31, 2007, and before the amendments of section 401 apply, the third segment rate under the Pension Protection Act of 2006 will be used for eligible spunoff plans. For eligible spunoff plans, the Code will be used instead of the regular interest rate. If a plan terminates before December 31, 2010, the employer's liability will be determined based on specific assumptions and methods. The employer's liability for a terminated pension plan under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 is determined based on specific assumptions and methods. This liability will be in lieu of any other liability to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation or the pension plan. If an eligible employer does not elect spinoff, their liability remains under the Act. An eligible employer not electing spinoff under ERISA will be liable to the corporation for the pension plan's unfunded benefit liabilities as of December 31, 2005. The term \"adjusted unfunded benefit liabilities\" refers to the amount of unfunded benefit liabilities without regard to any adjusted liabilities to be transferred to an eligible spunoff plan as of December 31, 2005. The term \"fractional portion\" refers to a fraction representing the amount required to be contributed to the pension plan for the 5 plan years before. The term \"applicable pension plan\" refers to a single employer plan established in Alaska on March 18, 1967. The amount required to be contributed to the plan is calculated based on a fraction where the numerator is the employer's contribution for the 5 plan years before December 31, 2005, and the denominator is the total contribution by all employers not making a specific election. The term \"plan\" refers to a single employer plan established in Alaska on March 18, 1967, with 2 or more contributing sponsors as of January 1, 2005. The \"allocable portion\" is the portion of an applicable pension plan's liabilities and assets based on the employer's share. An eligible employer in an eligible multiple employer plan is determined by the liabilities and assets of the plan, with the employer's share of the excess liabilities over assets being a key factor."
