    "content": "P.L. 106-554, signed in December 2000, enacted H.R. 5658 for Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government Appropriations in 2001. Funding was provided for various government accounts, including the General Services Administration and the Executive Residence for White House transitions. The President signed a transportation appropriations bill that partially funds accounts for White House transitions. Various measures were considered before the enactment of the FY2001 Treasury and General Government appropriations. Key measures include H.R. 4871 and S. Key measures include H.R. 4871 (House bill), S. 2900 (Senate bill), H.R. 4516 / H.R. 4985 (Legislative Branch Appropriation), P.L. 106-346 (Transportation Appropriations), P.L. 106-275 (FY2001 Continuing Funding Resolution), P.L. 106-426, P.L. 106-520 (presidential transition funding), and P.L. 106-554 (Enacts H.R. 5658, Treasury and General Government appropriations). The Act P.L. 106-554 authorizes funding for the presidential transition and White House moving expenses. P.L. 106-554 funds accounts within Treasury, Postal Service, Executive Office of the President, and General Government for FY2001. P.L. 106-346 provides supplemental funding for certain accounts. The President must submit the Budget of the United States Government annually to Congress. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) submits the Budget of the United States Government annually to Congress. Congress establishes a concurrent resolution for the government's budget and allocates funding levels to subcommittees. The FY2001 allocations for Treasury and General Government appropriations are discussed in the report. The FY2001 allocations for Treasury and General Government appropriations fund various law enforcement organizations under the Department of the Treasury, including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, Customs Service, Secret Service, and others. Additionally, Treasury appropriations cover agencies like the Internal Revenue Service, Financial Management Service, and Bureau of the Public Debt. The U.S. Postal Service is mostly self-supporting. The U.S. Postal Service is self-supporting, with limited federal contributions for services like free postal service for the blind. Appropriations for the Executive Office of the President cover salaries, expenses, and operations of various agencies within the EOP. The Executive Office of the President (EOP) funds various organizations like the Council of Economic Advisers, National Security Council, and Office of Management and Budget. The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) distributes funding for drug control initiatives to other entities. Independent agencies funded through this appropriation include the Federal Election Commission, General Services Administration, and National Archives. The Treasury and General Government appropriation includes titles that set governmentwide restrictions and rules, such as prohibiting the use of funds for employing non-U.S. citizens, requiring drug-free workplaces, and authorizing defined actions. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2001 includes provisions for drug-free workplaces, travel expenses for federal employees' immediate family members, and a .22% across-the-board rescission of FY2001 discretionary budget authority. A .22% across-the-board rescission of FY2001 discretionary budget authority and obligation limitations funds will affect all accounts in the Treasury and General Government appropriations. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) must report on the implementation of the rescission when the FY2002 budget is submitted. The rescission applies to all net positive discretionary budget authority and obligation limitations, including advance appropriations provided in earlier years. The Act mandates a 0.22% reduction in FY2001 discretionary budget authority and obligation limitations. Advance appropriations from FY2000 or earlier are affected, while those for FY2002 and beyond are not. Emergency appropriations are also subject to the reduction, applied equally to all programs, projects, and activities. The Act mandates a 0.22% reduction in FY2001 discretionary budget authority and obligation limitations. Agencies will be provided with their rescission amounts by account and must allocate the reduction on a pro-rata basis to every program, project, and activity. The OMB will provide agencies with their rescission amounts by account. Reductions must be allocated on a pro-rata basis to all programs, projects, and activities. Reductions are required to be made from discretionary budget authority and obligation limitations only. The FY2001 budget submission included a 0.38% rescission, with specific reductions reported by the Office of Management and Budget. The administration stated that each department had to achieve the 0.38% savings, with some flexibility to protect high-priority programs. Certain programs were exempt from the rescission provisions, but overall it was to be universally applied. The FY2001 Military Construction Appropriations Act exempts certain programs from the rescission provisions, affecting accounts covered by the Treasury/Postal Service measure. The pay date for federal civilian personnel will revert to the original scheduled date in FY2000, altering the funding level for FY2000. When the term \"net\" is used, it refers to the FY2000 appropriated levels reduced by the rescinded amount as reported by OMB and the supplemental. Table 4 provides a visual representation of this information. Table 4 summarizes FY2000 enacted funding levels, including House and Senate reported or passed funding, and FY2001 enacted levels. It includes accounts with significant funding or critical discussion. FY2000 enacted levels reflect rescissions and supplemental funding. Additionally, there were four legislative measures for appropriations for Treasury and General Government.

On July 27, 2000, H.Rept. 106-797 was filed to waive points of order against the conference report for H.R. 4516. The House agreed to the rule by a recorded vote of 214 ayes to 210 noes, with one voting \"present\" (Roll No. 448). On September 14, 2000, the House agreed to the conference report for H.R. 4516 (FY2001 legislative branch funding) with funding for the Treasury and General Government accounts.

The Department of Treasury's FY2001 funding totals $13.89 billion, with $8.86 billion allocated to the IRS. The budget request for the department is $14.520 billion, which includes increases for department-wide systems, Money Laundering Strategy, interagency crime and drug enforcement, and Secret Service, ATF, and Customs Service. A .22% rescission would result in a departmental reduction of approximately $30 million. The Department of Treasury's FY2001 funding totals $13.89 billion, with $8.86 billion allocated to the IRS. The budget request for the department is $14.520 billion, including increases for interagency crime and drug enforcement, Secret Service, ATF, and Customs Service. The House Appropriations committee reported H.R. 4871, providing $13.225 billion for the department.

The Senate's S. 2900 proposed $13.161 billion for the department. The Senate Committee on Appropriations proposed $13.161 billion for the Department of Treasury, with the IRS receiving $8.639 billion. Additional funding was allocated to various Treasury accounts through the Department of Transportation funding bill. The Department of Treasury is directed to establish a new National Terrorist Asset Tracking Center, increase staff in the Office of Foreign Assets Control, and implement a centralized vehicle acquisition program. Additional funding is allocated for department-wide systems and capital investments, as well as for expanded access to financial services and federal law enforcement training. $5 million allocated for a metropolitan area law enforcement training center accessible by various federal agencies and police departments. $25 million designated for design and construction. Additional funding for Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, U.S. Customs Service, and Internal Revenue Service for tax law enforcement and information technology investments. In FY1999, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) collected over $12 billion in taxes, penalties, fines, and other revenues. The ATF's mission focuses on reducing crime, collecting revenue, and protecting the public. In FY1999, ATF collected $12,135,929,000 in taxes, penalties, fines, and other revenues. Congress increased ATF's direct appropriations from $336,040,000 to $604,573,000 from FY1992 to FY2000. For FY2001, Congress appropriated $772,843,000 in direct funding for ATF, including $768,695,000 for salaries and expenses and $4,148,000 for counter-terrorism. In FY2001, Congress fully funded the administration's request for ATF, providing $4,148,000 for counter-terrorism. The vetoed Legislative Branch conference agreement would have allocated $768,695,000 to ATF, with the House bill proposing $731,325,000 and the Senate version $724,937,000. The administration's request included $105,298,000 for program budget increases. The administration's FY2001 request included $105,298,000 in program budget increases for various initiatives, such as the Integrated Violence Reduction Strategy, Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative, gun tracing, ballistic imaging, tobacco compliance, and national laboratory center transition. Additionally, funding was requested to relocate the ATF headquarters. Congress provided an additional $41,322,000 to expand the Integrated Violence Reduction Strategy, bringing total funding to $62,200,000. In FY2001, Congress allocated $41,322,000 to fund 224 agents, 112 inspectors, and 59 support staff for the Integrated Violence Reduction Strategy (IVRS), bringing total funding to $62,200,000. ATF planned to intensify local firearm initiatives and investigate cases of prohibited persons attempting to purchase firearms. In FY2001, Congress allocated $19,078,000 to expand the Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative (YCGII) to 12 additional cities, providing funding for 72 agents and 98 inspectors. This brings total funding for the program to $76,400,000. ATF will investigate cases of prohibited persons attempting to purchase firearms and ensure instant checks are being performed on all firearm transfers. In FY2001, Congress allocated $19,078,000 to expand the Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative (YCGII) to 12 additional cities, providing funding for 72 agents and 98 inspectors. This brings total funding for the program to $76,400,000 and expands its presence to 50 cities. The objective of YCGII is to reduce youth firearm violence and firearms trafficking by providing federal resources to state and local law enforcement agencies. Additionally, $16 million was provided for the Gang Resistance Education and Training (GREAT) program, where ATF agents and police officers teach an anti-violence curriculum to fourth and seventh graders. In FY2001, Congress allocated $9,990,000 for the Comprehensive Crime Gun Tracing Initiative, bringing total funding to $25,000,000.

A memorandum of understanding was signed to further develop the Integrated Ballistics Identification System. Congress also provided funding for the national laboratory transition and relocation of the ATF headquarters. From 1993 to 1997, the ATF and FBI operated two parallel systems. Congress funded the national laboratory transition and ATF headquarters relocation but did not fund the Tobacco Compliance/Diversion initiative. The increase in funding was needed for monitoring new permit and revenue requirements for tobacco importers. ATF's controversial activities include regulating and enforcing laws related to firearms commerce and possession. The House and Senate bills aimed to restrict the Department of Treasury from favoring manufacturers or vendors who agree to stricter regulations on firearms. Smith & Wesson Corporation's deal with HUD sparked controversy. The Smith & Wesson Corporation entered into an agreement with HUD, but the language regarding preferences for manufacturers was not included in the enacted legislation. The U.S. Customs Service, responsible for regulating trade between the U.S. and other countries, collected $22.4 billion in duties in FY1999. Congress increased funding for the Customs Service by 33% from FY1992 to FY2000. In FY2001, Congress increased funding for the U.S. Customs Service by 18% to $2,281,327,000. This includes $1,863,765,000 for salaries and expenses, and an additional $18,934,000 for counter-terrorism. The total amount is $5,167,000 less than the Administration's request. In FY2001, Congress increased funding for the U.S. Customs Service by 18% to $2,281,327,000, including $1,863,765,000 for salaries and expenses and an additional $18,934,000 for counter-terrorism. Congress provided $133,228,000 for the air and marine interdiction account, along with an additional $7,000,000. Congress also allocated $258,400,000 for the modernization of Customs' automated systems, which is $80,000,000 less than the projected fee receipts. In FY2001, Congress increased funding for the U.S. Customs Service by 18% to $2,281,327,000, including $1,863,765,000 for salaries and expenses. Congress also provided $258,400,000 for the modernization of Customs' automated systems, which is $80,000,000 less than projected fee receipts. The vetoed Legislative Branch appropriations conference agreement would have provided Customs with $1,863,725,000. The House bill (H.R. 4871) and the Senate bill (S. 2900) allocated different amounts of funding for Customs, with the House bill providing $1,822,365,000 and the Senate bill providing $1,804,687,000. The Legislative Branch measure allocated $133,228,000 for the air and marine interdiction account. The Administration's FY2001 budget request included $41,517,000 in program budget enhancements for Customs, including initiatives for drug investigations, narcotics illicit proceeds strategy, forced child labor, and other expenses.

The remaining $119,188,000 in increased funding was for various budget adjustments to maintain current service levels. The vetoed conference agreement included earmarks for the Southwest border initiative and security. The vetoed conference agreement included earmarks for various initiatives such as the Southwest border, security enhancement on the northern border, vehicle replacement, money laundering, drug investigations, and forced child labor. Compared to the House bill, there were differences in earmarked increases for drug investigations and forced child labor initiatives. Customs' Automated Commercial System (ACS) is used to track and process all commercial goods imported. Customs' Automated Commercial System (ACS) has faced challenges with \"brownouts\" hindering international commerce. Congress has allocated funds to upgrade ACS and develop its replacement, the Automated Commercial Environment (ACE). Customs received funding from Congress to upgrade ACS and develop ACE. Congress directed Customs to provide a revised blueprint, schedule, and budget for ACE in the FY2000 conference report. The Administration requested $338 million for automation modernization in FY2001, including a new user fee to offset ACE developmental costs. The Administration requested $338 million for automation modernization in FY2001, including a new user fee to offset ACE developmental costs. Congress rejected the fee proposal and provided over $258 million in direct appropriation for ACS, ITDS, and ACE development. The Administration requested $338 million for automation modernization in FY2001, with $5 million for ITDS and at least $130 million for ACE development. The cost of ACE development over 7 years is estimated to be between $1.4 and $1.8 billion. Customs would begin taking bids to develop the new system in FY2001. GAO testified that Customs had implemented recommendations to reduce duplication of effort and improve acquisition and investment management for ACE development, which is a complex and high-risk endeavor. The development of ACE is a complex and high-risk endeavor that supports the agency's ability to collect billions of dollars in revenue generated by imports. Customs generates offsetting receipts from two user fee programs, including conveyance- and passenger-related user fees and commerce-related merchandise processing fees. The Customs agency collects revenue from two user fee programs, including conveyance- and passenger-related fees and commerce-related merchandise processing fees. The merchandise processing fee receipts are not controlled by Customs, while the COBRA fee receipts are not appropriated by Congress and provide a significant portion of Customs funding. There are limitations on the use of COBRA fee receipts, which have increased from $176 million to $299 million from FY1992 to FY2000. The COBRA fee receipts have increased from $176 million to $299 million. These receipts are used to fund permanent inspector positions and information technology costs. However, there has been a recent drop-off in air passenger processing fee receipts, leading to a growing reliance on COBRA fee receipts to fund base positions. The COBRA fee receipts have increased significantly, but there is a concern about a drop-off in air passenger processing fee receipts. This reliance on COBRA fees to fund positions may cause issues in the future, especially with the authorization for COBRA fees expiring at the end of FY2003. Additionally, there is a request for increased funding for the IRS in FY2001. The net funding for FY2000 was $8,216,489,000, with a 0.38% rescission in the IRS Processing, Assistance, and Management account. The budget increase focuses on maintaining operations and modernization, requiring additional staffing for enforcement and customer service. H.R. 4871 would have funded IRS programs at $8.453 billion. The House passed H.R. 4871 to fund IRS programs at $8.453 billion, with a net increase of $236.5 million. Amendments reduced funding for certain accounts to allocate funds for other programs, such as the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas program and a pilot project for checking radioactive materials in scrap metal imports. The Senate Appropriations Committee (S. 2900) proposed funding the IRS at $8.535 billion, with higher levels for most accounts compared to the House. P.L. 106-554 allocated $8.639 million for IRS accounts, with $3,567.0 million for Processing, Assistance, and Management, and funding for Tax Law Enforcement. The IRS received $8.639 million in funding, with $3,567.0 million for Processing, Assistance, and Management, $3,382.4 million for Tax Law Enforcement, and $1,545 million for Information Systems. The vetoed conference agreement was the same as the final version, with objections raised over FY2001 IRS funding in the Legislative Branch Appropriations. The White House hinted at a veto if certain accounts were not addressed. On October 23, the President signed P.L. 106-346 which partially funded selected accounts in the Treasury/General Government bill. Despite this, the President later vetoed the Legislative Branch Appropriations on October 30. The IRS was instructed to delay implementing a no-cost Internet tax filing service until concerns were addressed in a report to Congress. Tax Law Enforcement received $7.974 million in funding. The IRS is instructed to delay implementing a no-cost Internet tax filing service until concerns are addressed in a report to Congress. Tax Law Enforcement receives $7.974 million in funding, including support for the money laundering strategy and additional funds for agents to participate in Joint Terrorism Task Forces. Information Technology Investments receive $71.751 million, subject to conditions. Staff Tax Administration for Balance and Equity receives $141 million in a new account, pending approval of a staffing plan by relevant authorities. The IRS proposed the STABLE initiative to improve service to taxpayers by increasing staff, particularly in the Tax Law Enforcement account. This initiative aims to strategically place new hires where they are most needed, such as in auditing. The STABLE initiative proposed by the IRS aims to strategically place new hires in auditing, enforcement, and customer relations. H.R. 4985 does not provide funding for this initiative, but the Tax Law Enforcement account will be fully funded to maintain current service levels. The conference version for FY2001 is lower than the President's request for the Secret Service budget. The President requested $829.5 million for the Secret Service in FY2001, with $824.5 million for salaries, expenses, research, and vehicle purchases, and $5 million for acquisition and construction. FY2000 funding was $691.5 million, with a rescission of $738,000.

The acquisitions, construction, and related expenses account is funded at $8.941 million, including $3.920 million for security enhancement at the Vice President's residence. P.L. 106-346 provides supplemental funding of $2.9 million for salaries and expenses, with funds allocated for 21 agents to participate in Joint Terrorism Task Forces. Section 506 stipulates that $2 million of the FY2001 Secret Service funding be available for forensic support of investigations of missing and exploited children. H.R. 4871 would fund the agency's salaries and expenses at $823.8 million, $156.5 million above FY2000. It includes $36.2 million for activities previously funded elsewhere and $1.8 million for the National Threat Assessment Center. Additionally, $24.2 million is allocated for Secret Service protective requirements during the Presidential election. The Senate-reported version of S. 2900 would fund the salaries and expenses account at $778.3 million, while the vetoed conference agreement on H.R. 4516/H.R. 4985 would have funded it at $8.9 million, including $3.9 million for security enhancements. The U.S. Postal Service generates funding through product sales and services, with an appropriation from the federal government for revenue foregone on free and reduced rate mail. The President requested $96.1 million for revenue foregone in FY2001, with $67.1 million delayed until October 1, 2001. The President requested $96.1 million for revenue foregone in FY2001, with $67.1 million delayed until October 1, 2001. Funding for revenue foregone in FY2000 was $93.4 million, reduced by .38% to $93.1 million. P.L. 106-554 provided $29 million for FY2001 with an advance appropriation of $67.1 million for FY2002. The rescission of .22% applies only to FY2001 funding, affecting funds appropriated in FY2000. H.R. 4871 held $67.1 million for FY2002, while S. 2900 funded the Postal Service at $67.1 million. The vetoed measure would have provided $96.1 million, with $67.1 million for advance appropriations and $29 million for reimbursement in FY2001. The House proposed $67.1 million for advance appropriations and $29 million for reimbursement to the Postal Service in FY2001. All versions included a provision for the Postal Service to use funds for guards with similar powers as special policemen. The Treasury and General Government appropriations act funds most offices in the Executive Office of the President, with three exceptions. The Council on Environmental Quality, Office of Science and Technology, and Office of the United States Trade Representative are funded under different appropriations acts. The Executive Office of the President is funded through various appropriations acts, with the Office of the United States Trade Representative funded under the Commerce, Justice, State, and the Judiciary appropriations act. The President's FY2001 budget proposed a $702,245,000 appropriation for the EOP, a 7.3% increase from FY2000. Nearly 70% of these funds would be allocated to the Office of National Drug Control Policy and Federal Drug Control Programs, with a significant portion transferred to state and local entities. The FY2001 appropriation request for these \"transfer accounts\" is $474,900,000. The FY2001 appropriation request for the Executive Office of the President amounts to $474,900,000 (67.6%), with a 56% increase in compensation for the President compared to FY2000. The FY2001 budget includes a $390,000 compensation for the President, with a $50,000 expense allowance, representing a 56% increase from FY2000. This increase is due to the raise in presidential salary to $400,000 per year. The White House Office budget for salaries and expenses is $53,288,000, a 2% increase from FY2000, with $201,000 rescinded. H.R. 4871 proposed $52,135,000, $1,153,000 below the President's request. The House denied requests to restore rescinded funds and provide additional compensation. H.R. 4871 proposed $52,135,000 for the White House Office, which is $1,153,000 below the President's request. The House denied requests to restore funds rescinded in FY 2000, provide severance payments, cover equipment replacement costs, and unspecified service increases. They also assumed a transfer of $500,000 for web page upgrades. S. 2900 and vetoed bills H.R. 4516/H.R. 4985 would fund the White House Office at the requested level. The Executive Residence received the requested $10,900,000 for operating expenses. H.R. 4985, as vetoed, would fund the White House Office at the requested level with $10,900,000 for operating expenses, a 17.7% increase over the previous year. The request for repairs and restoration was $968,000, a 581.2% increase over the previous appropriation. H.R. 4871 would have allocated $10,286,470 for operating expenses and denied requests for additional FTEs and repairs and restoration funding. The House Appropriation Committee denied requests for additional funding for FTEs and repairs, including $658,000 for repairs and restoration. S. 2900 and H.R. 4516/H.R. 4985 would have funded the accounts at the requested level, with the latter limiting repairs and restoration funding to $968,000. The repairs and restoration funding includes design and replacement of the concrete raceway containing communication lines. The restoration funding of $458,000 is allocated for the design and replacement of the concrete raceway containing communication lines in the East Wing and Executive Residence. A completed design with total construction cost estimates must be submitted to the Committees on Appropriations. Additionally, the FY2001 funding resolution authorizes expenditures for the transition and moving expenses following the 2000 election, providing approximately $200,000. The House Appropriations Committee allocated $200,000 for transition and moving expenses after the 2000 election. Maintenance and repair costs for the White House are funded by the National Park Service, while entertainment costs for state functions are covered by the Department of State. Reimbursable political events in the Executive Residence must be paid in advance by the sponsor. The Executive Residence requires advance payments from sponsors for reimbursable political events, with deposits from the President's political party. Reimbursements must be separately accounted for and sponsoring organizations billed. The staff reports to the Committees on Appropriations and maintains a tracking system for reimbursable expenses. The Act appropriates $3,673,000 for salaries and expenses, a 1.5% increase from the previous year, and $354,000 for the Official Residence of the Vice President, a 2.6% increase.

The Federal Pay Comparability Act of 1990 mandates annual adjustments for federal white-collar employees based on private sector salary changes. The base pay adjustment for federal white-collar employees is determined by changes in private sector salaries reflected in the Employment Cost Index (ECI). The adjustment rate for January 2001 is 2.7%, with no proposed changes. The budget recommendation is for 3.7%, leading to a second tier adjustment of 1%. The legislation assumes programs are funded to accommodate a 1% adjustment rate. Locality-based payments are calculated based on surveys of occupations in specific localities within the US. President Clinton proposed locality payments equal to 1% of payroll. The Federal Wage System compensates federal blue-collar workers. The Federal Wage System compensates federal blue-collar workers based on local wage rates. Congress has limited adjustments to rates, tying them to the General Schedule. The Federal Wage System compensates federal blue-collar workers based on local wage rates, with adjustments tied to the General Schedule. Wages in lower cost areas can increase based on wage surveys, but high cost area wages are capped. Pay adjustments for federal officials, including Members of Congress and judges, are also based on ECI calculations. The pay adjustment for federal officials, including Members of Congress and judges, is based on ECI calculations for a different 12-month period. The ECI calculations would dictate a 3% pay adjustment in January 2001, but the adjustment is limited to the rate of adjustment for the General Schedule. If the General Schedule base pay is adjusted at 2.7%, that will be the maximum rate of adjustment in salaries of federal officials. Despite reports that the President vetoed a pay raise for Members of Congress, the raise would still go into effect.

Federal funds refer to all monies collected and spent by the federal government, excluding trust funds. Obligations are binding agreements that require payment, while outlays are payments made to liquidate obligations. The PAGO process was established by the Budget Enforcement Act to ensure fiscal responsibility. The PAGO (Pay-as-You-Go) Process, established by the Budget Enforcement Act, ensures that revenue and direct spending legislation does not increase the deficit or reduce the surplus. It requires any deficit increase or surplus reduction to be offset by other legislation or sequestration.
