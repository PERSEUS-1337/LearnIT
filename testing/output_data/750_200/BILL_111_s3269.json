    "content": "The Act is known as the \"Safe Teen and Novice Driver Uniform Protection Act of 2010\" or the \"STANDUP Act\". Congress finds that motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for Americans aged 15-20, with a high fatality rate for drivers in this age group compared to older drivers. Teenage drivers, especially 16-year-olds, have a significantly higher fatality and crash rate compared to drivers between 25 and 70 years old. Teenage drivers account for over one-third of all fatalities in crashes they are involved in, with nearly two-thirds of all fatalities in those crashes. According to studies, teenage drivers have a higher fatality and crash rate compared to older drivers. The chance of a crash for 16- or 17-year-old drivers doubles with 2 peers in the vehicle and quadruples with 3 or more peers. Cognitive distraction from cell phones significantly impacts driving. According to studies, teenage drivers, especially those between 15 and 20 years old, are significantly affected by cognitive distraction from cell phones, leading to degraded performance. Despite only 20 percent of teenage driving occurring at night, over 50 percent of motor vehicle crash fatalities involving teenage drivers happen during nighttime. In 1997, Florida's graduated driver licensing system saw a decrease in fatal and injurious crashes among teenage drivers aged 15 to 18. Between 1998 and 2000, California's graduated driver licensing program led to a 9% decrease in fatal and injurious crashes among teenage drivers aged 15 to 18. In Michigan and North Carolina, crashes involving 16-year-old drivers decreased by 25% and 27% respectively between 1995 and 1999 after implementing comprehensive graduated driver licensing systems. Between 1998 and 2000, California's graduated driver licensing program resulted in a 40% decrease in teenage passenger deaths and injuries involving 16-year-old drivers, and a 24% decline in at-fault collisions. Over 40 states and the District of Columbia have implemented 3-stage graduated driver programs, as reported by the National Transportation Safety Board. Many states have implemented 3-stage graduated driver licensing systems, but some have not included other basic safety features. A 2001 Harris Poll shows strong support for requirements such as 30 to 50 hours of practice driving with an adult and a 6-month learner's permit period. According to a 2001 Harris Poll, 92% of Americans support a 6-month learner's permit period, and 74% support limiting teenage passengers and supervised driving during high-risk periods. State graduated driver licensing laws. State graduated driver licensing laws require novice drivers under 21 to go through a 2-stage process before getting an unrestricted license, starting with a learner's permit at 16 years old. State's driver's license laws include a learner's permit stage that starts at 16 years old, lasts at least 6 months, prohibits cellphone use while driving, prohibits night driving, and remains in effect until the intermediate stage begins. The intermediate stage of the driver's license laws starts after the learner's permit stage, lasts at least 6 months, and prohibits cellphone use while driving. It remains in effect until the driver reaches 18 years of age. The intermediate stage of driver's license laws prohibits nonemergency cellphone use, night driving, having more than 1 non-familial passenger under 21 without a licensed driver over 21 present, and lasts until the driver turns 18. The learner's permit stage includes 40 hours of behind-the-wheel training with a licensed driver over 21, a driver training course, and other requirements set by the Secretary of Transportation. In the learner's permit or intermediate stage, a requirement is that the driver must be accompanied and supervised by a licensed driver over 21 while operating a motor vehicle. The grant of an unrestricted driver's license may be automatically delayed for individuals convicted of driving-related offenses during the learner's permit or intermediate stage, such as driving while intoxicated, misrepresentation of age, reckless driving, or driving without wearing a seat. The Secretary of Transportation will establish regulations for implementing restrictions on individuals convicted of driving-related offenses, including reckless driving, not wearing a seat belt, speeding, or other offenses deemed relevant. SEC. 4. INCENTIVE GRANTS. The Secretary of Transportation will award grants to States in compliance with section 3(a) for the first 3 fiscal years after the Act's enactment.

The Secretary will award grants to States for enforcing a 2-stage licensing process, training law enforcement personnel, and carrying out administrative activities. $25,000,000 is appropriated annually from the Highway Trust Fund for this purpose. SEC. 5. WITHHOLDING OF FUNDS FOR NONCOMPLIANCE. During the fourth fiscal year after the enactment of the Act, the Secretary will withhold 3 percent of funds from states not in compliance with section 3(a).
