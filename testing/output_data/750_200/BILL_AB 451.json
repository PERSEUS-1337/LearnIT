    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 21107.8 of the Vehicle Code is amended to allow cities or counties to declare privately owned offstreet parking facilities open for public use, subject to certain regulations. If a city or county enacts an ordinance allowing privately owned offstreet parking facilities to regulate unauthorized parking, the owner must include contest instructions in parking fee invoices. If a city or county authorizes privately owned offstreet parking facilities to regulate unauthorized parking, the owner or operator cannot submit parking fee invoices to the Department of Motor Vehicles to collect unpaid fees by withholding licenses or vehicle registration renewals. An ordinance or resolution does not apply to offstreet parking facilities unless a notice is posted at each entrance warning of public moving vehicle laws and potential parking invoice fees for violators. Parking receipts must also include language about potential fees for violators. Section 22507.8 may be enforced without the need for an ordinance or resolution, as long as a notice is posted at each entrance of the offstreet parking facility warning of potential parking invoice fees for violators. The department is not required to patrol or enforce provisions of the code on privately owned offstreet parking facilities, except for those applicable to private property. Cities or counties must include dispute resolution procedures in their ordinances for private parking regulation. Dispute resolution procedures for private parking regulation must include a written policy with specified timeframes, an administrative hearing process with options for in-person or mail hearings, administrative review, and a hearing by a third-party examiner. The examiner must provide an independent, fair, and impartial decision delivered in person or by mail. The regulations include personal or mail delivery of an examiner's decision, installment payment options for those unable to pay in full, a prohibition on incentives based on issued or disputed invoices, and a cap on parking invoice fees. Measures to prevent private parking regulators from impersonating government agencies, including prohibiting certain terminology and requiring a disclaimer on parking fee invoices."
