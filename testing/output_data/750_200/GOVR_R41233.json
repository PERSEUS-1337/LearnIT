    "content": "Most of the funding for HUD comes from annual appropriations by Congress to address housing problems for low-income households. Rental assistance programs like Public Housing, Section 8 Vouchers, and Section 8 project-based rental assistance are key, along with block grant programs like HOME and Community Development Block Grants. HUD's non-emergency funding in FY2010 is mainly allocated to rental assistance programs, with HOME and Community Development Block Grants supporting housing and community development activities for low-income families. Specialized grant programs also cater to homeless individuals, including those with AIDS. The Federal Housing Administration insures mortgages for lower-income home buyers and developers of affordable rental buildings. FHA sustains itself through fees from insured borrowers. FHA collects fees from insured borrowers to sustain the insurance fund and offset administrative costs. Surplus funds have been used to support the HUD budget, including emergency funding for disaster recovery and economic stimulus programs. Total enacted appropriations for HUD are presented in Table 1. The economic stimulus legislation (P.L. 111-5) provided over $13 billion to HUD's programs in recent years, increasing regular funding by 57% in the past nine years. HUD's budget has seen year-over-year increases of 5% or more each year, with growth of nearly 10% in FY2009 and nearly 12% in FY2010. Adjusting for inflation, the growth rate has been significant. HUD's budget has had significant year-over-year increases, with growth of nearly 10% in FY2009 and nearly 12% in FY2010. Adjusting for inflation, the growth in \"real\" funding has been less robust, growing by about 17% over a nine-year period. Most of the growth in HUD's budget has come in the last two years. HUD's funding is made up of several components, including regular annual appropriations and emergency appropriations. HUD's annual funding, or budget authority, consists of regular annual appropriations, emergency appropriations, rescissions, and offsets. The funding for HUD's programs and activities mainly comes from regular annual appropriations, also known as discretionary appropriations. Congress may also provide emergency appropriations in response to disasters. In some years, Congress provides emergency appropriations through HUD's programs, usually in response to disasters. These funds are separate from regular appropriations and are subject to limits on new discretionary funding. Ways to stay within these limits include providing less in regular appropriations or finding offsets. Rescissions are used to offset a portion of HUD's regular annual appropriations. The cost of HUD's regular annual appropriations acts is offset through rescissions and offsetting receipts and collections. The total net budget authority for HUD is determined by the interaction between new appropriations and offsets provided through rescissions, receipts, and collections. Net budget authority is the estimated \"cost\" of the HUD budget. The net budget authority for HUD is the estimated \"cost\" of the budget, determined by new appropriations and offsets like rescissions and receipts. The total net budget authority increased 57% from over $29 billion to over $46 billion between FY2002 and FY2010. Between FY2002 and FY2010, net non-emergency budget authority for HUD increased by 57%, reaching over $46 billion. This growth was not solely due to increased appropriations for HUD programs, as regular annual appropriations only grew by 37% during this period. Between FY2002 and FY2010, net non-emergency budget authority for HUD increased by 57%, reaching over $46 billion. The growth in regular appropriations grew by only 37%, with decreases in offsetting receipts and collections and rescinded amounts contributing to the increase in net budget authority. The 37% growth in regular appropriations is mainly due to growth in HUD's Section 8 voucher program. The 37% growth in regular appropriations from FY2002 to FY2010 is largely due to the increase in HUD's Section 8 voucher and project-based rental assistance programs, which account for the majority of the HUD budget. Appropriations for Section 8 programs grew by over 70%, while funding for other HUD programs only grew by 8%. Section 8 programs went from 46% to 57% of HUD's regular appropriations during this period. In FY2002, Section 8 programs accounted for 46% of HUD's regular appropriations, increasing to 57% by FY2010. Funding for other HUD programs also began to grow in FY2009 and FY2010. The decline in offsetting receipts is mainly due to decreases in receipts from FHA mortgage insurance programs, dropping from over $3 billion in FY2004 to under $0.5 billion in FY2010. The amount available from FHA to offset the cost of new HUD appropriations has decreased significantly from over $3 billion in FY2004 to under $0.5 billion in FY2010. The annual appropriations process starts with the President's budget request, followed by hearings and crafting of appropriations legislation by the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. Legislation must be enacted before September 30 to avoid a government funding lapse. The appropriations process must be completed by September 30 to avoid a government funding lapse. Short-term continuing resolutions are enacted when Congress does not finish appropriations action on time. The FY2011 appropriations process lasted over a year and spanned two calendar years and Congresses. The FY2011 appropriations process for HUD lasted over a year and spanned two Congresses. The President's budget requested about $45.6 billion in net new budget authority for HUD, a 3% increase in appropriations for HUD programs in aggregate. The President's budget proposed a 3% increase in appropriations for HUD programs, with a decrease in net new budget authority. The increase would be offset by a substantial increase in offsetting collections and receipts, mainly from proposed changes to the FHA mortgage insurance programs. Funding increases were requested for Section 8 programs, programs for the homeless, and HUD's research and technology needs, while funding for other programs was decreased. The President's budget proposed increased funding for Section 8 programs, homeless programs, and HUD's research and technology needs. Decreased funding was requested for programs for the elderly, persons with disabilities, and public housing capital repairs. The FY2011 HUD funding bill approved by the House would have provided about $1 billion more than requested by the President, resulting in a 1% increase in net new budget authority over the FY2010 enacted level. The FY2011 HUD funding bill approved by the House provided about $1 billion more than requested by the President, rejecting proposed cuts to housing programs for the elderly and persons with disabilities, public housing capital funding, and certain initiatives. The bill was not enacted before the end of the 111th Congress. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved a FY2011 HUD funding bill (S. 3644) that would have provided about $1 billion more for HUD than requested by the President. The bill included a 1% increase in net new budget authority and a 5% increase in appropriations for HUD programs. It also rejected proposed cuts to housing programs for the elderly and persons with disabilities, public housing capital funding, and the brownfields program. The Senate committee bill rejected proposed cuts to housing programs for the elderly and persons with disabilities, public housing capital funding, and the brownfields program. It would have funded the President's Transforming Rental Assistance initiative and Choice Neighborhoods Initiative. The bill was not enacted before the end of the 111th Congress. During the 111th Congress, a series of continuing resolutions were enacted to maintain funding at the FY2010 level for most federal budget accounts, including HUD's budget. The last CR approved before adjournment was set to expire on March 4, 2011, or upon the enactment of FY2011 appropriations legislation, leaving funding for the remainder of FY2011 to the 112th Congress. The 111th Congress passed a series of continuing resolutions to maintain funding at FY2010 levels for federal budget accounts, including HUD. The last CR was set to expire on March 4, 2011, leaving funding for the rest of FY2011 to the 112th Congress. P.L. 111-322 extended FHA mortgage limits through FY2011. H.R. 1 proposed funding HUD programs at FY2010 levels but with cuts, resulting in $5 billion less in appropriations. H.R. 1 proposed funding HUD programs at FY2010 levels with cuts, resulting in $5 billion less in appropriations. The Senate failed to pass H.R. 1, which would have provided about $7 billion less in net new budget authority compared to FY2010. On March 9, 2011, the Senate considered but did not pass H.R. 1 and a Senate Amendment to H.R. 1 (S.Amdt. 149). The Amendment would have increased funding for HUD by nearly $6 billion without rescinding any FY2010 funding. It would have reduced net budget authority from FY2010 by over $1 billion (under 3%) but increased aggregate appropriations by about $900 million (under 2%) due to higher offsetting receipts from FHA in FY2011. The 112th Congress approved a short-term CR (H.J.Res. 44, P.L. 112-4) to fund the government through March 18, 2011, with most accounts funded at FY2010 levels. Only the Community Development Fund (CDF) account for HUD was reduced under H.J.Res. 44. Under H.J.Res. 44, the Community Development Fund (CDF) for HUD was funded approximately $195 million lower than FY2010 levels, equivalent to the amount previously allocated for congressional earmarks through Economic Development Initiatives (EDI) and Neighborhood Initiatives (NI). Congress later passed another short-term CR (H.J.Res. 48, P.L. 112-6) to maintain funding at FY2010 levels for most HUD accounts, but continued the reduction in funding. The short-term CR (H.J.Res. 48, P.L. 112-6) continued funding for most HUD accounts at FY2010 levels but reduced funding for the Community Development Fund (CDF). Another short-term CR (P.L. 112-8) extended funding through April 15, 2011, with reductions in public housing operating funds and restrictions on CDF funds for earmarks. The Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act of 2011 (P.L. 112-10) signed into law on April 15, 2011, provided year-long FY2011 appropriations for the Department of Defense and other government agencies, including HUD. It funded some HUD programs at FY2010 levels, reduced funding for certain programs, and increased funding for Section 8 programs. Additionally, an across-the-board 0.2% rescission was applied to non-defense discretionary accounts, including HUD's budget. The Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act of 2011 (P.L. 112-10) provided funding for HUD programs at FY2010 levels, reduced funding for some programs, and increased funding for Section 8 programs. The law included a 0.2% rescission from non-defense discretionary accounts, resulting in a net new budget authority of $41.1 billion for HUD, representing an 11% decrease from FY2010. However, the decrease in budget authority would only lead to a 4% decrease in appropriations for HUD programs due to increased offsetting collections from FHA mortgage insurance programs. The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insures mortgage loans for eligible borrowers, who pay upfront and monthly fees for the insurance. This helps make mortgage credit more widely available and at a lower cost. FHA home loan insurance programs are administered through two program accounts in the HUD budget. The FHA insurance programs are administered through two accounts in the HUD budget: the MMI/CMHI Fund and the GI/SRI Fund. The MMI Fund is the largest and covers single-family home loans, including the HECM program. The Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) program was moved into the MMI Fund by P.L. 110-289, creating two risk categories: MMI Purchase and Refinance, and MMI HECM. The GI/SRI Fund covers riskier home mortgages, multifamily rental housing, and special-purpose loans. These issues pertain to single-family loans insured under the MMI Fund. The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (FCRA) determines the cost of federal loan insurance in a fiscal year for the MMI Fund. Cash inflows come from insurance premiums paid by borrowers, while cash outflows are for payments to lenders for loan defaults. The net value of these cash flows is expressed as a percentage of the loan volume. The subsidy rate is calculated based on the difference between cash inflows from premiums and cash outflows for loan defaults. It is expressed as a percentage of insured loan volume. If cash inflows exceed outflows, the subsidy rate is negative, and if outflows exceed inflows, it is positive. The subsidy rate is applied to expected loan volume to determine the credit subsidy needed for federal credit programs. The subsidy rate is applied to the expected loan volume to calculate the credit subsidy needed for federal credit programs. Agencies must periodically revise initial subsidy estimates based on actual loan experience. The MMI Fund historically had a negative subsidy rate, generating negative credit subsidy to offset funding needs in the HUD budget. The MMI Fund has historically had a negative subsidy rate, meaning it generates money for the government. It has made more money in fees than it has paid out in claims, not requiring an appropriation from Congress to operate. The fund is divided into two risk categories: MMI Purchase and Refinance, and MMI HECM. The MMI Fund is divided into two risk categories: MMI Purchase and Refinance, and MMI HECM. The Purchase and Refinance category is estimated to have a negative subsidy rate of -2.59% for FY2011, generating about $5.8 billion in negative credit subsidy. This increase is partly due to FHA reforms. The estimated increase in negative credit subsidy for FY2011 is partly due to proposed FHA reforms by HUD. The Congressional Budget Office projected that the MMI Purchase and Refinance risk category would generate around $1.9 billion in negative credit subsidy, including $960 million without proposed changes and an additional $902 million with HUD-proposed program reforms. The Congressional Budget Office projected that the MMI Purchase and Refinance risk category would generate around $1.9 billion in negative credit subsidy, including $960 million without proposed changes and an additional $902 million with HUD-proposed program reforms. The differences between the offsetting receipts in the President's FY2011 budget request and CBO's re-estimate are shown in Table 3. Given that the full-year FY2011 appropriations law (P.L. 112-10) was not enacted until April 2011, FHA's estimates of FY2011 negative credit subsidy had been revised upward. In FY2011, FHA's estimates of negative credit subsidy were revised upward due to an increase in the annual premium charged by FHA in April 2011. The President's FY2012 budget request indicated a -3.92% subsidy rate for the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund's Purchase and Refinance risk category for the remainder of FY2011. The President's FY2012 budget request indicated a -3.25% subsidy rate for the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund's Purchase and Refinance risk category in FY2011, leading to an increase in FHA's estimates of offsetting receipts to nearly $10 billion by the time the FY2012 budget was released. CBO also raised its estimate of FHA receipts for FY2011 by over $1 billion during the appropriations process. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 moved the HECM program into the MMI fund, with a positive credit subsidy of 0.83% requiring a $250 million appropriation. HUD attempted changes in FY2010 to avoid the subsidy but was unsuccessful. In FY2011, HUD proposed increasing HECM borrowers' annual insurance premiums from 0.5%. HUD proposed increasing HECM borrowers' annual insurance premiums from 0.5% to 1.25% of the loan balance and adjusting the formula for initial loan size to reduce the need for positive credit subsidies. H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 would have provided less credit subsidies than the Administration's estimate. The final FY2012 appropriations law directed adjustments to the HECM program for zero credit subsidy. FHA-insured mortgages have seen increased demand as private lending standards tighten. FHA insured 18.7% of new single-family mortgages in FY2009, up from about 2% in FY2006. Demand for FHA-insured mortgages has been increasing in recent years, with FHA insuring 18.7% of new single-family mortgages in FY2009, up from about 2% in FY2006. The average credit score on FHA-insured loans has improved to the 690s, indicating better credit quality. However, the default rate on past FHA-insured loans is still rising, putting strain on the MMI Fund. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 mandated that the MMI Fund must maintain a capital reserve ratio of at least 2% within 10 years. By FY2009, the capital reserve ratio had fallen to 0.53%, the first time it dropped below the required threshold. The capital reserve ratio fell to 0.53%, below the required 2%. FHA proposed changes to its mortgage insurance programs, including increasing the annual premium. Congressional action may be needed for some changes. The FHA sets a statutory cap on annual mortgage insurance premiums. P.L. 111-229 increased the maximum annual premium amounts. FHA raised the annual insurance premiums charged starting in October 2010. Beginning on October 4, 2010, FHA raised annual insurance premiums to 0.85% for loan-to-value ratios below 95% and 1.15% for downpayments of 5% or less. The upfront mortgage insurance premium was also increased to 2.25% for loans endorsed on or after April 5, 2010. FHA raised annual insurance premiums and lowered upfront mortgage insurance premiums for loans endorsed after specific dates. They also proposed changes to downpayment and credit score requirements, including a 10% downpayment for borrowers with credit scores between 500 and 579. FHA proposes changes to downpayment and credit score requirements, including a 10% downpayment for borrowers with credit scores between 500 and 579. They also plan to reduce the maximum limit on seller concessions from 6% to 3%. These changes were published in a Federal Register notice for public comments. FHA plans to reduce seller concessions from 6% to 3% and increase oversight of FHA-approved lenders. Congress may need to grant FHA authority for additional enforcement actions. The FHA Reform Act of 2010 (H.R. 5072) aimed to give FHA more authority. The FHA Reform Act of 2010 (H.R. 5072) aimed to grant FHA authority for additional enforcement actions, including requiring lenders to indemnify FHA for claims on non-compliant mortgages and establishing a Deputy Assistant Secretary for Risk Management and Regulatory Affairs. The FHA Reform Act of 2010 aimed to address early defaults and claims by establishing a Deputy Assistant Secretary for Risk Management and Regulatory Affairs within FHA. The bill also granted FHA authority to contract with outside credit risk analysis sources and provided appropriations for staff to review lender performance. HUD provides capital grants through the Section 202 and Section 811 Supportive Housing programs. HUD provides capital grants and rental assistance to nonprofit developers through the Section 202 and Section 811 Supportive Housing programs for elderly residents and residents with disabilities. Supportive services are optional in Section 202 but mandatory in Section 811. Over 106,000 units of Section 202 housing and 30,000 units of Section 811 housing have been funded by HUD capital grants. The President proposed no new funding for Section 202 and Section 811 housing in FY2011 to redesign the programs, resulting in reduced funding for both. Section 202 and related programs would have been funded at $274 million. The President's proposal for FY2011 resulted in reduced funding for Section 202 and Section 811 housing programs. Section 202 and related programs would have been funded at $274 million, compared to $825 million in FY2010. The Section 811 program would have received $90 million, down from $300 million in FY2010. Both the House-passed appropriations bill (H.R. 5850) and the Senate committee-passed bill (S. 3644) did not follow the President's recommendations to redesign the programs or stop producing new units. The bills maintained the same funding level for Section 202 at $825 million, while H.R. 5850 provided $300 million for the Section 811 program. Both H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 proposed funding levels for Section 202 and Section 811 programs. H.R. 5850 allocated $300 million for Section 811, while S. 3644 allocated $200 million. The difference in funding was due to the treatment of Section 811 vouchers, with both bills moving funding for voucher renewals to the Section 8 account. In FY2010, $87 million was allocated for voucher renewals, but nearly $114 million would be used in FY2011. In FY2010, $87 million of the Section 811 appropriation was allocated for voucher renewals, with nearly $114 million planned for FY2011. The Senate Appropriations Committee report noted a $100 million reduction in Section 811 funding due to moving voucher renewals to the Section 8 account. Congress ultimately allocated $400 million for Section 202 and related programs and $150 million for the Section 811 program. Funding for Section 811 vouchers was split between the Section 811 and Section 8 tenant-based accounts. In FY2010, $87 million was allocated for Section 811 voucher renewals, with a planned increase to nearly $114 million for FY2011. The funding for Section 811 vouchers was split between the Section 811 and Section 8 tenant-based accounts. In FY2011, $67 million was available for Section 811 voucher renewals, which was $20 million less than the previous year. Additionally, $89 million was provided for Service Coordinators and $39 million for the Assisted Living Conversion program within the Section 202 funds. Approximately $89 million was allocated for Service Coordinators and $39 million for the Assisted Living Conversion program within the Section 202 funds. The Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program, funded through tenant-based rental assistance, is the largest program administered by HUD and the largest account in HUD's budget, providing funding for almost 2.3 million vouchers used by families for housing subsidies. Additionally, the account covers administrative costs for Public Housing Authorities. The Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program is the largest program administered by HUD, providing funding for almost 2.3 million vouchers used by families for housing subsidies. The program also covers administrative costs for Public Housing Authorities. Funding for voucher renewals and allocation to PHAs have been debated since FY2004. The HUD appropriations process each year involves debates on voucher renewals and funding allocation to over 2,000 PHAs. Questions revolve around the sufficiency of funding to cover all leased vouchers and whether it will be allocated efficiently to serve as many families as possible while controlling costs. Congress allocated over $16 billion for voucher renewals in FY2010, based on PHAs' voucher costs and utilization from the prior year. In FY2010, Congress provided over $16 billion for voucher renewals to PHAs based on their prior year costs and utilization. However, PHAs did not fully utilize their vouchers in FY2009, leading to insufficient funding in FY2010 to cover all vouchers. In FY2010, PHAs had 94% of their vouchers under lease, leading to insufficient funding in FY2010 to cover all vouchers. The President's FY2011 budget requested $17 billion for voucher renewals, aiming to fund about 95% of all vouchers in use. The President's budget requested sufficient funding for about 95% of all vouchers in use. The funding allocation formula would prioritize PHAs with lower reserves to increase utilization and serve more families. The President's budget requested funding to increase utilization of vouchers and serve more families by lifting the ban on \"over-leasing.\" The budget was not enough to fund all 2.3 million vouchers authorized by Congress. The House bill included about $150 million less for renewals than the amount requested in the President's budget. Recent inflation estimates have been lower than anticipated, reducing the need for renewal funding. The committee report indicated that the funding in H.R. 5850 would be enough to meet the program's renewal needs and reiterated support for funding all vouchers in use. The committee supported funding all vouchers in use but did not include the reallocation authority requested by the President in H.R. 5850. The bill aimed to make major authorization changes outside the Appropriations Committee's jurisdiction and would base PHA funding on prior calendar year spending. The bill proposed changes to PHA funding by basing it on prior calendar year spending instead of fiscal year spending, to better reflect program needs. It would fund renewals below the President's request and allocate funding using the same formula as H.R. 5850. The Senate bill did not include the reallocation authority requested by the President. The Senate bill, like the House bill, adjusted the formula to use calendar year spending for PHA funding. However, it did not include the reallocation authority requested by the President. Concerns were raised about potential cost increases and financial management of the program, leading HUD to report back on monitoring plans. No changes were made to the funding allocation formula from FY2010 in H.R. 1 or the final FY2011 appropriations law. Neither H.R. 1 nor the final FY2011 appropriations law made changes to the funding allocation formula from FY2010. Both included less for renewals than requested by the President, but more than was provided in FY2010. The President's budget requested Congress to begin funding the renewal of mainstream vouchers for persons with disabilities in the Section 8 account, rather than through the Housing for Persons with Disabilities account. HUD requested $114 million for this purpose in FY2011, with both the House and Senate bills proposing to adopt the President's request. HUD requested $114 million for the Housing for Persons with Disabilities account in FY2011. The final FY2011 appropriations law (P.L. 112-10) allocated less than requested for Section 811 renewals, directing funds to renew vouchers issued since 2007. Each Public Housing Authority (PHA) has a contract with HUD specifying the number of vouchers it can administer. In FY2010, Congress allocated $15 million for vouchers for families in the child welfare system and $75 million for other special populations or purposes. In FY2010, Congress allocated $15 million for vouchers for families in the child welfare system and $75 million for homeless veterans. For FY2011, the President's budget requested $85 million for new vouchers for supportive housing for families and individuals at risk of homelessness. The House bill from the 111th Congress included funding for the President's homelessness demonstration request, $75 million for vouchers for homeless veterans through the VASH program, and $66 million for vouchers for certain displaced families. The Senate bill from the 111th Congress allocated $75 million for vouchers for homeless veterans through the VASH program, $66 million for families displaced by hurricanes, and $16 million for the Family Unification Program (FUP) providing vouchers to families in the child welfare system. H.R. 1 did not include funding for new incremental vouchers, but the final FY2011 appropriations law (P.L. 112-10) provided for these programs. The final FY2011 appropriations law (P.L. 112-10) provided about $50 million for VASH vouchers for homeless veterans. The project-based rental assistance account funds existing project-based Section 8 rental assistance contracts between HUD and property owners, subsidizing low-income families' rent payments. No new contracts have been made under this program since the early 1980s. Families pay subsidized rent based on their incomes. Contracts for subsidized units have not been renewed since the 1980s, requiring new annual appropriations as contracts expire. Some contracts lack funding to complete their terms, necessitating additional funding (amendment funding). In FY2011, the President requested over $9 billion for project-based rental assistance, with $662 million needed for contract amendments. HUD aims to provide full-year funding for all contracts and renew expiring ones. The President requested over $9 billion for project-based rental assistance in FY2011, with $662 million needed for contract amendments. Both the House and Senate bills proposed to adopt the President's funding level, with H.R. 1 providing $100 million less than the request. The final FY2011 appropriations law (P.L. 112-10) allocated just under the requested amount. President Obama's FY2011 budget requested $350 million for a new \"Transforming Rental Assistance\" initiative to streamline HUD's rental assistance programs and increase residential mobility options for HUD-assisted tenants. The final FY2011 appropriations law provided just under $120 million less than the President's request. The funding requested by President Obama's FY2011 budget aimed to transfer HUD-assisted housing units to a new form of project-based rental assistance with tenant mobility. This new assistance is modeled after the Section 8 project-based voucher program. Three categories of properties are targeted for this initiative. The President's budget aims to transfer 300,000 housing units to a new form of project-based rental assistance with tenant mobility. Three categories of properties are targeted for transfer: public housing properties owned by local PHAs without a Section 8 voucher program (150,000 units), public and multifamily housing properties owned by PHAs willing to combine administrative activities with neighboring PHAs (130,000 units), and multifamily properties with old forms of rental assistance (20,000 units). The President's budget aims to transfer 300,000 housing units to a new form of project-based rental assistance with tenant mobility. Properties in three categories are targeted for transfer: public housing properties owned by local PHAs without a Section 8 voucher program (150,000 units), public and multifamily housing properties owned by PHAs willing to combine administrative activities with neighboring PHAs (130,000 units), and multifamily properties with old forms of rental assistance (20,000 units). Most of the funding requested would be used to make up the difference between the cost of current subsidy streams and the new subsidy level under the new program. The President's budget aims to transfer 300,000 housing units to a new form of project-based rental assistance with tenant mobility. Funding would be used to offset costs of combining PHA activities, fund landlord outreach, and provide technical assistance and program evaluation. Legislation called the Preservation, Enhancement, and Transformation of Rental Assistance Act has been proposed by HUD. Neither H.R. 5850 nor S. 3644 included funding for the President's initiative. The Transforming Rental Assistance initiative proposed by HUD was not funded in H.R. 1 or the final FY2011 appropriations law. The public housing program, established in 1937, offers subsidized rental units for low-income families. The public housing program, established in 1937, provides publicly owned and subsidized rental units for very low-income families. Congress continues to fund over 3,100 Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) that maintain 1.2 million units. HUD provides operating and capital funds to PHAs for maintenance and modernization projects. The Public Housing program provides rental units for low-income families. HUD funds PHAs for maintenance and modernization. HOPE VI grants help redevelop distressed housing. President's FY2011 budget requested changes in funding for operating and capital funds. The Congressional Budget Justifications state that the requested amount for the operating fund would be enough to cover PHAs' full eligibility. The decrease in capital fund request considers previous funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Fully funding the operating fund would allow more capital funds to be used for capital needs. Both H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 proposed funding for the operating fund. The Administration argues that fully funding the operating fund would free up more capital funds for capital needs. H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 proposed funding the operating fund at the President's request, with an additional $500 million for the capital fund. The Senate bill included a $50 million set-aside from the capital fund for grants to PHAs for early childhood education facilities in public housing. The proposed legislation aimed to cut funding for public housing capital and operating funds, with a requirement to allocate $10 million for safety measures. The final funding law funded the capital fund higher than initially proposed but lower than the previous year, while the operating fund received about $10 million less than the initial proposal. The reduced operating fund appropriations could be offset by PHAs' program reserves, with a potential mandatory offset proposed in the President's FY2012 budget request. The President's FY2012 budget proposed a mandatory offset of PHA reserves to fund public housing programs. The budget requested $250 million for the Choice Neighborhoods Initiative, a new proposal modeled after the HOPE VI program to revitalize distressed neighborhoods. The Choice Neighborhood Initiative aims to revitalize distressed neighborhoods by offering grants to various entities, not limited to public housing. Funding is focused on transforming, rehabilitating, and replacing HUD public and assisted housing. In FY2010, $200 million was allocated to the HOPE VI account, with $65 million set aside for a Choice Neighborhoods demonstration. In FY2010, Congress allocated $200 million to the HOPE VI account, with $65 million reserved for a Choice Neighborhoods demonstration. In FY2011, the House and Senate had differing positions on funding. H.R. 5850 proposed $200 million for HOPE VI but no funding for Choice Neighborhoods, while S. 3644 proposed no funding for HOPE VI but $250 million for Choice Neighborhoods. HUD drafted legislation for the Choice Neighborhoods Initiative, and the House Financial Services Committee held a hearing on the topic in March 2010. The House Financial Services Committee held a hearing in March 2010 on the topic. In July 2010, the committee ordered reported the Public Housing Reinvestment and Tenant Protection Act of 2010 (H.R. 5814), which included authorization of the Choice Neighborhoods Initiative. H.R. 1 proposed no funding for either HOPE VI or Choice Neighborhoods. The final FY2011 funding law provided just under $100 million for HOPE VI, with the majority of funding potentially used for Choice Neighborhoods. Congress authorized the creation of a national initiative. The Housing Trust Fund, created in the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008, aims to provide a dedicated funding source for affordable housing activities, focusing on rental housing for extremely low-income families. Contributions from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are identified as the funding source for the initiative. The Housing Trust Fund, established in 2008, aims to provide rental housing for extremely low-income families. Funding from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac was suspended in 2008, leaving the Trust Fund without a source of funding. Other funding sources have not yet been allocated. No funding has been directed to the Housing Trust Fund despite the authorization in P.L. 110-289. The President's FY2011 budget requested $1 billion in mandatory funding for the Trust Fund, to be offset elsewhere in the budget. The FY2010 budget also included $1 billion for the Trust Fund, but no funding was provided by Congress. Neither H.R. 5850 nor S. 3644 included funding for the Trust Fund. Congress did not provide funding for the Housing Trust Fund in FY2010 or FY2011 appropriations laws. Despite various legislative proposals in the 111th Congress, no funding was allocated. The Transformation Initiative, proposed in President Obama's FY2010 budget, aims to strengthen HUD's research and initiatives. The Transformation Initiative, proposed in President Obama's FY2010 budget, aims to strengthen HUD's research and technological capacities. The fund can be used for research, program demonstrations, technical assistance, and information technology. Congress provided the requested $20 million appropriation for the initiative in FY2010. In FY2010, Congress provided $20 million for combating mortgage fraud and authorized a 1% transfer authority for HUD's budget. The fund could have received up to $435 million, but due to restrictions, it only received $239 million. In FY2011, the President requested another $20 million for mortgage fraud and a 1% transfer authority, which could have resulted in almost $470 million for the transformation fund. Both H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 included $20 million for combating mortgage fraud and limited transfer authority. The House and Senate bills proposed restrictions on fund allocation by the department. The House and Senate bills from the 111th Congress proposed limits on the department's discretion regarding fund allocation for eligible activities. The Transformation Initiative funds were restricted to the core needs of the Department, with emphasis on oversight of funding by the Senate Committee. The Senate Committee supports investments in IT funding but emphasizes the need for oversight. They have limited flexibility in using funds requested by HUD and recommended minimum funding levels for IT modernization and technical assistance. H.R. 1 did not include authority for transfers under the Transformation Initiative. The bill allocated $71 million for modernizing FHA's systems and updating computer programs for the Section 8 voucher program, instead of the $20 million requested for combating mortgage fraud. The final FY2011 appropriations law (P.L. 112-10) allocated $71 million for modernizing FHA's systems and updating computer programs for the Section 8 voucher program. The law permits HUD the requested transfer authority under the transformation initiative, but from a more limited number of accounts than requested by the President. The Administration's budget for FY2011 included community development initiatives to transform the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) and related programs. The FY2011 budget included community development initiatives to transform the CDBG program. The budget proposed funding CDBG at FY2010 levels, while eliminating funding for the Rural Innovation Fund, Neighborhood Initiative, and Economic Development Initiative. It also requested funding for new initiatives like Catalytic Competition Grants and the Capacity Building Clearinghouse. The Administration's FY2011 budget proposed reducing funding for Community Development Fund activities, including defunding Neighborhood Initiative and Economic Development Initiative grants, to $4.380 billion from $4.450 billion in FY2010. The Administration's FY2011 budget proposed a $70 million reduction in Community Development Fund activities by defunding Neighborhood Initiative and Economic Development Initiative grants used for congressional earmarks. Savings would fund Sustainable Communities Initiative, University Community Fund, and a new Catalytic Investments Competition Grants initiative for economic development in distressed communities. No new funding was requested for the Brownfields Economic Development Initiative Account. The President's budget did not request new funding for the Brownfields Economic Development Initiative Account, arguing it duplicates other federal programs. The House bill recommended a $4.382 billion appropriation for Community Development Fund activities, including $89.3 million for congressional earmarked funds for Economic Development Initiative and Neighborhood Initiative projects. The Senate Appropriations Committee bill recommended a $4.450 billion appropriation for Community Development Fund activities, including funding for Economic Development Initiative and Neighborhood Initiative projects. Specifically, the Senate bill recommended $193 million for these projects. Both the House and Senate bills also recommended continued funding for the Sustainable Communities Initiative and University Community Fund at their FY2010 levels. The final FY2011 appropriations law, P.L. 112-10, allocated $3.501 billion for the Community Development Fund, a 21.2% decrease from FY2010. Funding for CDBG formula grants was reduced by 16.4%, and the Sustainable Communities Initiative saw a cut as well. The FY2011 appropriations law, P.L. 112-10, reduced funding for CDBG formula grants by 16.4% and for the Sustainable Communities Initiative by 33%. The Brownfield Economic Development Initiative program was not funded. The Community Development Fund supports various community development programs, including CDBG, EDI, and NI. The CDBG program, authorized under the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, is a major source of federal financial assistance for neighborhood revitalization, housing rehabilitation, and economic development. In 2010, CDBG formula funds were awarded to various communities and states for eligible activities. The CDBG program provides financial assistance for neighborhood revitalization, housing rehabilitation, and economic development in Puerto Rico and other insular areas. Funding for FY2011 was proposed to be frozen at over $3.9 billion, with additional funds allocated for Sustainable Communities Initiatives and Catalytic Competition Grants. The budget request included funding for Sustainable Communities Initiatives, Catalytic Competition Grants, and Indian tribes. Both H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 proposed higher funding for the CDBG program compared to FY2010 levels. The House passed H.R. 1, the Full Year Continuing Appropriations Act for FY2011 on February 19, 2011. The House passed H.R. 1, reducing CDF account by 66.3% below FY2010 funding level of $4.450 billion. Funds were prohibited for earmarks and SCI. Allocation instructions for CDBG program components were not included. The CDBG program allocated funds to entitlement communities, states, insular areas, and Indian tribes. The House-passed H.R. 1 reduced funding by 66.3% below FY2010 levels. Allocation instructions for CDBG components were not included in the bill. The FY2011 appropriations law allocated $3.508 billion for activities in the CDF account, with $3.343 billion for CDBG formula funds. A 0.2% mandatory cut reduced the CDF account by $7 million, and a 1% discretionary transfer moved $35 million to HUD's Transformation Initiative. The FY2011 appropriations law allocated $3.508 billion for CDF activities, with $3.343 billion for CDBG formula funds. A 0.2% cut reduced the CDF account by $7 million, and a 1% transfer moved $35 million to HUD's Transformation Initiative. The Administration requested $148.5 million for a new initiative supporting economic development projects in distressed areas through the proposed Catalytic Competition Grants Program (CCGs). Unlike CDBG funds, CCG program funds would be awarded competitively to local governments, nonprofit entities, or consortia. The CCG program funds, unlike CDBG funds, would have been awarded competitively to local governments, nonprofit entities, or consortia for reclaiming vacant property, supporting economic activities, and covering administrative costs. The Administration requested $148.5 million for its Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI) to support transit-oriented development, assist businesses in targeted neighborhoods, and cover administrative costs. Neither H.R. 1 nor the final FY2011 appropriations law appropriated funds for this proposal. In FY2010, Congress approved $148.5 million for the Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI) to fund four components, including Regional Integrated Planning Grants. In FY2011, $100 million was requested for competitive awards to regional organizations in metropolitan areas to develop effective models integrating planning requirements. Collaboration with Department of Transportation, EPA, and other federal agencies is involved in this component. HUD plans to award an average grant amount of $3 million to 25 of the nation's 100 regions. HUD plans to award grants to metropolitan areas for improvements in housing, transportation, energy, and land use planning activities. Community Challenge Grants are also provided to promote sustainable growth through reforming building codes and zoning ordinances. Community Challenge Grants (CCGs) are competitively awarded to communities to reform building codes and zoning ordinances for sustainable growth. HUD proposed a $2 million limit for grant awards. In FY2010, Congress allocated $40 million for CCG activities. Additionally, there is a joint HUD-Department of Transportation research initiative in FY2011 to assess the benefits and tradeoffs of various efforts. The administration requested funding for a joint HUD-Department of Transportation research initiative to evaluate benefits and tradeoffs of different efforts, with $2 million allocated for specific grants evaluation. Congress allocated $10 million for research in FY2010. Additionally, a capacity building program was proposed to enhance technical capacity of regional organizations and local jurisdictions. The proposal sought funding to improve technical capacity of various organizations and lenders through the Office of Sustainable Housing and Communities within HUD. Both H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 aimed to continue funding the Administration's Sustainable Communities Initiative at $148.5 million, with a requirement to allocate $25 million to metropolitan areas for Regional Integrated Planning Grants. The bills recommended allocating $25 million for the Regional Integrated Planning Grant component of the Sustainable Communities Initiative to metropolitan areas with populations under 500,000. They also proposed $25 million for the Rural Innovation Fund to assist various organizations in addressing housing and poverty-related issues, with $5 million set aside for rural Indian tribes. The bills proposed allocating $5 million in RIF appropriations for rural Indian tribes for revolving loan funds and technical assistance. They also supported HUD's Transformation Initiative, allowing the Secretary to transfer up to 1% of CDF appropriations. H.R. 1 prohibited the use of Community Development Fund dollars for SCI activities, but P.L. 112-10 allocated $99.8 million for SCI activities, including Regional Integration Planning Grants and Community Challenge Grants, representing a 33% reduction from FY2011 funding levels. The FY2011 funding level for SCI activities is $99.8 million, with $69.9 million for Regional Integration Planning Grants and $29.9 million for Community Challenge Grants. The Section 108 loan guarantee program allows states and entitlement communities to use their CDBG allocations as collateral for redevelopment activities, with the ability to borrow up to five times their annual CDBG allocations for qualifying activities. The Administration's budget proposed doubling the Section 108 loan guarantee program's loan commitment ceiling from $250 million in FY2010 to $500 million in FY2011 to help local governments finance large-scale projects. The proposed revamp includes charging a fee-based assessment to borrowers accessing the program. The Administration proposed increasing the loan commitment ceiling for the Section 108 loan guarantee program and implementing a fee-based assessment for borrowers. Congress rejected this proposal and recommended maintaining the program as currently structured. H.R. 5850 suggested a loan commitment ceiling of $427 million with a credit subsidy of $10 million, while S. 3644 recommended a ceiling of $275 million with a subsidy of $6.4 million. The loan commitment ceiling for the Capacity Building for Community Development and Affordable Housing Program was set at $275 million with a credit subsidy of $5.988 million in FY2011. The program was proposed to be redesigned to provide technical assistance and funds to local organizations through national intermediaries. The capacity building program aimed to provide technical assistance and funds to local housing and community development organizations through national intermediaries. It could fund training, education activities, and financial assistance to enhance the capabilities of community development corporations and housing organizations. The Administration's budget request aimed to increase funding for capacity building by $10 million, establishing it as a stand-alone account. Grant funds would be competitively awarded to national and regional intermediaries with expertise in housing and community development. The Administration's budget request aimed to increase funding for capacity building by $10 million, establishing it as a stand-alone account.

The Administration's budget request proposed increasing funding for capacity building by $10 million to support training and education activities for CDCs, CHDOs, and local governments serving low- and moderate-income individuals. Successful grantees would need to secure a 3:1 match from private sector sources. However, the House-passed and Senate Committee-passed bills did not allocate funding for this initiative. The Committee-passed bills did not include funding for a new initiative. H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 recommended continuing funding for capacity building activities by organizations like Local Initiative Support Corporation, Enterprise Community Partners, and Habitat for Humanity through the Self-Help and Assisted Homeownership Opportunity Program account. SHOP, funded through this account, provides grants for homeownership programs. The Self-Help Homeownership Opportunity Program (SHOP) funded by the Assisted Homeownership Opportunity Program account provides grants for national and regional organizations to facilitate self-help homeownership opportunities. This account also funds the Capacity Building for Community Development and Affordable Housing Program and the Housing Assistance Council. The Housing Program and Housing Assistance Council provide technical assistance and funds to local housing organizations. HAC supports rural housing needs by offering loans, research, and technical assistance. The President's FY2011 budget did not include funding for the SHOP account, noting that activities traditionally funded through SHOP are eligible for HOME Investment Partnerships Program funds. The President's FY2011 budget did not include funding for the SHOP account, as activities traditionally funded through SHOP are eligible for HOME Investment Partnerships Program funds. However, both H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 included a total of $82 million for the SHOP account, with $27 million designated for SHOP itself. In FY2011, $82 million was allocated for the SHOP account, with $27 million for SHOP, $50 million for capacity building, and $5 million for HAC. Funding levels remained the same as FY2010, with a total of $81.8 million allocated for these activities in FY2011. Total FY2011 funding for account activities was $81.8 million, including $26.9 million for SHOP, $49.9 million for Section 4 Capacity Building for Community Development and Affordable Housing, and $4.9 million for the Housing Assistance Council. HUD anticipated transferring $818,360 to the department's Transformation Initiative account. Through its Housing Counseling Assistance Program, HUD provides competitive grants to HUD-approved housing counseling agencies.

These agencies offer various counseling services such as pre-purchase homeownership counseling, post-purchase homeownership counseling, mortgage delinquency counseling, and counseling for renters, the homeless, or seniors seeking reverse mortgages. Congress has increased funding for this program in response to the rise in mortgage default and foreclosure rates since around 2006.

In response to the rise in mortgage default and foreclosure rates, funding for HUD's Housing Counseling Assistance Program has increased. The final FY2011 appropriations law eliminated funding for the program, resulting in a significant decrease from previous years. The FY2011 appropriations law resulted in a significant decrease in funding for HUD's housing counseling program, with critics arguing it overlaps with the NFMCP. HUD has faced criticism for slow distribution of grants. Congress has also allocated separate funding for foreclosure mitigation counseling since FY2008. Congress has allocated separate funding for foreclosure mitigation counseling since FY2008, with the National Foreclosure Mitigation Counseling Program (NFMCP) managed by NeighborWorks America receiving this funding instead of HUD.

In FY2008, it received $120 million in regular appropriation and an additional $180 million for mortgage foreclosure counseling. Congress also allocated $180 million to the NFMCP in the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008. Congress appropriated an additional $180 million to the NFMCP in the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008. The President's budget requested $113 million for the NFMCP in FY2011, with H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 including $113 million and $125 million respectively for the NFMCP. S. 3644 included $125 million for the NFMCP, $12 million more than the President's request and the House-passed bill. The final FY2011 appropriations law (P.L. 112-10) maintained funding for the NFMCP at the FY2010 level of $65 million. Many housing counseling agencies support the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) by providing counseling to eligible troubled borrowers. Recipients of funding through the NFMCP can use up to 30% of their grants to counsel borrowers with high debt-to-income ratios. All borrowers eligible for HAMP are encouraged to contact housing counselors for assistance. Native American Housing Block Grants (NAHBGs) are formula-based grants for Indian tribes to provide housing assistance primarily to low-income American Indian and Alaskan Native households. Many housing counseling agencies that receive funding through the NFMCP and HUD's housing counseling program provide counseling to borrowers eligible for HAMP. Contact housing counselors for assistance if you think you may be eligible for HAMP. Housing Block Grants (NAHBGs) are formula-based grants for Indian tribes to provide housing assistance to low-income American Indian and Alaskan Native households.

The final FY2011 appropriations law (P.L. 112-10) allocated nearly $650 million to the NAHBG account, which was over $50 million less than the FY2010 enacted level but almost $70 million higher than the President's FY2011 budget request. The set-asides within this account were maintained at FY2010 levels, with a 0.2% across-the-board rescission. The FY2011 Budget Resolution sets spending and revenue parameters for Congress, providing allocations to House and Senate committees for appropriations bills. Each subcommittee is responsible for one of the 12 regular appropriations bills.
