    "content": "For the first 100 years of the electric power industry, electricity generation was centralized in large power plants. In response to the 1970s energy crisis, Congress promoted distributed generation, including customer-sited generation. One policy to encourage this is net metering, defined in the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 encouraged states to adopt net metering, allowing electric consumers to offset energy provided by the utility with energy generated on-site. State net metering policies are relevant to discussions on renewable energy sources like solar, which make up 97% of net metering participation. Solar photovoltaic (PV) is the most commonly deployed energy type in the nation's electricity system, comprising 97% of net metering capacity in 2018. Federal and state policies, such as tax incentives and renewable portfolio standards, may interact with net metering policies to determine the pace of distributed solar energy deployment. Some states have modified their net metering policies in recent years, with expected effects on stakeholders and solar energy development. Net metering policies impact how electricity customers with distributed generation are compensated for the electricity they provide to the grid. Recent state policy changes may either promote or hinder solar energy development. Congress has the option to intervene in state net metering policies based on its priorities. This report offers background information and discusses current issues related to net metering policy. Net metering is a policy where electricity customers with distributed generation are compensated for the electricity they deliver to the grid on a one-to-one basis. This is often referred to as \"the meter running backward.\" Other policy options include buy-all, sell-all, where a utility buys all electricity generated. Net metering is a policy where electricity customers with distributed generation are compensated for the electricity they deliver to the grid. Policy options include buy-all, sell-all, and net billing. The term net metering is used to refer to these policies as they provide financial support for distributed generation. As of April 2019, 45 states had net metering policies in place that require utilities to offer net metering to customers, with some policies including alternatives to net energy metering. In states without mandatory net metering, some utilities voluntarily offer the service. Nearly 2 million customers participated in net metering programs in the United States in 2018. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), around 1% of U.S. electricity customers participated in net metering in 2018, with almost 2 million customers involved. The number of net metering customers increased from 2013 to 2018. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), around 1% of U.S. electricity customers participated in net metering in 2018, with almost 2 million customers involved. Net metering participation levels vary by state, with Hawaii having the highest participation rate at over 15% of customers. The U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that around 1% of U.S. electricity customers participated in net metering in 2018, with Hawaii having the highest participation rate at over 15%. Factors influencing participation rates include state policies, electricity prices, and solar resource quality. The process of setting electricity rates is crucial for state net metering policies. Electricity ratemaking is the process of allocating costs to customers incurred by utilities in producing and delivering electricity. This section discusses typical ratemaking considerations for vertically-integrated investor-owned utilities, where the utility owns and operates all parts of the electricity system. State regulators conduct the ratemaking process and approve rates that the utility can charge its customers. State regulators oversee the electricity ratemaking process for utilities, ensuring rates cover costs from electricity generation to distribution. This includes building and operating power plants, maintaining the grid, and covering regular utility expenses. Electricity rates cover costs from generation to distribution, including grid maintenance, bill relief programs, and return on investments. Rates are typically set as volumetric rates, where customers within a class pay the same rate per kilowatt-hour, resulting in varying bills based on electricity consumption. The electricity rate, in cents per kilowatt-hour, varies based on consumption. Regulators estimate the rate to cover total costs shared among all customers. Customer service costs may be separate and recovered in a fixed customer charge on the bill. Customer charges, separate from electricity rates, appear as fixed values on bills and do not change monthly. They are additional to volumetric charges based on kWh consumed. Some customer classes, like large industrial facilities, may have special system modifications with costs recovered in demand charges paid only by high-consuming customers. EPACT05 encouraged states to adopt net metering, but did not specify customer compensation methods. States have varied approaches, impacting Distributed Generation (DG) markets. Compensation mechanisms strongly influence the value proposition of DG deployment. Compensation mechanisms impact DG deployment in states' approaches to implementing net metering. States commonly compensate net metering customers at the utility's approved retail rate of electricity, known as net energy metering (NEM) policy. Initially, policymakers viewed the retail rate as a proxy for rate setting. The 2019 review of state net metering policy revisions highlighted how policymakers initially saw the retail rate as a suitable proxy for rate setting when implementing net metering policies. Initially, net metering was considered a simple approach for solar PV and other distributed generation (DG) when markets were not economically viable. Policymakers assumed the retail rate was a close approximation of the value of solar or DG, especially when the number of participating customers and credited kilowatt hours at retail price were limited. Retail rates provide high compensation for net metering generation due to reflecting the total costs incurred by the utility for delivering electricity. This encourages net metering participation more than other compensation methods, as the small number of participating customers and credited kilowatt hours at retail price result in minimal errors in estimating the true value. Retail rates may encourage net metering participation more than other compensation approaches as customers can recover upfront costs of a DG system quickly. Compensating net metering customers at the retail rate may lead to increased costs for non-net metering customers due to a cost shift or cross-subsidy in the ratemaking process. The process allocates utility costs among customers. Net metering reduces utility-provided electricity needed but not other services. Rates for non-net metering customers may increase to recover costs. Some stakeholders have raised concerns about potential equity issues with residential net metering customers having higher incomes than non-net metering customers. Studies vary on whether non-net metering customers are cross-subsidizing net metering customers, with different methodologies used to estimate cross-subsidies. Costs of maintaining the grid not recovered from net metering customers could lead to rate increases for non-net metering customers. Studies have used different methodologies to estimate cross-subsidies for net metering customers, with varying results. Local factors like DG penetration and electricity demand growth can impact observed cross-subsidies. Estimates conducted around 2015 found net metering cost shifts ranging from $444 to $1,752 per customer, but these figures may not be applicable to all states or future years. One synthesis of estimates in 2015 found that net metering cost shifts range from $444 to $1,752 per customer per year. Net metering is just one factor affecting electricity rates, along with other factors like energy efficiency and utility expenditures. The study on distributed generation (DG) impact on electricity rates found that rate effects would likely increase between 0.03 cents/kWh and 0.2 cents/kWh, compared to other factors causing increases up to 3.6 cents/kWh. The presence of a cost shift does not necessarily mean non-net metering customers are transferring money to net metering customers. Addressing cost shifts through normal ratemaking processes may be delayed due to inherent time lags. Some states are looking to move towards more precise allocations of system costs and benefits to net metering customers, addressing concerns about potential cross-subsidies from retail rate compensation. Cost shifts are not unique to distributed generation (DG) and are unavoidable in rate design, but regulators aim to mitigate these effects within conflicting rate design principles. States are considering options like adding fixed charges or changing compensation rates for net metering customers to address concerns about cross-subsidies. This allows utilities to recover grid maintenance costs while maintaining some benefits for customers. Customers' bills are adjusted to recover grid maintenance costs, with some advocating for compensating net metering customers at retail rates for simplicity. Proponents include utilities and advocates for low-income customers, arguing that fixed charges increase fairness. Opponents, such as the solar industry and environmental advocates, believe net metering promotes competition and oppose fixed charges. The solar industry and environmental advocates argue that net metering promotes competition in the electricity industry and that fixed charges discourage distributed generation (DG) benefits. Determining accurate fixed charges reflecting net metering customers' grid use has been complex. Some states use alternative compensation rates to represent energy costs utilities avoid with net metering customers supplying their own energy. An alternative compensation rate, known as an avoided cost rate, represents the energy costs utilities save when net metering customers generate their own energy. This rate primarily reflects the costs of producing energy and may include network upgrades for reliable integration of distributed generation, such as solar PV. The avoided cost rate is determined by regulators in some states. The avoided cost rate, determined by regulators, represents energy savings for utilities from net metering customers generating their own energy, including potential network upgrades. This rate is usually lower than retail rates and an alternative compensation method for solar PV customers is the value of solar (VOS) rate, reflecting societal benefits. The value of solar (VOS) rate, reflecting societal benefits, is often calculated to be larger than avoided cost rates but smaller than retail rates. Solar advocates generally support including societal benefits in net metering policy and rate design, with some states considering reduced greenhouse gas emissions a benefit of distributed solar PV. States could potentially determine a VOS rate greater than the retail rate based on the perceived benefits of solar included in the analysis. New York is one state that applies a related compensation rate to any distributed energy resource (DER), reflecting estimated grid and societal benefits. Regardless of the rate set, it could be applied in different net metering arrangements. Points of debate include which costs and benefits to consider in alternative compensation approaches. Points of debate around alternative compensation approaches for distributed generation (DG) include which costs and benefits to consider, and how to quantify them. Challenges arise from the time- and location-specific nature of DG costs and benefits, as well as the potential changes in costs and benefits with varying levels of DG penetration. States have varying approaches to evaluating net metering, as shown in a 2018 analysis by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) reviewing 15 state studies on net metering costs and benefits. The analysis of state studies on net metering costs and benefits highlighted the impact of different assumptions and value categories on study results. State net metering policies vary in compensation, program caps, source eligibility, credit retention, and system ownership, all of which can influence distributed generation deployment. Program caps, also known as aggregate capacity limits, set restrictions on the number of customers or generation capacity that can participate in distributed generation (DG) programs. These caps can be expressed in units of power (e.g., megawatts), a percentage of electricity demand, or other measures determined by the state. The decision to implement program caps and how they are defined can impact the promotion of DG under a state's net metering policy by managing risks to the electricity system and preventing cross-subsidies. Program caps are established to reduce risks to the electricity system from distributed generation (DG) and prevent cross-subsidies. They can also minimize sales losses for utilities but may hinder achieving renewable energy goals. States specify which generation sources can participate in net metering based on capacity limits and technology type, with solar energy being the dominant source. Net metering capacity is primarily dominated by solar energy, but other energy types can participate based on cost factors, customer type, and location. Factors like customer type and location influence participation, with projects like combined heat and power facilities appealing to large commercial and industrial customers, and distributed wind projects being attractive to farms or customers with large acreage. Net metering customers, especially farms or those with large acreage, can deliver surplus generation to the grid. State net metering policies vary in compensating customers for the electricity they generate, with some only compensating for surplus generation. Customers with a surplus receive a credit on their next bill if it exceeds their consumption over a billing period. Aggregate net metering allows single customers with multiple electricity meters on their property, such as farms, municipalities, or schools, to deliver surplus generation to the grid. Credit retention policies vary by state and determine how long credits can carry over, potentially reducing total electricity costs to $0 for customers. Aggregate net metering allows single customers with multiple electricity meters on their property, such as farms, municipalities, or schools, to deliver surplus generation to the grid. Shared net metering applies to multiple customers associated with the same net metering generation capacity, like participants in community solar projects. Virtual net metering is a version of shared net metering for onsite shared projects, such as multi-family dwellings. Third party participation, like solar leasing and power purchase agreements, allows for solar system ownership by a third party. Some Members of Congress have introduced legislation addressing states' net metering policies, including third party participation arrangements like solar leasing and power purchase agreements. Proposed legislation in the 114th Congress aimed to limit state regulators' ability to change compensation rates for net metering customers. Some legislation in Congress aims to address net metering policies, including considering cross-subsidies and adopting net billing policies for community solar. Studies have been requested to understand the costs and benefits of net metering, with a DOE report transmitted to Congress in 2019. In the 116th Congress, S. 346 and H.R. 1009 propose a study by the National Academies on net metering, including alternative incentives for distributed solar generation and consumer incentives."
