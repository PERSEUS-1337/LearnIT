    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Great Lakes Nutrient Removal Assistance Act\". Congress recognizes that ineffective wastewater treatment is a common source of water pollution, with nutrient pollution, especially phosphorus loading, being a significant issue in the Great Lakes System. It is crucial to limit phosphorus loads to control algal growth, and implementing nutrient removal technology is a reliable and cost-effective method to reduce harmful nutrients from point sources. Implementing nutrient removal technology is a reliable and cost-effective method for reducing the flow of phosphorus and other harmful nutrients from point sources in the Great Lakes System. The Nutrient Removal Technology Grant Program is established. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to establish a Nutrient Removal Technology Grant Program for Great Lakes States and municipalities to install technologies reducing total nutrients in wastewater. The Nutrient Removal Technology Grant Program prioritizes eligible facilities for installing technologies to reduce total nutrients in discharged wastewater, consulting with the Program Office for maximum nutrient load reductions at points of discharge. The Nutrient Removal Technology Grant Program aims to prioritize technologies that can achieve the greatest nutrient load reductions at discharge points, provide environmental benefits to the Great Lakes System, and align with nutrient objectives outlined in the Great Lakes Water Quality Protocol of 2012. States in the Great Lakes region can apply for this program. The Great Lakes Water Quality Protocol of 2012 allows Great Lakes States or municipalities to apply for a grant from the Administrator for up to 55 percent of the cost. The Administrator may grant up to 55 percent of the cost for installing nutrient removal technologies at eligible facilities. The term 'Great Lakes Water Quality Protocol of 2012' refers to the agreement signed in Washington on September 7, 2012. The term 'eligible facility' refers to a municipal wastewater treatment facility within the Great Lakes System in any of the Great Lakes States, with a design capacity to treat at least 500,000 gallons of wastewater per day. The subsection authorizes $100,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2016 to 2020 for wastewater treatment facilities in the Great Lakes System. The Administrator may use up to 4 percent of funds for administrative costs."
