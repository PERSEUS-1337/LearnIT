It includes information on current employment statistics for 2016, recent trends from 2012-2016, and employment projections from 2016-2026. The section on \"Employment Projections, 2016-2026\" analyzes projections by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for changes in S&E occupations and the creation of job openings. The \"Concluding Observations\" section offers stakeholder perspectives for Congress to ensure an adequate S&E workforce for the future. The S&E workforce lacks a definitive definition, with various terms and occupations included in different analyses. The Bureau of Labor Statistics acknowledges multiple definitions of STEM occupations. The size of the Science and Engineering (S&E) workforce varies depending on the definition used. Estimates range from 6 million to over 21 million individuals. The National Science Board noted that when defined by occupation, the S&E workforce totals between 6.2 million and 6.3 million people. The policy debate on the adequacy of the U.S. S&E workforce continues. The S&E workforce totals between 6.2 million and 6.3 million people, focusing on computer, mathematical, engineering, and physical science occupations. Excluded are social scientists. The S&E workforce in 2016 was approximately 6.9 million, excluding social scientists. The report uses a modified version of the SOC system to categorize scientists and engineers into six occupational groups. In 2016, the Science and Engineering (S&E) workforce consisted of around 6.9 million individuals, excluding social scientists. The workforce is categorized into six occupational groups, including computer occupations, mathematical occupations, and various engineering fields such as aerospace, civil, and electrical engineering. In 2016, the Science and Engineering (S&E) workforce consisted of around 6.9 million individuals, excluding social scientists.

The occupations within the engineering field include aerospace, agricultural, biomedical, chemical, civil, computer hardware, electrical, electronics, environmental, health and safety, industrial, materials, mechanical, mining and geological, nuclear, and petroleum engineers, among others. Life scientists in the workforce include animal scientists, food scientists, soil and plant scientists, biochemists, microbiologists, zoologists, biological scientists, conservation scientists, foresters, epidemiologists, and medical professionals. The Science and Engineering (S&E) workforce in 2016 consisted of various occupations including plant scientists, biochemists, microbiologists, zoologists, conservation scientists, foresters, epidemiologists, and life scientists. Physical scientists included astronomers, physicists, chemists, environmental scientists, geoscientists, and hydrologists. Science and engineering managers were also part of the workforce. The report provides detailed occupations in Science and Engineering (S&E) workforce, including computer and information systems managers, architectural and engineering managers, and natural sciences managers. Data is sourced from federal government employment, wage, and unemployment data from the Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) survey for the 2012-2016 period. Figures on educational composition of S&E occupations are also included in the report. The Bureau of Labor Statistics and state workforce agencies provide employment and wage data for the 2012-2016 period, covering over 800 occupations. The survey defines \"employees\" as part-time and full-time workers paid a wage or salary, excluding self-employed individuals. The wage statistic used is the occupational \"mean wage,\" calculated by averaging the wages of all employees in a given occupation. The Current Population Survey is a monthly survey of households. The Bureau of Labor Statistics uses the Current Population Survey to gather unemployment data and supplement Occupational Employment Statistics for employment projections. Employment Projections provide data for occupational and industry employment over 10-year periods. The Bureau of Labor Statistics uses the OES survey and CES data for employment projections over 10-year periods, including wage and salary employment by occupation in each industry. The projections also consider agricultural industry employment and self-employed individuals to determine base year employment levels for each occupation. The \"Recent Trends in Employment, Wages, and Unemployment\" section analyzes changes in employment, wages, and unemployment from 2012 to 2016. The \"Employment Projections, 2016-2026\" section relies on the Bureau of Labor Statistics' biennial projections for this time frame, considering various factors that can impact the U.S. S&E workforce. The size and occupational composition of the U.S. S&E workforce are influenced by various factors such as economic conditions, technology development, funding for research, and changes in market opportunities. This report does not attribute workforce changes to specific factors. The report does not attribute changes in the U.S. S&E workforce to specific factors. Various challenges affect the comparability of OES data over time, including changes in classification systems and data collection methods. The OES data as a time series include changes in occupational, industrial, and geographical classification systems, data collection methods, survey reference period, and mean wage estimation methodology. The CRS chose the 2012-2016 time period to enhance data comparability and provide a current perspective on trends in S&E occupations. The OES survey used consistent occupational categories based on the 2010 Standard Occupational Classification throughout 2012-2016. The Bureau of Labor Statistics makes estimates for employment projections based on various factors such as population size, labor force participation rates, economic growth, and technological innovation. These estimates cover 136 separate categories and consider trends in different age, gender, race, and ethnic groups, as well as changes in business practices and production methods. The Bureau of Labor Statistics makes employment projections based on factors like economic growth, technological innovation, changes in business practices, and organizational restructuring. BLS replaced its methodology for estimating occupational replacement needs with a new methodology for estimating occupational separations in its 2016-2026 projections. The Bureau of Labor Statistics replaced its methodology for estimating occupational replacement needs with a new methodology for estimating occupational separations in its 2016-2026 projections. The BLS identified issues with the old method that compromised accuracy and validity. Other factors affecting occupational projections include changes to immigration laws, technological advances, and shifts in consumer tastes. The BLS regularly evaluates the accuracy of its projections and publishes these evaluations in its Monthly Labor Review.

Table 9 shows unemployment rates for S&E occupational groups compared to overall rates and selected professional occupations during this period. During 2012-2016, S&E occupational groups had lower unemployment rates compared to the overall workforce. However, their rates were similar to or higher than other professional occupations like lawyers, dentists, physicians, nurses, and accountants. This analysis is based on Bureau of Labor Statistics data. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects growth in the science and engineering workforce from 7.3 million to 8.2 million jobs between 2016 and 2026, an increase of 853,600 jobs (11.7% growth rate). This is higher than the projected growth rate for all occupations during the same period. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects a 1.1% CAGR growth rate for science and engineering jobs, higher than the overall job growth rate. An estimated 2.3 million job openings will be created by job growth and workers exiting the workforce, with an additional 3.7 million openings from occupational transfers in S&E positions. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects a 1.1% CAGR growth rate for science and engineering jobs, with 2.3 million job openings from job growth and workforce exits. An additional 3.7 million openings will be created by occupational transfers in S&E positions. The BLS projections lack data for a quantitative analysis of new workers needed for these openings. According to BLS, projections allow for multiple occupational transfers within a 10-year period, with only one transfer per year. Table 10 provides employment projections for science and engineering occupational groups, showing actual employment in 2016, projected employment in 2026, and the total change. Table 10 provides employment projections for science and engineering occupational groups, including actual employment in 2016, projected employment in 2026, total change, percentage increase, compound annual growth rate, annual average increase in jobs, occupational separations, and total annual job openings. Computer occupations are expected to have the largest increase in employed individuals, with the highest number of labor force exits. Computer occupations are projected to see the largest increase in employed individuals, with the highest number of labor force exits and occupational transfers. They are expected to account for 64.0% of the total growth in science and engineering occupations between 2016 and 2026, increasing their share of all S&E jobs to 58.6% in 2026. Mathematical occupations are projected to have the fastest employment growth, increasing their share of total S&E employment slightly from 2.5% in 2016 to 2.8% in 2026. Mathematical occupations are projected to have the fastest employment growth, increasing their share of total S&E employment from 2.5% in 2016 to 2.8% in 2026. S&E Managers are expected to account for 7.0% of total S&E job growth, down from their 8.3% share in 2016. Engineers are projected to contribute 16.2% to total S&E job growth, below their 23.0% share in 2016. Engineers, Life Scientists, and Physical Scientists are projected to have a lower share of S&E employment in 2026 compared to 2016. S&E job growth is projected to be below their 2016 share of employment, reducing their projected share in 2026 to 3.7%. The number of new jobs created in all occupations is significantly lower than the number needed to replace those exiting the labor force. In S&E occupations, the number needed to replace those exiting the workforce is expected to be less than twice the number of new jobs created. Labor force exits exceed the number of projected new jobs in nearly all S&E occupational groups. The number of labor force exits greatly exceeds the projected new jobs in nearly all S&E occupational groups. For example, in engineering occupations, there are 385,000 exits and 138,900 new jobs projected between 2016 and 2026. However, in mathematical occupations, job growth is expected to exceed exits, with 50,100 new openings compared to 40,000 exits during this period. Figure 6 shows the breakdown of job openings by growth, exits, and transfers for each S&E group. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects job growth, labor force exits, and occupational transfers for S&E occupations from 2016-2026.

Scientists and engineers are crucial for U.S. technological leadership, innovation, and national defense. The U.S. science and engineering workforce is vital for technological leadership, innovation, manufacturing, and national defense. Congress has enacted programs to support education and development in these fields, as well as efforts to improve STEM skills for more students to pursue S&E degrees. Efforts to improve STEM skills for students to pursue S&E degrees and increase foreign scientists and engineers in the US through visa policies have diverse views on the adequacy of the S&E workforce. There are varying perspectives on the adequacy of the S&E workforce in the United States, including debates on whether there is a shortage of scientists and engineers, the nature of such a shortage, and whether the federal government should intervene with policy measures. There is a debate on the shortage of scientists and engineers in the U.S. Some argue there is a shortage, which could impact economic growth and national security. Others disagree, citing employment and wage growth data. Despite the debate, the need for more scientists and engineers is emphasized. Increasing the number of U.S. scientists and engineers is crucial for innovation, economic performance, and job creation, regardless of whether there is a shortage. Jobs in many occupations now require higher STEM knowledge levels, and earning S&E degrees provides valuable thinking and problem-solving skills. \"Government interventions in the S&E labor market to address shortages may lead to inefficiencies, such as incentivizing degrees in S&E disciplines or increasing immigration quotas.\" Government interventions in the S&E labor market, such as incentivizing degrees in S&E disciplines or increasing immigration quotas, may lead to inefficiencies. For example, too many students may be educated in S&E for the number of available jobs, resulting in lower salaries for graduates who find S&E jobs. Long-term workforce projections are unreliable and may lead to mismatches between students' education and market needs. Unexpected changes in industrial output or employment can further complicate long-term projections. Long-term projections for the S&E labor market can be unreliable due to unexpected changes in industrial output or employment, factor substitution, retirement behavior, foreign labor availability, labor market demographics, and government policies. Shortages may occur in certain industries or fields, including new and emerging S&E fields like nanotechnology and cyclical industries like aerospace. Shortages in certain industries or fields, such as new and emerging S&E fields like nanotechnology and cyclical industries like aerospace, may be resolved by the labor market through wage adjustments and increased supply of S&E graduates. The labor supply increases in response to market signals or substitution of alternative inputs. Government interventions are necessary to address even discrete shortages to prevent adverse consequences such as loss of technological leadership, lower economic performance, and diminished national security. Industry claims of shortages are driven by a desire to reduce costs and increase current knowledge. The industry's assertions of shortages in Science and Engineering (S&E) are driven by a desire to lower labor costs by providing a continuous stream of young, lower-cost graduates through education, training, and immigration. The real issue is a skills mismatch, not a shortage of people, particularly in meeting information technology workforce needs. Expanding immigration can help address this issue. Expanding immigration can help address the skills mismatch in Science and Engineering (S&E) by bringing in foreign scientists and engineers to work in the United States, reducing the loss of U.S.-educated foreign nationals with S&E degrees. This can also dampen market signals that would otherwise drive more U.S. students into science and engineering. Expanding immigration to bring in foreign scientists and engineers may depress wages, increase unemployment, and reduce career opportunities for U.S. scientists and engineers. This could also discourage American students from pursuing S&E degrees and careers, as well as cloud labor market signals for students considering S&E careers. U.S. students lag behind those of other nations in STEM knowledge. Federal efforts are needed to improve STEM education in the US as students lag behind those of other nations in STEM knowledge. This could lead to fewer talented scientists and engineers, lower economic growth, and reduced competitiveness. Federal policies can help strengthen K-12 STEM education. International assessments may not accurately reflect US student STEM knowledge. Standardized tests comparing U.S. student STEM knowledge to other nations may not accurately reflect their preparation for S&E degrees and future capabilities. This leads to differing opinions on federal policies to enhance the S&E workforce. Federal policies aim to increase the number of students pursuing S&E degrees, admit more foreign scientists and engineers to the U.S., boost underrepresented minorities and women in science and engineering, enhance K-12 STEM education, and provide better career information for high school students. These perspectives and opinions should be considered by Congress to strengthen U.S. competitiveness and leadership in science, engineering, technology, and industry. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) publishes data on the educational composition of occupations using the American Community Survey (ACS) data. The ACS uses a compressed version of the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) system, with a crosswalk provided at the end of the appendix. This information is crucial for understanding the occupational composition of Science and Engineering (S&E) occupations. The ACS occupational classifications for S&E occupations are illustrated in chart form, with educational levels aggregated into categories. The SOC codes crosswalk is provided at the end of the appendix."
