    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Truancy Prevention and Juvenile Crime Reduction Act of 1998\". Congress finds that truancy is a significant indicator of a young person's struggles, leading to school dropout, welfare dependency, unemployment, and criminal behavior. High rates of truancy are linked to high daytime burglary rates and vandalism, with up to 44 percent of violent juvenile crime occurring during school hours. Around 75 percent of children aged 13-16 who are arrested for crimes are truants, and some cities report up to 70 percent of unexcused student absences. This leads to significant social and economic costs for society. Truancy leads to high social and economic costs, with unexcused student absences reaching 4,000 per day in some cities. The consequences include a low educational attainment rate among inmates, high dropout rates, and a significant financial burden on the nation due to lost earnings and crime control costs. Effective truancy prevention programs can reduce the staggering costs of lost earnings and crime control. Lack of targeted funding hinders current law's ability to address truancy effectively.
