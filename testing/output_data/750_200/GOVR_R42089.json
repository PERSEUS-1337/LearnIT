Various policies, including tax incentives, have been implemented since the 1970s to promote conservation and energy efficiency. The challenge lies in determining the most effective policy tools for achieving energy efficiency objectives. In 2016, one-fifth of total energy consumed in the United States was used for residential purposes. The federal government is considering policy tools to improve energy efficiency in the residential sector. In 2016, residential energy consumption accounted for one-fifth of total energy use in the United States. Recent trends show a slight decrease in residential energy consumption on both a per capita and aggregate basis since the mid-2000s. Residential energy use per capita has remained constant since the 1970s, but started trending downward in the mid- to late-2000s. This decline suggests efficiency gains have kept aggregate energy use flat or slightly decreasing despite increased energy-demanding technologies. Experts believe there is still potential for increased energy efficiency in the residential sector, but concerns exist that consumers may not invest optimally. Experts suggest that there is potential for increased energy efficiency in the residential sector, but concerns remain about consumer investment levels. Debate exists on the optimal level of energy efficiency investment, which could lead to reduced residential energy use per capita over time. However, population growth may still result in overall increases in residential energy use. This report explores the use of tax credits as a policy option to promote residential energy efficiency. This report explores tax credits as a policy option for promoting residential energy efficiency by addressing market failures and barriers in the sector. The report explores tax credits to promote residential energy efficiency by addressing market failures and barriers. Taxpayers can claim credits for energy-efficiency improvements in their primary residence for the 2017 tax year. The tax credit (IRC \u00a725C) allows taxpayers to claim a credit for energy-efficiency improvements to their primary residence, including building envelope upgrades and high-efficiency appliances. The credit is 10% of expenditures on improvements plus the cost of each energy-efficient property, capped at $50 to $300. Taxpayers typically claim the maximum credit for energy-efficient property due to the high cost of these appliances. The Section 25C tax credit allows taxpayers to claim a credit for energy-efficient improvements to their primary residence, including high-efficiency appliances. The maximum value of the credit is capped at $500 and applies to claims made in the current and prior tax years. The credit expired at the end of 2017. Eligibility requirements for residential energy-efficiency tax credits in 2017 are summarized in Table 1. The residential energy efficient property tax credit (IRC \u00a725D) allows taxpayers to claim a 30% tax credit for installing renewable energy technologies like solar panels, geothermal heat pumps, wind energy, and fuel cells on their residence. The credit rate will decrease to 26% in 2020 and 22% in 2021, expiring after 2021. The Section 25D tax credit for residential energy-efficient property will decrease to 26% in 2020 and 22% in 2021, expiring after 2021. The maximum value of the credit is not capped, and a rational consumer would invest in energy-efficient technology if the savings outweigh the cost. For more details, refer to Appendices A, B, and C. Some consumers do not invest in energy-efficient technology even when the savings outweigh the cost, leading to the \"energy-efficiency paradox.\" Various economic theories explain this behavior, including market failures in production and consumption. Certain market failures related to energy production and consumption may explain why consumers do not invest in optimal residential energy efficiency. Market barriers also hinder investments in energy-efficient technologies, limiting the impact of tax credits like Section 25C and Section 25D. Energy consumption externalities, such as market failures and barriers, may limit the impact of 25D tax credits on increasing residential energy efficiency. Market imperfections and informational issues also contribute to suboptimal investments in energy efficiency. Energy consumption externalities, like pollution costs, can lead to underallocation of resources for residential energy-efficiency investment due to lower electricity prices not reflecting environmental consequences. This results in consumers consuming more electricity than optimal and underinvesting in energy efficiency. The adoption of energy-efficient technologies can lead to positive externalities through knowledge spillover effects, benefiting society as a whole. The adoption of emerging technologies has greater benefits for society as a whole due to market failures like knowledge spillover effects and the principal-agent problem in energy-efficient property purchasing decisions. In non-owner-occupied housing, landlords may underinvest in energy efficiency when tenants pay utility bills. Builders of new homes may install less efficient technologies if they believe high-efficiency products won't be cost-effective. Capital market imperfections can also lead households to underinvest in energy-efficient property. Landlords and builders may not invest in optimal energy efficiency due to capital market imperfections and high initial costs. Low-income households, more credit constrained, tend to settle for less efficient alternatives. Lack of information about energy-saving technologies also hinders consumer investments. Consumers may be hesitant to invest in energy-saving technologies due to lack of information and uncertainty about future energy prices. Government policies, such as tax incentives, can help address market failures and barriers. Government policies, like tax incentives, can address market failures or barriers in energy efficiency. Other options include grants, rebates, credit enhancements, regulations, mandates, and informational programs like Energy Star labeling. Government policies, such as tax credits like Section 25C and Section 25D, can correct negative externalities related to residential energy consumption and incentivize investments in energy efficiency technologies. Other tax incentives, like the expired energy-efficient appliance manufacturer credit (IRC \u00a745M), can reduce the cost of producing energy-efficient products. Tax credits for energy-efficient products can lower costs and encourage investment. They can address positive externalities and increase awareness of energy-efficient technologies. However, tax credits may not be the most efficient policy if markets underinvest due to low electricity prices. Tax credits may not be the most efficient policy for increasing energy-efficiency investment if markets underinvest due to low electricity prices. Allowing electricity prices to fully reflect costs could be a more efficient way to promote energy efficiency. This could involve removing federal financial support for electricity or taxing electricity production that generates external costs not currently reflected in market prices. Increasing electricity prices to reflect full costs could encourage investment in energy-efficiency technologies. Current tax incentives for residential energy efficiency do not address the principal-agent problem and are not available to renters, limiting their effectiveness in promoting energy efficiency. Tax incentives for residential energy efficiency do not benefit renters or landlords, as they cannot claim credits for investments in rental properties. Other tax incentives, like the credit for energy-efficient new homes, address potential market problems more directly. These credits may have limited impact on homeowners facing capital market imperfections. Tax incentives for residential energy efficiency may not be effective for homeowners unable to secure credit for upfront costs associated with energy-efficient technologies. While these incentives reduce investment costs, they may not provide immediate savings for credit-constrained consumers. Subsidizing efficiency through policies like tax credits could be beneficial in cases where consumers lack information about energy-efficient technologies. Tax credits for energy efficiency may not be effective for credit-constrained homeowners. Subsidizing efficiency through policies like tax credits could be beneficial for consumers lacking information about energy-efficient technologies. Recent research suggests that tax credits may decrease total welfare if adopted by well-informed consumers, as they may not need the incentive to invest in energy efficiency. Tax credits are most beneficial when targeting consumers with the largest energy inefficiencies. Tax credits for energy efficiency are most effective when targeting consumers with the largest energy inefficiencies. However, these tax credits may not address other market failures and may not increase the usage of energy-efficient technologies to optimal levels. An economic analysis of Section 25C and Section 25D tax credits evaluates their impact on investment, fairness, and administrative issues. The economic analysis of Section 25C and Section 25D tax credits focuses on their impact on investment, fairness, and administrative issues. It questions the effectiveness of residential energy-efficiency tax benefits in increasing investment and highlights how these credits tend to benefit higher-income taxpayers. Residential energy tax credits aim to promote energy-efficient investments, but there are concerns about their effectiveness and the benefit they provide to higher-income taxpayers. The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration has identified administrative issues with these tax benefits. Tax credits for residential energy efficiency may not lead to additional investments, potentially providing windfall gains to recipients without achieving the policy goal of increasing energy efficiency. These concerns have been raised since the introduction of such credits in the 1970s. In 1979, concerns were raised about the effectiveness of residential energy tax credits in generating additional investment. Representative Bill Frenzel expressed reservations about the lack of marketplace incentive and the lower-than-expected impact on the Treasury. The tax credit bill passed last year did not provide a strong incentive in the marketplace as expected. It tends to reward economic actions forced by other factors and does not effectively stimulate investment in energy-efficient property. The effectiveness of residential energy tax credits in promoting additional investment in energy-efficient property is debated. Some researchers suggest that tax incentives could lead to increased investment, while others argue that the credits mainly result in windfall gains for recipients. Policymakers need to consider whether tax credits truly encourage more energy-efficiency investment. Residential energy tax credits may not significantly impact purchasing decisions for consumers due to other market incentives like high energy prices. Federal revenue losses from tax credits can be seen as windfall gains for consumers who would have invested in energy-efficiency improvements regardless. Tax credit savings are only realized when tax returns are filed, often months later. Federal revenue losses from tax credits are windfall gains for consumers. Savings are only realized when tax returns are filed, reducing the incentive power of the credit. Tax credits only benefit taxpayers with income tax liability, excluding 44% of U.S. households in 2017. Tax credits for residential energy efficiency only benefit taxpayers with tax liability, primarily higher-income individuals. These incentives motivate certain taxpayers to invest in energy-efficient properties. Tax credits for residential energy efficiency incentivize investment in energy-efficient properties, particularly among higher-income individuals. These incentives aim to increase investment in energy efficiency and renewable energy properties. Tax credits for residential energy efficiency target homeowners, who are typically higher income individuals. These incentives are predominantly claimed by middle- and upper-income taxpayers. In 2015, residential energy-efficiency tax credits were mostly claimed by middle- and upper-income taxpayers, with over three-quarters of claims coming from tax returns with adjusted gross income above $50,000. These taxpayers also claimed the majority of the total value of residential credits. In contrast, lower-income tax units below $50,000 claimed a smaller portion of credits, despite making up a larger percentage of all tax units. Tax units in higher income brackets claim the majority of residential energy tax credits, with the highest earners receiving credits seven times higher than the lowest income earners. Nonrefundable tax credits like Section 25C and Section 25D may limit who can claim these benefits, as the value cannot exceed a taxpayer's tax liability. Section 25D credits can be carried forward, but Section 25C credits cannot. Taxpayers with insufficient tax liability in the current year cannot fully benefit from the Section 25C tax credit, which cannot be carried forward. Those who eliminate their tax liability through other incentives may not benefit from residential energy-efficiency tax incentives, limiting access to higher-income taxpayers. Residential energy-efficiency tax incentives are limited to higher-income taxpayers, which may not effectively address market barriers for energy-efficiency investments. Tax credits should target households facing high upfront costs and credit constraints to encourage additional investment. If tax credits only benefit higher-income households, they may not be the most effective policy option. An ideal tax code should be simple. If households are not credit constrained, tax incentives may not effectively address market barriers. An ideal tax code should be simple for taxpayers to comply with and for the government to administer. Taxpayers are more likely to claim benefits with low compliance costs, but there may be a trade-off between tax credits with little reporting requirements and overall taxpayer compliance. The Treasury Department's Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) found opportunities for fraud in residential energy tax credits due to the IRS's inability to verify if claimants made qualifying energy modifications to their homes. The IRS was unable to confirm the eligibility of claimants for residential energy tax credits due to lack of required information and verification. Prior to 2011, taxpayers were not asked for details to confirm their eligibility, leading to potential fraud opportunities. The IRS Form 5695 did not request necessary information to confirm eligibility for residential energy tax credits, leading to potential fraud. TIGTA found that 30% of sampled taxpayers claiming the credits may not have been homeowners. The IRS updated the form in 2011 to collect more details about the taxpayer's home. In a recent report, TIGTA discovered that the IRS may have wrongly denied $1.5 million in credits to nearly 800 eligible taxpayers. In a recent report, TIGTA found that the IRS incorrectly denied almost 800 eligible taxpayers $1.5 million in residential energy tax credits. The $500 limit for the 25C credit was mistakenly applied to the 25D credit, resulting in taxpayers being improperly denied the full amount. Congress has the option to address these temporary tax credit provisions. The Section 25C and Section 25D tax credits are temporary provisions that Congress can allow to expire. Options for future incentives for residential energy efficiency include modifying or replacing the credits with a grant program. Letting the credits expire as scheduled may impact taxpayers who base purchasing decisions on their availability. The current tax credits for residential energy efficiency may expire as scheduled, potentially impacting taxpayers who base purchasing decisions on their availability. Policymakers have the option to extend, expand, or modify these incentives. The current tax credits for residential energy efficiency may be extended, expanded, or modified. The credits have undergone changes since 2005 and can be expanded in various ways, such as using a more generous formula, including more technologies, and removing caps. The residential energy efficiency tax credits can be expanded by using a more generous formula, including more technologies, and removing caps. This expansion could provide additional incentives for taxpayers and has already shown significant growth in credit value. Policymakers have the option to scale back these provisions if needed. Policymakers have the option to scale back residential energy efficiency tax credits by reinstating technology-specific caps, introducing an overall cap, or phasing out credits for upper-income taxpayers. These changes may increase confusion among taxpayers estimating their credits. Policymakers may consider phasing out energy efficiency tax credits for upper-income taxpayers and replacing them with a rebate program or direct cash payments to incentivize eligible purchases. This alternative approach could be more beneficial for consumers, especially those without sufficient funds. A rebate program could be a more beneficial way to incentivize consumers purchasing energy-efficient or renewable-energy-generating technologies, especially for those with limited funds or little tax liability. Legislation introduced in 2010 aimed to create a rebate program for contractors installing qualified energy-efficiency property. The Home Star Energy Retrofit Act of 2010 aimed to create a rebate program for contractors installing energy-efficient property, but it was not passed by the Senate. Specifications for property eligible for residential energy-efficiency tax credits are detailed in the appendix. The Energy Tax Act of 1978 introduced the first tax credit for conservation and renewable-energy generation, with two components: 15% of the first $2,000 of energy-conservation expenditures and a maximum credit value of $300. The Energy Tax Act of 1978 introduced a tax credit with two components: 15% of the first $2,000 of energy-conservation expenditures (up to $300) and, in 1980, the Crude Oil Windfall Profit Tax Act increased the credit for renewable energy expenditures. The credit included 30% of the first $2,000 for solar, wind, and geothermal energy, plus 20% of the next $8,000 (up to $2,200), with a maximum total credit value of $2,500. The Profit Tax Act of 1980 increased the renewable energy credit to 40% of the first $10,000 of expenditures, with a maximum value of $4,000. This credit expired in 1985 and was not reinstated until 2005 with the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which introduced new temporary tax credits for energy-efficient home improvements. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT05; P.L. 109-58) introduced temporary tax credits for energy-efficient home improvements. The nonbusiness energy property credit (IRC \u00a725C) allowed taxpayers to receive a 10% nonrefundable tax credit for qualified expenditures on specific types of property. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT05) introduced temporary tax credits for energy-efficient home improvements. The nonbusiness energy property credit (IRC \u00a725C) allowed taxpayers to receive a 10% nonrefundable tax credit for qualified expenditures on specific types of property, such as air circulating fans, furnaces, heat pumps, and boilers. The maximum credit for windows was $200, with a lifetime cap of $500 for improvements made to the taxpayer's principal residence. Another credit established was the residential energy-efficient property credit (IRC \u00a725D), calculated as 30% of qualifying expenses. The residential energy-efficient property credit (IRC \u00a725D) established by EPACT05 for 2006 and 2007 was a nonrefundable credit calculated as 30% of expenditures on qualified photovoltaic properties, solar water-heating properties, and fuel-cell generators, with annual limits. The credit for photovoltaic and solar water-heating properties could not exceed $2,000 per year, while the credit for fuel cells could not exceed $500 per year. The residential energy-efficient property credit (IRC \u00a725D) expired at the end of 2007, while Section 25D was extended for the 2008 tax year by the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 (P.L. 109-432). The act clarified that all property using solar energy to generate electricity could qualify for the Section 25D credit. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 reinstated and modified the Section 25C credit for the 2009 tax year. It expanded the list of qualified energy property to include biomass fuel stoves eligible for a $300 credit. Geothermal heat pumps were removed from Section 25C but added to Section 25D. The Section 25D tax credit was extended for eight years, through 2016, and modified for existing and new technologies. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 extended the Section 25D tax credit for eight years, through 2016, and expanded it to include qualified small wind-energy property and geothermal heat pump property. The credit for small wind energy was 30% of expenditures up to a cap of $4,000. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 extended and modified tax credits for small wind-energy and geothermal properties, allowing taxpayers to claim credits for both technologies installed on their residential properties. The credit for small wind energy was capped at $500 for each half kilowatt of electric capacity generated, not to exceed $4,000 annually, while the credit for geothermal heat pumps was 30% of expenditures up to a $2,000 annual cap. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 extended and modified tax credits for energy-efficiency improvements and energy property. The credit was equal to 30% of qualified expenditures, with an increased cap of $1,500 for 2009 and 2010. Technology-specific credit amounts were eliminated, and the $200 aggregate cap for windows was removed. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 extended and modified tax credits for energy-efficiency improvements and energy property. The credit was equal to 30% of qualified expenditures, with an increased cap of $1,500 for 2009 and 2010. Technology-specific credit amounts were eliminated, and the $200 aggregate cap for windows was removed. Additionally, ARRA changed the Section 25D tax credit for 2009 and 2010 by removing maximum credit caps for most technologies except fuel cells, effective from 2009 through 2016. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 extended and modified tax credits for energy-efficiency improvements and energy property, removing maximum credit caps for most technologies except fuel cells for 2009 through 2016. The changes led to an increase in the number and total amount of credits claimed. However, when the ARRA expansions expired, the number of taxpayers claiming the residential energy credit decreased, along with the total and average amount of credits claimed. The 2010 Tax Act extended the Section 25C credit for one year, but reinstated the general lifetime limit and window lifetime limit. Taxpayers claiming the residential energy credit decreased due to these changes. The American Taxpayer Relief Act extended the Section 25C credit for two additional years, reinstating certain efficiency standards and technology-specific credit limits. The American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA) extended the Section 25C credit for two additional years, while the Tax Increase Prevention Act (TIPA) extended it for one more year. The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act (PATH Act) further extended and modified the 25C credit for two years, along with changing the requirements for qualifying energy-efficient improvements. The PATH Act extended the 25C credit for two years, from 2015 to 2016, and modified the requirements for energy-efficient improvements, specifically for windows and doors to meet Energy Star 6.0 standards starting in 2016. Division P of P.L. 114-113 extended the 25D credit for solar technologies through 2021 and adjusted the credit formula. The 25D credit for solar technologies was extended through 2021 with a modified credit formula. The credit will be calculated as 30% of qualifying expenditures from 2017 to 2019, 26% in 2020, and 22% in 2021. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 extended the 25D credit for nonsolar technologies like fuel cell plants, small wind energy property, and geothermal heat pump property through 2021. The credit rates for these technologies are now 30% for property placed in service before the end of 2019, decreasing to 26% in 2020. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 extended the 25D credit for nonsolar technologies like fuel cell plants, small wind energy property, and geothermal heat pump property through 2021. The credit rates for these technologies are now 30% for property placed in service before the end of 2019, decreasing to 26% in 2020 and 22% in 2021, matching the credit rates for solar technologies. The 25D credit for solar technologies remains unchanged from prior law."
