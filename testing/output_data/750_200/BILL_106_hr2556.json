    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Telecommuting and Air Quality Act\" and includes a grant program for designing a pilot program to improve air quality through telecommuting. The Secretary of Transportation will grant a nonprofit private entity to design a pilot program for improving air quality through telecommuting. The National Environmental Policy Institute may receive the grant if they apply. The Secretary of Transportation will grant a nonprofit private entity to design a pilot program for improving air quality through telecommuting. The program will be administered in collaboration with the Environmental Protection Agency and the Secretary of Energy. Definitions for participating employers and telecommuting are provided for the proposed Ozone Precursor Credit-Trading Pilot Program. The curr_chunk defines telecommuting as using telecommunications to work remotely, reducing the need to commute. Regulated entities are those under the Clean Air Act for emissions of ozone precursors, which are pollutants leading to ground-level ozone. The pilot program aims to evaluate methods for calculating reductions in ozone precursor emissions resulting from reduced vehicle-miles traveled. The pilot program evaluates reductions in ozone precursor emissions from telecommuting employees, allowing employers to transfer emission credits. The pilot program allows employers to transfer emission credits through a commercial trading forum or direct exchanges with credit holders. Regulated entities can obtain emission credits through these methods. Regulated entities can obtain emission credits and present them to the Federal Government or State for compliance with the Clean Air Act. The Federal Government will explore ways to facilitate the transfer of emission credits between entities. The Federal Government will explore means to facilitate the transfer of emission credits between participating employers and regulated entities in the greater metropolitan region of the District of Columbia for compliance with the Clean Air Act. The Secretary will select three additional geographic areas for consultation with local governments, in addition to the greater metropolitan regions of the District of Columbia and Los Angeles, for compliance with the Clean Air Act. The grantee under subsection (a) must consult with local governments and business organizations in the geographic area. The Secretary requires the grantee to study and report to Congress and the Secretary on the potential significance of the proposed pilot program for expanding telecommuting and reducing VMTs in the designated areas. The grantee must study and report on the potential effects of the program on transportation policies, energy conservation, air quality, and quality of life. $250,000 is authorized for the grant in fiscal year 2000."
