    "content": "Irrigation has been crucial for the development and economy of the United States, especially in settling the West and revitalizing agriculture after the Dust Bowl. Technological advancements have modernized irrigated agriculture, but come with costs such as infrastructure and support programs. The costs of irrigation include infrastructure, support programs, and potential impacts on water users and the environment. Irrigation water use is measured by withdrawals and consumption, with consumption referring to water taken in by plants or evaporated without returning to water sources. Consumption from irrigation refers to water taken in by plants or evaporated without returning to water sources. Irrigation is the second-largest source of water withdrawals in the United States, but withdrawals have decreased by 23% since 1980. From 2005 to 2010, irrigation withdrawals dropped 9% nationally. It is uncertain if this decline in withdrawals has led to a decrease in water consumption due to improved irrigation efficiency. Since 2003, only four western states have seen an increase in irrigated acres, while the rest have seen a reduction. Several eastern states, on the other hand, have seen a significant increase in irrigated acres over this same time period; seven states increased irrigation by 50% (Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Tennessee). Farmers shifted from gravity irrigation to pressurized sprinklers and microirrigation, especially in 17 western states. Since the 1980s, farmers in 17 western states have shifted from gravity irrigation to pressurized sprinklers and microirrigation. This led to a decline in gravity irrigation from almost 62% to 30% of irrigated acres by 2013. Irrigated land in the West increased by 1.7 million acres during this time, while applied irrigation water decreased by over 1.37 million acre-feet. The trend of declining water application began in 1998. Since 1980s, farmers in 17 western states shifted to pressurized sprinklers and microirrigation, reducing gravity irrigation from 62% to 30% by 2013. Irrigated land in the West increased by 1.7 million acres, while applied water decreased by 1.37 million acre-feet. Despite overall decline in irrigation withdrawals, groundwater withdrawals increased by 740,000 AF. Eastern states saw a growth of 8.7 million acres in irrigated land since 1984. Since 1984, irrigated land in eastern states has grown by over 8.7 million acres, with groundwater withdrawals being the primary source for irrigation. Withdrawals peaked in 2008, increasing by 4.3 million AF since 2003. This trend is attributed to factors like increased commodity prices, drought episodes, and easy access to groundwater. However, the expanded use of groundwater for irrigation has led to declining aquifer levels and environmental concerns. The expanded use of groundwater for irrigation since 1984 has led to a decline in aquifer levels and raised environmental concerns. Irrigation efficiency is determined by factors such as system performance, water application uniformity, and crop response, with evapotranspiration rate being a key consideration influenced by climate conditions. Efficient irrigation systems are influenced by climate conditions and the water conveyance system, which can impact crop water requirements. Poorly constructed irrigation canals can lead to conveyance losses. Efficient systems aim to maintain crop production levels while conserving water for downstream use. Studies have shown that efficient irrigation systems may lead to increased water consumption and crop yield, as seen in a study of irrigation subsidies in the Upper Rio Grande Basin. It remains unclear if expanded irrigation resulting from water conservation occurs nationwide and to what extent. Microirrigation is more efficient than gravity irrigation, but gravity irrigation typically consumes less water. Efficient irrigation systems may lead to increased water consumption and crop yield. Microirrigation is more efficient than gravity irrigation, but gravity irrigation typically consumes less water. Water not lost to evapotranspiration through gravity irrigation is returned to surface or groundwater sources. This water could potentially be put to subsequent beneficial use. Efficient irrigation systems may lead to increased water consumption and crop yield. There are two main categories of irrigation systems: pressure systems and gravity systems. These systems deliver water to crops using different methods and cover most types of irrigation systems in the United States. Adopting more-efficient irrigation technologies may not necessarily result in less water consumed overall. Precision technologies are increasingly common in modern irrigation systems, complementing basic irrigation methods. Best management practices for irrigation focus on water management on farms, including conveyance, scheduling, and application methods. These practices are based on select practices identified by USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service. Not all irrigation technologies are considered best management practices. The BMPs discussed are based on practices identified by USDA's NRCS for irrigation systems. Not all technologies are considered BMPs, and success depends on various factors. Pressure systems pump water through tubing to apply water to crops. Pressure systems pump water through tubing to apply water to crops using sprinkler or microirrigation systems, making up 58-65% of irrigation systems in the US. Major pressure systems include center pivot, linear move tower, and solid set. Pressure irrigation systems, such as center pivot, linear move tower, and drip systems, make up 58-65% of irrigation systems in the US. These systems are more efficient than gravity systems and require intentional water management to maintain soil moisture levels and reduce erosion. Initial investment costs can be high, but operational labor requirements are generally low. The management plan for irrigation systems involves timing and application of water to maintain soil moisture levels, reduce erosion, maximize plant growth, lower energy consumption, and increase water efficiency. It includes various irrigation BMPs such as microirrigation, sprinkler irrigation, ditch lining, land leveling, and tailwater recovery. Sprinkler systems like center pivot, side roll, and linear move tower irrigation spray water over crops to provide adequate soil moisture. Microirrigation systems, including surface drip, micro sprinkler, and sub-surface drip irrigation, are highly efficient methods that apply water directly to the root zone of crops. This enhances standard center pivot irrigation systems to low-energy precision application (LEPA) systems. LEPA systems convert standard center pivot irrigation systems to apply water directly into circular furrows, reducing evaporation losses and energy consumption. Gravity systems divert water to flood over a crop area via land-forming measures like canals, ditches, basins, and furrows. Controlled flooding methods increase efficiencies, while uncontrolled flooding is less efficient. Gravity irrigation systems, such as basin, border, and furrow irrigation, use land-forming measures to increase efficiency. These systems have a lower initial cost and higher labor requirement compared to pressure systems. Gravity systems are suitable for close-growing crops like rice, while furrow irrigation can be used for row crops like potatoes and corn. Irrigation land leveling ensures uniform water application to the crop area. Land leveling is reshaping a field to ensure uniform water application without puddles or dry spots. It increases irrigation efficiency, reduces erosion, and prevents water logging. Canal linings limit water loss during transit to the crop area. Canal linings are installed to limit water loss in transit to crop areas. They can increase conveyance efficiency based on soil type and canal length. Ditch linings are made from materials like concrete, PVC, and polypropylene. Tailwater recovery systems reuse excess water from gravity irrigation to prevent water contamination and waterlogging of crops. An irrigation reservoir, tailored to the water needs of crops, can be constructed at the end of a slope to store water for reuse. Precision technologies, like satellite data and sensor networks, are increasingly integrated into irrigation practices for enhanced efficiency. The integration of precision technologies in agriculture, particularly in irrigation, has seen rapid growth. Technologies such as satellite data, sensor networks, data analytics, and drones are improving irrigation efficiency, reducing costs, and increasing crop yield. Technology companies are increasingly involved in the agricultural sector, offering services to help farmers maximize profits. NASA and USDA collaborated on the SMAP satellite mission to gather soil moisture data. The SMAP satellite, launched by NASA and USDA, collects soil moisture data globally without terrestrial sensors. Despite radar transmission issues, the project continues using a functioning radiometer. This data can help governments and farmers make informed decisions on irrigation water usage. Drones are also used for aerial imagery and data collection in combination with software. Unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) and sensor networks are utilized for aerial imagery and data collection to monitor plant water status and soil water content. Data analytics is used to analyze real-time data for irrigation system automation, adjusting water application based on gathered information. The information gathered from regional weather networks, combined with precipitation and soil moisture data, is used to establish an accurate irrigation schedule. A remote monitoring notification system wirelessly transfers real-time information to adjust irrigation operations, reducing field visits and overall water usage. Poly-pipe is utilized in furrow irrigation for its flexibility and durability. Implementing irrigation best management practices (BMPs) such as using poly-pipe in furrow irrigation can optimize water application, reduce runoff, and increase irrigation efficiency. This can lead to higher yields, lower production costs, and more evenly watered fields. Irrigated crops typically yield double that of non-irrigated crops, allowing producers to grow higher value crops. Irrigation best management practices (BMPs) like using poly-pipe in furrow irrigation optimize water application, increase efficiency, and lead to higher yields. Irrigated crops yield double that of non-irrigated crops, allowing for the growth of higher value crops and extending growing seasons. Additionally, irrigation BMPs can enhance production of specialty crops by delivering water only when needed, reducing costs, and preventing issues from overwatering. The controlled environment of an irrigation system can also be used for applying other production-related inputs. Irrigation BMPs optimize water application, increase efficiency, and lead to higher yields. The controlled environment of an irrigation system can be used for applying nutrients and pesticides. Implementation choices for irrigation technologies vary across the United States due to factors like cost, crop type, climate, soil, labor, and water quality. Capital and operational costs can influence the adoption of efficient irrigation systems. Some agricultural producers adopt efficient irrigation systems for economic gains rather than water conservation. High-value crop growers are more likely to invest in costly drip irrigation systems compared to low-value crop growers. According to USDA's 2013 Farm and Ranch Irrigation Survey (FRIS), 32% of respondents reported financial constraints in upgrading irrigation systems, with 25% stating that the costs wouldn't be covered. High-efficiency systems like micro sprinklers and sub-surface drip are more expensive than gravity systems. Agricultural producers also consider the cost of developing a water supply, including drilling wells and operating pumps. The cost of developing a water supply is a significant consideration for agricultural producers when choosing an irrigation system. This cost includes drilling wells, operating pumps, or building storage facilities. The expense of establishing a water supply from groundwater, which is generally more costly than surface water, can influence the decision to adopt efficient pressure systems. Areas heavily reliant on groundwater often use high-efficiency pressure systems, while those with sufficient surface water may be less likely to invest in efficient irrigation systems. Areas heavily reliant on groundwater are more likely to adopt efficient irrigation systems, while areas with adequate surface water supplies may not invest in such systems due to lower water development costs. Growers in drought-prone regions relying on surface water are more inclined to adopt efficient irrigation. The type of crop being irrigated also influences the choice of irrigation system; for example, high-pressure sprinklers are not suitable for perennial tree crops due to the risk of fruit decay, making drip irrigation more appropriate. Close-growing crops like rice typically require gravity irrigation. Tree crops are better suited for drip irrigation systems to prevent fruit decay. Many farmers in the United States face challenges adopting efficient irrigation systems due to crop type and local climate conditions. Local climate conditions play a significant role in the adoption of irrigation technology. Drip and surface irrigation are more effective in windy conditions, while sprinkler irrigation is subject to high evaporation in arid climates. Soil type, such as sandy soils, also influences the choice of irrigation system. The type of soil in a crop production area is crucial for selecting an irrigation system. Sandy soils need sprinkler or microirrigation due to high infiltration rates, while loam and clay soils can use various methods. Clay soils are best suited for gravity irrigation. Soil surveys help in designing irrigation systems. Labor-technology trade-off is important when choosing between pressure and gravity systems. The type of soil in a crop production area is crucial for selecting an irrigation system. Gravity irrigation can be labor-intensive compared to pressure systems. Water quality can dictate the type of irrigation system used, as sprinkler and drip systems carry a clogging risk. Water quality is a key factor in selecting an irrigation system. Sediment-heavy water is best for gravity irrigation, while salinity and selenium can be managed with sprinkler or drip systems. The Clean Water Act addresses water quality concerns in the nation's water bodies. The Clean Water Act aims to improve water quality in various water bodies, benefiting agriculture indirectly. State water rights laws determine the amount of water available for irrigation. The federal government offers financial and technical assistance to agricultural producers. Political, legal, and societal factors related to water rights are not covered in detail in this report. For more information, refer to CRS Report R43910 on Water Resource Issues in the 114th Congress. The federal government provides financial and technical assistance to agricultural producers for water resource issues. USDA agencies offer support through education, outreach, and research. Conservation programs like EQIP, CSP, and AMA provide funding for irrigation BMPs adoption. Between 2009 and 2014, $1.2 billion in funding from farm bill programs was allocated for irrigation BMPs, with nearly half going towards sprinkler and microirrigation systems. California and Texas received the most funding, with several states in the West and three southeastern states also in the top 10 recipients. The West, including California and Texas, received the most funding for irrigation BMPs, with three southeastern states also in the top 10 recipients. Increasing irrigation efficiency may lead to groundwater depletion in key aquifers like the High Plains, Mississippi Embayment, and Central Valley. These aquifers accounted for 93% of groundwater depletion in the US from 2000 to 2008. Aquifers like the High Plains, Mississippi Embayment, and Central Valley are experiencing unsustainable groundwater depletion rates, accounting for 93% of depletion in the US from 2000 to 2008. The effectiveness of irrigation BMP funding in reducing depletion is uncertain, with programs like EQIP providing financial and technical assistance for irrigation water management plans and conservation projects. Funding for irrigation water management plans comes from CAPs, while Conservation Innovation Grants support local or regional irrigation conservation programs. The Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) provides funding for irrigation BMPs based on conservation performance. CSP also supports precision technologies like regional weather networks for irrigation scheduling and remote monitoring of irrigation pumping plants. Agricultural Management Assistance (AMA) is another program that provides support for irrigation practices. The USDA provides financial and technical assistance for irrigation technologies through various programs such as AMA, EQIP, and CAPs. AMA funds irrigation BMPs in states with low participation in the Federal Crop Insurance program. USDA research efforts also focus on irrigation technology adoption. Conservation Technical Assistance (CTA) helps irrigators adopt conservation plans through a national network of conservationists, serving as a foundation for qualifying for financial assistance programs. Conservation Technical Assistance (CTA) aids farmers and supporting groups in developing conservation plans, serving as a pathway to qualify for financial assistance programs. CTA is accessible to various entities, including state and local government units, citizen groups, and professional consultants, and has funded over $5.7 billion in technical assistance between 2003 and 2013. USDA provides information resources to irrigators through the Agricultural Research Service (ARS), Economic Research Service (ERS), and National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA). The Agricultural Research Service (ARS) is the primary agricultural research organization in USDA, focusing on irrigation BMPs. Recent studies have aimed at improving irrigation management and water conservation. The Economic Research Service (ERS) conducts economic and policy studies on agricultural issues, including irrigation water use and conservation trends in irrigated agriculture across the United States. Recent ERS studies have examined characteristics of irrigated farms in 17 western states and water conservation trends in irrigated agriculture across the United States. NIFA administers federal funding for agriculture-related science and research, including grant programs like AFRI Water for Agriculture Challenge Area and NWQP. National monitoring and reporting efforts for irrigation are limited, with NASS and USGS providing the most comprehensive data. Few national-level irrigation monitoring and reporting efforts exist. The National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) and U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) offer the most comprehensive data on irrigation water use in the United States, but their methodologies and reporting schedules differ. NASS conducts surveys of producers and produces the Farm and Ranch Irrigation Survey every five years, while USGS, part of the Department of the Interior, also provides valuable information. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) conducts a national assessment of irrigated agriculture in the US every five years. This assessment evaluates trends in water use categories, including irrigation.
