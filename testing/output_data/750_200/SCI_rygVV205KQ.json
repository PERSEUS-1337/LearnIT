    "content": "In this work, imitation learning is used to tackle challenges in high-dimensional sparse reward tasks for reinforcement learning agents. Adversarial imitation is shown to be effective in learning a representation of the world from pixels and exploring efficiently despite rare reward signals. The adversary, acting as the reward function, can be small with just 128 parameters and trained using a basic GAN formulation. This approach overcomes limitations of contemporary imitation methods by not requiring demonstrator actions, only video input. The proposed agent in this study can solve a challenging robot manipulation task of block stacking using only video demonstrations and sparse reward. It outperforms non-imitating agents and learns faster than competing approaches that rely on hand-crafted dense reward functions. Additionally, a new adversarial goal recognizer is developed to aid the agent's learning process. The study introduces a new adversarial goal recognizer that enables the agent to learn stacking without task rewards, solely through imitation. It demonstrates that GAIL can effectively handle high-dimensional pixel observations with the right features, using a single-layer discriminator network. This advancement improves efficiency in the environment and surpasses standard GAIL baselines. The study introduces a new adversarial goal recognizer that enables the agent to learn stacking without task rewards, solely through imitation. It demonstrates that GAIL can effectively handle high-dimensional pixel observations with the right features, using a single-layer discriminator network. The efficiency in the environment can be improved by using a Deep Distributed Deterministic Policy Gradients (D4PG) agent, which utilizes a replay buffer to store past experiences. Various types of features can be successfully used with a tiny, single-layer adversary, where a deep adversary on pixels would fail completely. In experiments, a new approach using self-supervised embeddings, random projections, and value network features from a D4PG agent is shown to solve a robotic block stacking task from pixels with sparse rewards. This method modifies GAIL for off-policy D4PG agents with experience replay, achieving success without dense task rewards. The curr_chunk discusses a new approach for learning block stacking with sparse rewards using a 6-DoF Jaco robot arm agent. It outperforms behavior cloning agents and achieves a 94% success rate in simulation. The main contribution is the use of sparse rewards and learning to stack faster than agents with dense staged rewards. The curr_chunk introduces various methods for improving task performance and learning speed in agents, including an adversary-based early termination method and an agent that learns without task rewards using an auxiliary goal recognizer adversary. Ablation experiments on Jaco stacking and a 2D planar walker benchmark are conducted to understand the reasons for the agent's improvement. Random projections with a linear discriminator are found to work well in some cases. The curr_chunk discusses the use of random projections and value network features in improving agent performance in a Markov Decision Process. The goal is to find a policy that maximizes the expected sum of discounted rewards. The DDPG algorithm aims to maximize the expected sum of discounted rewards by training an actor-critic model with neural networks. New transitions are added to a replay buffer for better exploration, and the action-value function is trained to match 1-step returns. The DDPG algorithm trains an actor-critic model with neural networks to maximize expected rewards. The policy network is updated via gradient descent to produce actions that maximize the action-value function. Building on DDPG, D4PG introduces improvements such as sampling from the policy with added noise for exploration and updating target networks every K learning steps. Building on the DDPG algorithm, the D4PG agent incorporates improvements like off-policy training with experience replay using a buffer B. GAIL involves learning a reward function by training a discriminator network to distinguish between agent and expert transitions, closely related to MaxEnt inverse reinforcement learning. The objective of GAIL includes an entropy regularizer to optimize the agent policy. The D4PG agent uses off-policy training with experience replay and a buffer B. It jointly trains the reward function using a modified equation. The discriminator distinguishes expert transitions from previous agents without using actions in the discriminator. The D4PG agent uses off-policy training with experience replay and a buffer B. It jointly trains the reward function using a modified equation. The discriminator distinguishes expert transitions from previous agents without using actions in the discriminator. The reward function interpolates imitation reward and a sparse task reward, bounded between 0 and 1 for early termination of episodes based on discriminator score. The D4PG agent uses off-policy training with experience replay and a buffer B. It jointly trains the reward function using a modified equation. The actor process includes pseudocode for early termination of episodes based on discriminator score. Multiple CPU actor processes run in parallel with a single GPU learner process. The actor processes receive updated network parameters every 100 acting steps to prevent the agent from drifting too far from expert trajectories. The D4PG agent uses off-policy training with experience replay and a buffer B. It includes early termination of episodes based on discriminator score to prevent drifting from expert trajectories. The type of network used in the discriminator is a critical design choice, with \u03b2 set at 0.1 to avoid wasting computation time. The discriminator's capacity is crucial for distinguishing between agent and expert. Expert demonstrations provide valuable data for feature learning, covering the state space needed for task solving. Access to expert actions is not assumed, ruling out behavior cloning for feature learning. To solve the task without expert actions, behavior cloning is not an option for feature learning. High-resolution images rule out learning features in pixel space. Contrastive predictive coding (CPC) is a promising representation learning technique for capturing long-term structure in data. Contrastive predictive coding (CPC) is a representation learning technique that maps observations into a latent space for long-term predictions using a probabilistic contrastive loss with negative sampling. This allows joint training of the encoder and autoregressive model without the need for a decoder model at the observation level. One way to enhance CPC is by replacing sparse rewards with a neural network goal recognizer trained on expert trajectories. However, freezing the network during agent training may lead to blind spots that allow the agent to exploit the system. To address this, a discriminator can be used to detect task completion instead of sparse rewards. To enhance CPC, sparse rewards can be replaced with a secondary goal discriminator network to detect task completion based on expert trajectories. The modified reward function includes D goal, a single-layer network operating on the same feature space as D, with a goal state defined as the latter 1/M proportion of expert demonstrations. Training D goal is similar to D, but expert states are only sampled from the latter 1/M portion. GAIL is an imitation learning method that aims to improve agent performance by training a second discriminator to recognize goal states. This allows the agent to surpass the demonstrator by learning to reach the goal faster. The environments include a Kinova Jaco arm and two other components. The environments for training agents include a Kinova Jaco arm with 9 degrees of freedom and hand-crafted reward functions. Demonstrations are collected using a SpaceNavigator 3D motion controller. To collect demonstrations for training agents, a SpaceNavigator 3D motion controller is used with a human operator controlling the Jaco arm. 500 episodes of demonstration for each task are gathered, along with 500 validation trajectories by a different human demonstrator. Additionally, a dataset of 30 \"non-expert\" trajectories for diagnostic purposes is collected. Another environment involves a 2D walker from the DeepMind control suite BID33, where demonstrations are collected by training a D4PG agent. The second environment involves a 2D walker from the DeepMind control suite BID33. Demonstrations are collected by training a D4PG agent from proprioceptive states to match a target velocity. The imitation method is compared to a D4PG agent and GAIL agents with discriminator networks operating on pixels directly, showing favorable results. The proposed method using a tiny adversary compares favorably in conditioning on k-step predictions, improving performance on stacking tasks. The CPC model accurately predicts future observations for expert sequences but not for non-expert sequences. D4PG with sparse rewards struggles due to exploration complexity, while D4PG with dense rewards shows better performance. In figure 4, D4PG with sparse rewards struggles with exploration complexity, while dense rewards show slow learning pace. Imitation methods perform well with sparse rewards. Value network features lead to quicker take-off than CPC features. GAIL from pixels performs poorly, while GAIL with tiny adversaries on random projections has limited success. Note that the discriminator network uses CPC features of dimension 128. The GAIL agent with CPC features of dimension 128 performs poorly, while the value network features are 2048-dimensional. Norm clipping applied in the critic optimizer may explain why GAIL value features work while pixel features do not. Testing another agent with norm clipping does not result in success in Jaco or Walker2D environments. The GAIL agent with CPC features of dimension 128 performs poorly in Jaco and Walker2D environments. Using CPC temporal predictions as input to the discriminator also does not improve performance. In ablation experiments on Jaco stacking, adding layers to the discriminator network does not improve performance, and early termination is crucial. Even with fewer demonstrations, the agent can learn stacking as well as with more demonstrations. The effectiveness of a tiny linear discriminator versus a deeper network for imitation learning is being investigated. The study investigates the effectiveness of a small linear discriminator versus a deeper network for imitation learning. Adding layers to the discriminator network does not improve performance in Jaco stacking experiments. Early termination is found to be crucial for learning, as disabling it results in slower model learning. The study compares the performance of a small linear discriminator versus a deeper network for imitation learning. Early termination is crucial for faster model learning, as shown in Figure 7 where the episode length decreases over time. The agent improves at imitating the expert after 6000 episodes, as depicted in the task and imitation reward graph. Data efficiency is evaluated in terms of expert demonstrations in a third ablation experiment, visualized in Figure 6 (b). In a third ablation experiment, the data efficiency of the proposed method is evaluated in terms of expert demonstrations. Results show that even with 60 demonstrations, good performance is achieved. An outlier was observed with 120 demos due to a random seed issue. The performance of the proposed method using value network features and random projections outperformed conventional GAIL on pixels in both Jaco and planar walker experiments. Videos of the trained agent are available in the supplementary materials.

Videos of the trained agent are included in the supplementary materials. Results show that two out of five runs were able to learn without any task reward, achieving a success rate of 55%. The best agent achieved a 55% success rate without task rewards. It learned to stack more efficiently than a human demonstrator. Leveraging expert demonstrations has a history in robotics and can improve agent performance. In robotics, leveraging expert demonstrations can improve agent performance. Recent work has shown success in training Q-learning agents using expert demonstrations. However, challenges arise when only pixel observations are available, limiting the ability to prime the value function in the same way. Deep learning has been successful in tasks beyond computer vision, including interacting with environments through imitation learning. Imitation learning in computer vision involves tasks to interact with environments. Supervised imitation and one-shot imitation approaches are used to replicate behaviors from single demonstrations. This allows for stacking blocks into target arrangements efficiently. Our approach aims for the agent to learn by interacting with the environment rather than supervised learning, unlike other methods that use attention or meta learning. Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) is proposed as an alternative to behavioral cloning for the agent to learn a reward function from demonstrations and then use reinforcement. This approach aims to overcome the limitations of behavioral cloning, such as the need for a large number of demonstrations and limited generalization capabilities. Instead of behavior cloning, BID38 BID25; BID0 propose inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to learn a reward function from demonstrations and optimize it using reinforcement learning. DQfD and DPGfD develop methods to train agents with expert trajectories and agent experiences, with BID26 improving handling of sparse-exploration Atari games. DPGfD shows success in solving a peg insertion task on a real robot through imitation without access to any data. GAIL applies adversarial learning to imitation, but challenges remain in making it work for high-dimensional input spaces. Our major contribution is using minimal adversaries to solve sparse reward tasks in high-dimensional input spaces. Another approach involves learning compact representations for imitation learning from expert observations. Our contribution involves using minimal adversaries to address sparse reward tasks in high-dimensional input spaces. We utilize static self-supervised features like contrastive predictive coding and dynamic value network features to train block stacking agents successfully from sparse rewards on pixels. The curr_chunk discusses the training of block stacking agents using behavior cloning with a residual network pixel encoder architecture. The stacking accuracy achieved is approximately 15%. Videos of the learned agents can be viewed on a specific website provided. The architecture for D4PG includes a 128-dimension LSTM and a final 512-dimensional linear layer. The model consists of an encoder and an autoregressive model optimizing the same loss function. Negative samples are used for optimization, and weights for bilinear mapping are learned. The weights for the bilinear mapping in CPC are learned and depend on the number of latent steps predicting in the future. By optimizing L CPC, the mutual information between z t+k and c t is maximized, resulting in compact representations of common variables in the context and target. This is beneficial for extracting slow features, especially when z t+k and c t are far apart in time. Our proposed approach involves model learning through contrastive predictive coding (CPC) and training the agent using CPC future predictions. Reward functions are modified from BID37, with dense staged rewards defined in five stages and sparse rewards in two stages. Each episode lasts 500 time steps without early stopping. The approach involves model learning through contrastive predictive coding (CPC) and training the agent using CPC future predictions. Sparse rewards are defined in two stages, with no rewards for reaching, lifting, or releasing. Actor and critic share a residual network with convolutional layers and fully connected networks for both. The actor and critic networks in the model use linear units and layer normalization. They employ Distributional Q functions with a categorical representation of random variable Z. The bootstrap target is computed with N-step returns. The model uses Distributional Q functions with a categorical representation of random variable Z for computing the bootstrap target with N-step returns. The loss function for training the distributional value functions involves cross entropy, and distributed prioritized experience replay is used for training. The value function is represented as L N (\u03b8) = E (st,at,{rt,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ,r t+N \u22121 },s t+N )\u223cB [H(\u03a6(Z ), Z(s t , a t |\u03b8))] with cross entropy H. Distributed prioritized experience replay BID29 is utilized for enhanced stability and learning efficiency."
