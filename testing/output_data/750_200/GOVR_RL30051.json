    "content": "The report discusses key base closure developments from the 105th to the 107th Congress, including the signing of legislation in December 2001 (P.L. 107-107) for a new base closure round in 2005. Action on 451 installations scheduled for closure and realignment by previous BRAC commissions was completed by FY2001. The completion of base closure and realignment actions by previous BRAC commissions in FY2001 resulted in significant cost savings. Additional closures were deemed necessary due to defense spending trends, leading to the initiation of a new base closure round in 2005. Secretary of Defense William Cohen released the Quadrennial Defense Review in 1997, calling for two more rounds of base closures in 1999 and 2001 due to the downsizing of DOD's base structure lagging behind its force structure reductions. Force structure had decreased by 33% since the first closure round and was projected to decline by a total of 36% under the QDR. The force structure has decreased by 33% and will decline by a total of 36% under the QDR. Domestic infrastructure will be reduced by 21%. Closing more bases is necessary to achieve a balance between infrastructure and force structure, and to secure significant savings for future readiness and weapons acquisition programs. Without these savings, DOD would struggle to fulfill its missions and responsibilities in the future. Secretary of Defense Cohen's plan to start new rounds of base closures within the next five years faced opposition on Capitol Hill due to concerns over economic and political repercussions in districts. Despite the Senate Armed Services Committee's narrow failure to approve two more rounds of base closures in 1999, both defense committees of the House and Senate did not support new base closure legislation during mark-ups of the FY1998 DOD authorization bills. The Senate Armed Services Committee narrowly failed to approve two more rounds of base closures in 1999 and 2001. Senator Carl Levin and other senators pledged to push for more base closings to reduce excess infrastructure for new weapons funding. The full Senate later voted against the McCain-Levin initiative, delaying any new base closings until DOD developed a plan. The full Senate voted against the McCain-Levin initiative for new base closings, opting for a substitute amendment that required DOD to develop accounting techniques to measure costs and savings. The amendment, sponsored by Senators Dorgan, Lott, and Daschle, mandated DOD to submit a cost/savings report to Congress in a timely manner to potentially authorize another round of base closings in 2001. In the House National Security Committee, opposition to a new round of base closures was strong. Representative Joel Hefley, chairman of the subcommittee on military installations, argued against new base closure rounds for at least five years. Concerns were raised about the Department of Defense's estimated savings and the upfront costs of shutting down bases. Despite DOD officials claiming net savings, the Congressional Budget Office reported in December 1996 that it was questionable. The Congressional Budget Office could not confirm the Department of Defense's estimated savings from base closures, leading to opposition to rushing into new rounds without a full understanding of the military implications. Despite lack of support on Capitol Hill, senior DOD officials and the President continued to push for new closures. Despite opposition on Capitol Hill, senior DOD officials and the President advocated for new rounds of base closures to free up funds for priority weapons programs. The Defense Reform Initiative included plans for base closures in 2001 and 2005. The \"Defense Reform Initiative\" (DRI) included two rounds of base closures in 2001 and 2005, aiming to save $2.8 billion annually. This was part of a larger effort to save $6 billion yearly through outsourcing, paperless contracting, and reducing personnel. Support for additional base closures came from various sources. Support for additional base closures beyond the 2001 and 2005 rounds came from the DOD-sponsored National Defense Panel in December 1997. They urged Congress and the Defense Department to expedite the process, emphasizing the importance of starting closures earlier than planned. Secretary of Defense Cohen endorsed the panel's findings, highlighting the need for two more BRAC rounds. In his endorsement of the panel's findings, Secretary of Defense Cohen emphasized the importance of two additional BRAC rounds for financing and accelerating the transformation of U.S. military capabilities. The base closure debate included President Clinton's actions regarding the closure of two Air Force maintenance depots recommended by the 1995 base closure commission. President Clinton opposed closing McClellan and Kelly Air Force Bases, advocating for privatization-in-place to prevent job losses in California and Texas. This stance was in contrast to the recommendation to transfer workloads to depots in Utah, Oklahoma, and Georgia due to low capacity utilization. President Clinton faced opposition for his support of privatization-in-place for job retention in California and Texas, with critics accusing him of political meddling. Legislators from Oklahoma, Georgia, and Utah opposed the plan, arguing it deprived their states of job opportunities recommended by the 1995 base closure commission. President Clinton faced opposition for supporting privatization plans at McClellan and Kelly air force bases, with some Members resenting his intervention from 1995. Congressional opponents cited his actions as a reason for opposing new base closure rounds. The House military readiness subcommittee approved an amendment to block DOD from privatizing depot maintenance work at McClellan and Kelly air force bases unless other depots were operating at 80% capacity. The full House National Security Committee and Senate Armed Services Committee also approved similar depot language. On June 16, depot language was approved by the Senate Armed Services Committee. However, depot-related provisions were removed from the DOD authorization bill due to a threatened filibuster by Senators from California and Texas. Representative Terry Everett's attempt to delete depot-related restrictions in the House defense authorization bill was defeated. Senator Inhofe tried to restore depot restrictions in the Senate bill but withdrew the amendment before floor consideration on July 11. Senator Inhofe led an effort to restore depot restrictions in the Senate bill but withdrew the amendment before floor consideration. The depot-related language in the House bill became a major obstacle in reaching a final agreement on the FY1998 defense authorization bill. As of early October, it was the only remaining issue to be resolved, with neither side willing to yield. One side threatened filibuster and/or veto if public-private depot competition at McClellan and Kelly air force bases were not allowed to proceed, while the other side insisted on language prohibiting depot. A resolution was achieved by Senate and House conferees on October 23 (H.Rept.105-340) regarding depot competition at McClellan and Kelly air force bases. The compromise agreement increased the limit on depot work by private contractors from 40% to 50%, but also broadened the definition of \"core work\" that must be done by government depots to offset the benefits to private contractors. The House passed the conference report on October 28 by a vote of 286 to 123. The House passed the conference report on October 28 by a vote of 286 to 123, and the Senate reached final agreement on November 6, passing the conference report by a vote of 90 to 10. President Clinton signed the bill into law on November 18 (P.L. 105-85), which included language prohibiting certain actions in the FY1998 defense authorization act. In FY1998, Congress passed a defense authorization act with language prohibiting DOD from planning new base closures until a report on costs and savings from previous closures was submitted. The report was due by January-February 1999. The Department of Defense submitted its report to Congress on base closures well ahead of the deadline set for the President's budget submission in FY2000. Secretary of Defense Cohen emphasized the need for new legislation, stating that the current base structure was 23% in excess and that savings from closures would fund modernization and readiness. He highlighted the 40% decrease in the defense budget. The Secretary of Defense emphasized the need for new legislation to address the 23% excess in the current base structure. He highlighted the significant imbalance between force and base structures, with planned reductions in Navy ships and Army soldiers compared to classroom and berthing space. The base closure report provided requested information to Congress on closure costs. The base closure report claimed that closure costs were lower than the Pentagon's original estimate for the 1988 and 1993 rounds. It projected savings exceeding initial estimates from the shutdown of bases during the 1988-1995 rounds, with expected total savings of $14 billion through 2001 and annual savings of $5.6 billion thereafter. The base closure report projected total savings of $14 billion through 2001 and annual savings of $5.6 billion thereafter. The Pentagon expected additional savings of about $3 billion a year from the 2001 and 2005 closure rounds. The report recommended applying the model of previous independent base closure commissions for the proposed rounds. The base closure report recommended applying the model of previous independent base closure commissions for the proposed rounds in 2001 and 2005. A subsequent Air Force memo added controversy by mentioning White House deputy chief of staff John D. Podesta's involvement in encouraging Lockheed Martin Corporation to pursue depot maintenance work at McClellan Air Force Base. Members were opposed to keeping depot maintenance work at both McClellan AFB and Kelly. Members adamantly opposed keeping depot maintenance work at McClellan and Kelly AFBs, accusing the Administration of meddling in the base closure process. Capitol Hill reacted strongly to the report's call for new base closure rounds, with widespread resistance from the House National Security Committee. The House National Security Committee and the Senate Armed Services Committee faced strong opposition to new base closure rounds. The Senate committee narrowly rejected a proposal for closures in 2001. Senators McCain and Levin were prepared to seek support for a floor amendment. Senator Carl Levin and other sponsors of new BRAC legislation were prepared to seek support for a floor amendment during Senate consideration of the FY1999 defense authorization bill. However, they abandoned their initiative as the majority sentiment was against them. The Senate voted 48-45 in support of an amendment that would have made it harder for the Pentagon to proceed with base closings. Amendment No. 2981, sponsored by Senator James Inhofe, aimed to hinder the Pentagon from closing bases with 225 or more civilian personnel and from realigning bases with 750 or more civilian personnel. It also aimed to delay base closures for four years after a realignment. The Inhofe amendment aimed to delay base closures by reducing civilian personnel numbers and expressed opposition to new closure rounds until previous actions were completed. It was dropped from the FY1999 defense authorization bill during conference. The Congressional Budget Office reviewed DOD's base realignment and closure report on July 1, 1998, stating it provided most, but not all, required information. The Budget Office reviewed DOD's base realignment and closure report on July 1, 1998. It found DOD's estimates of savings consistent with its own estimates, but explained that firm measures of BRAC savings requested by Congress do not exist as they are avoided costs, not actual expenditures. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) reviewed the Department of Defense's (DOD) report on base realignment and closure (BRAC) actions. DOD can only estimate savings from avoided costs, not measure them directly. CBO noted DOD's clear summary of potential savings from future BRAC rounds but criticized the lack of analysis on data and potential closures. The impact of future base closures on local communities was deemed difficult to predict. The CBO found that future base closures' impact on local communities is hard to predict. DOD was unable to provide some requested data, including original cost and savings estimates for BRAC commissions. GAO reviewed DOD's report on November 13, 1998. The General Accounting Office reviewed DOD's report on the BRAC closure rounds, giving generally good grades and affirming substantial net savings. However, it noted that DOD's report provided a rough approximation of costs and savings, with data systems not capturing all savings and lacking a separate system to track BRAC savings. The General Accounting Office reviewed DOD's report on BRAC closure rounds, noting that DOD's data systems do not capture all savings associated with BRAC actions. DOD's analysis shows no long-term problems related to military capabilities due to BRAC actions, and communities affected by prior BRAC actions are rebounding economically. Some communities are faring better than others. Proposed BRAC rounds in 2001 and 2005 were also mentioned. DOD's report on BRAC closure rounds shows that communities affected by prior actions are rebounding economically. Proposed BRAC rounds in 2001 and 2005 would be conducted similarly to prior rounds. DOD's legislative proposal for two additional BRAC rounds could serve as a basis for future legislation. Congress faced the decision of authorizing a new round of base closings at the start of the 106th Congress. Senator John McCain and Senator Carl Levin sponsored a bill calling for two new rounds of base closings in 2001 and 2003. Senator McCain highlighted the 23% excess capacity in DOD infrastructure and emphasized the potential billions of dollars in savings from closing and realigning bases. Senator John McCain and Senator Carl Levin sponsored a bill for two new rounds of base closings in 2001 and 2003, emphasizing the potential savings from closing and realigning bases. The proposed changes included starting and finishing the BRAC selection process two months later in 2001 and prohibiting privatization-in-place without explicit recommendation from the base closure commission. Secretary of Defense William Cohen also advocated for further base closures. Secretary of Defense William Cohen emphasized the importance of further base closures to improve efficiency and save money. He stated that wasteful spending on unneeded facilities was hindering military readiness and quality of life for service members. Cohen advocated for two additional rounds of base closures, projecting a savings of $20 billion during implementation and generating $3 billion. Despite appeals for two additional closure rounds to save $20 billion during implementation and generate $3 billion annually, many Members of Congress opposed the idea due to widespread fear among constituents. Secretary of Defense Cohen's call for more closure rounds received a cool response from the House Armed Services Committee, and the Senate Armed Services Committee voted against it. The Senate Armed Services Committee rejected Defense Cohen's call for two more closure rounds, with the full Senate also voting against it. This marked the third consecutive year that attempts to close more bases were blocked, with strong opposition in the House as well. The Senate and House blocked DOD's attempt to close more military bases, despite the Administration's push for it in the FY2000 DOD budget proposal. Defense Secretary Cohen emphasized the need for improvements in the base closing process to gain Congress's support. In an effort to win Congress's support, Secretary of Defense Cohen highlighted the need to improve the base closing process due to bureaucratic obstacles. He argued that not closing more bases could cost the Pentagon $20 billion that could be used for weapon systems and enhancing U.S. military capabilities. Despite this, Congress did not authorize any new base closure rounds in 2000. In 2000, Congress did not authorize new base closure rounds despite efforts by Secretary of Defense Cohen to improve the process. A proposed amendment for two new rounds in 2003 and 2005 was rejected in a Senate vote. In the early stages of the 107th Congress, DOD aimed to secure authority for additional military base closures and realignments. Senators Levin and McCain introduced bill S. 397 for new closure rounds in 2003 and 2005. Taxpayers for Common Sense supported the initiative, estimating savings of up to $21 billion by 2015 from closing excess bases costing $3.6 billion annually. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison disagreed with the idea of closing more domestic military bases prematurely, citing increasing restrictions on U.S. military training in locations abroad. She highlighted concerns about decisions made by the BRAC, such as those affecting Reese Air Force Base, TX, and Fort Hood, TX. On June 27, 2001, the Department of Defense urged Congress to approve another round of base closures and realignments due to excess capacity of approximately 25%. The Pentagon proposed a single round of base closings and consolidations starting in 2003, replacing the term \"BRAC\" with a new title. The Pentagon proposed a new round of base closings and consolidations starting in 2003, replacing the term \"BRAC\" with the \"Efficient Facilities Initiative of 2001 (EFI).\" It introduced a new approach based on the experience of Brooks Air Force Base in San Antonio, TX, where property was transferred to the local community and leased back to the base commander. The Senate Armed Services Committee recommended a new round of base closures and realignments in 2003, with a vote of 17 to 8 in favor. The full Senate approved the proposal by a margin of 53 to 47 on September 25, 2001, despite an attempt to shelve it by Senator Jim Bunning. In 2001, the full Senate approved a new round of base closures and realignments in 2003 by a margin of 53 to 47, marking the first success in five years of effort. General Henry H. Shelton and Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld emphasized the need to convert excess capacity into war-fighting ability due to the current struggle with terrorist groups. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld emphasized the need to convert excess capacity into war-fighting ability in the current struggle with terrorist groups. Opponents argued that the timing of closing bases during the war on terrorism and uncertain economy was not ideal. Supporters highlighted the importance of prioritizing military resources over home-state interests. Supporters of the initiative stressed the need to prioritize military resources over home-state interests in combating terrorism. Senator John McCain urged trust in military leadership. The House opposed base-closing language in the defense bill, vowing to stand firm in conference. In a stalemate over base closures, the House and Senate leaders held firm on their positions, delaying the passage of S. 1438. Senator John McCain warned of a potential veto by the President if no compromise was reached. A compromise was finally agreed upon on December 10, 2001, and the defense authorization bill was signed into law on December 28, 2001. The defense authorization bill (P.L. 107-107) was signed into law on December 28, 2001, after a compromise was reached on December 10, 2001. The bill extends the authority of the 1990 base closure and realignment act to authorize a new round in 2005. The Secretary of Defense is required to submit force structure plans and review all types of installations. The defense authorization bill (P.L. 107-107) extends the authority for a new round of base closure and realignment in 2005. The Secretary of Defense must submit a revised force structure plan with the FY2006 budget, review all types of installations, and certify the need for closure and realignment with annual net savings within six years. The defense authorization bill extends the authority for a new round of base closure and realignment in 2005. The Secretary of Defense must certify the need for closure and realignment with annual net savings within six years. The commission's recommendations for closing or realigning military installations must prioritize military value. The commission's membership is increased to 9 members, and the Secretary of Defense can testify on proposed base additions. Privatization-in-place of closed or realigned bases is prohibited. In 1997, the Department of Defense announced the need for two more base closure rounds in 1999 and 2001 to reduce excess infrastructure. Despite appeals by Secretary of Defense Cohen and Rumsfeld, the proposal was met with little enthusiasm from Congress. In 2001, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld successfully gained approval from Congress for a new round of base closures in 2005. Communities near military bases are concerned about the future of their installations and are implementing defensive and offensive strategies to retain or acquire military units/functions. Community leaders near military bases are working to retain their units/functions and are open to acquiring units from other areas to ensure the base's survival. They are concerned about \"range encroachment\" impacting base desirability to the Department of Defense or the BRAC commission. If range encroachment continues, military bases may lose value and be at risk of closure in 2005. The 2005 BRAC timeline outlines the process for base closure nominations and approval. If nominations are not sent by the required date, the process is terminated. The President prepares a report for approval or disapproval, and Congress has 45 days to pass a motion of disapproval. Otherwise, the Commission's list becomes law."
