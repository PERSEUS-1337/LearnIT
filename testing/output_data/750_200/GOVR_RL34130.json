Interest in renewable energy has since increased due to rising petroleum prices. Since the 2002 farm bill, interest in renewable energy has grown rapidly, driven by rising petroleum prices and increased biofuels production. Agriculture-based biofuels are seen as a way to boost rural economies and reduce energy import dependence. Federal support for biofuels includes tax incentives, loans, grants, and regulatory programs. The 2008 farm bill, following the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, further supported renewable energy initiatives. The 2008 farm bill, following the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, reflects the increased role for biofuels mandated by the expansion of the renewable fuels standard. EISA includes a significant expansion of the overall RFS to 36 billion gallons by 2022, with carve-outs for biodiesel and cellulosic ethanol. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 mandates an expansion of the renewable fuels standard to 36 billion gallons by 2022, with specific targets for biodiesel and cellulosic ethanol. Concerns about economic and environmental issues related to corn starch-based ethanol have led to an emphasis on cellulosic ethanol. Escalating commodity prices and high energy costs have resulted in increased competition between ethanol and petroleum in the marketplace, with ethanol production using nearly 40% of U.S. corn production in 2010. In 2010, ethanol production used nearly 40% of U.S. corn production, leading to a decrease in corn stocks and an increase in prices. Ethanol's profitability is influenced by both petroleum and corn prices, with rising petroleum prices driving up demand for ethanol and corn. The \"food versus fuel\" debate intensified during the 2008 farm bill debate due to food price inflation, highlighting potential issues with replacing gasoline with ethanol. The farm bill debate highlighted concerns about food price inflation and the challenges of replacing gasoline with corn-based ethanol. Federal programs supporting renewable energy production, like the RFS, originated outside the U.S. Department of Agriculture's purview. The inclusion of biofuels in the national fuel supply began with the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and was expanded in EISA. Federal tax credits for biofuel blenders were first included in the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 and later extended in the Tax Relief Act of 2010. The 2008 farm bill significantly increased programs to support biofuels production and use. The 2008 farm bill includes a distinct energy title (Title IX) focusing on biofuels, such as corn starch-based ethanol, cellulosic ethanol, and biodiesel. It maintains the structure of Title IX from the Senate-passed version and contains 13 new provisions in section 9001. The 2008 farm bill's Title IX includes 13 new provisions related to biofuels, such as cellulosic ethanol production tax credit and promotion of feedstocks production and refinery development. Sections 9002 and 9003 focus on studies and reports on biofuels infrastructure and renewable fertilizer. See the Appendix for a comparison of the energy provisions with the 2002 farm bill. The 2008 farm bill includes provisions for ethanol production tax credit, promotion of cellulosic feedstocks, biofuels research grants, loan guarantees, and incentives for cellulosic ethanol feedstock production. It also covers studies on biofuels market and environmental impacts, federal procurement of bio-based products, rural energy efficiency support, and bio-products certification program expansion. The 2008 farm bill energy title includes provisions for bio-based products certification, rural energy efficiency support, biofuels research programs, biodiesel education, and financial incentives for advanced biofuels production. The 2008 farm bill provides $1 billion in financial incentives and support for the production of advanced biofuels, mainly cellulosic. Grants and loan guarantees help leverage industry investments in new technologies, infrastructure, and cellulosic feedstocks. Programs like BCAP and the Biorefinery Assistance program support the production and refining of advanced biofuels. The Biorefinery Assistance program (Section 9001) provides grants and loans for commercial-scale refineries to produce advanced biofuels like cellulosic ethanol. Increased funding for advanced biofuels research is supported by programs like the Agricultural Bioenergy Feedstock and Energy Efficiency Research and Extension Initiative (Section 7207) and the Sun Grant Program (Section 7526). Cellulosic ethanol is produced from cellulose, hemicellulose, or lignin derived from plants, including prairie grasses, fast-growing woody crops, and waste biomass materials. These feedstocks offer long-term supply potential for advanced biofuels. Cellulosic ethanol is derived from various plant sources, including prairie grasses and agricultural residues. Despite its environmental benefits, commercial production remains limited, with only a few small refineries starting production in 2010. The slow progress has led the EPA to reduce cellulosic biofuel mandates set by Congress for the years 2010 through 2012. The EPA has reduced cellulosic biofuel mandates set by Congress for 2010-2012 due to limited production. The 2008 farm bill includes provisions for tax credits on ethanol, with a producer tax credit of $1.01 per gallon for cellulosic ethanol. The producer tax credit for cellulosic ethanol is $1.01 per gallon, aimed at boosting investment in production. The ethanol blender tax credit was reduced to $0.45 per gallon in 2009. The ethanol import tariff of $0.54 per gallon was extended to 2010 to protect the U.S. ethanol industry. The ethanol import tariff of $0.54 per gallon was extended by the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 to protect the U.S. ethanol industry. The ethanol blender tax credit and import tariff, set to expire in 2010, were extended by H.R. 4853 until the end of 2011. The tariff exceeds the blender tax credit by nine cents, imposing a punitive duty on imported ethanol. The impact of increased ethanol production on agricultural and rural economies is being assessed through required reports in the farm bill. The farm bill includes provisions for reports on the impact of ethanol production on the farm economy, environment, and food prices. Studies such as the Comprehensive Study of Biofuels and Biofuels Infrastructure Study will be conducted by various government agencies. The Biomass Crop Assistance Program also requires an assessment of expanded cellulosic biomass production on local economies. The 2008 farm bill authorizes over $1 billion in mandatory funding for biorefinery expansion and conversion, including $320 million to the Biorefinery Assistance Program, $300 million to the Bioenergy Program for Advanced Biofuels, $255 million to the Rural Energy for America Program (REAP), and $118 million for other programs. The 2008 farm bill authorizes over $1.7 billion in discretionary funding for energy-related provisions, with significant allocations to various programs such as the Biorefinery Assistance Program, Bioenergy Program for Advanced Biofuels, Rural Energy for America Program (REAP), Biomass Research and Development Act (BRDA), and potentially unlimited funding for the Biomass Crop Assistance Program (BCAP). The 2008 farm bill authorizes over $1.7 billion in discretionary funding for energy-related provisions, with significant allocations to programs like the Biorefinery Assistance Program, Bioenergy Program for Advanced Biofuels, Rural Energy for America Program (REAP), Biomass Research and Development Act (BRDA), and potentially unlimited funding for the Biomass Crop Assistance Program (BCAP). The increase in funding is mainly for the Biorefinery Assistance Program, funded through USDA's Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC). Mandatory funding is set unless Congress decides otherwise through the appropriations process. The research title includes selected energy programs for FY2010-FY2012 with mandatory and discretionary funding levels authorized in the 2008 farm bill and approved by Congress."
