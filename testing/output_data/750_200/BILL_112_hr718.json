    "content": "The \"Huntington's Disease Parity Act of 2011\" may be cited as the short title. Huntington's Disease is a progressive neurological disease causing physical and mental deterioration in 30,000 individuals in the US, with 200,000 more at risk. There is no effective treatment to slow its progression, with clinical indicators including loss of movement control and cognitive decline. Adult-onset Huntington's Disease typically presents symptoms in individuals aged 30-50, including loss of movement control, cognitive decline, memory loss, personality changes, irritability, mood swings, anxiety, and depression. Late-onset Huntington's Disease is also characterized by similar symptoms. Late-onset Huntington's Disease is characterized by symptoms developing after 50 years of age, with a milder course. Juvenile Huntington's Disease affects those under 19 years old and progresses rapidly. Due to the debilitating nature of the disease, individuals, even in early stages, are unable to work and rely on Social Security Disability Insurance. Despite advances in medicine, the Social Security Administration has not updated its rules for evaluating neurological disabilities since 1985. The term \"Huntington's Chorea\" used by the administration is outdated and inaccurate, failing to acknowledge the behavioral and cognitive impact of Huntington's Disease. Many individuals with the disease rely solely on Social Security Disability Insurance as they are unable to retain employment. Individuals with Huntington's Disease face challenges with Social Security Disability Insurance and Medicare benefits due to outdated terminology and eligibility requirements. Despite qualifying for disability insurance, they must wait 24 months for Medicare benefits, often becoming incapacitated before reaching the age requirement of 65. In 2000, the Centers for Medicaid & Medicare Services waived the 24-month waiting period requirement for individuals disabled by ALS, a condition similar to Huntington's Disease. The outdated Social Security Disability Insurance guidelines for Huntington's Disease pose challenges due to cognitive, behavioral, and physical incapacitation. Insurance guidelines for Huntington's Disease need revision due to the significant cognitive, behavioral, and physical incapacitation faced by individuals with this disease. There is an urgent need to update the medical and evaluation criteria used by the Social Security Administration to determine disability status. Additionally, the 24-month waiting period for Medicare coverage should be removed for individuals with Huntington's Disease, similar to the exemption for those with ALS. The medical and evaluation criteria for evaluating disability caused by adult-onset and juvenile Huntington's Disease need revision. The Commissioner of Social Security will amend the Listing of Impairments to include criteria for evaluating disability caused by Adult-Onset and Juvenile Huntington's Disease in consultation with medical experts. The Commissioner of Social Security will amend the Listing of Impairments to include criteria for evaluating disability caused by Huntington's Disease in adults and children. This includes providing medical and evaluation criteria for Huntington's Disease and Juvenile Huntington's Disease. The Commissioner of Social Security will amend the Listing of Impairments to include criteria for evaluating disability caused by Huntington's Disease in adults and children, including Juvenile Huntington's Disease. This involves providing medical and evaluation criteria for Juvenile Huntington's Disease. The term \"Listing of Impairments\" refers to appendix 1 to subpart P of part 404 of title 20 of the Code of Federal Regulations. The Social Security Act is amended to waive the 24-month waiting period for Medicare coverage for individuals diagnosed with Huntington's Disease. This change applies to benefits under title XVIII of the Social Security Act for items and services provided after the enactment of this Act."
