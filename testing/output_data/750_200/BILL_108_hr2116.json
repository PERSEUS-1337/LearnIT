The Tar Creek Superfund Site in Ottawa County, Oklahoma, was a lead and zinc mining area from the early 1900s to the 1970s. It is part of the Tri-State Mining District and is prone to flooding due to its location. Mining companies had to pump water from the Boone Aquifer. Mining at the Tar Creek Superfund Site in Ottawa County, Oklahoma, lasted until the 1970s. Companies had to pump water from the Boone Aquifer due to water in the ore. Much of the mining was on Indian land controlled by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. During World War I, mining at the Site supplied over 45% of the Nation's lead and zinc. This mining activity generated millions of tons of waste tailings. In 1923, the Department of the Interior made recommendations regarding the site. During World War II, the Department of the Interior recommended stockpiling chat waste aboveground at the Tar Creek Superfund Site for later reprocessing. In 1960, Congress passed a law to boost lead and zinc production at the site as mining declined in the early 1970s. The Zinc Mining Stabilization Act aimed to increase lead and zinc production at the Site. By the early 1970s, water from the Boone Aquifer began filling the underground mine workings, leading to the formation of acid mine water. In 1979, acid mine water started discharging at the surface, and by 1983, the Site was placed on the National Priorities List. In 1984, the Environmental Protection Agency took action. In 1983, the Site was listed on the National Priorities List for acid mine water remediation efforts by the Environmental Protection Agency. Despite millions spent, it was deemed nearly impossible to remediate the water due to numerous open mine shafts and boreholes on the site. The open mine shafts contribute to recharging the underground mine workings. The Site has over 100,000 boreholes and open mine shafts that recharge underground workings. Millions of tons of chat with toxic heavy metals scar the surface area, contributing to flood problems in the surrounding communities. The stockpiled chat also stores water that recharges the underground mine workings. The stockpiled chat at the Site has been used in construction, contaminating residential areas with heavy metals like lead. The Environmental Protection Agency started remediation work in 1994 to address unsafe lead levels in residential yards. Scientific studies show elevated blood lead levels in children at the Site, causing learning disabilities and health issues. Dust from stockpiled chat poses a health risk. Mining left underground cavities leading to repeated cave-ins at the Site. Repeated cave-ins, some over 100 feet in diameter, have occurred at the Site, including in populated areas and near schools. No remediation efforts have been made by the US Government to address the dangers of stockpiled chat or subsidence. There have been no comprehensive epidemiological studies conducted at the Site, which due to its unique environmental problems, can never be safe for human habitation. No remediation efforts have been made by the US Government to address the dangers of stockpiled chat or subsidence at the Site. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency will provide assistance under the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 to residents in the 17 square mile area identified in Governor Keating's Tar Creek Superfund Task Force Final Report. This includes the communities of Picher and Cardin on the Tar Creek Superfund site in Oklahoma. The EPA will be considered the displacing agency for the application of the Act. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency will work with other officials to address environmental and health issues at the Tar Creek Superfund site, without relieving any agency of their cleanup responsibilities under the law."
