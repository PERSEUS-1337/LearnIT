    "content": "More than 53,000 commercial vessels travel the world's waters, regulated by international protocols and U.S. laws to prevent pollution and protect marine resources. However, there are gaps in regulations, enforcement, and concerns about environmental impacts. The maritime industry, including the cruise industry, faces gaps in regulations, enforcement, and environmental concerns. Cruise ships make up about 13% of the world shipping fleet and are a significant contributor to the U.S. economy, providing $40 billion in benefits in 2009. The cruise industry is a growing contributor to the U.S. economy, providing $40 billion in benefits in 2009 and creating over 357,000 U.S. jobs. The number of cruise passengers worldwide has been increasing at an average annual growth rate of 7.4% since 1990, with an estimated 14.3 million passengers in 2010. The worldwide cruise ship fleet consists of over 230 ships, with the majority being foreign-flagged, particularly from Liberia and Panama. Foreign-flag cruise vessels owned by six companies make up nearly 95% of passenger ships operating in U.S. waters. The cruise industry is growing, with Liberia and Panama being popular flag countries. Foreign-flag cruise vessels owned by six companies make up 95% of ships in U.S. waters. Ships are getting bigger and more luxurious, with an average size increase of 90 feet every five years. The industry aims to show that cruising is safe for passengers and tourist communities. Cruise ships, often compared to \"floating cities,\" generate large amounts of waste during voyages. A typical one-week trip with 3,000 passengers and crew produces 210,000 gallons of sewage, 1 million gallons of graywater, 130 gallons of hazardous wastes, 8 tons of solid waste, and 25,000 gallons of other waste. The industry is focused on demonstrating the safety and health of cruising for passengers and visited communities. Environmental advocates have raised concerns about the risks posed by the large amounts of waste generated by cruise ships, including sewage, graywater, hazardous wastes, solid waste, and oily bilge water. Enforcement of existing laws for managing these wastes is considered weak, with a 2000 GAO report highlighting numerous cases of illegal discharges by foreign-flag cruise ships between 1993 and 1998. Between 1993 and 1998, foreign-flag cruise ships were involved in 87 confirmed illegal discharge cases in U.S. waters, with 83% of cases involving oil or oil-based products. 72% of the illegal discharges were accidental, 15% intentional, and 13% undetermined. The GAO found that 72% of illegal discharges from foreign-flag ships in U.S. waters were accidental, 15% intentional, and 13% undetermined. Cruise ships accounted for 4% of these cases, with some leading to criminal prosecutions and hefty fines. In 2000, a coalition of environmental groups petitioned the EPA to address pollution from cruise ships. EPA agreed to study cruise ship discharges and issued recommendations for further assessment. In December 2008, the agency released a cruise ship discharge assessment. In December 2008, the EPA released a report on cruise ship waste streams and findings from data collection activities, focusing on pollution issues and potential solutions. The report discusses the various waste streams and contaminants generated by cruise ships, as well as the complex legal framework governing pollution from these ships. It highlights the different laws that apply to different types of waste, both internationally and domestically. Additionally, it mentions legislative activities in Alaska and other states, and notes that cruise companies have implemented waste management plans to improve their environmental practices. Cruise ship companies have implemented waste management plans to prevent illegal waste discharges and improve environmental operations. Environmental groups have pushed for stricter regulations on cruise ship waste, endorsing legislation in Congress. No legislative action has been taken on proposed bills to control wastewater and other discharges from cruise ships. Cruise ships generate various waste streams that can harm the marine environment if not properly treated and disposed of. These waste streams include sewage, graywater, hazardous wastes, oily bilge water, ballast water, and solid waste, as well as air pollutants. Proper management of these discharges is crucial to prevent threats to human health and aquatic life. Cruise ships produce various waste streams that can harm the marine environment and threaten human health. While they represent a small portion of the shipping industry, the large volumes of sewage, graywater, and solid waste they generate are of particular concern due to the number of passengers and crew they carry. Additionally, their concentrated activities in specific coastal areas can exacerbate these environmental impacts. Cruise ships, especially those frequenting specific coastal areas like Florida, California, and Alaska, produce large volumes of harmful blackwater sewage containing bacteria, viruses, and nutrients. Discharges of untreated sewage can contaminate fisheries and shellfish. Cruise ships generate significant amounts of sewage, including blackwater containing bacteria, viruses, and nutrients. This untreated sewage can contaminate fisheries and shellfish beds, posing risks to public health. Additionally, the sewage can lead to excessive algal growth, oxygen depletion in the water, and harm aquatic life. Graywater from various ship activities also contributes to wastewater pollution. Cruise ships generate significant amounts of sewage, including blackwater and graywater. Graywater can contain various pollutants such as fecal coliform bacteria, detergents, oil, grease, metals, and nutrients. Sampling by EPA and Alaska found untreated graywater from cruise ships can have high levels of pollutants, including fecal coliform bacteria. Cruise ships generate high levels of fecal coliform bacteria in graywater, which can cause adverse environmental effects due to concentrations of nutrients. Graywater is the largest source of liquid waste on cruise ships, while solid waste includes glass, paper, cardboard, aluminum, steel cans, and plastics. Solid waste generated by cruise ships includes glass, paper, cardboard, aluminum, steel cans, and plastics, which can be hazardous. When solid waste enters the ocean, it can become marine debris, posing a threat to marine life and coastal communities. Cruise ships manage solid waste through source reduction, waste minimization, and recycling, but up to 75% is incinerated on board, with the ash often discharged at sea. On cruise ships, 75% of solid waste is incinerated onboard, with some ash discharged at sea. This waste includes plastics and other materials that can harm marine life. Each passenger generates two pounds of non-hazardous waste daily, totaling 8 tons on a large ship during a one-week cruise. Cruise ships generate a significant amount of solid waste, with about 8 tons produced during a one-week cruise. 24% of the solid waste from vessels worldwide comes from cruise ships, which often treat garbage on board before discharge. However, hazardous wastes are also produced from various onboard activities, putting a strain on port reception facilities. Cruise ships produce hazardous wastes from activities like photo processing, dry-cleaning, and equipment cleaning. These wastes include chemicals, medical waste, batteries, fluorescent lights, and paints. The materials contain substances like hydrocarbons, heavy metals, and solvents. Although the quantities are small, the toxicity is a concern. Hazardous waste generated on cruise ships includes vapor light bulbs, batteries, and pharmaceuticals. The toxicity of these wastes to marine organisms is significant. Oil leaks from engine spaces mix with water in the bilge, posing threats to fish, wildlife, and human health. Oil and byproducts from petroleum breakdown can harm marine life and human health. Even small amounts of oil can be lethal to fish. Bilge water on ships contains pollutants like oil, chemicals, detergents, and degreasers, which are toxic to marine organisms. Large vessels may also have waste streams with sludge and oily water mixtures that can contaminate the environment. Large vessels, like cruise ships, generate significant amounts of oily bilge water that needs to be extracted and treated before discharge. The extracted oil can be reused, incinerated, or off-loaded in port to prevent environmental contamination. The extracted oil from bilge water on large vessels like cruise ships can be reused, incinerated, or off-loaded in port to prevent environmental contamination. If a separator is faulty or bypassed, untreated oily bilge water could harm marine life when discharged into the ocean, leading to environmental violations for cruise lines. Ballast water is also used to stabilize vessels during transport. Cruise ships, tankers, and cargo carriers use ballast water to stabilize vessels during transport. This water is taken on in coastal waters and discharged at the next port of call to compensate for changes in weight. However, the discharge often contains biological materials. Ballast water discharge from ships contains biological materials, including non-native species that can harm aquatic ecosystems and industries. The economic cost of introducing pest mollusks to U.S. aquatic ecosystems is about $2.2 billion per year, impacting industries such as water and power utilities, fisheries, agriculture, and tourism. Further study is needed to determine the role of cruise ships in introducing non-native species. Cruise ships contribute to air pollution through diesel engines burning high sulfur content fuel. Air pollution from cruise ships is caused by diesel engines burning high sulfur fuel, emitting sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, particulate matter, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and hydrocarbons. EPA classifies diesel exhaust as a likely human carcinogen. Marine diesel engine emissions contribute to unhealthy air, failure to meet air quality standards, visibility degradation, haze, acid deposition, and water pollution. Ocean-going vessels account for significant nitrogen oxide, particulate, and sulfur emissions. Ocean-going vessels contribute significantly to air pollution, emitting nitrogen oxides, particulates, and sulfur dioxide. EPA estimates that these vessels account for a large portion of mobile source emissions in the United States, with emissions expected to increase as other sources are controlled. International shipping also contributes to global carbon dioxide emissions and emits black carbon and nitrogen oxides, which impact climate change. Shipping, including maritime vessels, contributes to global carbon dioxide emissions, black carbon, and nitrogen oxides, impacting climate change. States and localities are assessing the environmental impact of commercial marine vessels on regional air quality. Vessel emissions at sea can affect areas far inland. Cruise ship emissions, although a small fraction of the shipping fleet, may have significant effects. Cruise ship emissions, although a small fraction of the shipping fleet, may have significant impacts on local coastal areas. Shipboard incinerators burn large volumes of waste, producing ash that must be disposed of and may release toxic emissions. Various waste streams on cruise ships are regulated by international protocols and U.S. laws, but there is no single law governing all aspects. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) sets international maritime vessel safety and marine pollution standards, with representatives from major maritime nations, including the United States. They implement the 1973 International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, known as MARPOL 73/78. The IMO implements MARPOL 73/78, which sets pollution prevention standards for cruise ships flagged under signatory countries. Member nations are responsible for vessels registered under their nationalities. The Convention's six Annexes cover pollution sources, but require ratification and implementation by sovereign states for effective protection of the marine environment. The MARPOL 73/78 Convention sets pollution prevention standards for cruise ships under signatory countries. Annexes I-VI cover regulations for preventing pollution by oil, noxious liquid substances, harmful substances, sewage, and garbage disposal. MARPOL Annexes I-VI set pollution prevention standards for cruise ships, covering regulations for oil, noxious liquid substances, harmful substances, sewage, and garbage disposal. Annex VI limits emissions from marine vessels and prohibits deliberate emissions of ozone-depleting substances. Compliance with the Annexes is voluntary and requires ratification by member countries representing at least 50% of the world's gross tonnage. Amendments can be proposed by ratified parties, with specified procedures and timelines for adoption. The United States has ratified Annexes I, II, III, V, and VI of MARPOL, but has not taken action regarding Annex IV. The flag state of a ship is responsible for certifying compliance with MARPOL's pollution prevention standards. IMO has established various conventions, including those addressing ballast water management. The United States has ratified Annexes I, II, III, V, and VI of MARPOL, with the flag state certifying compliance. IMO conventions cover ballast water management and safety measures. Each nation enacts laws to implement and comply with the conventions. In the US, the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships enforces MARPOL provisions. The United States has ratified Annexes I, II, III, V, and VI of MARPOL, with the flag state certifying compliance. In April 2006, the Senate ratified Annex VI, which regulates air pollution. In July 2008, Congress approved legislation to implement Annex VI standards through EPA regulations in consultation with the U.S. Coast Guard. Amendments to Annex VI were made through international negotiations. The United States ratified Annexes I, II, III, V, and VI of MARPOL, with the flag state certifying compliance. In April 2006, the Senate ratified Annex VI, regulating air pollution. Congress approved legislation in July 2008 to implement Annex VI standards through EPA regulations in consultation with the U.S. Coast Guard. The legislation applies to all U.S.-flagged and foreign-flagged vessels in U.S. waters. The Coast Guard enforces regulations to implement MARPOL separately from other environmental laws. The regulatory mechanism in APPS for implementing MARPOL is separate from other federal environmental laws. Implementing MARPOL is challenging due to the international nature of maritime shipping. The United States can enforce its laws against foreign-flagged ships for pollution discharge incidents within its jurisdiction. Enforcement actions can be taken even if incidents occur outside U.S. jurisdiction. The United States enforces laws against foreign-flagged ships for pollution discharge incidents within its jurisdiction. Coordination is required between the Coast Guard, State Department, and flag states. Response rate from flag states has been poor. Multiple federal agencies have jurisdiction over cruise ships in U.S. waters, but no single agency coordinates all relevant functions. Several federal agencies, including the U.S. Coast Guard, EPA, Department of Justice, and Department of State, have regulatory responsibilities over cruise ships in U.S. waters. The Department of State represents the U.S. at international meetings and enforces foreign-flag violations. NOAA collaborates with the Coast Guard and EPA to assess environmental impacts. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) have limited roles in reporting on marine debris and ensuring quarantine inspection of food-contaminated garbage. States and localities also have responsibilities. U.S. laws and regulations, such as the Clean Water Act, apply to cruise ship discharges. The Clean Water Act (CWA) is the main U.S. law regulating polluting activity in water bodies. The National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) program controls pollutant discharges, including those from vessels like cruise ships. Sewage discharges from cruise ships are exempt from the definition of pollutants under the CWA. Section 312 of the Clean Water Act prohibits untreated or inadequately treated sewage discharge from vessels, including cruise ships, within 3 miles of shore. This regulation is enforced by the EPA and Coast Guard, requiring marine sanitation devices on commercial and recreational vessels with installed toilets. Under Section 312 of the Clean Water Act, vessels with installed toilets must have marine sanitation devices (MSDs) to prevent untreated sewage discharge. EPA sets performance standards for MSDs, while the Coast Guard regulates MSD design and operation, certifying compliance with EPA rules. MSDs can either hold sewage for shore disposal or treat it before discharge. Beyond 3 miles, raw sewage can be discharged, with Coast Guard regulations covering Type II and Type III MSDs for large vessels like cruise ships. Type II and Type III MSDs on large vessels like cruise ships treat or store waste before discharge. Type II MSDs treat waste chemically or biologically to meet specific limits, while Type III MSDs store waste for later disposal onshore or outside U.S. waters. Type I MSDs disinfect raw sewage with chemicals before discharge, meeting performance standards for fecal coliform bacteria. Type I MSDs use chemicals to disinfect raw sewage before discharge, meeting performance standards for fecal coliform bacteria. These MSDs are typically found on recreational vessels or those under 65 feet in length. Regulations for Type I MSDs have not been updated since 1976 and do not require monitoring or reporting of effluent discharges. Critics highlight deficiencies in the regulatory structure, especially for cruise ships and large vessels, as the regulations only cover bacterial contaminants and suspended solids. The MSD regulations only cover bacterial contaminants and suspended solids, while the NPDES permit program for other point sources regulates a wider range of pollutants. NPDES permits require compliance with sampling, monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting, unlike the MSD rules. The Coast Guard has been criticized for poor enforcement of Section 312 requirements for cruise ships and other vessels. The Coast Guard, responsible for inspecting cruise ships and vessels for compliance with MSD rules, has faced criticism for inadequate enforcement of Section 312 requirements. The GAO reported limitations in inspectors' ability to detect violations, citing factors such as focus on safety, limited time and staff for inspections, and lack of surprise in inspections. The Coast Guard's responsibilities include homeland security and non-homeland security tasks, with a shift towards more homeland security activities after 9/11. This has led to fewer resources available for vessel inspections. The Coast Guard has shifted resources to focus on homeland security activities, leading to less time for vessel inspections for environmental compliance. Annex IV of MARPOL regulates sewage discharges from ships, requiring sewage treatment plants or holding tanks. The United States has not ratified Annex IV, so it is not mandatory for ships in U.S. waters to follow it. Annex IV of MARPOL regulates sewage discharges from ships, requiring certified sewage treatment systems or holding tanks. Vessels must treat sewage discharges within three miles of shore with a certified MSD, and between three and 12 miles with maceration or chlorination. Discharges beyond 12 miles are unrestricted in U.S. waters. In U.S. waters, sewage discharges from vessels must be treated within three miles of shore with a certified MSD, and between three and 12 miles with maceration or chlorination. Beyond 12 miles, sewage discharges are unrestricted. Some cruise ships in Alaskan waters use Advanced Wastewater Treatment (AWT) systems for improved sewage treatment. Advanced Wastewater Treatment (AWT) systems are used for sewage treatment on some cruise ships in Alaskan waters. AWTs are effective in removing pathogens, suspended solids, and other contaminants from sewage. Section 312 also allows states to establish no-discharge zones (NDZs) to prohibit sewage discharges from vessels with installed toilets into certain waters. States can establish no-discharge zones (NDZs) to prohibit sewage discharges from vessels with installed toilets into certain waters. To create an NDZ, the state must apply to the EPA under one of three categories based on the need for greater environmental protection. As of 2009, this designation has been used for waters in 26 states. No-discharge zones (NDZs) can be established by states to prohibit sewage discharges from vessels with installed toilets into specific waters. These zones have been designated for waters in 26 states, including inland states, and can be based on environmental importance or protection of drinking water intake zones. The EPA identified options to address sewage from cruise ships, including revising discharge standards, restricting discharge within 3 miles from shore, and testing wastewater treatment equipment. The EPA is considering options to regulate sewage effluent from cruise ships, such as sampling and testing wastewater treatment equipment. Graywater is not currently defined as a pollutant under federal law, and there are no specific effluent standards for its discharge. The EPA is considering regulating sewage effluent from cruise ships, including graywater discharge. Graywater is not defined as a pollutant under federal law, but there are restrictions on bacterial contaminant content and total suspended solids in graywater discharge for commercial vessels in the Great Lakes and Alaska. EPA issued a general permit in 2008 for large commercial vessels, including cruise ships, with similar restrictions on graywater discharge. The National Marine Sanctuaries Act authorizes NOAA to designate areas where graywater discharges may be restricted to protect sensitive ecosystems. Regulations restrict such discharges in marine sanctuaries like Monterey Bay and Florida Keys. EPA identified options for addressing graywater discharges in the 2008 Discharge Assessment Report. In the 2008 Discharge Assessment Report, EPA outlined options for addressing graywater discharges, including setting standards, geographic restrictions, monitoring, and penalties. Cruise ship waste discharges are regulated by the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act, which prohibits dumping garbage into ocean waters without a permit. The Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act regulates waste discharges from cruise ships, making it illegal to dump garbage into ocean waters without a permit. EPA issues permits for disposal at sea, excluding dredged material which is managed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. No permit is needed for cruise ships to discharge solid waste beyond U.S. jurisdiction. Routine effluent discharge for propulsion is allowed. The Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA) regulates waste discharges from cruise ships. No MPRSA permit is required for solid waste discharge beyond U.S. jurisdiction. The Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS) also applies, prohibiting garbage discharge within certain distances from shore and plastic discharge anywhere. This applies to all vessels in U.S. navigable waters and the Exclusive Economic Zone. The Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA) regulates waste discharges from cruise ships, including solid waste and plastic discharge. The Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS) applies to all vessels in U.S. navigable waters and the Exclusive Economic Zone, prohibiting garbage discharge within certain distances from shore and plastic discharge anywhere. The Coast Guard administers the regulations and carries out inspection programs to ensure port facilities can receive offloaded solid waste. EPA has identified discharges of solid waste and plastic from cruise ships, prompting evaluations by the IMO to potentially amend Annex V of MARPOL. EPA has suggested options to address solid waste from cruise ships, such as enhancing on-board garbage handling and treatment technologies. The EPA has proposed various options to address solid waste from cruise ships, including improving on-board garbage handling technologies, implementing stronger waste management plans, expanding port reception facilities, and enforcing no discharge of solid waste into the marine environment. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) governs hazardous waste management. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) is the primary federal law governing hazardous waste management, imposing management requirements on generators, transporters, and treatment facilities. Hazardous waste is defined as ignitable, corrosive, reactive, or toxic, or listed industrial process waste streams and commercial products. Treatment, storage, and disposal facilities must have permits and comply with regulations. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) regulates hazardous waste management for industrial process waste streams and commercial products. Treatment, storage, and disposal facilities must comply with EPA regulations. Cruise ships may be subject to RCRA rules as generators or transporters of hazardous waste, facing challenges in waste identification and compliance with RCRA requirements. Cruise ships generate hazardous wastes from various activities onboard, such as cleaning, painting, and passenger services. These wastes are stored onboard until they can be offloaded for recycling or disposal in compliance with RCRA regulations. Compliance with RCRA requirements is essential for identifying and managing hazardous wastes on cruise ships. Cruise ships may be subject to RCRA regulations for managing hazardous wastes generated from operations like maintenance and passenger services. It is unclear if they are classified as large or small generators of hazardous waste, leading to uncertainty about the applicable regulations. Some cruise companies argue they generate less waste than the threshold for stricter regulations. Some cruise companies argue that cruise ships generate less waste than the threshold for stricter regulations, potentially classifying them as \"conditionally exempt small-quantity generators.\" Hazardous substance releases from cruise ships could trigger the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), but it has not been used in response to cruise ship releases. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) requires immediate notification of hazardous substance releases from vessels to the National Response Center. EPA has identified specific release amounts that may pose a danger to public health or the environment. The EPA requires notification for hazardous substance releases in the contiguous zone, with specific rules on reportable quantities as small as 1 pound. CERCLA authorizes the President to take remedial action for releases, and hazardous waste discharges from cruise ships are regulated under the Clean Water Act. Hazardous waste discharges from cruise ships are regulated under Section 311 of the Clean Water Act, which prohibits the discharge of hazardous substances into U.S. waters. The EPA's 2008 Discharge Assessment Report suggested options like establishing BMP standards, increasing inspections, and potentially prohibiting hazardous material discharges up to the 200-mile Exclusive Economic Zone. The EPA is beginning a rulemaking to prohibit the discharge of hazardous materials into U.S. waters up to the 200-mile Exclusive Economic Zone, including increasing inspections on cruise ships and authorized facilities receiving cruise ship hazardous wastes. Coast Guard regulations also prohibit oil discharge within 12 miles from shore. Coast Guard regulations prohibit oil discharge within 12 miles from shore, unless passed through a 15-ppm oil water separator and without causing a visible sheen. Beyond 12 miles, oil can be discharged if the content is less than 100 ppm. Vessels must maintain an Oil Record Book to record disposal of oily residues and discharges overboard. The Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships implements MARPOL Annex I for oil pollution. The Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS) implements MARPOL Annex I for oil pollution, applying to all U.S. flagged ships worldwide and foreign flagged vessels in U.S. navigable waters. Coast Guard regulations prohibit oil discharge within 12 nautical miles of land, except under limited conditions. Most cruise lines are foreign registered, so the regulations have limited impact on them. Most cruise lines are foreign registered, limiting the applicability of APPS regulations to their operations. Cruise lines have policies restricting discharges of machinery space waste within three miles from shore. EPA suggested options for addressing oily bilge water from cruise ships in the 2008 Discharge Assessment Report. Since the 1970s, Clean Water Act regulations exempted ballast water and other discharges from NPDES permit requirements, but due to the introduction of invasive species, there were calls to ban discharge of bilge water into U.S. waters and establish penalties for noncompliance. In January 1999, conservation organizations, fishing groups, Native American tribes, and water agencies petitioned EPA to repeal its 1973 regulation exempting ballast water discharge, arguing it should be regulated as a \"discharge of a pollutant\" under the Clean Water Act. EPA rejected the petition in September 2003, citing long-standing agency policy and congressional acquiescence in 1979 and 1996. EPA rejected a petition in 2003 to regulate ballast water discharge under the Clean Water Act, citing previous decisions in 1979 and 1996. Efforts to limit ballast water discharges have become mandatory since 2004, with all vessels required to have a management plan. Environmental groups filed a lawsuit after their petition was denied, seeking to rescind the exemption for ballast water discharges. In 2005, environmental groups filed a lawsuit to force EPA to rescind the regulation exempting ballast water discharges from CWA permitting. A federal district court ruled in favor of the groups in 2006, ordering EPA to set aside the challenged regulation by September 30, 2008. The ruling was upheld on appeal in July 2008, applying to other vessel discharges as well. The court's ruling in 2006 ordered EPA to rescind the exemption for ballast water discharges, extending to other vessel discharges like graywater and bilge water. In response, EPA issued the Vessel General Permit in December 2008, applicable to various large recreational and commercial vessels, including tankers, freighters, barges, and cruise ships. The Vessel General Permit (VGP) applies to pollutant discharges from non-recreational vessels over 79 feet in length, including ballast water discharges from commercial vessels under 79 feet and commercial fishing vessels. It covers 26 types of waste streams from vessel operations in U.S. waters up to the 3-mile territorial limit. The Vessel General Permit (VGP) covers 26 types of waste streams from vessel operations in U.S. waters up to the 3-mile territorial limit. The permit controls pollutant discharges including aquatic nuisance species, nutrients, pathogens, oil and grease, metals, and pollutants with toxic effects. Best management practices (BMPs) described in the permit are used to control most waste streams, with a primary reliance on existing Coast Guard requirements for ballast water discharges. The VGP primarily relies on existing Coast Guard requirements for controlling ballast water discharges and provides BMPs for managing bilge water discharges. Monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements are included, but sewage discharges are regulated separately under CWA Section 312. Under the VGP, cruise ships are subject to detailed requirements for certain discharges, including graywater and pool and spa water, with additional monitoring and reporting. Numeric effluent limits for fecal coliform and residual chlorine in cruise ship discharges of graywater are based on U.S. Coast Guard rules for discharge of treated sewage or graywater in Alaska. The 110th Congress considered legislation for uniform national approach on ballast water discharge issues to address aquatic nuisance species, opposed by some groups. Operational limits on cruise ship graywater discharges in nutrient-impaired waters are included in the VGP regulations. The 110th Congress considered legislation (S. 1578 and H.R. 2830) administered by the Coast Guard regarding ballast water management programs. Some groups opposed the legislation due to concerns about preempting states' authority and lack of citizen suit provisions. No further action was taken on this legislation. The Clean Air Act is the principal federal law addressing air quality concerns. The Clean Air Act is the main federal law addressing air quality concerns, requiring EPA to set health-based standards for ambient air quality and national emission standards for sources of air pollution. Cruise ship emissions were unregulated until 2003 when EPA established standards for new marine diesel engines on large vessels. In 2003, EPA established emission standards for Category 3 marine engines on large vessels like container ships, tankers, bulk carriers, and cruise ships flagged in the United States. The standards were a result of litigation by the environmental group Bluewater Network. The rule aligns with international standards for nitrogen oxides set in Annex VI of the MARPOL protocol. Emissions from these vessels were previously unregulated by EPA. In 2003, EPA established emission standards for Category 3 marine engines on large vessels like container ships, tankers, bulk carriers, and cruise ships. The rule aligns with international standards for nitrogen oxides set in Annex VI of the MARPOL protocol. Emissions from these vessels were previously unregulated by EPA, but now they are subject to EPA regulation under Section 213(a) of the Clean Air Act. EPA announced plans to review issues and technology related to emissions from large marine vessel engines to establish more stringent standards in the future. EPA established emission standards for Category 3 marine engines on large vessels in 2003, aligning with international standards. Plans were announced to review emissions from large marine vessel engines for more stringent standards in the future. Environmental groups criticized EPA for excluding foreign-flagged vessels from the rules, which were upheld in 2004. EPA may consider including foreign vessels in the future. In 2003, EPA established emission standards for Category 3 marine engines on large vessels, aligning with international standards. Plans were made to review emissions for more stringent standards in the future. Environmental groups criticized the exclusion of foreign-flagged vessels from the rules, which were upheld in 2004. EPA may consider including foreign vessels in the future rulemaking. In October 2008, the IMO adopted amendments to Annex VI for new global nitrogen oxide and fuel sulfur standards, as well as more stringent emission controls in designated Emission Control Areas (ECAs). The United States supported amendments to nitrogen oxide and fuel sulfur standards in 2011 and 2012, respectively, along with stricter emission controls in Emission Control Areas (ECAs). EPA adopted changes to 2003 CAA rules for Category 3 marine engines in December 2009, aligning with IMO requirements and establishing emissions standards for hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide. The EPA rule applies to newly built engines on U.S.-flagged or registered vessels. The EPA rule applies to newly built engines on U.S.-flagged or registered vessels, while engines on foreign vessels are subject to nitrogen oxide limits in MARPOL Annex VI. In October 2010, the IMO approved a U.S. request to designate waters in the U.S. Caribbean as an ECA, with more stringent emission limitations for sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides. The IMO approved a U.S. request to designate waters in the U.S. Caribbean as an ECA with stricter emission limits for sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides. If approved by July 2011, ships in the area would face tighter restrictions on emissions starting in 2014. The Clean Water Act defines navigable waters, the contiguous zone, and the ocean as separate entities. The Clean Water Act defines the territorial seas as extending 3 miles from the baseline, with a proclamation in 1988 extending it to 12 nautical miles. The contiguous zone is defined as the zone established by the US under the Convention of the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone. The contiguous zone, as defined in the Clean Water Act, extends from the baseline to not beyond 12 miles. In 1999, President Clinton doubled the width of the contiguous zone to 24 nautical miles, allowing U.S. authorities to enforce customs, immigration, or sanitary laws at sea within this zone. This proclamation did not amend any statutory definitions. The 1999 presidential proclamation doubled the width of the contiguous zone to 24 nautical miles from the baseline, allowing enforcement of customs, immigration, or sanitary laws at sea within this zone. This did not change statutory definitions, so the territorial sea remains 3 miles wide and the contiguous zone extends from 3 to 12 miles under the Clean Water Act. The CWA defines the \"ocean\" as any portion of the high seas beyond the contiguous zone. The Clean Water Act and the MPRSA define different areas of jurisdiction in the ocean. The CWA defines \"territorial seas\" and \"contiguous zone,\" while the MPRSA defines \"ocean waters\" beyond the baseline. These definitions are important for determining where specific laws apply, such as sewage discharge regulations under the Clean Water Act. The Clean Water Act and related regulations apply to sewage discharges from vessels into navigable waters, while the Oil Pollution Act addresses oil or hazardous substance discharges into US waters. Provisions from the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships also apply to navigable waters. The Clean Water Act and related regulations apply to sewage discharges from vessels into navigable waters. The Oil Pollution Act addresses oil or hazardous substance discharges into US waters. Provisions from the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships also apply to navigable waters. The MPRSA regulates ocean dumping within 12 nautical miles seaward from the baseline and regulates material transport by U.S.-flagged vessels for dumping into ocean waters. Jurisdictional considerations are complicated by varying definitions of distances from shore. In Alaska, cruise ship pollution has become a significant concern due to the increase in cruise ship passengers visiting the state. Nautical miles are used to measure distances from the baseline, which is 15% longer than a statute mile. After a three-fold increase in cruise ship passengers visiting Alaska in the 1990s, concerns over cruise ship pollution on marine resources grew. In a notable case, Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines pleaded guilty to federal criminal charges in July 1999, resulting in $6.5 million in penalties for knowingly discharging oil and hazardous substances in Alaska. The company admitted to a widespread practice of releasing oil-contaminated bilge water. The Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines admitted to discharging oil-contaminated bilge water, resulting in $6.5 million in penalties in Alaska. This was part of a larger $18 million federal plea agreement for environmental violations in multiple locations. Concerns over cruise ship pollution led to a program in December 1999 to identify waste streams, revealing that most ships exceeded U.S. Coast Guard standards for waste discharges. The poor functioning of ship systems led to excessive discharges exceeding U.S. Coast Guard standards for waste. Fecal coliform levels were significantly high in blackwater and graywater, prompting federal legislation in December 2000 to address the issue. The Miscellaneous Appropriations Bill, H.R. 5666, established standards for cruise ships with 500+ passengers, prohibiting untreated sewage discharge in Alaska waters. EPA is authorized to regulate sewage and graywater discharges until then, ships can discharge treated sewage at 6 knots and 1 nautical mile from shore with fecal limits. Ships in Alaska waters can discharge treated sewage wastes at 6 knots and 1 nautical mile from shore with specific limits on fecal coliforms and total suspended solids. Vessels with advanced systems can discharge closer to shore and at slower speeds with stricter effluent standards. The legislation requires vessels in Alaska waters to meet strict effluent standards for sewage and graywater treatment, including limits on fecal coliforms, total suspended solids, and residual chlorine concentrations. Vessel operators must conduct sampling, data collection, and recordkeeping to comply with Coast Guard oversight and enforcement. Regulations were issued in 2001 to implement the federal law, with provisions for sampling procedures and penalties for violations. The regulations mandate strict sampling and testing procedures for sewage and graywater treatment on cruise ships in Alaska, with penalties for violations. EPA conducted a project to assess treatment system performance and consider updated standards for wastewater discharges. In 2004 and 2005, studies were conducted to assess graywater and sewage onboard cruise ships and evaluate treatment system performance. Data from these studies were summarized in the 2008 Cruise Ship Discharge Assessment Report. EPA collaborated with Alaska on surveys and studies related to sewage and graywater treatment on cruise ships. Sampling efforts indicated advanced wastewater treatment effectiveness. In 2008, sampling in Skagway Harbor showed that advanced wastewater treatment systems effectively treat various contaminants from cruise ships. Alaska enacted its own law in 2001, setting standards for blackwater discharge identical to federal regulations. The state law in Alaska sets standards and sampling requirements for blackwater discharge, which are the same as federal regulations. In 2000, high fecal coliform counts in graywater led to extending effluent standards to graywater discharges. Sampling requirements for all ships began in 2001, with effluent standards for large cruise ships' blackwater discharges in the same year and for graywater discharges in 2003. Small ships had three years to comply. Standards for graywater discharges by large vessels in Alaska took effect in 2003, with small ships given three years to comply. A scientific advisory panel was established to evaluate the law's effectiveness. Large ships have either installed advanced wastewater treatment systems or hold all wastewater for discharge outside Alaskan waters. As of 2006, most large cruise ships in Alaskan waters have installed advanced wastewater treatment systems, improving the quality of discharged wastewater. However, small ships have not upgraded their systems, leading to consistent pollutant levels exceeding state standards in their effluent. In 2006, Alaska voters approved a citizen initiative requiring cruise lines to pay a $50 head tax per passenger and a corporate income tax, increasing fines for wastewater violations, and mandating new environmental regulations for cruise ships. This was in response to discharge levels of pollutants from smaller vessels exceeding state water quality standards, posing risks to aquatic life and human health. The initiative in Alaska proposes new taxes on cruise ships to fund local communities and public services. Supporters argue that the cruise industry doesn't pay enough for its environmental impact, while opponents fear it will harm tourism competitiveness. Legal challenges have been filed against the tax by some cruise lines. In response to the proposed tax on cruise ships in Alaska, some cruise lines have stopped operating in Alaskan waters due to concerns about the impact on tourism competitiveness. Alaska previously enacted legislation to address wastewater treatment standards for cruise ships. Similar regulations on cruise ship discharges have been implemented in other states as well. In April 2004, Maine enacted legislation regulating cruise ship discharges into coastal waters, applying to large ships with accommodations for 250+ passengers. Ships must have advanced wastewater treatment systems, comply with federal laws, and obtain a permit from the state Department of Environmental Protection to enter state waters after January 1, 2006. Under the federal Alaska cruise ship law, ships must have advanced wastewater treatment systems, comply with state and federal laws, and obtain a permit from the state Department of Environmental Protection. Prior to 2006, graywater discharges were allowed if the ship had a treatment system meeting requirements. Maine applied for up to 50 No Discharge Zones to prohibit blackwater discharges, with EPA approving Casco Bay as an NDZ in June 2006. California passed a law in 2004 prohibiting cruise ships from discharging treated wastewater in state waters. California enacted several bills in 2004 to regulate cruise ship discharges in state waters, including bans on treated wastewater, graywater, waste incinerators, sewage sludge, oil bilge water, and hazardous wastes. Another measure in 2006 required the state to take further action. California enacted several bills in 2004 to regulate cruise ship discharges in state waters, including bans on various types of waste. In 2006, California S.B. 497 mandated the adoption of ballast water performance standards by January 2008, with specific deadlines for the removal of invasive species from ballast water by 2020. Several states have also entered agreements with the industry to adhere to waste minimization practices. The cruise industry, through agreements with various organizations, must adhere to waste minimization, recycling, and management practices. For instance, in 2001, an agreement with Florida required cruise lines to stop wastewater discharges within 4 nautical miles off the coast, report hazardous waste annually, and undergo environmental inspections by the U.S. Coast Guard. Similarly, in 2004, Washington signed a memorandum of understanding with the cruise industry for environmental protection. The U.S. Coast Guard and various organizations have agreements with the cruise industry to regulate wastewater discharge. In 2004, Washington signed a memorandum of understanding to allow treated wastewater discharge into state waters, with restrictions on untreated wastewater and sludge. Environmental advocates criticize these agreements for lacking enforcement, while states argue that federal law does not prevent them from entering into such agreements. The Clean Water Act limits state control over cruise ship discharges, but states can make voluntary agreements with stricter requirements. In 2009, Washington reported that most cruise ships complied with an agreement to stop untreated wastewater discharge, with treatment systems producing high-quality effluent. Enforcement of voluntary agreements is challenging, but having measures in place to protect water quality is seen as beneficial. The cruise ship industry has responded to pressure from environmental advocates by adopting waste management practices and procedures. Members of the Cruise Lines International Association have implemented guidelines for their operations worldwide, building on regulations of the IMO and U.S. EPA. Enforcement of voluntary agreements to protect water quality is challenging but beneficial. The world's largest cruise lines have adopted waste management practices following regulations of the IMO and U.S. EPA. Guidelines require proper discharge of graywater and blackwater, hazardous wastes to be recycled or disposed of legally. CLIA's cruise line companies have Safety Management System plans for enhanced wastewater systems and auditing oversight, certified by the IMO's International Safety Management Code. Collaboration with equipment manufacturers is ongoing. The cruise industry has adopted waste management practices in compliance with regulations from the IMO and U.S. EPA, including enhanced wastewater systems and auditing oversight. They are also collaborating with equipment manufacturers and regulators to develop technologies for lower emission turbine engines and ballast water management. Environmental groups support the industry's improved practices but prefer enforceable standards over voluntary ones. The industry has partnered with Conservation International to form the Ocean Conservation and Tourism Alliance to address various issues. The cruise industry collaborated with Conservation International to establish the Ocean Conservation and Tourism Alliance, focusing on conservation efforts in coastal areas. Initiatives include improving wastewater management on cruise ships, protecting natural and cultural assets of destinations, raising awareness among passengers and crew, and educating vendors to reduce environmental impacts. The Caribbean and Mediterranean, home to two-thirds of top cruise destinations, are key areas of focus. In 2006, CLIA and CI announced a joint initiative to develop a map integrating sensitive marine areas into cruise line navigational charts to protect critical marine and coastal ecosystems. Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (RCCL) committed to retrofitting all vessels in its fleet with advanced wastewater treatment technology in 2004, becoming the first cruise line to do so completely. Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (RCCL) committed to retrofitting all vessels in its fleet with advanced wastewater treatment technology in 2004, becoming the first cruise line to do so completely. The company's efforts to alter its practices following federal enforcement actions in the 1990s for environmental violations resulted in RCCL paying criminal fines totaling $27 million. Concerns about cruise ship pollution raise issues for Congress in three broad areas: adequacy of laws and regulations, research needs, and oversight and enforcement of existing programs and requirements. Concerns about cruise ship pollution raise issues for Congress in three broad areas: adequacy of laws and regulations, research needs, and oversight and enforcement of existing programs and requirements. More assessment is needed to determine if current measures are sufficient, and obtaining resources to address the problems is a challenge. The key issue is whether existing laws, protocols, and industry initiatives adequately manage cruise ship pollution, or if legislative changes are necessary. The report questions if current regulations effectively manage cruise ship pollution, particularly in areas like graywater contamination. Legislative changes may be necessary to address gaps in coverage. EPA's 2000 white paper highlighted concerns about certain waste streams not being adequately regulated. The U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy recommended clear, uniform requirements for controlling wastewater discharge from large passenger vessels to address substantial contamination of cruise ship graywater. The U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy recommended establishing new statutory regulations for wastewater discharge from large passenger vessels, including uniform standards, recordkeeping, monitoring, and incentives for innovative treatment technologies. The Clean Cruise Ship Act was proposed in Congress but did not progress. The Clean Cruise Ship Act, introduced in the 111th Congress, aimed to amend the Clean Water Act to prohibit cruise vessels from discharging sewage, graywater, or bilge water into U.S. waters without meeting specific effluent limits and management standards. EPA and the Coast Guard would be tasked with establishing these limits. The Clean Cruise Ship Act introduced in the 111th Congress aims to set strict limits on sewage, graywater, and bilge water discharges from cruise vessels. It requires wastewater treatment on ships, enhances federal enforcement authority, and imposes passenger fees for implementation. Environmental advocates support the legislation, while industry groups argue it unfairly targets a small percentage of ships. The Clean Cruise Ship Act in the 111th Congress aims to set strict limits on sewage, graywater, and bilge water discharges from cruise vessels. Industry groups argue it unfairly targets a small percentage of ships, as environmental standards are already high. Some states have passed legislation to regulate cruise ship discharges, potentially prompting federal legislation to harmonize approaches. Congress also considers the status of EPA's efforts to manage cruise ship wastes. In 2000, Congress authorized EPA to issue standards for sewage and graywater discharges from large cruise ships in Alaska. EPA has been collecting information and assessing the need for additional standards but has not proposed any rules yet. EPA released a Cruise Ship Discharge Assessment Report in December 2008, examining various waste streams from cruise ships. The final report examines five cruise ship waste streams (sewage, graywater, oily bilge water, solid waste, and hazardous waste) and discusses current federal government actions to address them. Possible options and alternatives are identified, but EPA has not determined their necessity, feasibility, or legal authority for implementation. Other issues include harmonizing jurisdictional terms in U.S. laws. The entity has legal authority to implement options related to cruise ship waste, including harmonizing jurisdictional terms in U.S. laws and updating regulations to reflect improved technology. Research is needed to understand waste quantities generated by cruise ships. The U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy highlighted the importance of research in understanding the impact of vessel pollution and prioritizing resources to address significant threats. They recommended research by various entities on the transport of pollutants in the marine environment. Directions for research by the Coast Guard, EPA, NOAA, and other entities on the fates and impacts of vessel pollution include processes governing pollutant transport in the marine environment, small passenger vessel practices, disposal options for concentrated sludge from sewage treatment on large vessels, cumulative impacts on sensitive ecosystems, and impacts of vessel air emissions in ports and inland waterways. In the 2008 Cruise Ship Assessment Report, EPA suggested research options to address impacts of vessel air emissions, focusing on areas struggling to meet air quality standards. Research could include a nationwide sampling program, studies on human health and environmental effects of cruise ship discharges, and assessments on potential cumulative impacts from multiple cruise ships in semi-enclosed environments like bays and harbors. The 2000 GAO report highlighted the need for better enforcement of existing laws and regulations regarding cruise ship discharges. It emphasized the importance of monitoring these discharges to assess current standards and management effectiveness. Increased federal oversight by agencies like the Coast Guard was recommended for maintenance and operation of pollution prevention equipment. The Coast Guard and other agencies need to improve enforcement of laws and regulations on cruise ship pollution, including maintenance of pollution prevention equipment and proper off-loading of waste. The Coast Guard's resources for inspections have been questioned, especially in light of multiple security missions. The Coast Guard's resources for vessel inspections have been questioned in relation to homeland security missions. Possible options for enforcement and compliance include improving monitoring, rewarding passengers for detecting illegal activities, allowing state personnel to inspect cruise ship pollution control equipment, or charging a passenger fee for onboard marine engineers. In its 2000 report, the GAO found issues with the process for referring cruise ship violations to other countries, recommending that the Coast Guard collaborate with the IMO to ensure member countries respond to pollution cases and follow up on alleged pollution cases outside U.S. jurisdiction."
