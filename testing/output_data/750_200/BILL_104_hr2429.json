    "content": "The \"Farms for the Future Act Amendments of 1995\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. The purpose and findings of the Act are outlined in section 2. The \"Farms for the Future Act Amendments of 1995\" aims to provide financially competitive options for maintaining prime, unique, and strategic farmland in agricultural production, as agricultural producers lack such options leading to conversion of farmland to nonagricultural uses. Federal assistance is necessary to protect prime, unique, and strategic farmlands as states and local governments have been unable to provide sufficient incentives for landowners to maintain agricultural production on such lands. Federal assistance is needed to protect prime, unique, and strategic farmlands, as states and local governments lack incentives for landowners to maintain agricultural production on such lands. The Farms for the Future Act of 1990 is amended to include a new section on federal cost sharing for the acquisition of farmland protection easements. The section defines \"qualifying farmland\" as land important for agriculture and at risk of conversion, and \"farmland protection easement\" as an easement for protecting farmland. The term 'farmland protection easement' refers to an easement that restricts incompatible land uses and binds future landowners in eligible states with approved programs. The Secretary may provide matching grants to eligible States for acquiring farmland protection easements to preserve agricultural land from incompatible uses. Matching grants under subsection (c) for acquiring farmland protection easements are made on a 50-50 matching basis, with the possibility of up to 90 percent matching for eligible States actively protecting farmland from incompatible uses. Eligible States have a limitation on the total amount of grants they can receive. The program provides matching grants to eligible States for protecting farmland from incompatible uses. States are limited to receiving 10% of the total grant amount, with provisions for proportional distribution if fewer than 10 States participate. The Secretary ensures funds are used to protect qualifying farmland. The Secretary ensures that funds provided are used to protect qualifying farmland, with priority given to lands important to the State's agriculture industry. The purchase price of farmland protection easements acquired should not exceed fair market value. Authorization of appropriations is provided for each fiscal year."
