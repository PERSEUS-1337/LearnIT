    "content": "The alternate engine program for the F-35 Lightning II fighter was a significant issue for Congress in FY2012, with implications for the defense budget and military capability. The program developed the General Electric/Rolls-Royce F136 engine as an alternative to the Pratt & Whitney F135 engine. Despite successive Administration proposals to terminate the program, Congress continued to fund it in FY2011. In FY2011, Congress rejected proposals to terminate the alternate engine program for the F-35 fighter. General Electric and Rolls-Royce ended development of the F136 engine, leading to the termination of the engine competition. The Department of Defense selected the Lockheed Martin F-35 with the Pratt & Whitney F135 engine as the winner of the JSF competition. DOD plans to purchase 2,456 JSFs for the Air Force. The Lockheed Martin F-35, powered by the Pratt & Whitney F135 engine, was chosen as the winner of the Joint Strike Fighter competition. The Department of Defense plans to buy 2,456 JSFs for the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps. An alternate engine, the F136, was developed by General Electric and Rolls-Royce but was later terminated. The F135 and F136 engines were designed to be interchangeable without modifying the F-35 airframe. The alternate engine program for the F-35 airframe was proposed for termination by the Administration in FY2007, but Congress restored funding. Despite subsequent attempts by the Administration to terminate the program in FY2008, FY2009, and FY2010, Congress rejected them. However, in FY2011, funding for the program was deleted by the 112th Congress, leading to the formal termination of the alternate engine program by DOD on April 25, 2011. The alternate engine program for the F-35 was terminated by DOD on April 25, 2011, after Congress deleted funding. Supporters of the termination argue that developing a second engine would significantly increase costs and reduce the number of F-35s that could be procured, impacting future capabilities and force structure. An official from the F-35 program office mentioned a potential 50% reduction in procurement over the next five years. The reduction in F-35 procurement over the next five years could total 50 to 80 aircraft, impacting future capabilities and force structure. Procuring a second engine would increase F-35 life-cycle operation and support costs, posing challenges for aircraft carriers due to limited space. The need for a second engine is not necessary to sustain international interest in the F-35 program. The F-35 program faces potential reductions in procurement, impacting capabilities and force structure. Despite risks of using single designs across fleets, Congress and DOD find them acceptable. The need for a second engine is not crucial for sustaining international interest in the F-35 program. The F-35 program faces potential reductions in procurement, impacting capabilities and force structure. Airframe design risks fleet grounding due to flaws, but Congress and DOD find them acceptable. Development of F135 engine has progressed, eliminating the need for an alternate engine program as a backup. Opponents argue that the Administration's proposal to terminate the alternate engine program does not comply with Section 213 of the FY2008 defense authorization act, which mandates continued development and procurement for the Joint Strike Fighter Program. The Secretary of Defense must ensure funding for 2 options for the propulsion system of the Joint Strike Fighter to avoid reliance on a single engine type. This is necessary to prevent potential grounding of the entire F-35 fleet in case of engine issues. Having a second engine in production for the F-35 would allow for competition in procurement, reducing costs and promoting better performance and reliability. Having two engine production lines would prevent grounding of the fleet in case of engine issues. Having two F-35 engine production lines would promote better engine performance, increase reliability, and improve contractor responsiveness. It would also allow for quicker production surges in response to strategic changes, maintain competition in aircraft engine development, and sustain international interest in the F-35 program. The F-35 program aims to maximize exports by offering engine choices to potential foreign buyers. The alternate engine program was terminated in 2011, with over $200 million worth of hardware returned to the DOD. The alternate engine program for the F-35 was terminated in 2011, with over $200 million worth of hardware returned to the DOD. General Electric and Rolls-Royce ended their self-funded development of the F136 engine. Pratt & Whitney, the incumbent engine maker, received $7.3 billion in funding for work related to the F-35 program. The funding for the F-35 program from FY1994-FY2009 totaled $7.3 billion, including $6.1 billion for F135 System Development and Demonstration work. The F135 SDD contract cost increased to $6.7 billion by September 2009, with $0.8 billion attributed to cost growth and $1.1 billion to an expanded scope of work. The General Electric/Rolls-Royce alternate engine team received $2.4 billion during this period. The General Electric/Rolls-Royce alternate engine team received a total of $2.4 billion during the period FY1995-FY2009, with $1.1 billion attributed to an expanded scope of work. The F136 SDD contract did not include STOVL Lift System components and exhaust systems, which were provided under the F135 Pratt & Whitney SDD contract. During FY2011, the government faced funding challenges for the alternate engine program due to continuing resolutions (CRs) limiting spending. Technical issues were discussed, including fewer test hours and ground test engines. The Administration's opposition to further funding raised questions about the program's status. During FY2011, the government faced funding challenges for the alternate engine program due to continuing resolutions (CRs) limiting spending. The CR set DOD spending at FY2010 levels, including war funding, with reductions for BRAC funding not requested in FY2011. Office of Management and Budget Director Jacob Lew stated that DoD would continue funding activities on a pro-rata basis during the CR period. During the CR period ending March 4, 2011, DoD funded activities on a pro-rata basis to avoid impinging on Congress' full-year funding prerogatives for FY 2011. The alternate engine program was funded at the FY2010 level until March 24, 2011, when a stop-work order was issued. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates testified about the program's cost implications at a hearing on February 3, 2010. The Congress has allocated $1.8 billion for the program, with an estimated additional cost of $2.9 billion over the next five years. Analysis shows little benefit to taxpayers from a second engine, as most customers will only purchase one due to logistical constraints. Marine Corps and Navy plan to use only one engine due to limited space on ships. The Marine Corps and Navy will only use one airplane due to limited space on ships. The Air Force may compete for a second engine, but the F135 engine program is progressing well with 13,000 hours of testing completed. The F136 engine has only completed 50 hours of testing, raising concerns about potential development issues. Secretary of the Air Force Michael Donley has expressed doubts about the benefits of a second engine. Secretary of the Air Force Michael Donley expressed doubts about the benefits of investing in a second engine for the F-35 due to uncertainties about the costs and potential savings. Air Force Chief of Staff General Norton Schwartz testified that the F-35 should not have an alternate engine due to advancements in engine technology and the potential impact on the number of F-35s available. He also mentioned that the F-22 and F-18E/F are single-engine airplanes, highlighting the reliability of those engines. General Schwartz and Admiral Roughead expressed skepticism about the need for an alternate engine for the F-35, citing advancements in engine technology and space constraints on carriers. Schwartz questioned the need for taxpayer funding of the alternate engine, suggesting that Rolls and GE should invest more in their product. Roughead emphasized the importance of space on carriers, supporting the use of a single engine for the F-35. Adm. Gary Roughead and Gen. James Cartwright discussed the need for an alternate engine for the Joint Strike Fighter, with Cartwright suggesting that the funds could be better used for other military assets like Predators. Roughead emphasized the importance of space on carriers and the benefits of having a single engine for the F-35. The need for a second engine for the Joint Strike Fighter was discussed, with the question of whether the investment in developing a competitive alternative would be repaid through lower prices induced by competition. The Administration believed the alternative engine program for the Joint Strike Fighter was no longer needed as a hedge against failure, citing small financial benefits from competition due to high costs. The Office of Management and Budget estimated over a billion dollars in near-term savings from cancelling the program. The Office of Management and Budget estimated over a billion dollars in near-term savings from cancelling the alternative engine program for the Joint Strike Fighter, citing competitive pressures that could offset costs over the program's life. The Government Accountability Office testified that continuing the program would require an additional investment of $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion, with potential savings of 9 to 11 percent to recoup that investment through a competitive strategy. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) stated that a competitive strategy could result in savings equal to or exceeding 9 to 11 percent across the engine's life cycle. The \"Great Engine War\" of the 1980s led to significant savings in acquisition, operations, and overall life cycle costs. Nonfinancial benefits of competition include better performance, increased reliability, and improved. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) highlighted nonfinancial benefits of competition, such as better performance and increased reliability. Cost growth in the F135 engine has been a significant issue, with proponents of an alternate engine arguing for cost control. In response to a 24% cost increase in the F135, Secretary Gates acknowledged cost growth in developmental aircraft. Cost of F135 engine increased 24% to $8.3 million. Secretary Gates acknowledged cost growth in developmental aircraft, allocating over $4 billion in FY '10 budget to reduce program risk. DOD created Joint Assessment Team to investigate Pratt & Whitney's cost structure. In July 2009, DOD established a Joint Assessment Team (JAT) to analyze Pratt & Whitney's cost structure for the F135 engine in the F-35 Lightning II program. The JAT's focus included production costs, cost drivers, and long-term affordability. DOD did not share the JAT results with CRS. A report in February 2010 suggested that adding a second engine to the program would have the same cost as sticking to the single-source plan. A Pentagon study indicated that adding a second engine to the F-35 Lightning II program would cost the same as sticking to the single-source plan. Defense Department officials rejected proposals to buy General Electric and Rolls-Royce's F136 engine, citing cost equivalence between a competitive engine acquisition strategy and a sole-source scenario. The Pentagon memo on the JSF 'Alternate Engine Cost/Benefit Analysis' sent to lawmakers on Feb. 25 acknowledges reduced development costs for the F136 engine but concludes that having two competing F-35 engine programs does not offer significant cost savings. Pratt & Whitney received $1 billion for additional F135 engines and support. Pratt & Whitney received approximately $1 billion for additional F135 engines and support for flight testing of the F-35, with a focus on engine improvements for the F-35B variant. About a third of the planned improvements are to meet the original propulsion-system specification, while two-thirds aim to exceed the specification and enhance design robustness. Section 211 of the 2007 defense authorization act directed three independent cost analyses of the F-35 engine program, with studies by CAIG, IDA, and GAO reaching differing conclusions on financial break-even points for an alternate engine program. The studies in 2007 reached differing conclusions on financial break-even points for an alternate engine program. They also highlighted non-financial benefits like fleet readiness, contractor responsiveness, and stronger international relations. The CAIG study specifically looked at engine competitions for the Air Force F-16 and Navy/Marine Corps F/A-18 programs. The CAIG study analyzed engine competitions for the Air Force F-16 and Navy/Marine Corps F/A-18 programs, as well as the sole-source procurement of the Pratt & Whitney F-119 engine for the F-22. Assumptions were favorable to dual-source cases, with competition expected to result in a 5% immediate price decrease in engine procurement costs. The CAIG study in 2014 analyzed engine competitions for the Air Force F-16 and Navy/Marine Corps F/A-18 programs, as well as the sole-source procurement of the Pratt & Whitney F-119 engine for the F-22. It assumed competition would lead to a 5% immediate price decrease in engine procurement costs and a steeper rate of cost reduction for subsequent engines. The study estimated a 21.1% reduction in engine procurement costs over the program's lifetime to break even, with a 25.6% reduction needed on a net-present-value basis. The CAIG study estimated that the Department of Defense would need a 25.6% reduction in engine procurement costs to break even by 2040. It suggested that competing engine operations and support contracts could help achieve these savings, but doubted that a 25.6% reduction could be reached even with competition. The CAIG study discussed the growth potential in the F-35 engine, estimating weight growth between Critical Design Review and Initial Operational Capability, which would require a corresponding increase in engine thrust due to aircraft weight growth. The study highlighted concerns about Pratt & Whitney's F135 engine nearing its temperature specifications. The CAIG study highlighted concerns about Pratt & Whitney's F135 engine nearing its temperature specifications and the need for modifications to allow for thrust growth. The IDA study estimated that an F-35 engine competition could result in a gross savings of 11% to 18%. The IDA study estimated that an alternate engine program for the F-35 would cost $8.8 billion in constant FY2006 dollars. It concluded that recouping these costs through procurement-cost savings alone would be unrealistic, requiring a 40% savings. This amount would decrease to 18% if engine O&S contracts were also competed. The IDA study found that an alternate engine program for the F-35 would cost $8.8 billion in constant FY2006 dollars. It stated that achieving procurement-cost savings of 40% would be unrealistic, but could decrease to 18% if engine O&S contracts were also competed. The study highlighted the importance of contractor responsiveness in the Great Engine War and emphasized the need for an alternate engine to mitigate the risk of the entire F-35 fleet being grounded. The GAO study suggested that an alternate engine for the F-35 could prevent the entire fleet from being grounded due to engine issues. It stated that cost savings of 10.3% to 12.3% would be needed for the program to break even, with potential savings of up to 20% from past engine competitions. The study concluded that competing the engine could generate enough savings to recoup the investment costs. The GAO study found that an alternate engine for the F-35 could prevent fleet grounding. Cost savings of up to 20% from past engine competitions could recoup investment costs. The program may reach break-even by the late 2020s, despite marginal financial benefits. The F-35 production run size can impact the potential break-even point for an alternate engine program. The size of the F-35 production run, influenced by U.S. and foreign government decisions, can impact the potential for reaching a break-even point for an alternate engine program over many years. The decision on which engine to install in the F-35 can change over time due to shifts in international security and defense budgets. In 2009, GE/Rolls-Royce offered to build F136 engines at a fixed price, while Pratt & Whitney proposed reducing the price of the F135 after the initial lots. Pratt & Whitney offered to reduce the price of the F135 after the initial lots, while GE/Rolls-Royce made a fixed-price offer for F135s covering FY2012-FY2014. A fixed-price contract for F135s was agreed upon for F-35s in Low Rate Initial Production Lot IV, with costs reported to be 16% lower than in LRIP III. The cost of LRIP IV F135s was 16% lower than LRIP III. A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed by the United States and eight other countries on the production of the JSF includes production of the JSF Air Vehicle with propulsion systems F135 and F136. The Air Force confirmed that the MOU has not been superseded or changed. The JSF System Development and Demonstration Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) includes the development of primary and alternate propulsion systems F135 and F136, subject to funding availability. The provision for cooperative production and procurement of F135 and F136 remains valid. The Department will continue to implement JSF SDD and PSFD MOU obligations for F135 and F136, subject to funding availability. Consultations with partners have been held regarding the exclusion of F136 from RDT&E funding requests. The JSF SDD MOU and PSFD MOU will not be amended regardless of the U.S. FY10 authorization and appropriation process. European countries with firms involved in F135 and F136 programs are increasing their F-35-related contracts. European countries with firms involved in F135 and F136 programs, such as the Netherlands, are securing more F-35-related contracts. The position of partner nations on the need for the second engine may change based on economic interests. British Secretary of State for Defence supports the F136, expressing concerns about the long-term costs of canceling the second engine. The decision to cancel the second engine for the JSF may save money in the short term but could cost the U.S. and its partners more in the long term due to development challenges and engine failures during testing. In 2008, engine failures delayed the first flight of the F-35B aircraft by a month or two, leading to a reported cost overrun of up to $850 million in the F135 program. A test on September 11, 2009, damaged an F135 engine due to a worn bushing, causing damage to fan blades. Pratt & Whitney stated the damage occurred in a second-generation engine, not the version on current flight-test aircraft, and a \"minor modification\" would be made to all engines immediately. The company announced that a second-generation engine, not the one on current flight-test aircraft, suffered damage. A \"minor modification\" will be made to all initial service release production engines with little impact on cost and schedule. The F136 engine has had three test incidents, including ingestion of a test sensor and impact damage to turbine blades due to a loose nut. A nut ingested into the engine caused damage to an F136 engine, leading to a redesign for better security. Some F135 engines were replaced due to a possible misassembly issue identified in a ground-test engine. Pratt & Whitney confirmed replacing a 'small number' of F135 engines with spares since March. Pratt & Whitney confirms that a 'small number' of F135 test and production engines have been replaced with spares since March due to a mis-assembly issue discovered in a ground test engine at Arnold Engineering Development Center in Tennessee. This issue was also found in other engines during further checks. In July 2009, then-JSF program manager criticized Pratt & Whitney for quality control deficiencies leading to increased F135 costs. Pratt & Whitney responded to criticism about F135 costs, stating that only a few parts had a high scrap rate, with some parts achieving a 70 to 80 percent yield rate. Overall, they claimed to be doing well with a 97 percent scrap rate. William Begert, VP of business development, refuted claims of a 50% scrap rate, stating they are running at 97% for the total engine. A General Electric F136 achieved 115% of required thrust in testing. Pratt & Whitney plans to test a higher-thrust F135. The decision to continue or terminate the alternate engine program is a key issue for Congress. The budget proposes terminating the alternate engine program, raising the question for Congress whether to continue or end the program. Funding sources for the program have included existing F-35 program funds and additional funds from the DOD topline, with potential impacts on other DOD programs. The budget proposes terminating the alternate engine program, with potential impacts on other DOD programs. If alternate engine funds are allocated within the existing F-35 budget lines, other F-35 activities may be curtailed in favor of the alternate engine program. This could result in taking 50-80 tails out of the program over the next five years. The budget proposes terminating the alternate engine program, potentially impacting other DOD programs. Congress may need to decide whether to continue the alternate engine program, which could lead to reducing the number of F-35s procured, causing delays in the program, or cutting other defense capabilities to fund it. The Joint Assessment Team found that fielding and supporting two F-35 engines would cost about the same as one engine. The DOD's Joint Assessment Team found that fielding and supporting two F-35 engines would cost about the same as one engine. An additional $2.9 billion over the next six years is needed to develop the F136 engine for competition. The Accountability Office report stated that the $2.9 billion figure for developing the F136 engine may vary based on different assumptions and detailed information. Supporters argue that the upfront cost may be balanced over the program's lifetime by savings from competition. The F136 engine development costs may be balanced over the program's lifetime by savings from competition, a point of disagreement in studies. Competition provides a check on cost growth and influences contract negotiations. Congress must decide which assumptions to believe. The government negotiates contracts based on experience to establish prices, with incentives and penalties for cost targets. Congress may debate the risk of a single engine type for F-35 and the justification for a second engine due to potential fleet-grounding. Supporters of an alternate engine highlight the risk of all F-35s being grounded in case of engine problems. The F-35 is set to be the main U.S. fighter, but using a single engine type poses a risk of all F-35s being grounded in case of engine issues. Past incidents with AV-8B Harriers, Navy groundings, and Air Force fleet stand-downs due to engine problems highlight the importance of having an alternate engine program. Terminating the F136 alternate engine program is argued to pose little operational risk by DOD officials. DOD argues that terminating the F136 alternate engine program for the F-35 poses little operational risk due to advances in technology such as computational fluid design and advanced software for engine health monitoring. These advancements reduce the risk of relying on a single engine type for an aircraft. Advanced software in engines can diagnose their own condition and provide pilots with warnings of impending failures, allowing for timely landing and cost-effective maintenance. Operational and logistical challenges may arise with multiple engines, as seen in the Navy's limited facilities. Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Gary Roughead prefers a single engine for carriers due to space constraints. The Chief of Naval Operations and Air Force Chief of Staff have differing opinions on using multiple engines. Admiral Roughead prefers a single engine for carriers due to space constraints, while General Schwartz is concerned about the practicality of having an alternate engine solely for the Air Force. The Air Force has experience with multiple engine types for single-airframe fleets, like the F-16 and F-15. Congress may need to decide on using multiple engines for one service or the entire F-35 buy. The potential impact of terminating the F136 engine on General Electric's future competitiveness in fighter aircraft engines is a concern for policy makers. General Electric's future competitiveness in fighter aircraft engines could be affected by terminating the F136 engine, potentially impacting its ability to compete for future fighter aircraft engine contracts. General Electric's strong position in the commercial engine market was noted in the CAIG and IDA studies of 2007. The studies highlighted that General Electric produced 1,000 commercial engines in 2007, while Pratt & Whitney produced 220. General Electric derives about 15% of its business from military engines, while Pratt & Whitney derives about 50%. The question remains on the sufficiency of General Electric's work on engines other than the F136 for preserving its ability to design. The CAIG study of 2007 raised concerns about General Electric's ability to compete for future military engine contracts if the F136 program were terminated. Ending the program could also impact the supply chain for F-35 engine spare parts. Ending the F136 program could reduce the number of suppliers for F-35 engine spare parts, increasing vulnerability to disruptions. Maintaining competition between F135 and F136 may create uncertainty for suppliers. Defense consulting firm noted in 2006 that 50% of each engine is procured competitively. Approximately 50% of engine components are procured competitively, with multiple vendors potentially creating parts. A 2007 study on F136 suppliers suggested no harm to the industrial base if the engine is terminated, but expressed concerns about relying on a firm with limited commercial presence for fighter engine production. The 2007 study on F136 suppliers found no harm to the industrial base if the engine is terminated, but expressed concerns about relying on a firm with limited commercial presence for fighter engine production. The competition between General Electric and Pratt & Whitney during the Great Engine War strengthened the U.S. industrial base. The competition between General Electric and Pratt & Whitney during the Great Engine War strengthened the U.S. industrial base and proved invaluable to future engine development. Congress may consider the non-monetary value of industrial policy implications in choosing one or two engines. The House passed H.R. 1540, which includes language barring funds for performance improvements to the F-35's engine unless developed and procured competitively. H.R. 1540 includes language barring funds for performance improvements to the F-35's engine unless developed and procured competitively for fiscal year 2012. The competitive procurement language states a limitation on funds for the propulsion system for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft program. Limitation- No funds for performance improvements to the F-35's engine in fiscal year 2012 unless competitively developed and produced. Performance improvement defined as increasing airflow volume or thrust for better takeoff performance. The curr_chunk discusses the preservation and storage of property related to the F136 propulsion system, excluding improvements in weight, costs, durability, manufacturing efficiencies, observability requirements, or repair costs. The asset-preservation language states the plan for the Secretary of Defense to develop and carry out the preservation and storage of government-owned property acquired under the F136. The Secretary of Defense is required to develop a plan for the preservation and storage of property acquired under the F136 propulsion system development contract, ensuring that the property can be restarted for development, sustained long-term, and stored at government facilities or contractor sites. The Secretary of Defense must develop a plan for preserving and storing property acquired under the F136 propulsion system contract, including identifying costs for restarting development and allowing contractors to use the property for research and testing at no cost to the government. Additionally, any necessary contract modifications, facilities, or funding must be identified by the Secretary. The Secretary of Defense must develop a plan for preserving and storing property acquired under the F136 propulsion system contract, including identifying costs for restarting development and allowing contractors to use the property for research and testing at no cost to the government. The plan may include additional facilities or funding deemed necessary. None of the authorized amounts for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft program can be used for destroying or disposing of the property. A report on the plan must be submitted to the congressional defense committees within 45 days of the enactment of the Act. The Secretary of Defense must submit a report to Congress within 45 days on the plan for preserving property related to the F136 propulsion system. The committee supports incentivizing competition and ensuring access to property for the contractor to continue development and testing at no cost to the government. The contractor is commended for their efforts despite obstacles from the Department of Defense. The committee supports incentivizing competition and ensuring access to property for the contractor to continue development and testing of the F136 propulsion system at no cost to the government. They believe a competitive alternative is critical for the success of the Joint Strike Fighter program, leading to better engine performance, improved contractor responsiveness, a more robust industrial base, increased engine reliability, and improved operational readiness. The Administration strongly objects to the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Propulsion System. The Administration strongly objects to the language in section 215 of H.R. 1540, which limits funds for performance improvements to the F-35 Lightning II propulsion system unless there is competitive development. This would result in the continued development of an extra engine that adds significant costs to the program, which the Administration and DoD have deemed unnecessary. The Administration strongly opposes the funding for an extra engine in the F-35 program, as it is deemed unnecessary and costly. They also object to the requirement to store property from the terminated F136 program. The Administration opposes funding for an extra engine in the F-35 program and objects to storing property from the terminated F136 program, citing unnecessary costs and logistical challenges. The Senate passed S. 1867, which includes language prohibiting funds for the F136 engine. The Senate passed S. 1867, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, which includes language prohibiting funds for the F136 engine. The conference report on H.R. 1540 included language regarding preservation of F136 assets, stating that no research or development costs for the F136 engine can be charged to future government contracts. The Secretary of Defense must develop a plan for the disposition of property acquired under the F136 propulsion system development contract. The Secretary of Defense must develop a plan for the disposition of property acquired under the F136 propulsion system development contract, ensuring long-term sustainment, repair, and potential future use or disposal within government programs or contractor-funded activities. The Secretary of Defense must develop a plan for the disposition of property acquired under the F136 propulsion system development contract, ensuring long-term sustainment, repair, and potential future use or disposal within government programs or contractor-funded activities. The plan allows for preservation and storage of identified property at Federal Government facilities or contractor facilities, with necessary contract modifications, additional facilities, or funding as determined by the Secretary. No funds for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft program in fiscal year 2012 can be used for activities related to destroying or disposing of property. The Secretary of Defense must submit a report to congressional defense committees within 120 days detailing the plan for the disposition of property acquired under the F136 propulsion system development contract. No funds for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft program can be used for destroying or disposing of property until 30 days after the report submission. The Secretary of Defense must submit a report to congressional defense committees within 120 days detailing the plan for the disposition of property acquired under the F136 propulsion system development contract. The report should describe how to maximize the benefit to the Federal Government from the investment in the F136. The 2012 Department of Defense Appropriations Act did not include funding for the F-35 alternate engine. The 2012 Department of Defense Appropriations Act, part of H.R. 2055, did not provide funding for the F-35 alternate engine program. The Joint Explanatory Statement of the Committee of Conference also made no mention of the program. Appendix A details the legislative history of the F-35 alternate engine program from FY1996-FY2010, focusing on final bill and report language. The F-35 alternate engine program, previously known as the Joint Advanced Strike Technology (JAST) program, was authorized funds in the FY1996 Defense Authorization Act. The program's legislative history from FY1996-FY2010 focuses on final bill and report language. The FY1996 Defense Authorization Act authorized funds for the Joint Advanced Strike Technology (JAST) program, including $7 million for competitive engine concepts. A report on program requirements and combat aircraft was required, with limitations on fund obligations until the report submission. The conference report discussed these provisions in detail. The conference report on the FY1996 Defense Authorization Act discussed Section 213 of the JAST program, emphasizing the need for engine competition and the evaluation of propulsion concepts from competing companies. The report also highlighted concerns about the lack of engine competition and the size of flying prototypes. The conferees emphasize the need for engine competition and appropriate scale of demonstrator aircraft in the JAST program, directing the Under Secretary of Defense to ensure these aspects are addressed. The Secretary of Defense is also directed to include plans for competitive engine programs and demonstrator aircraft in the required report. The conferees direct the Secretary of Defense to include in the report the Department's plan for competitive engine programs and demonstrator aircraft, recommending authorization of funds for these changes. The Senate Armed Services Committee report on an earlier version of the defense authorization bill discussed the JAST program and supporting competitive propulsion programs to reduce risk and achieve more affordable life. The committee directs the Secretary of Defense to evaluate at least two propulsion concepts from competing engine companies for the full scale, full thrust aircraft demonstrators. This is in response to concerns that the current JAST approach may prematurely select one power plant manufacturer. The House Appropriations Committee report on the DOD Appropriations Act also discussed the importance of supporting competitive propulsion programs to reduce risk and achieve more affordable life cycle costs. The House Appropriations Committee report on H.R. 2126 discussed the challenges of developing new fighter engine propulsion plants, citing dissatisfaction with engine performance on early model F-14s and F-15s/F-16s. The Air Force spent over a billion dollars to introduce competition among engine manufacturers. The House Appropriations Committee report on H.R. 2126 highlighted issues with engine performance on early model F-14s, F-15s, and F-16s. Over a billion dollars was spent to introduce competition among engine manufacturers. The new engine for the F-22 is facing technical problems and undergoing a redesign. The JAST program aims to build a common aircraft for the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps, but has chosen an unproven engine design. Given past engine performance difficulties, this decision is risky. The Committee believes it is crucial for the JAST program to pursue an engine design from a second manufacturer due to past engine performance issues. An additional $20,000,000 has been allocated for this purpose. The Senate Armed Services Committee report on the Defense Authorization Act discussed the benefits of engine competition and directed remaining funds to guarantee integration into the preferred weapons system concept. The DOD Appropriation Act was an omnibus appropriations act that included the DOD appropriations act. The DOD Appropriation Act (H.R. 3610 / P.L. 104-208 of September 30, 1996) included the JAST program with a recommendation to increase funding for the Navy account by $13,000,000 to accelerate development of an alternate engine. This increase was part of a program to develop a demonstrator engine and integrate it into selected weapon systems contractor concepts. The FY1998 Defense Authorization Act (H.R. 1119 / P.L. 105-85 of November 18, 1997) Section 213 of H.R. 1119 / P.L. 105-85 requires a report on the production and fielding sequence of the variants of the joint strike fighter. The report on the Joint Strike Fighter Program must certify sufficient funding for an alternate engine development program. The House Armed Services Committee expressed concerns about funding for the alternative fighter engine in the JSF program. The committee is concerned about inadequate funding for the alternative fighter engine in the JSF program. They believe a fully developed and flight-tested engine is essential to reduce program risk and control costs. The Secretary of Defense is directed to provide a report detailing the funding for the engine by February 15, 1998. The Senate Armed Services Committee report on the JSF program emphasized the need for funding for an alternative engine for the joint strike fighter. The committee expects the Department to allocate sufficient funds in future years for an accelerated development profile. The Senate Armed Services Committee report emphasized the need for an alternative engine for the JSF program and recommended a budget increase of $28.0 million to accelerate the program. The committee expects the Department to provide funding for the accelerated program in fiscal year 1999 and beyond. The Senate Armed Services Committee report recommended funding for an alternative engine for the JSF program, with a budget increase of $28.0 million to accelerate the program. S.Rept. 105-189 discussed the JSF program and the requirement for a report on fielding variants, including the naval variant. The report also mentioned the need for sufficient funding for an alternate engine program within the JSF program. The Senate Armed Services Committee recommended funding for an alternate engine in the JSF program to accelerate program development. The committee acknowledges the Department of Defense's clear presentation of priorities but expresses concern over delays in demonstrating the alternate engine in a JSF airframe, which could jeopardize the program's effectiveness. The Senate Armed Services Committee recommended an increase of $15.0 million to accelerate the development of an alternative engine for the JSF program, citing concerns over potential delays in meeting key requirements. The House Armed Services Committee also expressed support for the development of an alternate engine to ensure critical industrial base capabilities. The committee supports the development of an alternate engine for the JSF program to maintain industrial base capabilities, control engine costs, and reduce risks to the planned fleet of 3,000 aircraft. Concerns were raised about funding levels not being sufficient for timely completion of the effort. The Department is also working on other jet engine development efforts as part of the aircraft engine CIP. The committee supports the development of an alternate engine for the JSF program to maintain industrial base capabilities, control engine costs, and reduce risks to the planned fleet of 3,000 aircraft. Concerns were raised about funding levels not being sufficient for timely completion of the effort. The Department is conducting other jet engine development efforts in PE 27268F as part of the aircraft engine CIP. The requested funding for this program has increased by $66.6 million, over 40 percent from the level projected for fiscal year 2000. The justification for the increase is to reduce backlog of proposed engineering tasks for currently fielded engines. The committee does not consider the proposed increase to this program to be of higher priority than development of a new state-of-the-art alternative engine for JSF. The committee recommends $130.2 million in PE 27268F, a decrease of $30.0 million, and $265.4 million in PE 63800F, an increase of $30.0 million, for the development of a flight qualified jet engine for the JSF program. The increase in funding for JSF should be used only for accelerating alternate engine development. The Senate Armed Services Committee report on S. 1059 discussed the JSF program, stating that the budget request included $476.6 million. The Services Committee report on S. 1059 discussed the JSF program, recommending an additional $15.0 million for the alternate engine program to reduce risk for the V/STOL JSF variant. The committee recommends an additional $15.0 million in PE 63800F to reduce risk and accelerate development of the alternate engine for the V/STOL JSF variant, bringing the total Air Force authorization to $250.4 million. The FY2001 Defense Authorization Act (H.R. 4205/P.L. 106-398) discussed concerns about additional contractor funding for the JSF program. The conferees are concerned about the need for additional contractor funding to sustain the current DEMVAL activities of the JSF program. They oppose industry making unreimbursed investments beyond existing agreements and view additional DEMVAL funding as necessary for project execution on an extended schedule. The conferees expect DEMVAL funding to support JSF program projects on an extended schedule, including risk mitigation projects like the alternate engine. The House Armed Services Committee report discussed the JSF program and noted ongoing reviews to address aircraft industrial base concerns. The committee supports the continuation of the JSF alternate engine program to ensure the health of the fighter aircraft engine industrial base. The current funding for the JSF AEP may not be sufficient for completing development and flight qualification of the alternate engine. The committee supports accelerating the development of the JSF alternate engine program to reduce risk to production and aircraft fielding. They recommend additional funding to ensure compatibility with the JSF airframe. The committee recommends additional funding of $144.5 million for the JSF AEP to accelerate the program, as stated in the DOD Appropriations Act and the Senate Appropriations Committee report. The committee also supports the Alternate Engine Program for JSF and ensures that changes in funding will not impact the AEP schedule. The FY2002 Defense Authorization Act discusses the JSF program and emphasizes the importance of developing and integrating the alternate engine within the EMD program. The goal is to have the engine integrated into the JSF before full rate production. The Department should execute the alternate engine program to integrate it into the JSF before full rate production. The House Armed Services Committee report on H.R. 2586 discussed the JSF alternate engine program, highlighting the need for funds to reduce development schedule risk. The JSF program aims to develop aircraft for the Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and allies. The JSF program aims to develop aircraft for the Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and allies with commonality among variants to minimize costs. The committee notes the schedule risk of the alternate engine common hardware components and supports the co-development efforts of two engine manufacturers for interchangeable propulsion systems. The committee recommends increased funding in fiscal year 2002 to reduce development schedule risk of the JSF alternate engine common hardware components. The committee suggests $779.5 million in PE 64800F, an increase of $10.0 million. The committee recommends increased funding in fiscal year 2002 to reduce development schedule risk of the JSF alternate engine common hardware components. The conferees have included an additional $29,750,000 for the Joint Strike Fighter Interchangeable Engine Program to develop and maintain two competing engine programs for the Joint Strike Fighter. The Senate Armed Services Committee report notes a recommendation for $56 million in the FY2004 Defense Authorization Act. The Senate Armed Services Committee report recommends an increase of $56 million in funding for the JSF program, specifically for the development of the interchangeable engine. The committee believes that delaying the interchangeable engine would set back the program by at least two years. The committee recommends a $56.0 million increase in funding for the F136 interchangeable engine development. The Department of Defense should adjust the Future Years Defense Program to restore the original engine schedule. The Senate Appropriations Committee expressed concern about the JSF program's inflation savings reduction. The Committee recommends a $56 million cut to the Joint Strike Fighter program, equally divided between the Navy and Air Force, due to a reduction in funding for the F136 Interchangeable Engine in fiscal year 2004. This decision goes against the Committee's longstanding support for the engine development program. The Committee recommends a $56 million cut to the Joint Strike Fighter program, divided equally between the Navy and Air Force, except for the F136 engine program. An additional $20 million is allocated for risk reduction to the F136 Interchangeable Engine program. This decision contradicts the Committee's previous support for the engine development program. The House Armed Services Committee report discussed the JSF program and mandated funding for an alternate engine program to maintain competition. The JSF Joint Program Office is working on interchangeable engines for the earliest possible engine production lot competition. The committee directs the JSF JPO to compete engine common hardware and turbomachinery at the earliest possible date while maintaining engine interchangeability. This directive is in line with the FY2006 Defense Authorization Act and the House Armed Services Committee report on the JSF program. The committee understands the efforts to eliminate the budget for the JSF competitive engine program in the FY2006 budget request, but the Secretary of Defense ensured nominal funding. They believe a two-engine source for the single-engine JSF would be cost-effective and operationally effective. The committee expects the Secretary, along with the Navy and Air Force, to remain committed to developing competitive engines for the JSF. The committee expects the Secretary, along with the Department of the Navy and the Department of the Air Force, to continue developing competitive engines for the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) as mandated in the FY2007 Defense Authorization Act. The Secretary is expected to sustain two interchangeable propulsion systems for the Joint Strike Fighter aircraft as mandated in the FY2007 Defense Authorization Act, with limitations on modifications to the acquisition program. The Secretary of Defense may allow modifications to the Joint Strike Fighter engine program if certain requirements are met, including notification to congressional defense committees, submission of required reports, and appropriation of funds. Independent cost analyses of the program are to be conducted by the Comptroller General and a federally funded research and development center. The Fighter engine program will be independently performed by the Comptroller General, a federally funded research and development center selected by the Secretary of Defense, and the Cost Analysis Improvement Group of the Office of the Secretary of Defense. The cost analysis will cover alternatives for the Joint Strike Fighter aircraft's propulsion system. The Secretary of Defense, Comptroller General, and CEO of a research center will report on a contract for a propulsion system for the Joint Strike Fighter aircraft, including alternatives for engine selection to reduce costs and improve program schedule. The Secretary of Defense, Comptroller General, and CEO of a research center will independently submit reports to congressional defense committees by March 15, 2007, detailing the cost analysis of alternative propulsion systems for the Joint Strike Fighter aircraft. Reports will include key assumptions, methodology, life-cycle cost comparisons, and estimates in current and constant dollars. The reports to congressional defense committees by March 15, 2007, will include a comparison of life-cycle costs, estimates of manpower, flight hours, and engine procurement for alternative propulsion systems for the Joint Strike Fighter aircraft. Benefits of competition will also be evaluated, such as improved performance, operational readiness, and technology innovation. The report to congressional defense committees by March 15, 2007, will include an assessment of benefits provided by competition for engines for tactical fighter aircraft, acquisition strategies used in past programs, comparison of experiences under sole-source acquisitions, and the impact of canceling programs. The report to congressional defense committees by March 15, 2007, will assess the benefits of engine competition for tactical fighter aircraft, past acquisition strategies, and the impact of canceling programs. It will also evaluate the impact of canceling the F136 competitive engine on the military engine industrial base and the Department of Defense's ability to make competitive engine choices for future combat aircraft systems. The Comptroller General and CEO of the research center must certify if the Secretary of Defense provided sufficient information for informed judgments in the report. Lifecycle costs include elements like engine procurement and estimates. The House Armed Services Committee report discussed the cost analysis for a major defense acquisition program, specifically focusing on procurement of engines, spare engines, and engine components. The budget request included $2.0 billion for the development of the joint strike fighter (JSF), also known as the F-35, with no funds allocated for research. The budget request contained $2.0 billion for the development of the joint strike fighter (JSF), also known as the F-35, with no funds allocated for research on a second aircraft tire source or an alternate JSF engine. The JSF alternate engine program is developing the F136 engine as an alternative to the currently-planned F135 engine. The committee expressed the need for a two-engine source for the single-engine JSF to be cost-effective and operationally effective. They were disappointed that the budget did not include funds for an alternate JSF engine beyond fiscal year 2006. The Under Secretary of Defense testified about the benefits of a second supplier during a hearing. The Under Secretary of Defense testified that the benefits of a second supplier for the JSF are not worth the financial cost, leading to the termination of the alternate engine program. The Government Accountability Office confirmed that the Department of Defense's analysis focused only on potential savings for engine acquisition. The GAO witness reported to the committee that the Department of Defense's analysis only focused on potential savings for engine acquisition, not considering potential savings from competition for maintenance and operations. The committee agrees with this observation and recommends continuing the JSF alternate engine program for further analysis of costs and savings. An increase of $408.0 million is recommended for the program in fiscal year. The committee recommends an increase of $408.0 million to continue the JSF alternate engine program for fiscal year 2007, with a provision requiring the Department of the Navy and the Department of the Air Force to allocate funds for the development of an alternate engine for the Joint Strike Fighter. The committee recommends funding for the development of an alternate engine for the Joint Strike Fighter, with a provision for independent analyses and reporting to congressional defense committees by March 15, 2007. The Senate Armed Services Committee emphasizes the need for modernization and transformation of the armed forces to address irregular warfare threats. The Department has modernized and transformed the armed forces since 2001, supported by the committee with funds for ship construction, unmanned systems development, Joint Strike Fighter engine, Army's Future Combat Systems program, and an increase in budget. The committee supported modernization of the armed forces since 2001, including funding for ship construction, unmanned systems, Joint Strike Fighter engine, Army's Future Combat Systems program, and increased budget for science and technology programs. The committee emphasized the importance of developing capabilities for coalition operations and addressed concerns about engine competition in the Joint Strike Fighter program. The committee included a provision in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996 to evaluate two propulsion concepts for the Joint Strike Fighter program. Despite legislative direction to maintain a two-engine program, the committee remains concerned about the Department's proposal to eliminate the F136 alternate engine, citing operational and financial risks. The committee authorized $400.8 million for the development of an interchangeable engine in fiscal year 2007 to mitigate operational and financial risks of relying on one engine provider for multiple missions. They directed the Secretary of Defense to sustain the Joint Strike Fighter program with two competitive propulsion systems or consider a one-time contract for a single propulsion system throughout the aircraft's lifespan. The report recommended continuing the development and sustainment of the Joint Strike Fighter program with two competitive propulsion systems or opting for a one-time firm-fixed-price contract for a selected propulsion system throughout the aircraft's life cycle. The report recommended a one-time firm-fixed-price contract for a selected propulsion system for the aircraft's life cycle following the initial service release of the JSF F135 propulsion system in fiscal year 2008. Congress directed the Department of Defense to develop an engine to compete with Pratt & Whitney engines in the 1970s and 1980s due to persistent engine problems. This competition resulted in improved performance, reduced risk, increased readiness, lower cost of ownership, and improved contractor benefits. The competition for engine development for the JSF program in the 1970s and 1980s led to improved performance, reduced risk, increased readiness, and lower cost of ownership. Congress has consistently supported engine competition for the Joint Strike Fighter for over 10 years, resulting in significant cost savings of over $4.0 billion. The Joint Strike Fighter program, the largest in Department of Defense history, has seen significant cost savings through engine competition. Concerns arise over reliance on a single engine supplier for multiple missions, services, and nations, posing operational and financial risks. The termination of the F136 engine was justified with incomplete analysis. Total JSF deliveries may exceed 4,000 aircraft, with billions in propulsion business. The committee is concerned that the Department's analysis for terminating the F136 engine only accounted for 30% of engine costs over the aircraft's life cycle, failing to comply with economic analysis policy. A full life cycle analysis could show significant cost savings through a competitive engine strategy, generating savings and enduring value through competition. The committee recommends conducting independent life cycle cost analyses for the Joint Strike Fighter engine program to ensure full cost transparency and potential savings through a competitive engine strategy. The committee recommends directing the Secretary of Defense, a federally-funded research and development center, and the Comptroller General to conduct independent life cycle cost analyses for the Joint Strike Fighter program with two competitive propulsion systems. This aims to compare the costs of developing and sustaining the program with two engines versus proceeding with only one. The committee recommends independent life cycle cost analyses for the Joint Strike Fighter program with two competitive propulsion systems to compare costs of developing and sustaining the program with two engines versus one. Concerns were raised about the Department of Defense analysis not accounting for all costs over the aircraft's life cycle. The report discussed the JSF program and the lack of funding for the F136 interchangeable engine. The committee believes in supporting competitive propulsion systems to reduce operational risk and achieve more affordable life cycle costs. The committee recommends an increase of $200.4 million in PE 64800F and an increase of $200.4 million in PE 64800N for the continued development of the F136 interchangeable engine for the Joint Strike Fighter program. The conference report on H.R. 5631 discussed the JSF program and recommended an additional $170,000,000 in Research, Development. The conference report on H.R. 5631 recommended an additional $170,000,000 for the development of the F-136 engine for the Joint Strike Fighter program. The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics was directed to sponsor an independent cost analysis of the program, with a strong encouragement for the analysis to be conducted by the Institute for Defense Analyses. The conferees recommend an analysis of the costs and potential savings of developing the F-135 and F-136 fighter engines, to be conducted by the Institute for Defense Analyses. The analysis should also consider the impact on the industrial base. The results are due to be submitted to the congressional defense committees by March 15, 2007. The conferees recommend an analysis of the costs and potential savings of developing the F-135 and F-136 fighter engines, to be conducted by the Institute for Defense Analyses and submitted to the congressional defense committees by March 15, 2007.

They also authorize an increase of $430.0 million in RDT&E for continued F136 engine development and $130.0 million in Aircraft Procurement, Air Force, for F136 engine procurement. The Secretary of Defense is expected to comply with the direction in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008. The conferees expect compliance with the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 for F136 engine procurement and development of two options for the F-35 propulsion system. House Armed Services Committee recommends a net reduction of $122 million in Navy aircraft procurement funding for F-35Bs and Cs for the Marine Corps. The House Armed Services Committee recommends a net reduction of $122 million in Navy aircraft procurement funding for F-35Bs and Cs for the Marine Corps, including adjustments for the F136 alternate engine and spares. Additionally, there is an increase in Navy aircraft advance procurement funding for the F136 alternate engine. The House Armed Services Committee recommends adjustments in funding for F-35 aircraft procurement, including a net reduction of $67 million in Air Force procurement funding for F-35As and an increase of $153.5 million in Navy research and development funding for the F-35. Additionally, there are increases in funding for the F136 alternate engine and spares. The House Armed Services Committee recommends adjustments in funding for F-35 aircraft procurement, including a net reduction of $67 million in Air Force procurement funding for F-35As and an increase of $153.5 million in Navy research and development funding for the F-35 program. H.R. 2647 also includes provisions for the F-35 alternate engine program, with increases in funding for the F136 engine and reductions for program excess. H.R. 2647 includes provisions for the F-35 alternate engine program, with limits on FY2010 research and development funds until certain conditions are met. Section 218 of the bill restricts the obligation of funds for the F-35 Lightning II program until specific criteria are fulfilled. For fiscal year 2010, only 75 percent of funds for the F-35 Lightning II program can be used until specific conditions are met, including certification of funds for a competitive propulsion system and submission of a required report to congressional defense committees. The Secretary of Defense must submit reports to congressional defense committees regarding the F-35 Lightning II program and its competitive propulsion system development and procurement. The Secretary of Defense is required to include in the annual budget a request for funding for the development and procurement of a competitive propulsion system for the F-35 Lightning II. The Secretary of Defense must request funding for the development and procurement of a competitive propulsion system for the F-35 Lightning II in the annual budget. This funding should be included in future-years defense programs to ensure continued development and procurement of the propulsion system. The Secretary of Defense must ensure the full funding for the development and procurement of a competitive propulsion system for the F-35 Lightning II in the annual budget. This includes obligating and expending sufficient amounts for the continued development and procurement of two options for the propulsion system to ensure competitive production. The development and procurement of two options for the propulsion system for the F-35 Lightning II are essential for competitive production. The F-35 program is working on the F136 engine for this purpose. The House report recommends funding for the F-35 program's competitive F136 engine as an alternative to the F135 engine. This recommendation has been consistent in committee reports for the past three years. The committee recommended increases for the F-35 competitive propulsion system, in line with previous recommendations. Despite requirements for the development and procurement of a competitive propulsion system, the Department of Defense has not complied for three consecutive years. The committee is disappointed that the Department of Defense has not included funds for the competitive propulsion system for the F-35 in the budget request for the third consecutive year. The F135 engine development program has experienced cost growth since its inception in fiscal year 2002, with costs increasing from $4.828 billion to $6.7 billion by the end of 2008. The F135 engine development program costs increased by $1.872 billion, or 38 percent, reaching $6.7 billion by the end of 2008. Engine procurement costs for the F-35 variants also saw significant increases between December 2005 and December 2008, ranging from 38 to 47 percent. Between December 2005 and December 2008, engine procurement cost estimates for the F-35B increased by approximately 47 percent, attributed to both the F135 engine and the F-35B's lift fan. In contrast, the F136 engine program did not experience any cost growth. The F136 pre-EMD contract, initiated in 2002 and completed in 2004 for $411.0 million, remained stable without cost growth. The F136 EMD contract, awarded in 2005 for $2.486 billion, has also maintained a stable cost estimate since contract award. The committee is puzzled by the Department's decisions to exclude an engine competition given the rising costs of the F135 development and procurement. The committee is perplexed by the Department's decisions to not include an F-35 competitive propulsion system program in its budget requests, despite F135 cost increases and test failures. They believe a two-engine competitive program would offer better engine performance and a more robust industrial base. The committee recommends a total increase of $463.0 million for the competitive F-35 propulsion system program, citing better engine performance, improved contractor responsiveness, a more robust industrial base, increased engine reliability, and improved operational readiness. Additionally, they suggest an aggregate increase of $140.0 million for the procurement of four F136 engines. The committee recommends an aggregate increase of $140.0 million for the procurement of four F136 engines and related components for the F-35 program. The Administration objects to the additional funding for the alternative engine program. The Administration objects to the additional funding of $603 million for the alternative engine program, which will delay the fielding of the Joint Strike Fighter capability. They argue that the current engine is performing well and that expenditures on a second engine are unnecessary and impede the progress of the overall JSF program. The Administration opposes additional funding for a second engine in the JSF program, citing unnecessary expenditures and hindrance to progress. They argue that risks of fleet-wide grounding due to a single engine are exaggerated, as the Air Force operates several fleets with single-engine sources. The Administration also objects to limiting JSF development funding until all funds for the alternative engine program are obligated. If the final bill disrupts the F-35 program, the President's advisors would recommend a veto. In the FY2010 defense authorization bill, Division D recommends a net increase of $141.45 million in Navy and Air Force research and development funding for the F-35 program, including funding for the F136 alternate engine. If the final bill disrupts the F-35 program, the President's advisors would recommend a veto. The FY2010 defense authorization bill recommends a net increase of $141.45 million in Air Force research and development funding for the F-35 program, with $219.45 million allocated for the F136 alternate engine and a $78 million reduction for excess management reserves. Section 211 of S. 1390 focuses on the continued development of a competitive propulsion system for the Joint Strike Fighter program. The FY2010 defense authorization bill recommends increased funding for the F-35 program, with a focus on developing a competitive propulsion system for the Joint Strike Fighter program. The Secretary of Defense must certify sufficient funds for the continued development of the propulsion system before 90 percent of the allocated funds can be obligated. The committee recommends funding for the development and procurement of the F136 competitive propulsion system for the F-35 Lightning II in fiscal year 2010 to ensure the system's continued development and demonstration program. Plans for the F136 JSF propulsion system aim for completion by fiscal year 2012 for a competitive contract award concurrent with the sixth lot of low-rate initial production aircraft. The committee recommends funding for the development and procurement of the F136 competitive propulsion system for the F-35 Lightning II in fiscal year 2010 to ensure its continued development. The budget request included funds for the JSF program but not for the SDD phase of the F136 program. Studies by the Department of Defense, Institute for Defense Analyses, and Government Accountability Office suggest continuing the development of the F136 for the Nation's best interests. The committee recommends funding for the development of the F136 competitive propulsion system for the F-35 Lightning II in fiscal year 2010. Studies suggest that non-financial factors favor continuing the JSF competitive propulsion system program. The committee recommends an increase of $438.9 million for continuing the F136 SDD program for the F-35 Lightning II, with additional funding allocated to Navy and Air Force research and development. The recommendation was approved in full-committee markup by a vote of 12-10. The committee approved an increase of $438.9 million for the F136 SDD program for the F-35 Lightning II, with votes split 12-10. Senators in favor included Levin, Kennedy, Byrd, and others, while those opposed included Lieberman, Reed, and others. The Administration strongly objected to the addition of funds for the alternative engine program and provisions mandating it for the JSF. The Administration objects to the $438.9 million increase for the alternative engine program for the F-35 Lightning II. They argue that the current engine is performing well and that the risks of a single engine provider are manageable. They believe that expenditures on a second engine are unnecessary and impede the progress of the overall JSF program. The Air Force's JSF program faces objections regarding funding allocation and the alternative engine program for the F-35. The Administration opposes the increase for the alternative engine, citing the current engine's performance and manageable risks. A veto may be recommended if the final bill disrupts the F-35 program. The Senate rejected an amendment related to this issue. The Senate rejected an amendment (S.Amdt. 1767) to modify Section 211 for additional research and development funding for an alternate engine program. Instead, they adopted another amendment (S.Amdt. 1627) to remove the added funding for the alternate engine program. The Senate adopted an amendment (S.Amdt. 1627) to remove research and development funding for an alternate engine program in Section 211 of S. 1390. The amendment also prohibits the use of FY2010 funding on the alternate program until certain cost-effectiveness certifications are made by the Secretary of Defense. This aligns S. 1390 with the Administration's proposal to terminate the alternate engine program. The Senate preserved language from Sec. 211 to limit DOD's obligation of FY2010 F-35 research funds until certification of sufficient funds for propulsion system development. Additional funding for the alternate engine program was maintained, along with restoration of cuts to the UH-1Y/AH-1Z helicopter program. The Senate preserved funding for the alternate engine program and restored cuts to the UH-1Y/AH-1Z helicopter program and F-35 program management reserves. Funding for the HC/MC-130 aircraft program was reduced instead. SEC. 211 of S.Amdt. 1767 requires a certification from the Secretary of Defense before 90% of funds for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft program can be obligated for fiscal year 2010 to ensure continued development of a competitive propulsion system. The F-35 Lightning II aircraft program requires a competitive propulsion system for continued development in fiscal year 2010. An additional $282.9 million is allocated for the procurement of UH-1Y/AH-1Z rotary wing aircraft. Management reserves for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Program are being restored. The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Program receives increased funding for management reserves for both Navy and Air Force components. The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Program receives increased funding for management reserves, with $78,000,000 allocated to the program. Additionally, $438,900,000 is decreased from aircraft procurement for the Air Force to be used for the HC/MC-130 recapitalization program. The Senate Armed Services Committee is proposing restrictions on the use of FY2010 F-35 research and development funds until the Secretary of Defense certifies sufficient funds for a competitive propulsion system. The new language prohibits spending on an alternate engine program until cost-effectiveness certifications are made. The Senate Armed Services Committee is proposing restrictions on the use of FY2010 F-35 research and development funds until the Secretary of Defense certifies sufficient funds for a competitive propulsion system. The new language prohibits spending on an alternate engine program until cost-effectiveness certifications are made. Additionally, the text of S.Amdt. 1627 includes limitations on funding for the alternate propulsion system for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program and an increase in funding for the procurement of UH-1Y/AH-1Z rotary wing aircraft. SEC. 211 limits funds for an alternative propulsion system for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program until the Secretary of Defense certifies cost-effectiveness. It also increases funding for UH-1Y/AH-1Z rotary wing aircraft procurement. The funding for an alternate propulsion system for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program is limited until the Secretary of Defense certifies cost-effectiveness and operational readiness. Additionally, there is an increase in funding for UH-1Y/AH-1Z rotary wing aircraft procurement. The amount authorized for aircraft procurement for the Navy is increased by $282,900,000 for UH-1Y/AH-1Z rotary wing aircraft. Additionally, $78,000,000 is allocated for the restoration of management reserves for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. The authorized amount for the Navy's research, development, test, and evaluation is increased by $78,000,000 for the Joint Strike Fighter program. The Air Force's amount for the same purpose is also increased by $78,000,000 for the Joint Strike Fighter program. The authorized amount for the Navy's research, development, test, and evaluation for the Joint Strike Fighter program is increased by $78,000,000. For the Air Force, the amount is also increased by $78,000,000. Additionally, $219,450,000 is decreased from the Navy and Air Force Joint Strike Fighter F136 development budgets. The Air Force's research, development, test, and evaluation budget is reduced by $219,450,000 for the Joint Strike Fighter program. The FY2010 DOD Appropriations Bill (H.R. 3326) was signed into law on December 19, 2009, as P.L. 111-118. The FY2010 DOD Appropriations Bill (H.R. 3326) was signed into law on December 19, 2009, as P.L. 111-118. The explanatory statement provided $2,083.8 million for Air Force F-35 procurement, including funds for the F-35 alternate engine program. The FY2010 DOD Appropriations Bill allocated $2,083.8 million for Air Force F-35 procurement, with an additional $35 million for the F-35 alternate engine program. Air Force and Navy research and development funding for the Joint Strike Fighter program saw a $215 million increase each, with the extra funds designated for the alternate engine program. The FY2010 DOD Appropriations Bill allocated $1,956.3 million for the Fighter program, including $215 million for the F-35 alternate engine program. Concerns persist about the cost and schedule issues of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, as reported by the Joint Estimating Team. The Department projects cost growth and schedule issues for the JSF program, but insists it is on track. $6,840,478,000 is allocated for JSF procurement as a congressional special interest item. The Secretary of Defense must ensure all 30 aircraft are procured as requested. The Under Secretary of Defense is directed to provide findings from the JET and recent studies on the test program. The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics must provide findings from the JET and recent studies on the test program to congressional defense committees by January 15, 2010. The House Appropriations Committee recommends a net increase of $18.6 million in Air Force procurement funding for the F-35 program and an increase of $215 million in Navy research and development funding for the F-35. The report highlights increases in funding for the F-35 alternate engine program, with a total increase of $130 million for non-recurring engineering and $215 million each for Navy and Air Force research and development. The Committee aims to reverse the trend of terminating programs prematurely and emphasizes realistic budgeting aligned with available funding. The Committee supports realistic budgeting aligned with available funding and aims to reverse the trend of terminating programs prematurely. They believe that continuing certain efforts, such as the presidential helicopter program, may yield significant payback. The Committee supports realistic budgeting and aims to reverse the trend of terminating programs prematurely. They believe that continuing efforts like the presidential helicopter program could yield significant payback. The report highlights the potential benefits of the Joint Strike Fighter alternative engine for the F-35 Lightning II program. The Department's original plan for the F-35 propulsion engine was to have two variants, but cost growth led to the abandonment of the alternate engine program. Currently, all three variants of the F-35 aircraft will be powered by the same engine, raising concerns about potential technical problems in the future. The Committee is concerned about potential technical problems with the F-35 engine that could ground the entire fleet of aircraft, limiting the Commander-in-Chief's flexibility during a crisis. They also highlight the lack of competition in the Joint Strike Fighter engine program, which could lead to significant cost savings with over 2,500 aircraft planned for the program. The Committee questions the Department's decision not to fund an alternate engine program for the F-35, despite a business case showing similar costs for a dual source strategy. With significant upfront development costs already invested, the Committee sees the dual source strategy as the way forward. The Committee recommends an additional $560,000,000 for the continued development and production of the alternate engine for the Joint Strike Fighter, as the dual source strategy is deemed the most cost-effective method moving forward. The Secretary of Defense is directed to include funding for the alternate engine program in future budget requests for the Joint Strike Fighter (F-35) program, despite objections from the Administration regarding the unnecessary expenditures on the alternate engine. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommends no funding for the development of an alternate engine for the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program, despite objections from the President. The current engine is performing well, and the risks of a single engine provider are manageable. If the final bill disrupts the F-35 program, the President's advisors would recommend a veto. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommends no funding for the development of an alternate engine for the F-35 program in the FY2011 Defense Authorization Act. The House Armed Services Committee included $485 million for the alternate engine in H.R. 5136, with a provision limiting DOD's spending on the F-35 program until all alternate engine funds are obligated. The FY2011 Defense Authorization Act limits the obligation of funds for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft program until all funds for a competitive propulsion system are obligated. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommends no funding for an alternate engine for the F-35 program. The FY2011 Defense Authorization Act restricts the procurement of more than 30 F-35 Lightning II aircraft until funds for a competitive propulsion system are obligated. The FY2011 Defense Authorization Act limits the procurement of over 30 F-35 Lightning II aircraft until funds for a competitive propulsion system are obligated. The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics must certify to the congressional defense committees by January 15, 2011, regarding the advance procurement funds for F136 engines. H.R. 5136 requires the inclusion of alternate engine funding in DOD's annual budget submission and mandates the completion of 1,000 test hours in the F136 system development and demonstration program. The Secretary of Defense must include funding for alternate engine in DOD's annual budget submission for the competitive propulsion system of F-35 Lightning II aircraft. The Secretary of Defense is required to request funding for the development and procurement of a competitive propulsion system for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft in the defense budget materials for fiscal year 2012 and beyond. Additionally, in each future-years defense program, there must be sufficient funding allocated for the continued development and procurement of the propulsion system for the F-35 aircraft. The Secretary of Defense must ensure full funding for the development and procurement of a competitive propulsion system for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft in each fiscal year. This includes obligating and expending sufficient amounts for two options for the propulsion system. The Secretary of Defense must ensure full funding for the development and procurement of two options for the propulsion system for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft in each fiscal year to ensure competitive production. The Secretary of Defense must ensure full funding for the development and procurement of two options for the propulsion system for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft in each fiscal year to ensure competitive production. H.R. 5136 designated the competitive F-35 engine programs as major subprograms, imposing more stringent oversight and reporting requirements. Section 213 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 is repealed. The Secretary of Defense designated the F135 and F136 engine development and procurement programs as major subprograms of the F-35 Lightning II aircraft, ensuring competitive production. The F135 and F136 engine development and procurement programs for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft are designated as major subprograms in accordance with section 2430a of title 10, United States Code. The Secretary will use the Milestone B decision as the original baseline for reporting requirements, and may restructure the F-35 program following critical cost growth. The Secretary may restructure the F-35 Lightning II aircraft program following critical cost growth, including the F135 and F136 engine development programs, based on the original baseline for reporting requirements. The Secretary may restructure the F-35 Lightning II aircraft program based on the original baseline for reporting requirements, meeting the requirements of section 2433a of title 10, United States Code for a major subprogram designated under subsection (a). The Secretary of Defense is required to reassess and take actions for a subprogram under the F-35 program. If programmatic changes cause the unit cost to increase by a certain threshold, the requirements of the program are not considered met. The report on H.R. 5136 also addresses the F-35 alternate engine program. The report on H.R. 5136 includes language on the F-35 alternate engine program, with details on the budget request for development and procurement of F-35 aircraft. The competitive F-35 propulsion system program is working on the F136 engine. The committee recommended increases for the F-35 competitive propulsion system, including the development of the F136 engine as an alternative to the F135 engine. Despite the requirement in the National Defense Authorization Act, funds have been appropriated by Congress for this purpose. The committee recommended funding for the development of a competitive propulsion system for the F-35, but the Department of Defense has not included funds for this purpose in the budget request for the fifth consecutive year. This goes against the spirit and intent of the law. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported significant cost increases in the F135 development program and procurement of F135 engines for the F-35 between December 2005 and December 2008. The F135 engine development cost is now estimated at $7.3 billion, a 50 percent increase over the original contract award. Additionally, the negotiated prices for the F-35B and F-35A engines were significantly higher than budget estimates in fiscal year 2009. The F135 engine development program experienced significant cost increases, with the negotiated unit cost for the F-35A engine being 42 percent higher than budgeted. A Joint Assessment Team (JAT) reviewed the cost structure and concluded that improvement plans by the engine contractor were credible but challenging, requiring additional investment for cost reduction initiatives. The Deputy Secretary of Defense submitted an update on the competitive engine program to the committee in February 2010. The Deputy Secretary of Defense updated the committee on the competitive engine program, stating that an additional $2.9 billion investment over six years is needed to complete the F136 engine development for competitive procurement of F-35 engines in 2017. The report also highlighted that long-term costs for a one-engine or two-engine competitive acquisition strategy are the same. The committee questions the Department's decision to not include a competitive F-35 engine program in its budget requests despite cost increases. They believe that a two-engine competitive program would offer better engine performance, improved contractor responsiveness, a more robust industrial base, increased engine reliability, and improved operational readiness. The committee recommends a $485.0 million increase for the competitive engine program for the F-35, citing benefits such as a more robust industrial base, increased engine reliability, and improved operational readiness. The F-35 Joint Program Office and contractor have not met cost and schedule expectations, leading to additional reviews of the program. The Department of Defense conducted reviews of the F-35 program, including the JET 2 update in 2009 and an independent manufacturing review. JET 2 estimated a 30-month delay and $3.0 billion increase in costs, while the IMRT found high production risks. To mitigate risks, the Department took steps to address development and production challenges. The Department of Defense proposes measures to reduce production risks in the F-35 program, including procuring an additional test aircraft, setting up a software simulation facility, using operational F-35s for testing, adjusting production plans, and increasing budget for development. These actions are expected to delay completion by 13 months and reduce planned production by 122 aircraft. The Department of Defense is taking steps to reduce production risks in the F-35 program by increasing the budget for development and production. This will delay completion by 13 months and cost an additional $2.8 billion. The program is expected to exceed unit cost thresholds by more than 50 percent compared to the original estimate. The F-35 program faces challenges with late delivery of test aircraft and unrealistic system development and test plans, according to the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics. The program's concurrency of development, test, and production activities is unprecedented. The F-35 program is facing challenges with late delivery of test aircraft and unrealistic system development and test plans. The Department of Defense intends to procure up to 307 aircraft at a cost of $58.2 billion before completing developmental flight testing by mid-fiscal year 2015. The committee notes concerns about the Department requesting a total of 550 aircraft before completing developmental testing, representing over 22 percent of the planned procurement of 2,443 F-35s. The Department plans to request 550 aircraft by spring 2015, which is over 22% of the total planned procurement of 2,443 F-35s. Despite concerns raised by various findings, the request for 43 F-35 aircraft in fiscal year 2011 remains unchanged from projections made in fiscal year 2009. The GAO highlighted significant risks and potential costly changes due to ongoing development testing. The committee is concerned about the significant risks and impacts of required design changes for the F-35 aircraft. They recommend reducing the production ramp rate until developmental testing is complete. The committee suggests authorizing the budget request for 42 aircraft for fiscal year 2011, contingent on the completion of certain milestones by the Department. The committee recommends authorizing the budget request for 42 aircraft in fiscal year 2011, subject to completion of certain milestones by the Department. Certification by key officials is required before procurement of more than 30 F-35 aircraft can proceed. The Administration strongly objects to the addition of $485 million for the extra engine program for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) and associated legislative provisions that limit overall JSF development funding to 75 percent until funds for FY 2011 have been obligated for the extra engine program. The Future Years Defense Plan includes funding for the F135 and F136 engine development programs. Secretary Gates mentioned that an additional $2.4 billion would be needed for the extra engine. The Department does not believe this cost will be recovered through competition. The current engine has performed well with over 13,000 ground test and 200 flight test hours. The current engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program has performed well with over 13,000 ground test and 200 flight test hours. If the final bill includes funding for an extra engine program, the President's advisors would recommend a veto. The report recommends a certification requirement before further funding for the alternate engine. The committee recommends a provision that would require the Secretary of Defense to certify that the development of the alternate propulsion system for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program will reduce costs, improve operational readiness, and not disrupt the program before spending additional funds on the F136 engine. The Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act For Fiscal Year 2011 did not specify funding for the F-35 alternate engine. The House and Senate Armed Services Committees issued a joint explanatory statement regarding the program, ensuring it will not disrupt the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. The joint explanatory statement from the Armed Services Committees addressed H.R. 6523, amending the House language to designate an F-35 engine development and production subprogram as a major subprogram. The Secretary of Defense must designate this program within 30 days of the Act's enactment. The Secretary of Defense must designate the F-35 Lightning II aircraft program as a major subprogram within 30 days of the Act's enactment, using the Milestone B decision as the original baseline for reporting requirements. Subsequent restructuring may occur following a reassessment and actions required by section 2433a of title 10, United States Code. The F-35 Lightning II aircraft program is designated as a major subprogram with reporting requirements based on the original baseline. Actions taken in fiscal year 2010 meet the requirements of the program. Actions taken in fiscal year 2010 for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft program meet the reporting requirements of the major subprogram designated under subsection (a). These actions are considered to meet the requirements of section 2433a of title 10, United States Code, to the extent that designation as a major subprogram would necessitate a reassessment and actions pursuant to the section. Additional programmatic changes post-enactment of this Act may require further reassessment and actions to meet the section's requirements. The FY2011 Defense Appropriations Act included $450 million for the F-35 alternate engine, added by a vote of 11-5 in the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee markup. The subcommittee report allocated $450 million for the F-35 alternate engine program, approved by an 11-5 vote. The House and Senate did not pass a separate defense bill for FY2011, leading to a continuing resolution maintaining spending at FY2010 levels. The F-35 alternate engine program was funded at the FY2010 level until a stop-work order was issued on March 24, 2011. The FY2011 DOD and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, signed into law on April 15, 2011, provided funding for the Department of Defense for the remainder of FY2011. This included a vote to eliminate $450 million for the alternate engine program. The FY2011 Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act (H.R. 1473) signed into law on April 15, 2011, provided DOD funding for the remainder of FY2011, excluding funds for the F-35 alternate engine program. Congress's interest in establishing this program may have been influenced by the \"Great Engine War\" between Pratt & Whitney and General Electric from 1984 to 1994. The Air Force's interest in pursuing an alternate engine for the F-16 stemmed from frustrations with Pratt & Whitney's management of the F100 engine. Congress funded General Electric's development of the F101 engine through the Engine Model Derivative Program (EMDP) after contentious hearings in 1979. In 1979, Congress funded General Electric's development of the F101 engine through the Engine Model Derivative Program (EMDP) for the F-16. The F110 engine was developed as an alternate to the F100, with DOD spending over $376 million on its development. Annual competitions for engine procurement were controversial but believed to produce better engines at lower costs. Proponents believed that competition for engine procurement generated benefits for the Department of Defense, such as better contract terms, warranties, and long-term support. This approach was seen as more beneficial than purchasing from a single company without competition. Some critics, however, argued that it could jeopardize combat effectiveness and pilot survivability. The Great Engine War resulted in better contract terms, warranties, and long-term support for the Department of Defense. Competition led to engine improvements being offered earlier than expected by the incumbent, Pratt & Whitney. The Air Force demanded cost projections from General Electric and Pratt & Whitney before the first contract award. Force demanded cost projections from General Electric and Pratt & Whitney for six years, including production of engines, support equipment, spare engines, technical data, and dual sourcing data for operations and support. Contractors were held to these projections with firm-fixed price contracts for six years, a new practice before the Great Engine War. The DOD required contractors to provide cost projections for future operations and support work, including dual sourcing of critical parts. The GE Rolls-Royce Fighter Engine Team decided to discontinue self-funded development of the engine. The GE Rolls-Royce Fighter Engine Team has decided to terminate self-funded development of the F136 engine for the Joint Strike Fighter due to uncertainty in the JSF Program schedules. The decision was made jointly by GE and Rolls-Royce leadership, with the engine development nearly 80 percent complete. The GE Rolls-Royce Fighter Engine Team has decided to terminate self-funded development of the F136 engine for the Joint Strike Fighter despite being almost 80 percent complete. The U.S. Department of Defense terminated the program, leading to the end of the F136 development work. The team will fulfill its termination responsibilities with the federal government after 15 years of developing a competitive fighter engine for the JSF. The FET developed a competitive fighter engine for JSF with advanced propulsion technologies, accumulating over 1,200 hours of testing before the program was terminated. GE and Rolls-Royce consistently delivered on cost and schedule, receiving high marks from the DoD. They advocated for defense acquisition reform and offered fixed-price proposals for F136 production engines. GE and Rolls-Royce, grateful for Congressional support, advocate for defense acquisition reform by offering fixed-price proposals for F136 production engines for the JSF program. They believe competition is essential for meaningful reform."
