    "content": "The \"Second Opinion Coverage Act of 2005\" is cited in this Act, which covers second opinions in group health plans under the Public Health Service Act. Group health plans and health insurance issuers must provide or authorize a second opinion by a qualified healthcare professional when requested by a participant, beneficiary, or enrollee questioning the necessity of recommended surgical procedures. Group health plans and health insurance issuers must provide or authorize a second opinion by a qualified healthcare professional when a participant questions the reasonableness or necessity of recommended surgical procedures, diagnosis, or plan of care for serious conditions. This includes situations where clinical indications are unclear, diagnosis is in doubt, or conflicting test results are present. If a healthcare professional is unable to diagnose a condition, the participant can request an additional diagnosis. This can also happen if the treatment plan is not improving the medical condition within a reasonable time frame, and the participant wants a second opinion. If a participant has serious concerns about their diagnosis or plan of care, they can consult an appropriately qualified health care professional for a second opinion. This professional must be a primary care physician or specialist with relevant clinical background and expertise. The second opinion must be provided by a healthcare professional with relevant clinical background and expertise. Timely opinions are required, especially in cases where the individual's health is at serious risk. The second opinion must be timely and provided by a healthcare professional with relevant expertise to address serious health threats. Timelines for responding to requests must be filed within 90 days of enactment, with a maximum 72-hour limit for non-emergency cases. The timelines for responding to emergency needs, urgent care, and other requests must be met within 90 days of enactment, with a 30-day limit for any amendments. Liability for costs is limited if a second opinion is approved by a group health plan or issuer. If a participant seeks a second opinion from their primary care physician, it must be provided by a qualified healthcare professional of their choice within the same physician organization. For second opinions from specialists, the individual can choose any provider from an independent practice association or medical group. Liabilities for costs are limited if the second opinion is approved by the group health plan or issuer. If a participant seeks a second opinion from their primary care physician, it must be provided by a qualified healthcare professional of their choice within the same physician organization. For second opinions from specialists, the individual can choose any provider from an independent practice association or medical group. The plan or issuer will cover the cost or negotiate fee arrangements for the second opinion if the specialist is not within the same physician organization. If not authorized by the plan or issuer, additional medical opinions not within the original physician organization shall be the responsibility of the enrollee. If there is no participating provider meeting standards in the network, the plan must authorize a second opinion from a qualified health professional outside the network. The plan considers the enrollee's ability to travel for the second opinion but is not responsible for travel costs. The plan or issuer must require a second opinion health professional to provide a consultation report to the participant, beneficiary, or enrollee and the initial health professional, including any recommended procedures or tests. The plan can also authorize additional medical opinions based on its independent determination. The plan or issuer can authorize additional medical opinions independently for a participant's medical condition. If a request for a second opinion is denied, the participant must be notified in writing with reasons for the denial and informed of the right to file a grievance. Services must be obtained from participating providers unless authorized by the plan or issuer. The participant must obtain services from a provider participating in the plan or issuer's network. Referrals may be limited to network providers. Exemption applies to health care plans with preferred provider contracts. Service plan contracts under group health plans must provide benefits to enrollees through preferred provider contracting arrangements without limiting access to second opinions. Additionally, notice requirements under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 must be followed. Amendments to section 2723(c) of the Act include references to sections 2704 and 2707. Amendments to section 2723(c) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 include adding references to sections 2704 and 2707. \"SEC. 714.

The requirement is considered a material modification for notice purposes under the plan. The summary description required under section 104(b)(1) for a modification must be provided within 60 days after the first plan year in which the requirement applies. Additionally, sections 731(c) and 732(a) of the Act are amended, and a new item is added to the table of contents. Coverage of second opinions is added to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 under section 9813. Coverage of second opinions is included in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 under section 9813, with requirements similar to those in the Public Health Service Act. The provisions of section 2707 apply to health insurance coverage in the individual market, with notice requirements similar to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. The Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 is amended to include requirements for group health plans. Effective dates for the amendments vary for group health plans and individual health insurance coverage. The Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 is amended to include requirements for group health plans, with effective dates specified for group health plans and individual health insurance coverage. The amendments apply to group health plans for plan years starting on or after January 1, 2006, and to individual health insurance coverage in the individual market on or after that date. A collective bargaining exception is noted for group health plans maintained under ratified agreements before the enactment date. For collective bargaining agreements ratified before the enactment date, the amendments to the Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 do not apply to plan years starting before January 1, 2006. For collective bargaining agreements ratified before January 1, 2006, plan amendments made to conform to new requirements are not considered termination of the agreement. The Secretaries of Labor, Treasury, and Health and Human Services will coordinate administration through an interagency memorandum of understanding. The Secretaries of Labor, Treasury, and Health and Human Services will ensure regulations and enforcement policies are coordinated to avoid duplication and have the same effect at all times."
