    "content": "Congress has been grappling with reauthorizing the Indian Health Care Improvement Act for over five years. The Act authorizes various specific Indian Health Service programs, including health professional recruitment, mental health services, urban Indian health services, and construction of health facilities. The Indian Health Care Improvement Act authorizes various specific Indian Health Service programs, including health services, construction and repair of health facilities, and IHS reimbursement by health programs. Congress continues to appropriate funds for the programs, with ongoing negotiations for reauthorization bills. Ongoing negotiations have led to a series of IHCIA reauthorization bills in the 106th-109th Congresses. The first bill, S. 1057, was reported in March 2006. A similar House bill, H.R. 5312, was referred to three committees and reported by the Resources Committee in June. A Senate Finance Committee bill, S. 3524, addressing Indian health provisions in Medicaid, Medicare, and SCHIP, was reported in July. The Committee reported a bill addressing Indian health provisions in Medicaid, Medicare, and SCHIP. Congress faces a multi-billion-dollar problem related to Indian trust funds, with claims against the United States by Indian individuals and tribes totaling as much as $176 billion. This issue has also led to the controversial reorganization of two agencies. The Indian trust fund issue has led to lawsuits and the reorganization of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Office of Special Trustee for American Indians. The funds' asset value is about $3.3 billion, with $2.9 billion in tribal accounts and $400 million in Individual Indian Money accounts. Trust lands total about 56 million acres. The Indian trust fund issue, totaling $3.3 billion, includes $2.9 billion in tribal accounts and $400 million in Individual Indian Money accounts. The Treasury Department manages the accounts, with historical criticism towards the Bureau of Indian Affairs for mismanagement. The American Indian Trust Fund Management Reform Act of 1994 aimed to improve trust fund management. The American Indian Trust Fund Management Reform Act of 1994 aimed to reform the management of Indian trust funds and assets, leading to the creation of the Office of the Special Trustee (OST) to oversee trust management reforms. Lawsuits, including Cobell v. Norton, were filed by IIM account holders and tribes demanding an accounting of their funds and correction of fund mismanagement. The Cobell v. Norton lawsuit and other tribal suits have prompted the reorganization of the BIA and OST, as well as congressional consideration for settling IIM and tribal claims related to trust fund mismanagement. The district court found in 1999 that DOI and Treasury breached their trust duties regarding document retention, data gathering, and trust management systems. They were ordered to bring trust management up to current standards. The court ordered DOI and Treasury to bring trust management up to current standards. The final stage of the lawsuit will determine the amount of money owed to the IIM plaintiffs, with different proposals for historical accounting methods. DOI proposed reconciling transactions above a certain value, while the plaintiffs suggested using databases to estimate the total amount due. The district court ordered DOI to conduct a historical accounting of all IIM trust account transactions and assets since 1887 without using statistical sampling. DOI estimated compliance would cost $12-13 billion. U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit overturned the district court's orders twice. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit overturned the district court's order for historical accounting since 1887, estimating compliance costs at $12-13 billion. The DOI continues its historical accounting plan, with Congress addressing the Cobell suit through oversight hearings and provisions in Interior appropriation acts. The conference committee rejected the need for a historical accounting on the scale ordered by the court in the 1994 Act. Congress is concerned about the costs of the Cobell lawsuit impacting trust reform and other Indian programs. Current costs include ongoing litigation expenses, with potential future costs estimated at $12-$13 billion for historical accounting. Possible future costs for Indian programs include $12-$13 billion for court-ordered historical accounting, a potential Cobell settlement, and more than $100 billion estimated to be owed to Cobell plaintiffs. Funding sources may include discretionary appropriations and the Treasury Department's \"Judgment Fund,\" although some consider the Fund insufficient for the large costs. Possible future costs for Indian programs include a $12-$13 billion court-ordered historical accounting and potential Cobell settlement. Funding sources may involve discretionary appropriations and the Treasury Department's \"Judgment Fund,\" which some view as insufficient. Congress has introduced settlement bills in the 109th Congress to establish an IIM accounting-claim settlement fund for distribution to claimants. The introduced bills aim to establish a settlement fund for IIM claimants, create a commission for trust asset management review, increase payments for individual Indian trust interests, implement a tribal trust management project, restructure BIA and OST under a new Under Secretary for Indian Affairs, and mandate annual independent audits of all Indian trust funds. Hearings were held on S. 1439 by the Senate Indian Affairs Committee. The Senate Indian Affairs Committee held hearings on S. 1439 in July 2005 and March 28, 2006. H.R. 4322 is awaiting further committee action. A Senate Indian Affairs Committee mark-up of an amended S. 1439 with a settlement amount of $8 billion was scheduled for August 2 but withdrawn at the Administration's request for more negotiations. The DOI, BIA, and OST have made administrative and organizational changes to implement trust management reform since the 1994 Act. A significant change was the transfer of trust fund management from BIA to OST in 1996. In 2003, DOI initiated a reorganization separating BIA trust management operations from other services at regional and agency levels, creating OST field operations. The DOI's ongoing reorganization splits BIA trust management operations from other services, creating OST field operations to oversee trust management. Tribal leaders and Cobell plaintiffs oppose the reorganization, citing lack of consultation and undefined OST duties. DOI claims prior consultation with tribes and defends the reorganization process. The DOI's reorganization of trust management operations has faced opposition from tribal leaders and Cobell plaintiffs due to lack of consultation and unclear OST duties. Despite attempts to halt the reorganization in Congress, bills proposing changes in DOI and BIA trust management have not progressed. S. 1439 and H.R. 4322 aim to reorganize DOI's management of Indian trust assets. S. 1439 and H.R. 4322 propose reorganizing DOI management of Indian trust assets. The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA) regulates gambling on Indian reservations and certain lands, aiming for tribal economic development. IGRA prohibits gaming on trust lands acquired after 1988, with exceptions for specific circumstances. The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA) prohibits gaming on trust lands acquired after 1988, with exceptions for specific circumstances such as tribes without reservations in 1988, newly recognized tribes, restored tribes, and land-claim settlements. Critics argue that these exceptions lead to \"reservation shopping\" and undermine on-reservation economic development intended by Congress. Two bills, S. 2078 and H.R. 4893, aim to curb exceptions in the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act that allow gaming on trust lands acquired after 1988. These exceptions have been criticized for promoting \"reservation shopping\" and hindering on-reservation economic development. The bills eliminate the requirement for secretarial and gubernatorial agreement but allow applications filed before specific dates in 2006 to proceed. H.R. 4893 also adds a geographic limitation to lands with a \"nexus\" to the tribe. Exceptions for tribes without reservations in 1988, newly recognized tribes, and restored tribes are retained with some limitations. The bills, S. 2078 and H.R. 4893, aim to restrict exceptions in the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act for gaming on trust lands acquired after 1988. H.R. 4893 adds a new exception for tribes landless on the date of its enactment, with limitations similar to newly recognized tribes. Opponents argue that the bills impose unfair burdens on newly recognized, restored, and landless tribes. Opponents of bills S. 2078 and H.R. 4893 argue that they add new and unfair burdens on newly recognized, restored, and landless tribes, with H.R. 4893 requiring mitigation agreements that they see as unprecedented subjection of tribal sovereignty to local governments. H.R. 4893 failed to pass in the House on September 13. Native Hawaiians, the indigenous people of Hawaii, are not currently considered Indians under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. Native Hawaiians, indigenous to Hawaii, lack federal recognition as Indians and a political entity recognized by the government. Despite this, Congress has authorized federal programs for their benefit. Supporters fear that the absence of recognition puts Native Hawaiian programs at risk of legal challenges claiming they are race-based. Native Hawaiian programs face legal challenges as they lack federal recognition. Congressional action is needed for a Native Hawaiian political entity to be recognized, with three bills in the 109th Congress aiming to establish this process. Details on governmental powers and lands are left for later negotiations. The bills in the 109th Congress aim to establish a process for recognizing a Native Hawaiian political entity, excluding them from BIA programs and the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. Proponents argue that Congress has the power to recognize them based on their constitutional authority over indigenous peoples in the US. Proponents argue that Congress has a special relationship with Native Hawaiians similar to that with Indian tribes, citing established programs like the Hawaiian homelands program. They claim Native Hawaiians did not give up sovereignty but had it forcibly taken in the 1893 overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii. Native Hawaiians argue that their sovereignty was forcibly withdrawn in the 1893 overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii, led by Americans with support from certain U.S. officials and armed forces. They maintain a distinct community with cultural and political institutions, similar to Indian tribes. Opponents dispute Congress's authority to recognize Native Hawaiians as they do with Indian tribes. Opponents argue that Congress lacks constitutional authority to recognize a Native Hawaiian political entity, as it does not extend to all indigenous peoples. They also believe the US does not have a special responsibility to Native Hawaiians like it does for Indian tribes. Additionally, they argue that recognition of a Native Hawaiian entity would be solely based on race, without meeting criteria such as geography, community, and political autonomy. Opponents argue that Native Hawaiian recognition would set a precedent for political recognition of other non-Indian groups based on race. The U.S. Civil Rights Commission opposed the passage of S. 147 citing racial discrimination concerns. Some opponents dispute claims about Native Hawaiian sovereignty, stating that it ended before 1893 or resided in the monarch. The bills S. 147 and H.R. 309, which address Native Hawaiian sovereignty, have been extensively considered in previous Congresses. S. 147 was reported by the Senate Indian Affairs Committee in 2005. An amended version, S. 3064, was introduced in 2006 but failed to proceed in the Senate. Arguments against Native Hawaiian recognition include concerns about racial discrimination and disputes over the timing and nature of sovereignty. The Senate failed to invoke cloture on a motion to proceed with considering S. 147 and S. 3064, effectively ending Senate consideration of the bills. H.R. 309 was referred to the House Resources Committee and has not been reported. The House Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on the Constitution held a hearing on constitutional issues raised by H.R. 309."
