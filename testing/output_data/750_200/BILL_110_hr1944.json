The Act \"Veterans Traumatic Brain Injury Treatment Act of 2007\" establishes a screening program for eligible veterans to screen for symptoms of traumatic brain injury. The Secretary is required to submit an annual report to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs regarding the number of veterans screened under the program. The House of Representatives requires a report on the number of veterans screened for traumatic brain injury symptoms, prevalence of symptoms, and recommendations for improving care. Additionally, a comprehensive program for long-term traumatic brain injury rehabilitation is mandated by the Act. The Act mandates a comprehensive program for long-term traumatic brain injury rehabilitation, including residential, community, and home-based components at four designated polytrauma network sites for eligible veterans who served in combat theaters. The program developed under subsection (a) is for eligible veterans who served in combat theaters, have moderate to severe traumatic brain injury, and are unable to manage daily activities without assistance. The program developed under subsection (a) is for eligible veterans with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury who require assistance with daily activities. The Secretary must submit an annual report to Congress detailing the program's operation, number of veterans served, and annual operating costs. Additionally, there are Traumatic Brain Injury Transition Offices established under Section 1793. The Secretary must establish Traumatic Brain Injury Transition Offices at Department polytrauma network sites to coordinate healthcare and services for veterans with moderate to severe traumatic brain injuries. These offices can enter into cooperative agreements and aim to provide care not immediately available within the Department. The Secretary can arrange for health-care and services through cooperative agreements with entities that have neurobehavioral rehabilitation programs. A Traumatic Brain Injury Veterans' Health Registry will be established to maintain information on traumatic brain injuries. The Traumatic Brain Injury Veterans' Health Registry, referred to as the `Registry', will list individuals from Operation Enduring Freedom or Operation Iraqi Freedom with symptoms of traumatic brain injury seeking care or filing compensation claims. The Traumatic Brain Injury Veterans' Health Registry includes individuals from Operation Enduring Freedom or Operation Iraqi Freedom who file compensation claims based on associated disabilities. Relevant medical data and other information can be included in the Registry with the individual's permission or if the individual is deceased. The Secretary will notify individuals in the Traumatic Brain Injury Veterans' Health Registry of important research developments on the health effects of military service in Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. Subchapter IX of title 38, United States Code, includes provisions for screening, rehabilitation, transition offices, and a registry for traumatic brain injuries. The Secretary must implement these requirements within 180 days of the enactment of the Act."
