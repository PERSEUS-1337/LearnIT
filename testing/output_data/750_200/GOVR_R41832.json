    "content": "Pakistan's stability, democracy, and prosperity are crucial to U.S. interests due to its role in combating religious militancy and addressing various policy concerns such as terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and regional tensions with India. The country is known for hosting extremist groups and being a rapid nuclear weapons proliferator, making it a top priority on the international security agenda. Pakistan's cooperation with U.S.-led counterterrorism efforts has been praised, but doubts about its commitment to core U.S. interests have deepened. The country's mixed record on battling Islamist extremism includes tolerance of Afghan insurgents and anti-India militants. Pakistan's troubled economy, political instability, and difficult relations with neighboring countries pose security challenges. Pakistan's troubled economic conditions, precarious political setting, and history of difficult relations with neighbors present serious challenges to U.S. decision makers. The spread of Islamist radicalism and the presence of insurgents in the border region near Afghanistan have cost Pakistan thousands of civilian lives and billions in financial losses. In 2011, Pakistan faced over 26 terrorist attacks per week, resulting in significant civilian and security force casualties, as well as financial losses. The revelation of Osama bin Laden's presence in Pakistan strained the relationship with the U.S., leading to increased scrutiny and tension. In 2011, the U.S. government scrutinized the tense relationship with Pakistan, with Admiral Mike Mullen accusing Pakistan of supporting Afghan insurgents. NATO troops were attacked by Pakistani army outposts in November, leading to retaliatory airstrikes and 24 Pakistani soldiers dead. In late November, NATO troops in Afghanistan were attacked by Pakistani army outposts at Salala, resulting in 24 Pakistani soldiers dead. A Pentagon investigation blamed poor coordination and miscommunication, leading to fury in Pakistan. Pakistani officials moved to scrap and renegotiate bilateral agreements with the United States related to supply lines into Afghanistan and covert American activities in Pakistani territory. Islamabad demands a full apology from Washington for past agreements related to supply lines into Afghanistan and covert American activities in Pakistan. The closure of Pakistani ground lines of communication (GLOCs) for NATO supplies remains unresolved since 2012, overshadowing potential deals to reopen them. The closure of Pakistani ground lines of communication (GLOCs) for NATO supplies remains unresolved since 2012, with negotiations stalled over a potential fee increase. This issue overshadowed a NATO summit in Chicago, where Pakistani negotiators were seeking a significant fee hike, leading to tensions with senior U.S. officials. Additionally, a Pakistani doctor involved in a CIA operation received a lengthy prison sentence for treason, causing confusion and anger among Americans. A Pakistani doctor involved in a CIA operation to identify bin Laden family DNA received a 33-year prison sentence for treason, leading to anger and confusion among Americans. The Senate Appropriations Committee responded by attaching a provision to dock $1 million from U.S. aid funding for each year of the sentence unless the doctor is freed. The Administration sees no reason for the conviction, and bilateral relations have remained strained since 2012. The cooperative aspects of bilateral relations have remained frozen since 2012, with anti-American sentiments and xenophobic conspiracy theories prevalent among ordinary Pakistanis. Opinion surveys show a decline in favorability towards the United States in Pakistan, while Americans also hold increasingly negative views of Pakistan. The State Department warns Americans about high travel risks in Pakistan due to Islamist extremism and militancy, with American civilians facing abductions, including the case of Daniel Pearl. This poses a challenge to U.S. foreign policy goals, such as defeating terrorist groups like Al Qaeda and stabilizing Afghanistan, as well as resolving the longstanding Pakistan-India rivalry. The State Department warns of high travel risks in Pakistan due to Islamist extremism and militancy, with concerns about American citizens being recruited by Pakistan-based elements for terrorism. Most-wanted enemies of the US, including Al Qaeda chief Ayman al-Zawahiri, are believed to be in Pakistan, raising suspicions of government protection. Some American intelligence officials suspect Zawahiri may be protected by elements of the Pakistani government. Congress is increasingly questioning the effectiveness of U.S. policy towards Pakistan, with calls to cut off foreign aid. Legislation to limit aid and military reimbursements is being considered in Congress. In May 2012, Congress appropriated about $2 billion in direct aid for Pakistan, making it a top recipient of U.S. foreign assistance. Pakistan's Ambassador to the United States expressed concerns about restrictions on aid hindering cooperation. The closure of Pakistani GLOCs to Afghanistan did not have the expected logistical impact, with Islamabad using it as leverage in relations with Washington. Pakistan's closure of supply routes to Afghanistan did not have the expected impact, but it has strained relations with the United States. By bowing to domestic pressures, Pakistan risks losing foreign aid and influence in post-war Afghanistan. President Obama's announcement of a military drawdown in 2014 highlights the need for positive cooperation between the two countries. In June 2011, President Obama announced a U.S. military drawdown from Afghanistan in 2014, emphasizing the need for Pakistan to expand its role in securing a peaceful future for the region and neutralizing terrorist safe havens. Despite acknowledging Pakistan's ties to anti-Afghan and anti-India groups, Secretary of Defense Panetta stressed the necessity of maintaining a relationship with Pakistan. Until a potential breakdown in 2012, the U.S. continued to press Pakistan on its commitments. The United States acknowledged Pakistan's ties to terrorist groups but emphasized the need to maintain a relationship with Pakistan. Continued engagement with Pakistan was seen as the only realistic option, with some analysts suggesting a more confrontational approach. The US increased nonmilitary aid to improve the lives of Pakistanis and conditioned military aid on Islamabad's progress in combating militancy. In July 2011, the US suspended up to $800 million in security assistance to Pakistan and is now evaluating their cooperation more rigorously before releasing further aid. $1 billion in approved coalition support fund reimbursements also remains undisbursed due to disagreements. Pakistani behavior is seen as unlikely to change according to observers. Developments in 2011 validate observers' views that Pakistani behavior is unlikely to change due to long-held geostrategic perspectives in Islamabad and Rawalpindi. Pakistan's foreign policy behavior is influenced by the military's strategic interests, leading analysts to advocate for strong U.S. support for civilian authorities to reduce conflict. Pakistan's military's strategic interests influence its foreign policy behavior, leading analysts to advocate for strong U.S. support for Pakistan's civilian authorities to reduce conflict. The current U.S. Ambassador to Pakistan emphasizes the need for a strong civilian government for successful U.S.-Pakistan cooperation. However, four years after their election, Pakistan's civilian leaders show little willingness to address their country's security policies effectively. Pakistan's civilian leaders show reluctance to address security policies and blame the United States for extremism, overlooking their own support for Islamist militancy in the region. President Obama's decision to travel to India in 2010 without visiting Pakistan heightened concerns among Pakistani officials about a perceived \"pro-India\" tilt in Washington. The Administration's India policies, including refraining from engagement in the Kashmir dispute and favoring U.S.-India civil nuclear cooperation over Pakistan, are seen as destabilizing for the region. The Administration's India policies, including nuclear cooperation and sympathy towards New Delhi's perspective on regional terrorism, are viewed suspiciously by Pakistani leaders and citizens. Afghanistan's closer ties with India and the U.S.-Afghanistan partnership are seen as threats to Pakistan's security institutions, suggesting strategic encirclement by external forces. Pakistan is increasingly threatened by external forces aiming to weaken the country. The events of 2011, including the Salala incident, have strained bilateral relations with the U.S. Analysts predict a shift towards more narrow, issue-based engagement in 2012 and beyond, moving away from the broad strategic partnership envisioned by Amb. Richard Holbrooke. In 2012, Pakistan sought a formal, business-like relationship with the U.S., with new restrictions on foreign assistance likely. Analysts suggest a transactional approach to prevent noncooperation. Pakistan sought a transactional relationship with the U.S. in 2012 to prevent noncooperation. Ambassador Sherry Rehman outlined prerequisites for resetting the bilateral relationship, including apologizing for the Salala incident and halting drone strikes. The U.S. and Pakistan are working on improving their bilateral relationship by addressing issues such as apologizing for the Salala incident, releasing suspended CSF reimbursements, increasing intelligence sharing, halting drone strikes, and focusing on trade rather than aid. Former U.S. diplomats suggest managing expectations, targeting economic aid programs better, promoting business ties, and discreetly supporting initiatives for regional development. The U.S. and Pakistan are working on improving their bilateral relationship by addressing issues such as apologizing for the Salala incident, releasing suspended CSF reimbursements, increasing intelligence sharing, halting drone strikes, and focusing on trade rather than aid. Experts suggest fostering more substantive business ties, discreetly supporting initiatives for regional stability, and not overemphasizing a purely security-oriented approach. The Obama Administration is advised to consider positive trends in Pakistan-India relations and avoid a purely security-oriented approach that could fuel anti-American sentiment in Pakistan. Some U.S. analysts criticize Pakistan's intransigence on GLOCs and the Salala incident, seeing it as a missed opportunity for cooperation. They urge firm pressure on Islamabad for counterterrorism efforts. Some commentators urge the U.S. government to maintain pressure on Pakistan for counterterrorism efforts, despite Pakistan's reduced leverage. Others criticize Pakistan's unyielding stance as a short-sighted mistake, advocating for a shift to a more adversarial posture. Calls for a new U.S. policy towards Pakistan, including \"focused hostility,\" have been made by high-profile analysts. President Obama's and President George W. Bush's engagement policies towards Pakistan have failed. Suggestions include implementing \"focused hostility\" towards Pakistan's military and intelligence services, targeting individuals for sanctions, and cutting military aid. Some argue that Pakistan should be considered an enemy of the United States in terms of Afghanistan policy. Threats to end all assistance to Islamabad and retaliate if Pakistan does not comply are also proposed. Some suggest implementing \"focused hostility\" towards Pakistan's military and intelligence services, targeting individuals for sanctions, and cutting military aid. Others argue that considering Pakistan an enemy of the United States in terms of Afghanistan policy and making credible threats to end all assistance to Islamabad would benefit both countries. However, some experts reject a more adversarial approach as counterproductive and risky for the U.S.-led project in Afghanistan. The observer opposes a \"two Pakistans\" approach, suggesting a more passive U.S. strategy focused on providing security assurances and strengthening Pakistan's civilian governance. The Pakistani military's cooperation with India may be tactical or strategic. The current situation in Pakistan raises questions about whether their cooperation with India is a tactical move to ease international pressure or a strategic shift in perspective. Despite potential tactical benefits, Pakistan's geostrategic status could suffer from international isolation. Many suggest that Pakistan should focus on energy and trade cooperation with neighbors rather than conflict with India. The changing South and Central Asian calculus should lead Pakistan to prioritize energy and trade cooperation with neighbors over conflict with India. This shift could help Pakistan overcome its perpetual insecurity. However, the worldview of Pakistan's security services and domestic public hinders civilian leaders from pursuing these policies effectively. Salman Taseer, governor of Punjab province, was assassinated in 2011 by his own security team due to his vocal criticisms of blasphemy laws. His killer, Malik Mumtaz Qadri, was praised by some in Pakistani society. Taseer's assassination was condemned by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The assassination of Minorities Minister Shabaz Bhatti, a vocal advocate for religious tolerance and reform of blasphemy laws, was strongly condemned by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as an attack on values of tolerance and respect for all faiths. Secretary Clinton condemned the killing of Bhatti as an attack on values of tolerance and respect for all faiths, championed by Pakistan's founding father. President Zardari addressed the assassinations, warning of increasing Islamist radicalism in Pakistan. The Taseer and Bhatti assassinations in Pakistan raised concerns about increasing Islamist radicalism in the country. In a separate incident, American Raymond Davis shot and killed two men in Lahore, claiming self-defense. Despite diplomatic immunity claims, Pakistani authorities accused Davis of murder. President Obama referred to Davis as \"our diplomat.\" The controversy surrounding Raymond Davis, a CIA contractor involved in a shooting incident in Pakistan, led to tensions between the US and Pakistan. Some in Congress suggested reducing aid to Pakistan if the case was not resolved satisfactorily. Senator Kerry visited Islamabad to ease escalating tensions. In mid-February, Senator Kerry traveled to Islamabad to reduce tensions over Raymond Davis, a CIA contractor involved in a shooting incident in Pakistan. The CIA negotiated with the ISI for Davis's release, which happened on March 16, 2011, after a pledge of $2.3 million in \"blood money\" for the victims' families. Top U.S. officials denied any quid pro quo arrangement for Davis's release. On May 2, 2011, Osama bin Laden was located and killed in Abbottabad, Pakistan, near Islamabad. The circumstances of his death raised doubts about Pakistan's commitment to fighting extremism. The location and circumstances of Osama bin Laden's death raised doubts about Pakistan's commitment to fighting extremism, leading to calls to cut U.S. assistance. Questions arose about Pakistan's role in harboring bin Laden, with many believing officials were complicit or the country's support system aided him. The hunt for Osama bin Laden raised doubts about Pakistan's involvement, leading to questions of complicity or incompetence in their search for top Al Qaeda leaders. Pakistan's credibility suffered as their military and intelligence services were criticized for failing to detect a foreign military raid on their territory. Intelligence services criticized for failing to detect foreign military raid and presence of terrorist in Pakistani territory. Army Chief warns against future incursions. Parliament condemns U.S. raid and calls for halt to drone strikes. Threatens to close vital supply lines to NATO troops. Public demonstrations turn anti-American, fueling bilateral distrust. The developments in Pakistan fueled bilateral distrust and acrimony, with Congress questioning the wisdom of continued engagement due to suspicions of the government's knowledge of OBL's whereabouts. Calls for greater oversight and accountability for future U.S. assistance to Pakistan were made, while some senior Members advocated for more engagement with the country. Despite concerns over Pakistan's knowledge of OBL's whereabouts, some senior Members advocate for increased engagement with the country, emphasizing the need for more oversight and accountability in future U.S. assistance. President Obama and top officials maintain a positive stance towards Pakistan post-Abbottabad raid, acknowledging questions surrounding OBL's refuge. On May 22, 2011, heavily armed militants attacked Pakistan's Mehran Naval Station near Karachi, resulting in the deaths of ten security personnel and four militants in a 16-hour gun battle. Senior U.S. officials were divided over the bilateral relationship with Pakistan, with some advocating for strong reprisals due to perceived intransigence. On May 22, 2011, militants attacked Pakistan's Mehran Naval Station near Karachi, resulting in the deaths of ten security personnel and four militants in a 16-hour gun battle. The militants destroyed two U.S.-supplied P-3C Orion aircraft in their hangar. The Pakistani Taliban claimed the attack was revenge for bin Laden's killing, causing embarrassment for the Pakistani military. The attack on Pakistan's Mehran Naval Station in 2011 led to criticism of the Pakistani military for a breach that raised concerns about the security of the country's nuclear weapons. Suspicions of inside help were raised as attackers avoided detection. A former navy commando was arrested, and three navy officers, including the base commander, faced court-martial for negligence. A former navy commando was arrested in connection with the Mehran Naval Station attack. Three navy officers, including the base commander, are to be court-martialed for negligence. The Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) is accused of ordering the torture and murder of journalist Syed Saleem Shahzad, who suggested the attack was due to the Navy cracking down on Al Qaeda cells. The Pakistan Navy crackdown on Al Qaeda cells led to journalist Syed Saleem Shahzad's murder, allegedly ordered by senior ISI officials to silence critics. Government inquiry and US officials implicated ISI in the brutal attack, with Admiral Mike Mullen stating it was sanctioned by the Pakistani government. The Pakistan Navy crackdown on Al Qaeda cells led to journalist Syed Saleem Shahzad's murder, allegedly ordered by senior ISI officials in an effort to silence critics. An official Commission of Inquiry in January 2012 was unable to identify the culprits behind Shahzad's murder but recommended making intelligence agencies more law-abiding and accountable through a statutory framework and mechanisms of oversight and redressal. In July 2011, the Obama Administration suspended $440-$500 million worth of scheduled counterinsurgency training and equipment for Pakistan due to reduced U.S. military presence and delays in visa processing. Islamabad's accountability was emphasized through internal administrative review, Parliamentary oversight, and judicial redressal of citizens' grievances. The Obama Administration suspended $300 million in planned FY2011 Coalition Support Fund reimbursements to Pakistan due to delays in visa processing and obstacles in fulfilling agreements. This move was seen as a warning to Islamabad about potential consequences for lack of cooperation. Pakistani military downplayed the impact, suggesting reprogramming U.S. security assistance towards development projects. The Obama Administration suspended $300 million in planned FY2011 Coalition Support Fund reimbursements to Pakistan, affecting future combat operations. Some observers believe this decision may lead to resentment from Pakistani leaders and validation of anti-U.S. sentiments among ordinary Pakistanis. Pakistani-American businessman Mansoor Ijaz mentioned a memorandum allegedly \"dictated\" to him by the Pakistani Ambassador after bin Laden's death in May 2011. The op-ed piece referenced a memorandum allegedly \"dictated\" to Mansoor Ijaz in May 2011 by then-Pakistani Ambassador Husain Haqqani, requesting U.S. assistance to avert a military coup and install friendly leaders for cooperation with U.S. counterterrorism efforts. The Pakistani Supreme Court launched an investigation to uncover the document's author and purpose. The \"Memogate\" scandal involving Ambassador Haqqani and the alleged memo requesting U.S. assistance to prevent a military coup brought pressure on President Zardari. Despite Ijaz being a questionable witness, the investigation did not find evidence of wrongdoing by civilians, allowing Haqqani to leave Pakistan. Concerns arose about Zardari facing overthrow due to the civil-military clash. The civil-military clash over the \"Memogate\" scandal raised concerns of President Zardari facing overthrow. Army and intelligence officers confirmed the memo's authenticity, prompting Prime Minister Gilani to warn against conspiracies to remove the elected government. Rumors of a military coup persisted, leading to the army publicly pledging to uphold civilian rule. The military in Pakistan is urged to be accountable to parliament and not act as a separate entity. Despite rumors of a coup, the army publicly supported democracy. The civilian government was upset that the army and intelligence chiefs bypassed them in dealing with the court. Prime Minister Gilani criticized this as unconstitutional, which the military denied. There is concern about the state of Pakistan's democratic government, but the public is against direct military intervention. The Pakistani public is against direct military intervention despite concerns about the democratic government. With an assertive judiciary and watchdog media, the likelihood of a military coup is low. Parliament reaffirmed its supremacy and called for constitutional limits on the army and Supreme Court. Prime Minister Gilani softened his criticisms of the military, leading to a decrease in the crisis atmosphere. In November 2011, U.S. ground forces near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border were attacked by heavy machine gun and mortar fire from positions inside Pakistan. Despite calling in NATO air assets, the fire continued, leading to the deployment of an AC-130 gunship and other aircraft. NATO air assets were called in to assist U.S. ground forces under attack by Afghan insurgents near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. Despite the show of force, the incoming fire persisted, leading to the deployment of an AC-130 gunship, two F-15 jets, and two AH-64 Apache helicopters to neutralize the enemy positions. Pakistani soldiers also came under fire, resulting in the death of 24 soldiers. The attacks were condemned by Pakistani officials as a breach of sovereignty and a violation of international law, sparking anger and accusations against NATO forces. The attacks near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border led to the death of 24 Pakistani soldiers, sparking anger and accusations against NATO forces. Prime Minister Gilani condemned the attacks as a breach of sovereignty and a violation of international law, leading to the closure of NATO's ground logistics routes through Pakistan and the eviction of U.S. personnel from the Shamsi airfield in Baluchistan. Pakistani government rejected U.S. expressions of regret, resulting in the closure of supply routes for more than five months. The Pakistani government demands a formal apology from the U.S. for the death of 24 soldiers near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. The Pentagon's investigation concluded that U.S. forces acted in self-defense, but there were serious miscommunications. The NATO investigation concluded that no personnel acted improperly during the incident near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. Pakistan's military criticized the attribution of partial responsibility to them as unjustified. They acknowledged firing first but claimed it was legitimate given the circumstances. The NATO investigation criticized the claim that no Pakistani posts were in the area and blamed the incident on the failure to share information with Pakistan. The Obama Administration considered issuing an apology for the incident at Salala, which advocates believed would help mend relations. Advocates within the State Department believed an apology for the incident at Salala would help mend relations with Pakistan and facilitate the reopening of the GLOCs. However, opponents, including Pentagon figures, argued that an apology would be seen as a sign of weakness in pressuring Pakistan on counterinsurgency. Secretary Clinton's planned apology to Foreign Minister Khar in London was canceled after U.S. military personnel burned Korans in Afghanistan. Later, coordinated insurgent attacks in Afghanistan in April were blamed on the Pakistan-based Haqqani Network. In Afghanistan, U.S. military personnel accidentally burned Korans, leading to a cancellation of Secretary Clinton's planned apology to Foreign Minister Khar. Subsequently, coordinated insurgent attacks in April were attributed to the Haqqani Network. U.S.-Pakistan relations were further strained when a hearing on Baluchistan suggested partitioning Pakistan into substates. Subcommittee Chairman Dana Rohrabacher introduced H.Con.Res. 104 to support Baluchistan's right to self-determination, causing backlash from the Islamabad government and Pakistani media. Prime Minister Gilani criticized it as an attack on Pakistani sovereignty, while the Obama Administration distanced itself from the resolution. The Obama Administration distanced itself from a resolution supporting Baluchistan's independence, causing backlash from Pakistan's government. The Salala incident led to a freeze in US-Pakistan relations for a review by Parliament, completed in April 2012. Some saw this as a rare assertiveness by the civilian government. The civilian government of Pakistan showed unusual assertiveness in a review process regarding foreign policy, which some analysts viewed as a facade for military influence. The 14-point guidelines issued in April 2012 included demands such as immediate cessation of drone attacks and infiltration into Pakistani territory. The Pakistani government demands an end to drone attacks and infiltration into its territory, prohibits the use of its airspace for transporting arms to Afghanistan, condemns the NATO/ISAF attack as a violation of sovereignty, calls for an apology from the US, and insists on justice for the Salala incident. It also prohibits verbal agreements on national security and calls for all agreements to be in writing. The Pakistani government demands justice for the Salala incident and prohibits verbal agreements on national security, calling for all agreements to be in writing. Additionally, they reject drone attacks, infiltration, and the establishment of foreign bases on their territory. The review also requests a civil nuclear deal similar to the one offered to India in 2005. The United States offers a civil nuclear deal to Pakistan, similar to the one offered to India in 2005. Despite ongoing drone strikes (albeit at a reduced rate), the Obama Administration emphasizes respect for Pakistani democracy and sovereignty. U.S. Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, Marc Grossman, holds high-level talks in Islamabad following the Salala incident, discussing the Parliament's 14 points. Despite high-level talks with U.S. Special Representative Marc Grossman following the Salala incident, hopes for a reset in the bilateral relationship were dashed as Pakistan's demands for a cessation of drone strikes remain a major point of contention. The CIA's reluctance to give up the ability to strike \"high-value targets\" and the use of \"signature strikes\" based on surveillance are also in question. The continuation of \"signature strikes\" targeting suspected low-level militants based on \"pattern of life\" surveillance is raising concerns due to the higher likelihood of civilian deaths. Reports suggest that Pakistani leaders may refuse to open NATO's ground supply lines until drone strikes cease, but no official confirmation has been made. Pakistan's demand for an unconditional apology for the inadvertent deaths of Pakistani soldiers at Salala remains a major obstacle in resolving these issues. The U.S. government is reportedly withholding at least $1 billion in military aid. At the time of writing, unresolved issues include the deaths of Pakistani soldiers at Salala and the withholding of $1 billion in military aid by the U.S. government. Pakistan insists on abiding by Parliament's recommendations, while boycotting NATO summits following the Salala incident. The NATO conference in Chicago was overshadowed by U.S.-Pakistan tensions and the unresolved GLOCs issue. President Zardari received a last-minute invitation to attend but President Obama reportedly refused to meet with him, adding to the strained relations. President Obama's refusal to meet with President Zardari at the NATO conference in Chicago added to strained U.S.-Pakistan tensions. Some observers in Pakistan viewed Zardari's participation as embarrassing, while Foreign Minister Khar remained optimistic about Pakistan's role. On May 23, 2012, a tribal court in northwestern Pakistan convicted Shakil Afridi of treason and sentenced him to 33 years in prison for working with the CIA in collecting DNA samples from Osama bin Laden's compound. Shakil Afridi was sentenced to 33 years in prison for treason after working with the CIA to collect DNA samples from Osama bin Laden's compound. The sentence sparked outrage in the United States, with officials calling it \"shocking and outrageous\" and stating that Afridi should be praised, not punished. The Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee criticized the punishment of Shakil Afridi for helping the US in the Osama bin Laden case, stating it will strain the US-Pakistan relationship. Islamabad defends the legal process but some in Pakistan question the conviction due to lack of legal representation and unclear appeal rights. The Administration's assessment in March 2011 found that progress in Afghanistan and Pakistan policy remained static, with some improvement in combating Al Qaeda. Cooperation between Pakistani armed forces and NATO improved, but there was no progress in executing counterinsurgency efforts in certain regions. The last quarter of 2010 showed no progress in effectively executing counterinsurgency efforts in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas. There was a lack of 'hold' and 'build' planning to complement ongoing clearing operations, hindering the path towards defeating the insurgency in Pakistan. In contrast, a March 2011 certification by Secretary Clinton under the Enhanced Partnership With Pakistan Act of 2009 indicated progress, despite conflicting U.S. government reporting on Pakistan's situation. The March 2011 certification by Secretary Clinton under the Enhanced Partnership With Pakistan Act of 2009 allowed the release of security-related FY2011 aid to Pakistan. It confirmed Islamabad's efforts in combating terrorist groups, ceasing support to extremists, preventing terrorist activities on Pakistani soil, and dismantling terrorist bases. The certification by Secretary Clinton in March 2011 allowed the release of security-related aid to Pakistan, acknowledging their efforts in combating terrorist groups and dismantling bases. However, skepticism arose regarding the certification's basis on political considerations rather than ground realities. Secretary Clinton's certification in March 2011 enabled the release of security aid to Pakistan for combating terrorist groups. The Administration's assessment in September 2011 highlighted limited progress in enhancing civilian control and stable government in Pakistan. Indicators and metrics in Pakistan remained static for the reporting period, with a decline in COIN capabilities attributed to decreased bilateral security cooperation. International involvement in stabilizing Pakistan showed limited progress, with the IMF Stand-By Arrangement on hold since August 2010. Limited progress in funding IMF Stand-By Arrangement and World Bank Multi-Donor Trust Fund. Pentagon report highlights Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan as critical threat. Kabul security situation remains volatile. The Pentagon report highlights Pakistan's role in undermining security in Afghanistan by providing safe havens and material for insurgents, posing a critical threat to the U.S.-led effort in the region. The Pentagon report emphasizes Pakistan's role in destabilizing Afghanistan by harboring insurgents, posing a significant threat to the U.S.-led campaign. U.S.-Pakistan relations have also been strained by issues such as freedom of travel for U.S. diplomats in Pakistan. Incidents of \"official harassment\" towards U.S. diplomats in Pakistan, including the requirement of \"No Objection Certificates\" for leaving Islamabad, have strained relations. Additionally, two U.S. citizens of Pakistani origin were found working for the ISI to influence U.S. Kashmir policy. President Obama has not visited Pakistan, and the Strategic Dialogue has not had a formal session since October 2010, although high-level military and intelligence interactions continue. Since taking office, the bilateral Strategic Dialogue has not had a formal session since October 2010. High-level interactions, especially among military and intelligence officials, have continued to be frequent. In October 2011, the Obama Administration led a large delegation to Islamabad to emphasize the United States' stance to the Pakistani leadership. Secretary Clinton emphasized to Pakistani leadership the US's intolerance of militant safe havens in western Pakistan and the postponement of the U.S.-Pakistan Strategic Dialogue. Engagement has continued at other levels, with Secretary Clinton meeting Foreign Minister Khar in February 2012. In February 2012, Secretary Clinton met with Foreign Minister Khar in London, conveying U.S. respect for Parliament's right to review bilateral relations. She expressed eagerness to resume cooperation on counterterrorism and Afghanistan. Khar mentioned Islamabad's focus on upcoming Senate elections before addressing Parliament's recommendations. Amb. Grossman later met with President Zardari in Tajikistan, emphasizing the U.S.'s commitment to a constructive relationship with Pakistan. President Obama reiterated the U.S. desire for a positive relationship with Pakistan during a meeting with Prime Minister Gilani in Seoul, emphasizing shared interests in counterterrorism and Afghanistan. He welcomed Pakistan's parliamentary review process and expressed openness to their participation in the upcoming Chicago NATO summit. In March, senior U.S. and Pakistani military commanders held formal talks in Rawalpindi to discuss border coordination issues. In April, Deputy Secretary of State Thomas Nides met with Foreign Minister Khar in Islamabad to build upon previous conversations and expressed optimism for achieving a balanced approach respecting Pakistan's sovereignty and interests. In April, USAID Administrator Rajiv Shah visited Pakistan to express strong U.S. commitment to building ties through civilian assistance. Amb. Grossman later attended the 6th Trilateral Core Group meeting in Islamabad, the first high-level U.S. visit after the parliamentary review release. During the high-level U.S. visit to Pakistan, Amb. Grossman and Foreign Secretary Jilani discussed the reopening of GLOCs and Pakistan's opposition to drone strikes. The session was unsuccessful, with Washington's refusal to apologize for the Salala incident being a key sticking point. The U.S.-Pakistan-Afghanistan Tripartite Commission met for the 35th time in Rawalpindi in mid-May. The U.S.-Pakistan-Afghanistan Tripartite Commission met for the 35th time in Rawalpindi in mid-May to discuss Afghan stability and border security. Controversial missile strikes in Pakistan by American drones have been reportedly effective against militants, with President Obama personally approving targets. Over 118 drone strikes occurred in 2010 alone, with 70 more reported in 2011. In 2010, there were 118 drone strikes, more than the previous six years combined. In 2011, 70 more strikes were reported in western Pakistan. The strikes have targeted Al Qaeda and other militants but are criticized for killing civilians and fueling anti-American sentiment in Pakistan. The Pakistani government protests the strikes as a violation of sovereignty. The Pakistani government strongly condemns drone attacks as a violation of territorial integrity and international law, fueling anti-American sentiment. Despite official rejection, there is domestic debate on the necessity of drone strikes, with some analysts supporting it as the best option. Some analysts support drone strikes as necessary and effective against Al Qaeda and its allies. The program's messaging to Pakistan is evident, with strikes following key events like the release of Raymond Davis and the suspension of U.S. military aid. Top Administration figures have differing opinions on the wisdom of the tactic. The May 2012 NATO summit saw a surge in drone strikes in Pakistan, following President Obama's refusal to meet with the Pakistani counterpart. There are conflicting views within the Administration on the continuation of UAV strikes, with some urging for a reduction in pace to avoid further straining relations with Pakistan. Despite the tactical effectiveness of drone attacks, concerns exist about the potential destabilization of Pakistan. A mid-2011 White House review reaffirmed support for the CIA drone campaign while implementing some changes. The mid-2011 White House review reaffirmed support for the CIA drone campaign in Pakistan, with changes such as greater State Department involvement in strike decisions and advanced notice to Pakistani officials. The number of \"signature strikes\" against suspected militants decreased as a result. The armed drone program was praised for its precision and lack of collateral deaths. The top counterterrorism advisor claimed the armed drone program has not caused collateral deaths, but independent analysts dispute this, estimating 145-535 civilian casualties. Despite killing militants and commanders, violence in western Pakistan has not subsided. Despite the killing of hundreds of militants and commanders, violence in western Pakistan has not subsided as a result of missile strikes. With a drawdown of NATO troops in Afghanistan looming, the U.S. government may have no better option than to continue using this tactic. The U.S. has had close links with Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) since the 1980s, but mutual mistrust has always been present. The ISI, Pakistan's intelligence agency, has a history of training Afghan fighters and using militant proxies for its perceived interests. There are concerns about its involvement in extralegal activities and manipulation of domestic politics. Lt. Gen. Zaheer-ul-Islam became the Director-General in 2012. Lt. Gen. Zaheer-ul-Islam, the Director-General of Pakistan's ISI, is seen as a potential candidate for the Chief of Army Staff position. He replaced Lt. Gen. Pasha in 2012 and is considered more open and moderate. U.S. officials have accused the ISI of supporting Afghan insurgents. The ISI is accused of actively supporting Afghan insurgents with money, supplies, and planning guidance, allowing them to sustain their insurgency. Reports suggest that the ISI increased direct contacts with the Taliban in 2011, encouraging more violence and supplying them with explosives manufactured in Pakistan. The leaked NATO report in January 2012 reveals that Afghan insurgents receive direct support from the ISI, with senior Taliban leaders regularly meeting ISI personnel for strategic advice. Despite NATO officials downplaying the report, Pakistan's foreign minister dismissed it as old news. The ISI is also linked to anti-India terrorist groups. The ISI is regularly linked to anti-India terrorist groups, including Lashkar-e-Taiba responsible for the 2008 Mumbai attack. Secretary of State Clinton stated that certain elements of the Pakistani government are ambivalent about cracking down on terrorism. Pakistani officials provide assurances that no elements of the ISI are involved in supporting terrorism. Pakistan's security services have long-standing relationships with terrorist groups, with concerns about Islamist extremists infiltrating the military and intelligence services. Leaked U.S. diplomatic cables suggest bias in training against the United States for Pakistani military officers. Analysts view Pakistan's security services as divided between nationalist and Islamist factions. Pakistan's national identity is divided between nationalism and Islamism, with the security services split into nationalist and Islamist factions. CIA-ISI relations were strained even before the Raymond Davis incident, with American frustration over lack of Pakistani military action and ISI support for militant groups. The Davis affair heightened Pakistani scrutiny and hostility. The Davis affair heightened Pakistani scrutiny and hostility towards U.S. security officials and contractors in Pakistan, leading to demands for accountability of CIA operatives. The circumstances of Osama bin Laden's death increased focus on alleged ISI links with Islamist extremism, prompting Pakistan to crack down on its citizens working with the CIA. Following the May 2011 raid that resulted in Osama bin Laden's death, Pakistan cracked down on its citizens working with the CIA. Pressure was exerted to allow American investigators access to bin Laden's widows in Pakistani custody, which was eventually granted. A Pakistani newspaper, believed to be close to the military and intelligence services, revealed the name of the CIA's Islamabad station chief, marking the second time in six months that the top American operative in Pakistan had been exposed. U.S. officials suspected these disclosures were intentional to showcase the ISI's power and influence. After the OBL raid, the ISI leadership faced increased scrutiny over collusion with Afghan insurgents. The CIA alerted Islamabad about bomb-making facilities in FATA, but they were found abandoned, leading to suspicions of tip-offs. After the OBL raid, suspicions arose about tip-offs to militants in FATA as bomb-making facilities were found abandoned, leading to interagency discord. After the OBL raid, a Yemeni national linked to Al Qaeda was arrested in Karachi with U.S.-provided intelligence. Mohammed Ali Qasim Yaqub, a key courier for Al Qaeda leaders, was captured, improving relations between Pakistan and the U.S. Pakistan also promised to grant visas to CIA officers. Ilyas Kashmiri, a top terrorist, was killed in a drone strike in June 2011. In June, Pakistan pledged to grant visas to CIA officers to rebuild confidence. Most-wanted terrorist Ilyas Kashmiri was killed in a drone strike in South Waziristan. Al Qaeda's deputy Atiyah Abd al-Rahman was also killed in an August strike in North Waziristan with intelligence likely from Pakistan. In September, Pakistan announced the arrest of three senior Al Qaeda operatives near Quetta with CIA assistance. Bilateral intelligence cooperation focuses on targeting Al Qaeda and Pakistani militants. The CIA has reportedly assisted in the arrest of senior Al Qaeda operatives near Quetta, Pakistan. Bilateral intelligence cooperation targeting Al Qaeda and the \"Pakistani Taliban\" continues despite strained government relations. The CIA has allegedly established a network of \"secret friends\" in Pakistan to counter less trustworthy army and ISI officials. Pakistani leaders aim for strategic depth with Central Asia and India through friendly relations. Pakistani leaders have long sought strategic depth with Central Asia and India through friendly relations with Afghanistan, dating back to President-General Zia ul-Haq's support for Afghan mujahideen in the 1980s. The British colonialists divided Pashtun tribes with the Durand Line, a disputed border not accepted by Afghan leaders. The Durand Line, a porous 1,600-mile border dividing Pakistan and Afghanistan, is a source of ongoing tension. Both countries are key U.S. allies in combating Islamic militancy, but their acrimony hinders American interests. Pakistan's military and intelligence services are believed to seek influence in Afghanistan, complicating efforts for a stable resolution. Pakistan's military and intelligence services are believed to seek influence in Afghanistan, aiming for a post-NATO Afghanistan that aligns with Islamabad's interests. The U.S.-led coalition, on the other hand, aims to leave behind an independent Afghanistan that may increase cooperation with India. Pakistan is assumed to use the Quetta Shura and Haqqani Network as proxies in its dealings with Kabul. Pakistan's use of the Quetta Shura and Haqqani Network as proxies in dealings with Kabul increases its leverage in Afghan reconciliation talks, despite tensions with the U.S. over differing approaches. Americans aim to \"fight, talk, build,\" while Pakistanis prefer a \"cease-fire, talk, wait for the Americans to leave\" strategy. The differing approaches of the American and Pakistani governments towards Afghanistan are evident. Americans want to \"fight, talk, build,\" while Pakistanis prefer a \"cease-fire, talk, wait for the Americans to leave\" strategy. Pakistani officials are confused by the lack of clarity in U.S. goals for Afghanistan and pressure to employ force against militants in North Waziristan. There are concerns that Washington risks rewarding Pakistani intransigence by involving their security services in brokering peace with insurgent forces they have supported. The ISI plays a key role in brokering peace with insurgent forces in Afghanistan, despite allegations of supporting the Taliban regime. Pakistani cooperation is seen as crucial for long-term stability in Afghanistan, but relations with Kabul are strained. Afghan insurgents find safe havens in Pakistani cities, hindering successful military operations. The Taliban finds safe havens in Pakistani cities like Quetta and Karachi, as well as in western Pakistan's tribal agencies, hindering pacification efforts in southern and eastern Afghanistan. Declassified U.S. government documents show that the Taliban's resurgence in the mid-2000s was supported by sanctuaries in FATA. Despite some improvement in Pakistan-Afghanistan relations, Afghan officials still accuse Pakistan of aiding terrorism in Afghanistan, leading to continued wariness of Pakistani influence in Afghanistan. Many analysts are concerned about Pakistani influence in Afghanistan, with suspicions of Islamabad using \"Pashtun jihadi proxies\" to further its interests. There is unease in Islamabad over the potential U.S. military drawdown in Afghanistan and fears of being abandoned by the international community, similar to the 1990s. President Obama's announcement in 2011 added to these concerns. President Obama's 2011 announcement of a U.S. military drawdown from Afghanistan signaled a focus on an exit strategy, raising concerns among stakeholders. Pakistani leaders emphasize Afghan stability as a crucial interest, with efforts to accelerate the peace process through high-level visits to Kabul. The Afghanistan-Pakistan Joint Commission met in June 2011 to accelerate the peace process, with Gilani criticizing America's \"imperial designs\" and advocating for an \"Afghan-led and Afghan-owned\" process. In June 2011, the new Joint Commission met with Gilani and President Karzai committing to an \"Afghan-led and Afghan-owned\" process. They agreed on a 23-point \"Islamabad Declaration\" to strengthen ties. However, tensions rose due to \"reverse infiltration\" incidents, including a deadly cross-border raid and accusations of rocket attacks by Pakistan. In September 2011, Afghan officials accused Pakistan of firing rockets into Kunar, Nangarhar, and Khost provinces, resulting in the deaths of at least 60 people. Pakistan denied involvement in the attacks, leading to strained relations between the two countries. The assassination of Afghan High Peace Council chairman Burhanuddin Rabbani further escalated tensions. In September 2011, Afghan High Peace Council chairman Burhanuddin Rabbani was assassinated in Kabul by a suicide bomber, leading to suspicions of ISI involvement. Afghan officials criticized Pakistan for lack of cooperation in the investigation. Afghan intelligence claimed to have foiled a plot to assassinate Karzai. The Afghan president accuses Pakistan of supporting terrorism. Afghan intelligence officials stopped a plot to assassinate Karzai, linked to Al Qaeda and the Haqqanis in FATA. Islamabad supports peace talks with the Afghan Taliban, wanting Kabul to lead. Pakistan aims to limit India's influence in post-conflict Afghanistan. Pakistan's leaders aim to limit India's influence in post-conflict Afghanistan by controlling Taliban negotiations. In 2010, they orchestrated the capture of Mullah Baradar to facilitate talks with Taliban commanders for reconciliation. Some believe ISI's motives were to thwart negotiations, while others see it as an effort to broker peace. In mid-2010, Pakistan initiated reconciliation efforts between the Kabul government and the Haqqani Network, raising concerns about Islamabad exploiting the situation for maximal influence in post-conflict Kabul. NATO facilitated secret meetings between QST figures, Haqqani Network representatives, and Afghan officials in Kabul, with unclear Pakistani involvement. In 2011, the U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan suggested that Pakistan has significant influence over top Afghan insurgents, hindering reconciliation efforts by preventing Taliban leaders from traveling to Kabul for talks. Afghan President Karzai also expressed frustration with Pakistan's interference in the peace process. In early 2012, Afghan President Karzai urged Pakistan to support negotiations with the Taliban, but Pakistani leaders were initially hesitant. In early 2012, Afghan President Karzai urged Pakistan to support negotiations with the Taliban. Despite initial reluctance, Prime Minister Gilani later issued an appeal for Afghan Taliban leaders to participate in reconciliation efforts. Concerns persist about Pakistan's ties to Afghan insurgent groups during the reconciliation process. The Haqqani Network, led by Jalaluddin Haqqani and his son Sirajuddin, is seen as the most dangerous Afghan insurgent group. They pose a strategic threat to Afghan stability and U.S. national security interests in the region. The Haqqani Network, led by Jalaluddin Haqqani and his son Sirajuddin, is Afghanistan's most capable insurgent group with close ties to al-Qaeda. Military offensives by ISAF and Afghan forces are needed to address the group beyond 2012. Islamabad has not taken action against the Haqqanis in North Waziristan despite U.S. requests. The Pakistani military has not taken action against the Haqqani Network in North Waziristan despite U.S. requests, as they believe the group could help exert Pashtun-based influence in post-ISAF Afghanistan. The Haqqanis have carried out high-profile attacks in Afghanistan, including the 2011 assault on Kabul's Intercontinental Hotel and a truck bomb attack on a U.S. facility. In June and September 2011, the Haqqani Network carried out deadly attacks in Afghanistan, including assaults on Kabul's Intercontinental Hotel and a U.S. military base in Wardak province. The most significant attack was on the U.S. Embassy compound in Kabul on September 13, 2011, which resulted in the deaths of 16 Afghans, including police officers and children. This attack altered U.S.-Pakistan relations, showcasing the militants' ability to conduct complex raids. The Haqqani Network carried out deadly attacks in Afghanistan, including assaults on Kabul's Intercontinental Hotel and a U.S. military base in Wardak province. The attack on the U.S. Embassy compound in Kabul resulted in the deaths of 16 Afghans, including police officers and children. U.S. officials dismissed the attack as a sign of insurgents' weakness, but it was seen as a blow to the narrative of Afghanistan becoming more secure. Admiral Mullen called on General Kayani for Pakistani military action against Haqqani bases, escalating tensions with accusations of ISI conducting a \"proxy war\" in Afghanistan. The ISI is accused of using the Haqqani network for a \"proxy war\" in Afghanistan. Secretary Panetta issues an ultimatum to Pakistan to protect US forces from future attacks. Mullen states that the Haqqani network is supported by Pakistan's ISI. The Haqqani network, acting as an arm of Pakistan's ISI, was responsible for various attacks in Afghanistan, including the truck bomb attack on September 13 and the assault on the US embassy. Secretary Panetta emphasized the need to pressure Pakistan to address this issue. The Obama Administration is putting pressure on Pakistan to address the issue of the Haqqani network's attacks in Afghanistan. President Obama stated that the intelligence on the ISI-Haqqani relationship is unclear but insisted that Pakistan needs to take care of the problem. The Wardak truck bombing was seen as a turning point in hardening Secretary Panetta's stance on the issue. The Wardak truck bombing was a turning point in hardening Secretary Clinton's attitude towards the Haqqanis. Haqqani fighters have been implicated in further attacks on coalition targets in Afghanistan. Islamabad denies responsibility for the violence and supporting the Haqqanis, calling Mullen's statements \"unfortunate and not based on fact.\" The Pakistani military denies supporting the Haqqanis and conducting a proxy war, warning the US of damaging the bilateral relationship. President Zardari criticizes verbal assaults against Pakistan. Efforts to reconcile the Haqqanis with the Kabul government face challenges due to their links with Al Qaeda. Efforts to reconcile the Haqqanis with the Kabul government are hindered by their close links with Al Qaeda, who are believed to have sanctuary in Haqqani-controlled areas. Pakistan, with its influence over the Haqqanis, is seen as the key player in pushing for negotiations. Pakistani military officials claim they can bring the Haqqanis to the negotiating table to avoid a potentially unwinnable military conflict. The Obama Administration is considering designating the Haqqani Network as a Foreign Terrorist Organization, with pressure from senior Senators. Seven Haqqani leaders have been under U.S. sanctions since 2008. The Obama Administration is considering designating the Haqqani Network as a Foreign Terrorist Organization, with pressure from senior Senators like Services Committee Chairman Senator Carl Levin and Intelligence Committee Co-Chair Senator Dianne Feinstein. Seven Haqqani leaders have been under U.S. sanctions since 2008, and Secretary Clinton designated operational commander Badruddin Haqqani under Executive Order 13224 in 2011. The potential decision on an FTO designation is complicated by the Administration's willingness to negotiate with the Haqqani leadership for sustainable peace in Afghanistan. The Haqqani Network Terrorist Designation Act of 2011 has not progressed in the House committee. U.S. Congress is frustrated with the Administration's delay in the formal review for FTO designation. Ammonium nitrate is a key component in IEDs used by insurgents in Afghanistan. The majority of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) used by Islamist insurgents in Afghanistan contain ammonium nitrate (AN), which is believed to be smuggled from Pakistan since the Kabul government banned it in 2010. Data from the Pentagon shows a peak in IED attacks in the summer of 2011, but improved detection and clearing capabilities have led to a decrease in effective IED attacks. The Intelligence Authorization Act of FY2012 required the Director of National Intelligence to take action. The Intelligence Authorization Act of FY2012 mandated a report on countering IED-related networks in Pakistan and Afghanistan. The US government is pushing for stricter Pakistani laws to restrict access to ammonium nitrate or enhance border security to prevent its movement into Afghanistan. The US government is encouraging Pakistani law enforcement and border security agencies to prevent the movement of illicit chemical explosives precursors into Afghanistan through diplomatic, law enforcement, and science and technology efforts. Operation Global Shield is a multilateral law enforcement operation launched in 2010 to combat this trafficking. Operation Global Shield, a multilateral law enforcement initiative launched in 2010, aims to combat the illicit cross-border diversion and trafficking of 11 chemical explosives precursors. Measures such as adding urea fertilizer granules to Ammonium Nitrate (AN) or using colored dyes and radio frequency identification tags to track AN shipments have been recommended by experts. Pakarab Fertilizers Ltd. in Multan, Pakistan, is the largest fertilizer complex in the country, producing over 300,000 metric tons of Ammonium Nitrate (AN) annually since 2004. Legislation in Islamabad is being considered to further restrict AN and other precursors, but it remains in the draft stage. The Islamabad government is considering legislation to restrict Ammonium Nitrate (AN) and other precursors, but it is still in the draft stage. The United States relies on Pakistani authorities for enforcement, while NATO uses logistics routes through Pakistan to supply forces in Afghanistan. NATO has faced challenges with logistics routes through Pakistan to supply forces in Afghanistan due to closures and attacks by militants. Efforts to interdict supply lines near the Khyber Pass and Karachi to Kandahar routes resulted in destroyed trucks and dead Pakistani drivers. Truck drivers often pay bribes to officials, and some trucks are emptied of fuel and cargo before being destroyed. In response, the U.S. military aimed to reduce reliance on Pakistan. The U.S. military began testing alternative routes to reduce reliance on Pakistan, focusing on the \"Northern Distribution Network\" (NDN) from Central Asia and Russia. The NDN carried over half of NATO's supplies by mid-2010, but only nonlethal cargo. Despite preferring Pakistan for logistics, U.S. officials expanded aerial and NDN routes, despite higher costs and reliance on authoritarian regimes in Central Asia. The U.S. military has been expanding aerial and NDN routes, despite the higher costs and reliance on authoritarian regimes in Central Asia. The loss of Pakistani GLOCs has not been as damaging to Afghan operations as expected, with British and U.S. officials managing well without them. Gen. Allen mentioned that the closure of GLOCs has not negatively affected the campaign in Afghanistan. The Pentagon's April report on Afghanistan and Pakistan highlighted the strategic concern of the continued closure of the GLOCs, which has hindered Afghan security forces by causing a backlog of equipment. Over 4,100 vehicles are stranded in Pakistan due to the closure, but airlift capabilities have mitigated the impact on communication equipment and weapons movement. NATO will need to remove over 100,000 shipping containers and 70,000 vehicles worth $30 billion as they withdraw from Afghanistan. NATO needs to remove 100,000 shipping containers and 70,000 vehicles worth $30 billion from Afghanistan. U.S. commanders pushed for the reopening of Pakistani GLOCs as the spring \"fighting season\" approached in 2012. Pakistani officials indicated that the reopening was imminent, with Foreign Minister Khar stating, \"Pakistan has made a point and now we can move on.\" Pakistani officials indicated that the reopening of Pakistani GLOCs was imminent, with Foreign Minister Khar stating, \"Pakistan has made a point and now we can move on.\" Reports suggested a deal had been struck before the Chicago summit, with Islamabad initially seeking a fee of $1,500-1,800 per truck. However, just days before the summit, Pakistani negotiators proposed a fee of $5,000 per truck, a significant increase that the Pentagon found difficult to accept. This increase was seen as challenging, considering that the use of Pakistani GLOCs had been considered \"free\" in exchange for billions of dollars in CSF reimbursements. The Pentagon found the proposed $5,000 fee for Pakistani GLOCs unacceptable, with Senate Armed Services Committee members calling it \"extortion.\" Negotiations on the issue have not been resolved yet. Pakistan has been facing Islamist extremism, militancy, and a separatist insurgency, with a peak in attacks and victims in 2009. Pakistan has faced Islamist extremism, militancy, and a separatist insurgency, with a peak in attacks and victims in 2009. The U.S. National Counterterrorism Center reports a decline in terrorist incidents and related deaths since then, but Pakistan still ranks third in the world for both measures. Suicide bombings have increased significantly in the country, from only two in 2002 to 84 in 2009. Suicide bombings in Pakistan have increased significantly, with the country accounting for nearly half of all suicide bombing deaths worldwide. Militants have targeted the country's military and intelligence institutions, leading to a drop in Islamist attacks in 2011 due to military operations and drone strikes. The increase in suicide bombings in Pakistan, attributed to military operations and drone strikes, has led to a drop in Islamist attacks in major cities. However, concerns remain about the Islamabad government's response to terrorism and the presence of Al Qaeda terrorists operating in the country. The Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) emerged as a coherent grouping in late 2007, representing Pakistan's tribal agencies and settled districts. The Quetta Shura Taliban and Haqqani Network are also active in different regions of Pakistan. Islamist militant groups are present in Punjab province. The Haqqani Network, based in North Waziristan and Kurram agencies of FATA, is a significant Afghan insurgent group. In Pakistan's Punjab province, various Islamist militant groups, including the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), operate with global jihadist aspirations. The LeT, with ties to the ISI, is considered a growing threat to U.S. national security. Analysts view the LeT as the most dangerous terrorist group in South Asia, capable of becoming a global threat if not countered. The LeT in Pakistan, identified as the most dangerous terrorist group in South Asia, could pose a global threat if unchecked. Pakistan's Ambassador to the United States criticizes the country's focus on sovereignty violations over combating jihadist ideology that has claimed many Pakistani lives. The Pakistan army has deployed 150,000 troops in response to the surge in militancy, with over 3,000 soldiers killed. Haqqani criticizes the country's focus on sovereignty violations instead of combating jihadist ideology that has cost many lives. The Pakistan army has deployed 150,000 troops in western Pakistan in response to militancy, with over 3,000 soldiers killed in combat. Conflict has affected all seven FATA agencies and adjacent regions, with notable offensives in Swat Valley and South Waziristan in 2009. U.S. government assessments are discouraging, with difficulties in the \"holding\" and \"building\" phases of military operations due to limited civilian administration capacity. The Pakistani military has faced challenges in the \"holding\" phase of operations in Swat and FATA from 2009 to 2011. Despite temporary successes in dislodging militants, sustained progress in counterinsurgency has been elusive. The air force conducted numerous combat sorties and bombings, but notable militant leaders remain at large. The Pakistani air force has flown over 5,500 combat sorties in the FATA, dropping more than 10,000 bombs. Ground operations have resulted in the capture or killing of leaders. Bloody fighting continues in the FATA, with government forces conducting offensives in Kurram and Khyber agencies. The army has had some success in degrading LI's capabilities, but insurgency still affects most FATA agencies. The Pakistani army has made progress in degrading LI's capabilities in the FATA region, but a simmering insurgency still affects most agencies. TTP militants overran a fort in South Waziristan, killing 15 soldiers, while Bajaur suffered a major militant attack. North Waziristan, home to the Haqqani Network and TTP forces, remains a stronghold for extremist groups. The North Waziristan agency is a significant haven for Afghan- and Pakistan-oriented militants, including the Haqqani Network and TTP forces. Pakistani officials have been hesitant to act on U.S. requests to address the militant presence in North Waziristan, citing the need to consolidate control in newly acquired areas. Pakistan's military is inexperienced in counterinsurgency and lacks effective nonconventional warfare capabilities. Pakistani leaders have criticized the slow response from the United States in addressing these issues. Pakistan's military is inexperienced in counterinsurgency and lacks effective nonconventional warfare capabilities. Independent analysts believe that Pakistan's military operations, political strategies, drone strikes, and internal militant power struggles have fragmented the Pakistani Taliban in 2011, resulting in smaller and weaker factions that do not follow the nominal TTP leader Hakimullah Mehsud. The power struggles within the Pakistani Taliban in 2011 led to the splintering of the group into smaller, weaker factions that do not obey the nominal TTP leader Hakimullah Mehsud. This fragmentation has resulted in a significant decrease in suicide bomb attacks in Pakistan. Mehsud has conflicts with militant commanders Maulvi Nazir and Hafiz Gul Bahadar, and has been targeted for assassination by his former deputy Wali-ur-Rehman. In 2011, power struggles within the Pakistani Taliban led to fragmentation of the group, resulting in decreased suicide bomb attacks. Hakimullah Mehsud, the TTP leader, faced conflicts with militant commanders and was targeted for assassination by his former deputy, Wali-ur-Rehman. Pakistani officials considered negotiations with TTP militants, but concerns arose due to past failed efforts in the FATA region. Negotiations with TTP militants faced challenges due to past failed efforts in the FATA region. Despite denials, talks with the militants may have occurred, possibly influenced by Mullah Omar and mediated by Al Qaeda and Haqqani group representatives. Mullah Omar has pressured Pakistani militants to make peace with the Pakistani army to strengthen his own ranks. Al Qaeda and Haqqani group mediators facilitated an agreement among four major militant factions under Omar's leadership in Waziristan. This alliance, known as \"Shura-i-Muraqba,\" aims to focus hostility on Afghanistan, unlike the TTP, which is in conflict with Pakistan. The Haqqanis seek to redirect FATA militants' focus towards Afghanistan, potentially ending the anti-Pakistan insurgency. The Haqqanis aim to shift FATA militants' focus to Afghanistan, potentially ending the anti-Pakistan insurgency. The U.S. government offered a $10 million reward for information on Hafiz Saeed, causing tension in U.S.-Pakistan relations. In April, well-armed militants attacked a prison in Bannu, freeing nearly 400 prisoners, including a terrorist sentenced to death for a 2003 plot against President Musharraf. The move to designate the Haqqani network as a terrorist group was criticized by Pakistan, causing further strain in U.S.-Pakistan relations. In 2003, a terrorist was sentenced to death for a plot against President Musharraf. The raid bolstered Pakistani Taliban force levels and raised concerns about the security apparatus. Secretary of State Clinton urged Pakistan to clear its territory of terrorist sanctuaries and criticized the government for not taking action against Hafiz Saeed. The U.S. is urging Pakistan to take more action against terrorist sanctuaries, particularly targeting Hafiz Saeed. Concerns remain about extremist groups operating with impunity in Pakistan, including the Afghan Taliban in Quetta and Karachi, the Haqqani Network in North Waziristan, and other designated terrorist organizations in Punjab. These groups pose significant threats to the U.S. and its allies. In Pakistan's Punjabi heartland, groups like LeT and Jaish-e-Mohammed pose significant threats to the U.S. and its allies, including Islamabad's civilian government. Concerns about American citizens being recruited for Islamist terrorism by Pakistan-based elements escalated in 2010 after Faisal Shahzad, a U.S. citizen of Pakistani origin, attempted a car bomb attack in Times Square. Shahzad received bomb-making training in western Pakistan. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attempted bombing in Times Square, and the culprit confessed to receiving bomb-making training in western Pakistan. Faisal Shahzad was sentenced to life in prison. Other cases involving U.S. citizens and residents linked to Islamist extremism in Pakistan and terrorist plots against American targets are numerous. One Pakistani-born American was involved in the 2008 terrorist attack in Mumbai, India. David Coleman Headley, a Chicagoan convert to Islam, was charged with scouting for the attack by the Pakistan-based LeT terrorist group and pleaded guilty to the charges. David Coleman Headley, a Chicagoan convert to Islam, traveled to Mumbai multiple times from 2006 to 2008 as a scout for the Pakistan-based LeT terrorist group. He pleaded guilty to the charges and was the first former Pakistani military officer directly linked to terrorism suspects in the United States. Headley reported to a retired Pakistani major suspected of being an LeT contact and interacted with Ilayas Kashmiri, a former Pakistani special forces commando with ties to Al Qaeda. The Indian government sought direct access to Headley for its own investigation. The Indian government sought direct access to David Coleman Headley, a former Pakistani special forces commando with ties to Al Qaeda, for its own investigative efforts. Access was granted in 2010, leading to information that implicated an official Pakistani role in the Mumbai attack. In a Chicago court trial in May 2011, Rana was charged with material support of terrorism related to the attack, with three senior LeT members and an ISI officer also indicted. Headley, the prosecution's key witness, detailed links between the ISI and the attackers. In a Chicago court trial in May 2011, Rana was charged with material support of terrorism related to the Mumbai attack. Headley, the prosecution's star witness, detailed links between the ISI and terrorism, adding to already fraught U.S.-Pakistan relations. Rana was acquitted on Mumbai attack charges but found guilty of aiding LeT and conspiring to attack a Danish newspaper. Pakistan and India have a history of bitter rivalry with three full-scale wars and constant military preparedness. The bitter rivalry between Pakistan and India dates back to the acrimonious partition of British India in 1947. The unresolved issue of Kashmiri sovereignty has been a major source of tension between the two nuclear-armed countries, leading to three full-scale wars and constant military preparedness. Despite this, a bilateral \"Composite Dialogue\" in 2004 saw some modest successes, including a formal cease-fire along the shared frontier and increased trade and people-to-people contacts across the Kashmiri Line of Control. In 2008, Pakistan-India relations deteriorated significantly after a terrorist attack in Mumbai killed 165 civilians, leading to a halt in the peace process. Territorial disputes over Kashmir, the Siachen Glacier, and the Sir Creek remain unresolved. In 2010, conflict over water resources emerged as another exacerbating factor in the bilateral relationship between Pakistan and India. Pakistani leaders believe regional peace is linked to resolving the Kashmir dispute. The U.S. government under the Obama Administration has maintained a policy of staying distant from the Kashmir dispute and refraining from mediation. Pakistan and India are also engaged in a \"shadow war\" inside Afghanistan with spies and proxies. Pakistan and India are involved in a \"shadow war\" inside Afghanistan with spies and proxies, leading to high-visibility attacks on Indian targets. Islamabad accuses New Delhi of interference in Pakistan's western regions through Indian consulates in Afghanistan. After the 2008 Mumbai attack, India held Islamabad responsible for supporting anti-India terrorist groups in Pakistan. India and Pakistan resumed high-level peace talks in 2011 after a hiatus of more than two years, following a brief \"cricket diplomacy\" where Prime Minister Gilani accepted an invitation to watch a match in India. Bilateral talks between home secretaries led to an agreement to establish a \"terror hotline\" to address terrorism issues. In 2011, Prime Minister Gilani accepted an invitation from his Indian counterpart to watch a match in India, leading to bilateral talks between home secretaries and the establishment of a \"terror hotline.\" Subsequent meetings between commerce secretaries, foreign secretaries, and Foreign Minister Khar resulted in agreements to enhance economic cooperation, expand confidence-building measures, and increase trade and travel across the Kashmiri LOC. In 2011, bilateral talks between India and Pakistan led to agreements to enhance economic cooperation, increase trade across the Kashmiri LOC, and liberalize bilateral trade. India dropped opposition to an EU initiative waiving duties on Pakistani exports from flood-affected areas. India dropped its opposition to an EU initiative waiving duties on Pakistani exports from flood-affected areas, which was a significant step forward in bilateral talks between India and Pakistan. Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh viewed Osama bin Laden's death as a positive development in the fight against terrorism, but also expressed concerns about the potential impact on India's foreign policy interests due to a hastened U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. New Delhi saw the discovery of OBL in Pakistan as an opportunity to press demands for extradition of Mumbai attack perpetrators and other anti-India terrorists. Afghanistan's new strategic framework with India heightened Pakistan's fears of encirclement. Kabul's new agreement with India raised Pakistan's fears of encirclement due to Afghanistan's acceptance of Indian assistance in training its security forces. Some analysts view this development as provocative and potentially hindering efforts to reduce Pakistan's reliance on militant proxies in Afghanistan. Relations between Pakistan and India are currently improving. Pakistan's relations with India are improving, with the separatist rebellion in Indian-held Kashmir at its lowest ebb since 1989. Pakistan's government plans to grant normal trade status to India by the end of 2012, which could significantly boost bilateral trade. The news of improved relations between Pakistan and India is seen as a significant development that could greatly increase bilateral trade. Islamabad's offer to move towards freer trade and the decrease in terrorist attacks from Pakistan in India are positive signs. Progress on the \"core issue\" of Kashmir as a prerequisite for movement in other areas may be receding, with no terrorist attacks in India traced to Pakistan in over three years. President Zardari's 2012 visit to India marked the first by a Pakistani head of state since 2005, followed shortly by an avalanche at the Siachen Glacier that killed 139 Pakistani soldiers. The avalanche tragedy at Siachen Glacier killed 139 Pakistani soldiers, highlighting the ongoing conflict between Pakistan and India over Kashmir. Despite the region's minimal military value, both governments refuse to withdraw their forces. In 2012, Pakistan and India signed agreements with Turkmenistan to construct a $7.6 billion pipeline through Afghanistan for natural gas transportation, supported by the United States. The 1,100-mile-long pipeline through Afghanistan for natural gas transportation, costing at least $7.6 billion, is supported by the United States as part of the New Silk Road Initiative. Concerns remain about security in Afghanistan affecting investor confidence. Despite some analysts cautiously optimistic, India's ability to make concessions is limited by ongoing Islamist militancy from Pakistan. India is dissatisfied with Pakistan's failure to bring Mumbai terrorism masterminds to justice, particularly LeT chief Hafiz Saeed. Islamabad faces criticism for not acting on evidence to prosecute Saeed and other suspects, while India seeks extradition of Ibrahim and Indian Mujahedeen leaders. China's close relationship with Pakistan has been beneficial for both countries over the years. Pakistan has served as a link between China and the US in the past, as well as a bridge to the Muslim world for China. The future course of relations between India and Pakistan is heavily influenced by the calculations made by Pakistan's generals. India is seeking extradition of Mumbai attack suspects from Pakistan, while Islamabad is criticized for not taking action on the evidence provided. The economic ties between India and Pakistan could help prevent open conflict between the two countries. China's close relationship with Pakistan has been beneficial for both countries over several decades. China has been a primary arms supplier for Pakistan since the 1960s, helping build arms factories and supplying weapons systems. Chinese companies and workers are now prevalent in the Pakistani economy. Beijing plans to construct two new civilian nuclear reactors in Pakistan, potentially violating international guidelines. During a visit in late 2010, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao and Pakistani officials signed 12 Memoranda of Understanding for various cooperative efforts. During Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao's late 2010 visit to Islamabad, Pakistan and China signed 12 Memoranda of Understanding covering various cooperative efforts and designated 2011 as the \"Year of China-Pakistan Friendship.\" Contracts worth $15 billion were signed by businesses in oil, gas, mining, space technology, heavy machinery, and manufacturing. Additionally, Pakistan reacted promptly in August 2011 when Beijing accused Islamist militants trained in Pakistan for terrorist activities in China's Xinjiang province. In August 2011, Beijing blamed Islamist militants trained in Pakistan for terrorist activities in China's Xinjiang province. ISI Director Pasha was sent to Beijing to address the issue. China expressed concerns in 2012 about Uighur separatists finding refuge in Pakistan, straining bilateral relations. With deteriorating US-Pakistan ties, Islamabad is increasingly reliant on its friendship with Beijing. Pakistani leaders have been overly effusive in their expressions towards China. In 2011, Pakistani leaders showed increased closeness with China, seeking support in the face of deteriorating US-Pakistan relations. China agreed to expedite delivery of fighter jets and is in talks for a significant defense purchase. Pakistan is negotiating with Beijing for a $3 billion defense purchase, including six submarines. China sees its relationship with Pakistan as a way to counterbalance India but also recognizes the risk of Pakistan-based terrorist groups triggering a crisis harmful to Chinese interests. This situation could lead to increased coordination between the US and China to enhance Pakistan's counterterrorism capabilities. The dynamics between the US, China, and Pakistan could lead to greater coordination to improve Pakistan's military and intelligence services and dismantle global jihadist groups. This cooperation could extend to areas like nonproliferation, governance, and economic growth in Pakistan, despite differing interests in India's regional role. Chinese support for Pakistan hinders India's ambitions, while the US aims to deepen its partnership with India. Chinese military and diplomatic support for Pakistan continues to hinder India's regional ambitions. China's geostrategic reliance on Pakistan is likely to grow as the United States deepens its partnership with India. However, China's own interests suggest that its \"all-weather friendship\" with Pakistan may not entail blanket support as in the past. Beijing is unlikely to mediate in any U.S.-Pakistani rift or replace Washington as Islamabad's primary foreign benefactor. The Chinese government is unlikely to mediate in any U.S.-Pakistani rift or replace Washington as Islamabad's primary foreign benefactor. Pakistan's relations with Iran have been troubled by differences over Afghanistan and the presence of anti-Shia terrorist groups. Both countries aim to complete a pipeline for natural gas from Iran to meet Pakistan's energy needs. Iran has completed construction on its side of the border for a natural gas pipeline to Pakistan. Tehran has offered $500 million to finance construction on the Pakistani side after a Chinese consortium withdrew. The U.S. opposes the project due to sanctions on Iran's nuclear program. Secretary of State Clinton warned that building a pipeline on the Pakistani side of the border would violate Iran sanctions. The U.S. has expressed concerns to Islamabad, which plans to proceed with the project. Iran has tried to bypass sanctions by bartering oil for wheat and rice with Pakistan. U.S. worries about the security of Pakistan's nuclear arsenal, especially with the rise of Islamist militants in the region. Pakistan's nuclear security remains a top concern for the U.S. due to past illicit proliferation activities led by A.Q. Khan. Despite improvements, analysts warn that parts of the network may still be active. Khan and his alleged co-conspirators have not faced criminal charges, raising ongoing worries about the integrity of Pakistan's nuclear program. Pakistan's nuclear security has improved, but concerns persist about potential leakage of know-how or technologies. Recent reports suggest a rapid growth in Pakistan's nuclear weapons arsenal, possibly in response to U.S. civil nuclear cooperation with India. This growth is happening as China plans to build new nuclear reactors in Pakistan, potentially violating Nuclear Suppliers Group guidelines. Pakistan's nuclear arsenal is rapidly growing, raising concerns about potential leakage of technology. China's plan to build nuclear reactors in Pakistan may violate international guidelines. The country faces economic challenges exacerbated by flooding in 2010. The devastating flooding in Pakistan in 2010 and 2011 worsened existing economic problems, with losses estimated at $10 billion. Corruption hinders economic development, leading to a decline in foreign investment. Increasing militancy, global recession, and political instability in Islamabad are major factors contributing to the economic decline. Pakistan's economic decline is attributed to increasing militancy, global recession, and political instability in Islamabad. International financial institutions prioritize addressing inflation, containing the budget deficit, reviving growth, and managing higher global oil prices. India's economic growth surpassed Pakistan's in the early 2000s, despite historically similar GDP per capita levels. In the post-independence period, Pakistan's GDP per capita was slightly higher than India's. However, India's growth surged in the early 2000s while Pakistan's remained stagnant. Today, India, with a population seven times larger than Pakistan, has higher national wealth figures even on a per capita basis. Pakistan faced a balance-of-payments crisis in 2008, leading to seeking multi-billion dollar loans from the IMF. The current IMF-supported program is a 34-month, $11.3 billion Stand-By Arrangement approved in 2008, with $3.6 billion yet to be disbursed. In 2008, Pakistan faced a balance-of-payments crisis and sought a $11.3 billion IMF loan. $3.6 billion is yet to be disbursed due to Islamabad's failure to implement required reforms. Security concerns in 2011 further delayed negotiations with the IMF. Pakistan has reportedly sought U.S. help to influence the IMF to relax conditions for the outstanding tranches. Pakistan has requested U.S. assistance to persuade the IMF to release remaining funds. The country's repayment of IMF loans will strain its federal budget due to low revenue generation and excessive military spending. Secretary Clinton and other U.S. officials are critical of the situation. Pakistan's economic elite engages in mass tax evasion, worsened by excessive military spending in the federal budget. Secretary Clinton criticizes Pakistan's low 9% tax-to-GDP ratio. Efforts to implement tax reforms and reduce fuel subsidies face challenges, leading to political turmoil. Electricity shortages contribute to the country's economic decline. Electricity shortages in Pakistan have led to economic deterioration, with businesses forced to shut down due to power outages lasting up to 20 hours a day. Public protests over gas shortages have turned violent, with citizens ransacking offices and torching vehicles. Public protests in Lahore and other Punjabi cities included ransacking politicians' offices and torching vehicles. Despite devastating floods in FY2011, Pakistan's economy grew by 2.4%. Inflation is the top concern for Pakistanis, with 52% citing it as the most important issue. The State Bank of Pakistan acknowledges that public debt, inflation, and energy shortages will continue to hinder growth. Persistent double-digit inflation and severe energy shortages will continue crippling growth in the near term in Pakistan. The State Bank of Pakistan admits that flooding cannot mask the structural deficiencies in the economy, such as low tax revenues and power shortages. Plans to reform taxes and phase out subsidies are delayed, with power outages estimated to reduce GDP growth by up to 4%. The root cause of these economic problems is attributed to poor governance. The World Bank's assessment of Pakistan's economy highlighted poor governance as the central cause of economic problems, leading to a negative outlook. International financial institutions regularly assess the country's economic challenges, noting a deteriorated fiscal situation and lack of governance improvements. The State Bank of Pakistan acknowledges persistent inflation and energy shortages as key factors crippling growth, with plans to reform taxes and subsidies delayed. The World Bank and IMF report on Pakistan's economy highlights poor governance, deteriorated fiscal situation, and negative outlook. Recommendations include focusing on human development sectors like education and health to prevent poverty alleviation gains from being at risk due to renewed growth challenges. IMF bluntly states that current policies do not bode well for Pakistan's near- and middle-term prospects. The IMF warns that Pakistan's near- and middle-term prospects are bleak due to low growth, high inflation, and a weakening external position. Urgent policy action is recommended to strengthen public finances, reform the energy sector, and reduce inflation. Pakistani leaders aim to improve access to Western markets, but security concerns deter foreign investors and exports. Pakistani leaders aspire to improve access to Western markets, particularly for textile exports. They seek reduced tariffs on textile exports to boost the economy, especially after flood damage to the cotton crop. The textile sector employs 3.5 million Pakistanis and accounts for 40% of urban factory jobs. Abolishing American tariffs on cotton apparel could increase exports by $5 billion. Pakistani officials and business leaders estimate that abolishing American tariffs on cotton apparel, currently averaging 17%, could boost exports by $5 billion annually. Democracy in Pakistan has been unstable, marked by power struggles among presidents, prime ministers, and army chiefs. The country has experienced direct military rule for over half of its 65 years of existence, with a bicameral Parliament as the locus of federal power. Members are elected to five-year terms, with a 342-seat National Assembly and a 100-seat Senate. President Zardari was elected recently. President Zardari was elected in September 2008 to lead Pakistan's civilian government, which has struggled to maintain power against the military's influence on foreign and national security policies. President Zardari's government in Pakistan has faced challenges in maintaining power against the military's influence on foreign policy and national security. The PPP-led coalition has struggled to stay in power and has been unable to enact major reforms. The judiciary, empowered by the 2008 \"Lawyer's Movement,\" is battling the executive branch and pursuing corruption charges against politicians, including President Zardari. Analysts warn that Pakistan's political turmoil could lead to economic chaos due to widening deficits. Pakistan's political turmoil, if not stopped, could result in economic chaos due to widening deficits. The PPP-led coalition has faced threats to its majority status and government existence from coalition politics. The MQM and JUI have withdrawn and rejoined the coalition multiple times in response to rising fuel prices and inflation. The loss of MQM's 25 seats has removed the coalition's parliamentary majority. In 2011, the MQM withdrew from the ruling coalition three times, aiming to gain more administrative control in Karachi. This led to the loss of the coalition's parliamentary majority. The PPP strengthened its position by forming an alliance with the PML-Q faction, which has considerable support in Punjab. The PML faction merged with a smaller group and rebranded as the original PML. Their support in Punjab and alliance with PPP could threaten Nawaz Sharif's PML-N faction. Senate elections in 2012 secured PPP's control until 2015. The Senate elections in February 2012 were crucial for Zardari's political safety, as PPP's gains ensured their control of the Senate until 2015. The ruling party's increased plurality allows them to block legislation even if they lose in the National Assembly polls. OBL's death was embarrassing for the Pakistani military, leading to rare domestic criticism and potentially allowing civilian leaders to have more control over foreign and national security policies. The embarrassment of the May 2011 Mehran naval base attack and scandals involving abuse of power and human rights led to unprecedented media criticism of the security establishment. Despite this, civilian leaders have not taken advantage of the opportunity to gain more control over foreign and national security policies. Parliament did establish a commission to investigate how bin Laden found refuge in Pakistan and how American forces entered Pakistani territory. The commission established by Parliament to investigate how bin Laden found refuge in Pakistan and the American forces' penetration of Pakistani territory lacked focus and cohesion, diminishing hopes for increased civilian authority. Civil-military tensions escalated after the May 2011 raid, nearly leading to another military coup in late 2011. In early 2012, Prime Minister Gilani faced contempt charges for not complying with Supreme Court orders regarding a corruption case with Swiss authorities. In early 2012, Prime Minister Gilani faced contempt charges for failing to request Swiss authorities to reopen a corruption case against President Zardari. The Supreme Court, led by Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry, issued a contempt notice and found Gilani guilty, but only sentenced him to the time it took for the court to adjourn. Gilani has refused to resign despite opposition demands. In early 2012, Prime Minister Gilani faced contempt charges for failing to request Swiss authorities to reopen a corruption case against President Zardari. The Supreme Court found Gilani guilty but only sentenced him to the time it took for the court to adjourn. Despite opposition demands, Gilani has refused to resign. Legal scholars predict he may be disqualified after the appeal period expires in June. Imran Khan, a former cricket hero, emerged as a new political star in late 2011 with his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party. The State Department considers the case a domestic political issue for Pakistan. Imran Khan, a former cricket hero, rose as a new political star in Pakistan in late 2011 with his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party. Despite minimal representation in Parliament initially, Khan attracted support from young and middle-class Pakistanis through anti-corruption and anti-American sentiment. His rallies in Lahore and Karachi drew massive crowds, and the PTI has gained converts from major national parties, especially in Punjab. Imran Khan's PTI party gained support from enthusiastic crowds of over 100,000, especially in Punjab, posing a threat to Nawaz Sharif's PML-N. While unlikely to win enough seats to become Prime Minister in 2013, Khan could be a key player in future governance. He pledged to cut off U.S. aid, end conflict with the Pakistani Taliban, and tackle corruption within 90 days if elected. Imran Khan promised to cut off U.S. aid, end conflict with the Pakistani Taliban, and tackle corruption within 90 days if elected, reflecting the public's desire for honest politicians. Khan's rise in 2011 showed a hunger for change from the traditional political parties. The emergence of Pakistan's conservative Islamist political forces under the Difa-e-Pakistan (DPC) has raised concerns among international observers. The DPC, consisting of over 40 Islamist and rightwing parties, including banned extremist groups, has been organizing large street rallies demanding an end to cooperation with the United States and any reconciliation with India. Hafiz Saeed, leader of the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) terrorist group, has been openly participating in DPC rallies. The Difa-e-Pakistan (DPC) opposes cooperation with the United States and reconciliation with India, with Hafiz Saeed from the LeT terrorist group openly participating in their rallies. The DPC believes reopening GLOCs would help allied forces stay in Afghanistan and accuses the US and India of involvement in Baluchistan's insurgency. Anti-American rhetoric is seen as beneficial for Pakistani politicians seeking patriotic credentials, with some analysts suggesting Pakistan's security services may support the DPC. The DPC in Pakistan is seen as a tool for political leverage against the US and civilian leaders, with reported human rights abuses persisting despite some positive steps taken by the government. Government accountability remains a significant issue, leading to a culture of impunity. The human rights situation in Pakistan remains poor with a lack of government accountability, leading to a culture of impunity. The most serious problems include extrajudicial killings, torture, and disappearances by security forces and extremist groups. Other issues include poor prison conditions, arbitrary detention, weak criminal justice system, and infringements on citizens' privacy. The human rights situation in Pakistan is poor with issues such as extrajudicial killings, torture, and disappearances by security forces and extremist groups. There are also problems with weak criminal justice system, lack of judicial independence, restrictions on freedom of assembly and movement, religious freedom violations, discrimination against religious minorities, widespread corruption, and various forms of violence and discrimination against women. The human rights situation in Pakistan is dire, with issues such as rape, domestic violence, child abuse, human trafficking, discrimination against minorities, and lack of worker rights. Violence, abuse, and intolerance by militant groups contribute to a culture of societal discrimination. The human rights situation in Pakistan is severe, with ongoing abuses including violence, abuse, and intolerance by militant groups. Pakistan is ranked as the most dangerous country for journalists, with concerns over \"disappearances\" and extrajudicial killings by security forces. The Obama Administration has committed to withholding funding for train and equip programs due to human rights violations. The Obama Administration has declared it will withhold funding for Pakistani army units implicated in human rights abuses. Pakistan's blasphemy laws, popular but criticized for being discriminatory and arbitrary, came under scrutiny in late 2010. The blasphemy laws in Pakistan faced criticism in late 2010 when a Pakistani Christian woman was sentenced to death. Calls for repeal intensified, but government reform efforts were hindered by Islamist hardline groups. In 2011, government proponents of reforming blasphemy laws in Pakistan were assassinated, hindering reform efforts. National Assembly member Sherry Rehman withdrew her proposal after PPP leaders announced no reforms. Congress renewed $15.3 billion in assistance to Pakistan, including development and security programs. In 2009, Congress passed bills authorizing increased nonmilitary aid to Pakistan and established the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund to enhance Pakistani security forces' ability to combat militancy. The Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund (PCCF) was established by Congress to enhance Pakistani security forces' ability to combat militancy. Congress has also appropriated billions of dollars for coalition support funds, totaling nearly $9 billion to date, to reimburse Pakistan for its support of U.S.-led counterterrorism operations. Increased oversight has led to a rise in rejected claims for these funds. The Administration's Pakistan Assistance Strategy Report in 2009 outlined objectives for nonmilitary U.S. aid to Pakistan, focusing on infrastructure programs with a proposed budget of $3.5 billion for FY2010-FY2014. The US proposed to allocate $3.5 billion of aid to high-impact infrastructure programs in Pakistan, with a focus on energy and agriculture sectors. There are plans to assist in the construction of the Diamer Basha dam, a $12 billion project led by the Asian Development Bank. This project could generate 4,500 megawatts of electricity, filling the country's current shortfall. The US allocated $3.5 billion for infrastructure programs in Pakistan, focusing on energy and agriculture. $855 million in civilian aid funds were disbursed in FY2011, with concerns about corruption hindering spending. Majority of KLB funds remain unspent, reinforcing Pakistani doubts about US reliability. The delay in U.S. assistance to Pakistan has reinforced doubts about American reliability. Security aid included training programs but was mostly suspended in 2011. Pakistan received various defense equipment, including items for counterterrorism and conventional warfare. Pakistani officials have raised concerns about the lack of necessary equipment for counterinsurgency operations. The delay in U.S. assistance to Pakistan has raised concerns about American reliability, especially in providing necessary defense equipment for counterinsurgency operations. Security aid aims to strengthen law enforcement capabilities through training and advanced identification systems. The circumstances of OBL's death have impacted perceptions of current U.S. aid programs. The circumstances of OBL's death have led to a reevaluation of U.S. aid programs to Pakistan, with significant reductions and new restrictions being considered in pending legislation. Congressional figures have criticized Pakistan as a U.S. ally, questioning the effectiveness of military aid in combating Islamist militancy and promoting economic and political development. There is a growing recognition that U.S. military aid to Pakistan has not effectively countered Islamist militancy and may hinder the country's development. Analysts suggest focusing on nonmilitary aid to strengthen Pakistan's civil society. Several bills in FY2013 include Pakistan-related provisions with stricter conditions. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2013 would restrict preferential procurement of goods by the Secretary of Defense. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2013 (H.R. 4310) imposes restrictions on procurement from Pakistan and limits FY2013 CSF payments to $650 million. Payments are withheld unless the Secretary of Defense reports on claims process and transit cost differences.

The FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act imposes restrictions on procurement from Pakistan and limits FY2013 CSF payments to $650 million. S. 3241 proposes $50 million for the PCCF, contingent on Pakistan's cooperation in counterterrorism efforts. Quetta Shura Taliban, Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammed, Al Qaeda, and other terrorist organizations in Pakistan are required to meet certain conditions, including not supporting terrorist activities against the US or coalition forces in Afghanistan, dismantling IED networks, preventing nuclear proliferation, and protecting judicial independence and rule of law. The FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act imposes restrictions on procurement from Pakistan and limits FY2013 CSF payments to $650 million. S. 3241 proposes $50 million for the PCCF, contingent on Pakistan's cooperation in counterterrorism efforts. The bill also limits total State Department aid to Pakistan to about $800 million, with specific allocations for different programs and conditions for the release of Dr. Shakil Afridi from prison. The FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act imposes restrictions on procurement from Pakistan and limits FY2013 CSF payments to $650 million.
