    "content": "The \"Automobile Fuel Efficiency Improvements Act of 2003\" may be cited as the Act. It includes phased increases in fuel economy standards. The \"Automobile Fuel Efficiency Improvements Act of 2003\" mandates phased increases in fuel economy standards for passenger automobiles, with standards ranging from 25 to 32 miles per gallon based on model year. The fuel economy standards for passenger automobiles are mandated to increase gradually, starting at 28 miles per gallon for model years before 2008, and reaching 40 miles per gallon for model years after 2014. Higher standards can also be set by regulation. The text chunk discusses amendments to subsection (a) of a section related to fuel economy standards for non-passenger automobiles. It involves changes such as removing certain text, increasing the standard, and reorganizing paragraphs. The text chunk amends subsection (a) of a section regarding fuel economy standards for non-passenger automobiles. It includes changes in the average fuel economy standard for different model years, specifying mileage requirements. The text chunk specifies different mileage requirements for non-passenger automobiles based on model years, ranging from 19 to 27.5 miles per gallon. It also mentions a provision for future model years after 2015. The text chunk introduces a new provision stating that if the Secretary does not increase the fuel economy standard within 24 months after the latest increase, a report must be submitted to Congress explaining the reasons for not increasing the standard. SEC. 3. INCREASED INCLUSIVENESS OF DEFINITIONS OF AUTOMOBILE AND PASSENGER AUTOMOBILE. The definition of \"Automobile\" in section 32901(a) of title 49, United States Code, is amended to increase the weight limit to 12,000 pounds and the fuel economy standard to 14,000 pounds. The weight limit for passenger automobiles is increased to 14,000 pounds, and the definition of a passenger automobile is amended to include vehicles with a gross vehicle weight of 12,000 pounds or less. The definition of a passenger automobile is amended to include vehicles with a gross vehicle weight of 12,000 pounds or less, excluding certain types of vehicles with specific characteristics. The definition of a passenger automobile is amended to include vehicles with a capacity of more than 9 persons or a cargo area of at least 6 feet in length. These amendments apply to automobiles manufactured for model years after the specified date. The amendments made by this section apply to automobiles manufactured for model years after the enactment of this Act. SEC. 4. CIVIL PENALTIES. Increased Penalty for Violations of Fuel Economy Standards under section 32912 of title 49, United States Code, is amended to raise the penalty amount to $10, adjusted annually. The penalty amount for violations of fuel economy standards under section 32912 of title 49, United States Code, is increased to $10, adjusted annually based on the Consumer Price Index. The Consumer Price Index is used to adjust the penalty amount for violations of fuel economy standards. Amendments to the section include removing certain subparagraphs and applying the changes to automobiles manufactured after the enactment of the Act. SEC. 5. ACCURATE FUEL ECONOMY TESTING. Biennial Report on Testing Quality: The Secretary of Transportation must submit a report to Congress every odd-numbered year on the quality of automobile fuel economy testing for all available technologies. The Secretary of Transportation must submit a biennial report to Congress on the quality of automobile fuel economy testing, including an assessment of accuracy and planned changes in testing methodology. The Secretary of Transportation and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency must consult on the preparation of the biennial report on automobile fuel economy testing accuracy and methodology changes. The first biennial report on testing quality under section 32920 of title 49, United States Code, must be submitted to Congress in 2005. The Secretary of Transportation is required to conduct a study through the John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center to determine the most accurate automobile fuel economy testing process. The Secretary of Transportation is required to conduct a study to determine the most accurate automobile fuel economy testing process for highway, urban, and combined use, and compare the average fuel economy ratings for each category of automobile use. The Secretary of Transportation must conduct a study to determine the most accurate automobile fuel economy testing process for different categories of automobile use and compare the fuel economy ratings. A report on the study results must be submitted to Congress within two years of the enactment of this Act. The Secretary of Transportation will submit a report to Congress on the study results, including determinations and comparisons made, as well as an estimate of the average adjustment to automobile fuel economy ratings. The Secretary of Transportation will submit a report to Congress on the study results, including determinations and comparisons made, as well as an estimate of the average adjustment to automobile fuel economy ratings. Within 180 days of the report submission, a revised testing procedure will be required to closely align ratings with accurate fuel economy calculations. Within 180 days of submitting a report to Congress, the Secretary of Transportation must create regulations for a new testing procedure to accurately measure automobile fuel economy for each model. This procedure will be used to determine the average fuel economy for chapter 329 of title 49, United States Code. The Secretary of Transportation must create regulations for a new testing procedure to determine the average fuel economy of automobiles manufactured after model year 2006, based on accurate measures of actual fuel economy. The Secretary of Transportation will adjust average fuel economy standards for automobiles manufactured after 2006 to reflect improved accuracy in calculating fuel economy from a revised testing procedure. The Secretary will ensure that the revised testing procedure results in fuel economy standards that are at least as strict as those under the previous testing method. SEC. 6. STANDARDS FOR EXECUTIVE AGENCY AUTOMOBILES. Section 32917 of title 49, United States Code, is amended to set fleet average fuel economy standards for non-passenger automobiles. The text discusses setting fleet average fuel economy standards for non-passenger automobiles under section 32917 of title 49, United States Code. It outlines the requirements for passenger automobiles to meet the average fuel economy standard applicable for the model year. For the purposes of setting fleet average fuel economy standards for non-passenger automobiles, the text amends subsection (b) by specifying the fleet average fuel economy of non-passenger or passenger automobiles in a fiscal year. It clarifies the distinction between non-passenger and passenger automobiles for meeting the average fuel economy standard. The text amends subsection (b) to specify fleet average fuel economy standards for non-passenger or passenger automobiles in a fiscal year. It also requires at least 20% of passenger automobiles leased or bought by executive to be exceptionally fuel-efficient vehicles. The President must set regulations requiring that at least 20% of passenger automobiles leased or bought by executive agencies have a fuel economy rating at least 5 miles per gallon higher than the average standard. Additionally, starting in fiscal year 2009, at least 10,000 vehicles in the executive agencies' fleet must meet certain fuel efficiency criteria. Starting in fiscal year 2009, executive agencies must ensure that at least 10,000 vehicles in their fleet have a fuel economy at least 5 miles per gallon higher than the average standard."
